i still havent figured this one out
did everything as instructed but the game never installed
strange
since i dont like to rate on something i couldnt get to work ill just say that i didnt like it because i couldnt get it to work p for those that did manage to get it installed im sure its a great game
i had the first dirt and it was a scream
too bad this one bombed
maybe a bad discthe game itself is great but games for windows live is such a frustrating piece of garbage
i wish it would just die and stop bringing down my pc gaming experiencei enjoyed the first hawx game
however they left out some key things in hawx  no coop mode  i really enjoyed that cant choose your own plane right off the bat
you have to use whatever they tell youthose two things will make me not play this game anymorei loved the first hawx pc game when it came out
playing hawx  got boring after several missions is just a shamemy father is a seaman
i have seen many ships sailed with him around the world numerous times
so ships are in my blood
when i saw this game i bought it without batting an eyelid
well i wish i didnt because i now regret my decisionthe game is unique in its concept
we never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasnt centrally focused on war and sinking other ships 
this one happens to be just peacetime shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo to passenger to rescues to towing to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing titanic to new york on its first maiden voyage etc
the game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations
any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game
but to me thats where all the goodies endthe cons associated with game are just too gamebreaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game
until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games seriesfirst and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary time compression feature
not all of us have  hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun
sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission
with a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast
this is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me
i know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot dont too
since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more
if they can incorporate a time compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamerssecond is the still dated graphics engine
i see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look
i have a pretty good rig and i can play games like mass effect and silent hunter  in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise
the ships and ocean etc
looks very simplistically rendered from todays standard
the graphical quality of this game released in  is kind of dissappointing thoughlast some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion
this game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts hover boats etc
i bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boatsanywaysi wouldnt really recommend anyone spend  bucks on this game
wait until it gets to  or so bargain bin
and i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from mei bought  of these  of which was shipped to me with defects and  more became defective within about  weeks of normal use
i would not recommend these to any one but couldnt give a  star as of  cords still works finebreath of fire three is the third part to what was a very good series of rpgs
breath of fire one seems to be what most people i talk to about games  consider the best
even though i loved breath of fire  the most
i  expected a lot from breath of fire  perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of breath of fire  but i did not like this gameas far as game play  goes like all bof games in bof  you have the ability to turn into a  dragon
like bof  and unlike bof when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while
while youre a dragon you loose mp every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike bof  all the character seem to  get their own special power
the character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character
the training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly i didnt like it
the town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportationas far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay
then about two hours in goes in a  different direction
it is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax
they lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  tales of destiny ending
also the characters dont have very strong and  noticeable personalities
also if you keep up with it you wont like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threwas far as control goes  its basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  itthe graphics to this game are not very good
it is done in sprites
sometimes i myself prefer sprits but i do not like the character drawings  of this game
on the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short
the drawings are basic and too simple
there was only one of the  dragons i liked the look of
however there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other rpgs in cuteness of a  single character
the cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you doand finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many rpgs wont be beaten on a short  rental
if you get this game buy itoverall this game is the worst of  the bof series
i dont recommend buying it unless its finishes some  collection you are working on or if you have to see a hopping onion follow  people aroundyeah the cpu is like  completley retarded gulie does not counter with his flip kicks ryu doesnt ever do his shukoken uppercuts to counter but  some of the characters can be pretty hard like t hawk but i just dont get the street fighter arcade  like feelingi actually played the saturn version with the mb ram cart and i have to say that the ps version sucks
why
because tagteam was taken out because the ps could not handle it
it did not have enough ram random access memory to switch fighters since it takes about at least  mb of ram and the ps only has  mb
if capcom did put in tagteam then it would take forever to load up a character once you tagteam with it you can tagteam with the same character but it does not feel the samei suggest get a saturn it is only  bucks or less get a mb ram cart which you can find at ebcom or any video game store and get the import version of xmen vs street fighter trust me you wont be disappointedto say that the ps version of capcoms xmen vs street fighter is butchered is saying it lightly
what made the game so great in arcades was the tagteam feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight
this feature made for great fighting fun but because of the pss ram inabilities that feature had to be omitted
its obvious capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the xmen and street fighter licenses and while on its own it can be a solid fighter without the tagteam feature the graphics are painfully watered down the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates and there is loads of slowdown
if you can get past all that this may be worth checking out if your a street fighter fan but the marvel vs capcom games that would be released later on nextgen systems are more worth your timewhen a system is incapable of doing justice to a game one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system
but for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter xmen vs street fighter on the playstation
the only thing added to the game is super cancels which allow you to string multiple super combos together
super cancels were lifted out of street fighter ex without much forethought so some characters cancels work better than others
in fact the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought
even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game the simple fact remains that xmen vs street fighter is a terrible unbalanced poundonbuttonsatrandomandwinanyway fighting gameone of the few things the arcade version and the saturn version which was an arcadeperfect translation had going for it was the graphics
they werent spectacular but the characters were large colorful and used a lot of frames of animation
the playstation a fairly weak machine when it comes to d simply cant handle that much data
so capcom chopped out tons of frames juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still and his attacks are about two frames
the graphics look very washed out and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown
kens shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out and it still slows the game down to a crawl
the slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplaythe arcade versions big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tagteam between the two at any time during the fight
your teammate would also come out and help in a twolevel team attack as well as in alpha counterstyle attacks
since duplicating this on the playstation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory the tag feature has been completely removed
you still pick a second character cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters
to make up for the shortened play time the oneround battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard twooutofthree format
characters also slowly regain life much like your backup character would in the arcadethis game just shouldnt exist
at some point in the development cycle someone should have stepped in seen that the playstation simply couldnt do justice to the original game and pulled the plug
it took an additional mb of ram to get the saturn which already has more ram than the playstation to run a perfect version of the game
i like the street fighter series as much as the next guy but this is taking it way too farthe graphics and gameplay are very out dated
the movies at the end are stupid and only the first eight players have them
the only reason i even got this game is because i loved tekken tag and  the only reason i dont sell this is i want to have all the tekkens but if you want to buy it dont pay more than  for ityou know youre in trouble when other terrible video games are compared to you
though only a little worse than charlies angels gamecube and not as bad as hidden invasion playstation fighting force is the difinitive bad adventurefighting game that fits on the same crap list as burning fight
even brawl bros and peace keepers are better than this and thats saying a lotyou get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters pixiepigtailed alana gruff hawk leatherpantswearing look at me im nabiki tendo mace and prison inmate smasher
theyre out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of  ad and is now determined to make that happen
maybe he should have waited through the other  times it turned new years day across the worldmany sega saturn owners didnt realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system
nintendo  owners were not so lucky and i wasnt so lucky after getting the playstation versionthe controls are sloppy the hit detection is horrible especially the dash attacks and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoonif there is one redeeming factor it is the music
though not great the musical scores in this game are a nice touch
the only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a cdplaying radio or computer and skip track one since thats just a data track  meaning all you will hear if anything is an annoying buzz
start on track  sit back and enjoy the only good thing about this gameim going to fly in the face of convention wisdom and assert that tomb raider is not a good game
i like the concept the puzzle solving and exploration
i like that its a great diversion from the standard shootem up
the problem is with the tedious game play
the game is tough just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what youre supposed to be doing in each level
but thats part of the fun figuring things out
unfortunately its moving through the levels and getting from point a to point b that is problematic
there are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely no margin for error
in some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point or in some cases you die meaning you have to start the whole level over again
and after trying one of these jumps over and over and over you finally get frustrated and give up
there were instances where i tried a jump over and over and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what i had done differently from the previous numerous attempts
for any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace
its too bad i think i could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me
i know its one of psx quotgreatest hitsquot and very popular but if dont like tedious games youll want to avoid this onewhen i first got this game i found it to be boring not too soon after getting it
when i play it today i still think its boring
wwf war zone is the first real wwf wrestling game to be released on the playstation
i dont really consider the in your house game to be wrestling wise but more mortal kombat likewar zone is based off the wwf roster from late  to early  featuring only the most popular stars in the game 
among the wrestlers in this game you can choose to play as stone cold steve austin shawn michaels bret hart the undertaker the rock triple h mankind goldust owen hart ahmed johnson farrooq british bulldog ken shamrock and the headbangersthe opening of the game is cool as youre given a raw like intro that used to open monday night raw back in the mid to late s
from there on youre taken to the menu screen thats in the form of an elevator
in the menu you can look at the wrestlers biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game
theres also a training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the gameonce you enter the game you can either play exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to challenge mode
among the match types available are singles tag team tornado tag team hardcore or steel cage
the steel cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play
when you climb the cage i didnt know what button to push to climb down
i pushed down but i just ended up climbing back down to the ring
i lost most of the cage matcheschallenge mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the world championship
unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play
once you play one match youve played them all
you have to fight the same opponents at least  or  times before you advance to newer ones
as you progress through youll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match
oh yeah thats another thing
if you lose  or  matches youre automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match  to go up
it ultimately screws you over and youre forced to play a lot of the same boring matches againoverall i found war zone boring then and i find it boring now
in my opinion in your house is more fun to play than this
even the sequel game to war zone attitude is more fun to play than war zone
so if you dont want to be bored skip war zone and buy in your house or attitude insteadall right the graphics are nice and the terrain damage is something new but that doesnt make up for the gameplay which could be summed up in one wordslowskirmishes take a real long time to get going i mean at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force
and then what do you find yourself doing
protecting your base with them and attacking with missle launches
im dead serious the only way to attack is with missle launches
to attack with your men especially tanks takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy basethat being said the multiplayer is a total waste of time
if the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers consider yourself lucky
dont get caught up in a  hour game that is just about to be resolved when you or your opponent loses hisher connection
and dont consider engineering a cheap way to attack its the only way anyone attacksthe campaign is allright i guess if you can stand the poor gameplay to get from cutscene to cutscene which arent as good as red alerts were come on you cant tell me nod doesnt have a huge advantage over gdi
they dolets hope kane bites the dust soon before the campc series turns as twisted as quotthe forgottenquotbanjokazooie is a strange platformer but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining
it tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play
all the attention on humor and yet the game itself is hardly ever fun
this means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor which im sure was nintendos intentions to market the game for kids and assume they wouldnt be able to detect the lousy game design
i guess the nintendo  struggling to make a profit at the time meant nintendo had to do absolutely anything to try and get any type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality were forced to persevere so that explains banjo kazooies existenceanyway banjokazooie is basically nothing but an itemcollecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than  of the stuff the n was pumping out at the time
the waters grassy lands mountains everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments
but seriously why am i basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time
if you think thats what all platformers do
guess again many of them focus on exciting enemy variety diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks
the only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges
i found sharks you have to swim away from crabs you can stomp on top of and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while youre trying to make your way across high paths without falling
these enemies only appear like  of the time the rest of your surroundings arent very threateninglets see all the things you have to collect
honeycomb pieces jiggy pieces mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world  musical notes which is a total ripoff of super mario  with the  coins needed to get a star mumbo tokens used to cast spells and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts
you can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity but otherwise nothing to get really excited about
often you have to climb trees to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while believe meoh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies youre constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that its much harder than it needs to be
i will never understand why nintendo refuses to fix water portions in d platform gaming
its mindboggling
they didnt even fix them in super mario galaxy  a game released a good  years after banjokazooie
the characters are all forgettable including the ponytailsporting female bear and banjo himself
kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunchwhereas the mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively banjokazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group
its too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers
banjokazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself is it worth my time to return here againnot one of the best games
i would have rather played mario just once
i only play it for about two minutes
i fall asleep afterwardrogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat
the d enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as jabba the hutts palace on tattoinethe main problem i have with this game is on the hoth and deathstar mission
use password deaddack to get to themon the hoth mission you wrap a cord around imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do
as for the deathstar mission the scenery is wrong
in the movie luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench in the game the target is on the ground
but thats not what bothers me most though after you hit your target it just says mission complete they shouldve had a cinematic sequence where the deathstar blows up
that doesnt happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfiedevery once in a while i experience a piece of entertainment that is so overrated its hard to believe im even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best
the legend of zelda ocarina of time is that very piece of overrated entertainment
talk about a video game that not only doesnt live up to the hype not even close but it doesnt do a darn thing to impress me even if i were to ignore all the exaggerated hype
this is a serious letdown of a video game
but again please understand im not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game
i care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else
apparently most zelda fans believe puzzlebased dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the zelda seriesone thing that positively stinks is that the land of hyrule despite being presented as beautiful and realistic dont tell me nintendo wasnt riding the d high in  and going for realism here its basically a gigantic piece of nothingness
simply a means of getting from one area to another
a large colorless empty field that link either runs or rides his horse across
nothing magical medieval or interesting about any of this
it feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house
going into this game after a link to the past youll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles
remember all those trees rocks grass and water sections from link to the past
remember how rich and vibrant they looked
ha nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld
oh sure the monsters come out at night in predictable spots but thats it
as far as i can see only one monster actually comes out named stalchild
terribly lacking
the trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking toothe dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that its almost unfathomable to believe nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient
again where are all the enemies
why am i roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good
are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like im really inside a castle now
give me a break guys
the rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever
instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner these castles are alarmingly empty lifeless and unacceptable
but thats apparently okay because ocarina of time is the first d zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels right
not in my world baby
the games following ocarina of time perfected the zelda formula way more effectively
wind waker and skyward sword leaves this dated mess in the dustwhile normally i dont care about graphics in a video game you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the zelda series more engrossing
this is just gross
only the realisticlooking flawed overworld is a sight to behold which of course now looks significantly better in twilight princess
clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isnt much to admire
i dont really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings trees or other objects that are all part of the nintendo s datedness
sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or at the very least forgiving
what i do mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction or having a game entirely too long so were forced to persevere these issues time and time again
in other words id be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppyuninspiring graphics in other areas
sadly it doesnt
this isnt even much of an issue compared to the other complaints i have which ill mention below keep reading
these graphics especially the ones in the dungeons resemble the ones found in the ruins of mega men legends and the walls of the quake series
the graphics in link to the past are unique and cannot be compared to any other gamelets discuss the dungeons shall we
despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that its almost a chore going through one generic room after another
ocarina of time shows the makings of early d development at its most obvious the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead
when you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what youre doing and where youre going its enough to make you think youre playing with string puppets
again early d design flaws and datednessthe storytelling is really basic and predictable
its never elaborate like in wind waker or skyward sword
its mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called gorons for the first half and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half
this is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented
it doesnt even feel or look like youre going  years into the future as links appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesnt appear to be much different from his younger self
oh sure hes slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but its very subtle
the music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however
all the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments but melodic and memorable
several dungeon themes are wellmade and believably chilling and haunting
the right ingredients were definitely put into the musicmaking aspect of the game
the hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and wont get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend therethe dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused cratepushing to open up portals or switches or hopelessly generic im stuck in a maze and i cant get out frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early d game design
but these arent any ordinary mazes
these are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn hence the flawed early d game design
a cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be or in other words needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the d zeldas so memorable
sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means and quite often you have to collect  silver rupees to activate a switchopen a door
collecting these silver rupees is way too similar to super mario  with the red coins
the lost woods is a tunnelinfested maze with no personality whatsoever
the lost woods if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer will most definitely be the source of endless frustrationthe enemies or rather what little enemies you will stumble upon on your adventure through the temples is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game
these dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable
you will often go  or  rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy
why even have a sword
in the d games the idea was simple just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and guess what
now the dungeons are exciting
a genius idea really
here
in ocarina of time
its all about atmosphere
its all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once nintendos most recent creation back in  but nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day
what was once a brand new puppy in  is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design
video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable
thats exactly what has happened with ocarina of time it hasnt stood the test of timedo you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a zelda game
seriously
their animations are so stiff due to the nintendo s limitations as a console that its unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards link
but even then most dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable
big skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous its more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while youre running around
the spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting
somehow all the enemies manage to never once be memorable
ever
ocarina of time has dated horrendously seriously
wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make red bubble is basically the same thing as big skulltula but on fire and gibdos are boring
the redeads let out a hilarious scream that freezes link in place which is inconvenient when youre trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when youre stuck in a room with two of them
mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them run behind them and slice them with your sword
to be fair some enemies are cool such as deku baba where its best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill creatively well done there
the deku scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat
and the lizalfos and dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemiesthe game overall has a shortage of rupees
theyre really not that important which is odd
this is the first zelda game ive ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought
not something to take real seriously
if you dont feel like collecting them then dont no harm done
the bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon
you have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform
it takes forever and no this boss is nowhere as fun as the water dungeon in link to the past in case youre wondering
the hookshot is used more than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often
the hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas
after you collect  gold skulltula tokens you get a beneficial reward
you can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy usually found on walls
i admit i love the witches you face in the spirit temple
while the temple itself is really short and boring its probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight
you have to use your shield to reflect shots at the other witch and its really fun and creative
the hookshots basically a required item to properly deal with hardshelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and its annoying that its used way more frequently than the sword throughout the game
due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while especially if you keep missing your target and it slows down the pace of the game by a lotif you havent noticed yet the water dungeon in ocarina of time is just abominable
i bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way
also the worst influence ever occurs here the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons mostly for warping from one place to another
nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina way too many darn times
its overdone
just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake
dont make it so you have to play the ocarina up to  times if not more
i never really counted how many times i used it
it was a lot
it severely drags the gameplay atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina
watching link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing ive ever seen
no wonder people think nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days
this game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influenceganons castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful
its supposed to be filled with dangerous traps tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place
but the one in ocarina of time falls way short of being presentable by normal legend of zelda standards
instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through  trials to dispel the main barrier
the problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting  silver rupees
this is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening
another bonus point for link to the past
oh and the ganon fight
his strategy is stolen from agahnims battle from link to the past but takes several more minutes to bring down
remember how you fought agahnim
yup same exact strategy but in a d world
sigh
the second part of the ganon fight after a looooong and tedious timebased departure from the top of a castle is to shoot arrows at ganon and hit his glowing behind several times
its really easy all of it
however fighting him in one of the early dungeons forest temple is actually one of the most memorable in the entire zelda series
this is because ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a very unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept
reminds me of a harry potter moviea few other complaints
fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy
its better than most fishing games ive played in other games i admit
expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however
most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them
thats a rare compliment i can give
some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun
i dont really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm
if you fall behind even a little bit youll lose
performing this same ghostchasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since youre dodging fireballs
the other task earlier on in the game in the ice cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzlebased
having to do this once or twice would have been suitable not  times
this particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninterestingbasically when compared to the d games ocarina of time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the zelda series into d but only giving us a small portion of whats available in link to the past
as a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions
its because the nintendo  is a limited console thats really only able to handle so much
ocarina of time comes up way short
even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going
avoiding being detected by guards isnt fun after the first time
oh and speaking of avoiding detection this game actually has a metal gear solid stealthstyle mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people
the stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon
equally annoying is upon freeing the  carpenters these red swordswinging enemies appear on screen
the same exact enemy  times in a row with no differences between any of them
at first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about  times and they fall over and diereading text and having boring discussions with zelda trees and other semiinteresting characters doesnt get the job done either
ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual that one conversation with zelda and link with ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in hyrule castle comes to mind here
i will admit that some of the flamecovered cutscenes involving ganon riding his horse is very intimidating
the cutscene outside the bridge of hyrule castle comes to mind here
otherwise ganons presented uninterestingly
youre supposed to get a feeling of hopelessness that ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems ganon being a ruthless villain doesnt ever materialize at least hes not as scary as he should berecognize ocarina of time for making the d zelda series exist
thats fair
it allowed wind waker to eventually be created which in turn made the d zelda formula better starting from that game until now
by  nintendo was working with the technologically superior gamecube console which allowed the zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories gameplay graphics replay value and excitement
i say avoid ocarina of time but hey nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful daymiyamoto slacked off on this onethis is certainly not the best game ever
not even the best game on nintendo  super mario  and perfect dark both stomp this game into submissionthis is not a roleplaying game
roleplaying games have a lot of text and character involvement
this game has a script that is about two pages long maybe less
what you say or do in this game really has no effect on the games out comethis is not the best zelda game
the legend of zelda links awakening and a link to the past are all much better games especially for their timethis game is not  mega bytes
it is actually  mega bits which is equal to  mega bytes
so sorry the game isnt nearly the size of a  mega byte cdromthe game has no replay value i played through it once then about a year later i attempted playing through it again i couldnt bare it the game is just too boring
i played through final fantasy vii and viii twice each and those took alot longer than this to finish they were both great both times throughi loved the good old zelda games but this just doesnt deserve the zelda name lets just hope that zelda on the game cube doesnt turn out the same wayif you like the story then get this
for me multiplayer is where it counts and i have more fun with rage wars
frag tag is awesomethe main reason that people hate this game is because it came right after twisted metal  and people were expecting a lot of improvement but the expectations were in vain
the game isnt all that bad i mean mr grimm still cool there is a new viper car you can use rain missiles as weapons some of the characters and stories are very funny the graphics were improved the rob zombie intro song was awesome and the london spaceship and blimp stages were greatnow
the reason that this game sucks is because everything in the game looks like fake plastic the special effects are not shocking at all you cant make any massive explosion or massive destruction many characters look lame if your car turns upside down you have to wait for  seconds for your car to stand up and many stages are very smallps this twisted metal sequel is terrible but at least is not garbage as twisted metal 
that game wasnt even a twisted metal game that was more like the circus war
xadioshaving played the twisted metal series for a few years now i can honestly say that twisted metal iii while having an initial gleam at first play it wears itself out fairly quickly
the gleam im speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play
it tries to be something new which it is but it improves in all the wrong waysallow me to explain weapons inventory
instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have
for example i can pick up  homing missiles but no more
the rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like speed missiles more on that in a bit
in previous tm installments you could keep building your homing missile capacity and carry only those as long as you didnt exceed the max capacity
annoyingnew weapons
okay so initially i thought the rain missile was the best thing since sliced bread
but really the rain missile doesnt do very much apart from visual appeal
the missile shoots into the air and you detonate it and a ring of fire falls down like five mininapalms
it doesnt do the damage the napalm does but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fireat least until they turbo stopdropandroll in tm maneuvers out of it  seconds later
minimal damage donethe introduction of the speed missile was the worst mistake of the weapon category
its a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets
if you can fire them fast you can do some damage but theyre so useless during combat that it really doesnt even matter
remotes are plenty but do much less damage than in tm
freeze missiles the leftrightup maneuver do not hit enemies like they used to
it is much harder to freeze an enemy
this can be frustratingenemies
new characters are added some are great some not so great
your enemies now have the ai
that allows them to steal items from in front of you
if they need health they will race you for it and take the health
this is especially frustrating when you are fighting minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health
cue controller hitting floorthe levels are not very large
not much scenery and not much to discover
theres a few hidden places you can find to explore but for the most part its very limitedall in all tm falls flat
the previous installments are much better both in gameplay value and in overall playabilityif you can find this cheap get it
otherwise pass it upi recently tried playing this game and by this point my n is lucky it didnt get chucked out the window
the first few passes through the first few stages were fine and pretty fun but the rest of the game ends up being one long annoying tedious impossible and frustrating choreto start off the control just isnt good enough to pull off half the things you need to do in this game
there are instances where you must execute specific jumps to get you from point a to point b but half the time the controller is nonresponsive
especially when it comes to levels that put you high up this usually means fallingover and over againto add to this annoyance is the fact that there are no check points
if a level requires you to go to the top of a mountain and you spend half an hour just getting up there and then you fall you have to climb the whole thing all over again
so if youre like me and find your self wondering off cliffs every other try because of the awful camera work you will be playing the same stages over and over with no payoff but one big headachenow lets talk about the camera
throughout most of the game i found my self fighting it more than i fought bowser
its simply impossible to judge distances based on where the camera is facing at any given time
pressing the c buttons will move it around but you have to keep perfectly still in order to avoid suddenly gong sideways or backwards
if you are in a stage where there is a time limit or a complicated jump this can be particularly fataladding to this frustration is the fact that it is incredibly easy to over or under jump
this wouldnt be as much of a problem if it werent for all the levels which require you to get to the top of things
again if you fall once thats it you start all over again
if the game designers werent going to give you any continue points in these levels whyowhy did they make it so friggin easy for you to fall
there are plenty of levels and stages in this game and lots to do in all of them
but by the time i cleared one stage i really questioned whether or not i wanted to even go to the next
finally after reaching a mere  stars my answer is noso thats my two cents on this game i cant beat it i dont want to beat it
id rather go to a morrissey concert with kathy griffin as the opening act than try to play it again
it would me much less annoying than this gameim pretty sick and tired of people calling super mario  a classic
its not
just because its significant and influential in helping pave the way for future mario titles doesnt mean super mario  is deserving of its classic status or that its any fun to actually play
super mario galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of super mario  so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid s gaming history
the only other possible reason someone would play super mario  is because they desperately seek open world exploration and this is basically the only mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite
not that i personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect eitherthe biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness
oh sure youll see trees ramps castles buildings enemies such as goombas chain chomps badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down pokeys rolling boulders and other things that have become a trademark of the mario series but the amount of items to find and collect is extremely limited to coins both yellow and red ones and the occasional powerup that enables mario to either fly which admittedly is pretty fun or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes mario invincible
an alternative to the starman perhaps with lousy side effects mario cant jump as high or far while wearing the metal capwhen youre not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time youre jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinarypresented platforms over and over again
this stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms
its extremely basic game design
the platforms are generic squareshaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size
it gets monotonous almost immediately
only unreasonable nintendo fans would eat this stuff up seriously
anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed repetitive gameplay
the d mario games move at such a swift pace that you dont even have time to stop and notice the platforms unless youre an extremely slow gamer
this is mainly because you dont have to stop and situate mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins super mario s gameplay
and dont even say my skills are horrible when its obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issuewhile im by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available you gotta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game
the buildings water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes
nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics even the bright inviting colors dont lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of mario paintyou have to collect  stars in order to complete the game  but guess what
many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes
what kind of challenge is that
the one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is babyish and the one where you swim around collecting  predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive
or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus release the star
dont even think about mentioning the ones where you walk up to toad and he simply hands you the star
granted the game seems to always alternate easy starcollecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but thats the problem the stars are either too easy or too long
there is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles
you have to jump at just the right moment while making sure youre positioned in the right spot
this takes forever and is dreadfully annoyingalso whats up with all the little baby games
grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill
chase the bunny so he doesnt hop away
these are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous d gaming such as super mario bros  or super mario world and yes these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in super mario galaxy too in case you think im intentionally favoring super mario galaxy for no reason
at least the cannonshooting parts are cool
its fun figuring out where to launch mario so he can land safely on upper groundsi cant help but feel the red star collecting is overrated
when you collect red stars in yoshis island you feel like youre given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to  complete a stage
its a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once youve acquired all these items and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them
super mario  basically takes that one red coincollecting element of yoshis island and makes it a main priority here
you often have to collect  red coins per stage opposed to  in yoshis island to obtain one of the  stars
ughbut nothing nothing is worse than the fact you have to reenter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout
to me this is unquestionably lazy game design
how can it be anything else
who in their right mind would actually want to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam
super mario world was guilty of this too granted but not nearly to this exaggerated extent
a terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but its exactly the opposite once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer you wont want to repeat these same objectives ever again
so you probably wont want to play super mario  ever again
even worse when you often have to search for  coins to obtain a star
this can take up to  minutes and bore you the entire time
being forced to collect  coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers dont leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even find  of themi also dislike how many of the classic enemies arent included here such as the hammer brothers buzzy beetles bloopers and cheep cheeps
even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen well other than that one race in the beginning
you can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesnt count as an enemy appearance
hes not a true enemy here
why is that
why not include all the familiar and wellloved enemies that have become a trademark to the mario series
they ruin the pirahna plants by the way
why is he sleeping
granted he comes alive when you get near but its a really weird concept
at least nintendo got the boos and haunted house right a surprising and exciting mazelike high point of the game
its a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages
thats how you design a memorable stage
obviously if you werent busy running around through several vast and averagedesigned empty fields of grass there could have easily been room for the inclusion of more enemies
hey im all for open world exploration but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement
simply throwing mario into a big d world because its his first grand d adventure truthfully isnt going to get the job done im afraid
more needs to be doneconstantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where youre actually going is a nuisance
nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game but granted several games back in the mid to late s were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see whats ahead
still youll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in super mario   i guarantee it
one thing i do like about this game is how fast mario runs
its a fastmoving game which helps going from point a to point b more convenient
also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute
reminds me of super metroid in that respect
yoshi is teased in this game i wont spoil how but hes not actually playable which doesnt make sense
why make an appearance if hes not going to be playablethe music is either extremely good the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metallike bowser fights or downright horrendous everything else which consists of annoying nursery rhyme childrens themes inappropriate and painfully skullsmashing for the rest of us
i cant stand the theme songs that play in whomps fortress and rainbow ride two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever i play super mario galaxy  where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory
rainbow ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong
the snowy mountain stage with the italian accordion music is sickening and out of place
just mute the volume on your tv to make life easier for yourself
the boss fights are incredibly simplistic grab bowsers tail spin him around and toss him or pick upstomp other bosses
basic boring stuffa few stages that are actually fun include lethal lava land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the d world from the original super mario bros castle levels not to mention bettermore interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in sm shifting sand land since its packed with obstacles and enemies and reasonably challenging overall and tall tall mountains tricky climb to the top involving a vine climbing portion
in fact to be fair tall tall mountain is one of the best levels ever in a d mario game
its that good
bowsers castle levels are pretty solid as well mostly due to the fastpaced nature of themseveral things feel tacky the ups and coins are small dark ugly looking and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design and overall super mario  is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game
if not for influence this game would have been forgotten and the superior super mario galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do
oh and dont even mention the cakeeating storyline
its atrocious
the fact they brought it back for the galaxy series makes me want to vomitlet me just say that i think mario  is a okay game as far as gameplay and graphics goes but every level gets harder and harder its so hard it would take you months to beat it and by the time you do you would be white as a sheet from staying inside all the time and  of your muscles would atrophy
also the ending really sucks it ends by princess toadstool saying lets make a cake for mario then its over so dont waste your time with this gamei started my first succesful city wo a starter city and it was great
then after about two hours of gameplay my  pop
city had a problem with people
it must have because in less than  minuets my city was reduced to about  pop
get this it was for no apparent reason
my popularity was high all of the ordenances i could have had were activated all buildings had water and power i had full funding to schools firestations police ect police and fire coverage were excelant taxes were only at  for everything ind com and res
 and everything else you could think of i had it
it was the perfect city and my whole population who still liked by the way left the city
if you have a good reason for it  id say it was a glitch in the game
dont get me wrong it is a fun game when there is a reason to the sudden drops but i dont think you can have a real good city that lasts for more than four or five hours and there is no good city theyll all die out eventually
the only option you have is loss
i am hoping that sc  will be much betteri love sim
games very much but i did not like this sim
game
after i would have my little city all set up i would need to watch it like a hawk leaving me with almost no time to expand and improve on my little city
i have been told to give this game another try but i just can not find a reason to go back and try this game againthe only shump on the  i figured id check it out it plays like a genesis game with crude d backgrounds
not very interesting to look at
if you want shump theres only one system for you and its called the dreamcast
this one you can pass onthis game isnt very excitingi dont like this gameits boring what you do in this game is try to go through boring levels that dont look very detailedi warn youyou wont like this gamei warn youdont pick this upthis game is really old  and just such a bad game this game was very poorly madeits really boring because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things
all the enemies are exactly the same theres never any health and  health points arent enough because the health goes down too fast
the sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog and it all just draws in as you walk ahead making it hard to see enemies
i do like seeing the familiar south park characters in d the game is very funny and the weapons are hilarious
but still i wouldnt buy it
rent at mosti only gave this game  stars because if youre diehard south park fan its possible that you might enjoy this game but i like south park and i hated it
the controls are impossible to use you have to use the c buttons most of the time the gameplay is repetitive and boring all you do is walk around throwing snowballs at turkeys and the multiplayer part is boring too
one pro is that the guns are pretty original amp the south park kids say some funny things but the novelty wears off after a while
i bought this game when it first came out for  and i sold it for  at a stoop sale i just wanted to get rid of it its really that bad
if you really have to get it at least rent it firstkonami took a bold step into d with this castlevania installment for the   unfortunately it didnt live up to expectations which part of it is because it wasnt the same people believe it or not that did symphony of the night psx
read on to see why its a below average gamethe goodfinally castlevania in d
despite many shortcomings the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere which are characteristic of a castlevania game at least the newer releases
you can select between two characters carrie and reinhart that change the storyline somewhatthe badi was never a fan of the  controller and this is the one game where it hurt most
the controls and gameplay were difficult at best and normally i have a decent tolerance level for controls heres where i absolutely loathed it
getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game
also the storyline aside from the two characters different yet similar paths is really hollow at its core and doesnt add anything new to the castlevania legacyoverallnot recommended
i advise renting the game only
only buy it if you are a diehard n fan
otherwise i strongly recommend skipping it
im a big castlevania fan and i feel that this game does not do the series justice
i noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over bloodlines genesis why
bloodlines had far better gameplay and replay value than this
perhaps its because  of gamers today prefer graphics over gameplay when its gameplay that creates the gamegame came on time and works
this game is pretty bad in my opinion i would stick to the d whipping action if your looking for fun
you choose from  pretty lame characters camera angles are no good and the gameplay its self is not great
get this game to add to your collection but other then that this game is a waste of energytheres a lot of hype surrounding the resident evil series of games
theyre on most systems there are books and even a movie
the story is a good one but i found the game to not be so great
graphics are alright the sound is bad though
and game play is horrible
trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing especially when youre under attack and things are chaotic
the characters move unlike most games
you dont go in the direction of the dpad rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button
it was poorly designed
but since the playstation  is out and better games as well as more resident evil theres no reason to pick up this game anymore
the disc set here is one adventure with a male character and another with a female
the game is involved just not as much fun as it shoud bethis game is pretty bad first off all you can do is run strait the only good thing about is its pretty long the other bad thing is its to hard and it gets boring i wouldnt buy this game if you want a crash bandicoot game get either naughty dog and sony released crash bandicoot which rivaled the likes of mario and sonic
in the end many gamers liked crashs nonstop action but others simply just skipped it
even though it was very promising crashs gameplay did not really offer anything new which featured elements you can find in a bit platformeryou play as crash whose girlfriend is kidnapped by dr neo cortex
you basically just run through the levels from start to finish and fight bosses after each world
even though the action is intense throughout the gameplay becomes really tedious
crash bandicoot did nothing new for adventure games and it isnt really d since youre restricted to one path
all you do is make your way through levels dodging obstacles avoiding enemies and collect items and nothing more
the difficulty level is not exactly high either and the challenge is severely lackingcrashs graphics are quite impressive for a playstation game including welltextured environments and colorful characters
effects like running water and mist and fog are great eyecandy
the visuals are the games only saving grace
controlling the bandicoot can be a hassle since it doesnt use analog
youre forced to deal with sensitivity of the crosspad and at times will result in unwanted deathsaside from good graphics youre left with nothing but an average platformer equivalent to that of a bit sonic game in a polygonal world
while it may be d crash plays out too much like an old sidescrolling game of the past
i dont know why would anyone want to play this game because crash bandicoot pales in comparison to other breakthrough adventure games at the time like segas nights and nintendos mario on hog ride
people has misplaced faces and they look like they took drugs
this game sucked
 sonic is betteroverall its a pretty good game
 star taken off because it does not feature the original soundtrack and because of this many levels are silent or have different music
another star taken off because of load times the graphics lag come on no amount of enemies should make a game like this lag and the censoring of some levels
also no player coop only online which is stupid
if you simply must have it on psx then youll enjoy it if not then just buy the pc versionthe good decent story tons of gore great graphics and audio new features are neatthe bad abysmal combat terrible control extremely slow pace laughable voice actingi tried so hard to love re and look beyond its major flaws
flaws such as the abysmal combat system
you cant aim at anything
the tank controls dont help either so you always end up dying constantly and with a lack of health and ammo youll toss your pspspspsp out the window
the other flaw is the level design
everything is so confusing and its so easy to get lost
the map doesnt help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go whereanother thing that doesnt help is the games paceits sooooooo slow
when you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish menu are slow text is not skippable
another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting
they actors sound like theyre fresh out of remedial drama while the live action cut scenes are just as bad
the only good part about re is the story enemies and the amount of gore there is
while dc offers vibration uncensorship and a few game play tweaks its not worth it
re was my first re and going back to this is just awful
if you havent played re youre not missing much at allalthough there are video games out there that can wow you and then there are the duds
not all racing games seem to be the best behind the wheel
in the case of a video game coming based from an arcade version it really seems to be alright but looks are always decieving
in the case of nintendo  there are very few racing games that really can make it behind the wheel
this isnt really one of themthe  crusn usa game for nintendo  seems to be a real miss behind the real wheel
the graphics are very strong but you are limited down to a certain number of cars to choose from which is seven not like the more than dozen that there are in the arcade game
although the courses seem to be within detail there are so many flaws including th frame rate and the style of the game especially within the tunnels of place like washington dc nevertheless the game seem to be a little down and out but at the time it came out for nintendo  it was one of only two video racing games for the nintendo it is kind of dissapointing that they couldnt try to make some better video games with racing at the time but there are so many better choices to the nintendo  if youre really into the racing feel of the nintendo  i suggest you either get mario kart  rush  or the sequel to crusn usa  crusn worldi think its too late to give a review on this game but here goes
this is the most perverted game ever made
when you think about it its pretty disgusting
aim for the open spot
 ill do you fast peppy old pal
 fox get this guy off me
ive got a present for ya
eeeeeeeeeuuu
should kids be playing these gamesanyway the gameplay is funfor  minutes
then its bothersome annoying and dull
your team mates have the worst ai
ever and they dont get powerups
the game is horribly easy and waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy too short
like  minutes short
also the voice acting sucksi hope starfox adventures will be good
this game shouldnt have started the whole starfox thing
if so it needed workat first i didnt like this game then i got into it
its like an electic boardgame
the one thing i hate is playing against the consol
always play with four real peoplethis game had the potential to be great but the controls were very difficult to maneuver with as your thumbs will become very sore after trying to move your character with the dpad for however long you play the game
if you can find yourself a specialized dpad for fighting games or one that can override the dualshock analog limitations than you just may be good to go but you can easily take a lot of damage and you cant save anywhere like you would be able to if you played any of the doom games or quake
if you want something that will scare the jeepers out of you then go ahead and play this but if you want a comfortable game with horror elements i think you are better off playing doom  silent hill the original quake or resident evil these are my two centsi bought this game back in december
i played it for about  solid hours
i come to realize that this is it
all the same levels are like this
so boring and so not like the movies and the movement and the weapons in this game are terrible
not to mention the animation of the aliens they look like they are break dancing or having an upright seizure moving back and forth like a tiger pacing in a cage
the alien creatures are so predictable in this game and not the least bit scary
the parasites things that crawl on the ceiling walls and floor is perfectly done but i am going to have to say that even the doom games bring better action and better background and goals and weapon options compared to this alien game
the pc game alien vs predator is by far way better than this and is true to the plot and movie actionits too bad i spend  dollars on this game i am going to resell it right away and let some other sucker buy iti remember playing this game back around  i was nearly  years old when i first played this game and i thought at the time this was a really cool game
i really like the alien movies mainly the first and second one and i was fairly excited to play any game based on my favorite movienow as a grown up or maybe still a child at heart lol i came across this game again
remembering all my childhood experiences with this game i was fairly excited to relive it
right after playing it for about  minutes i started laughing at myself
i honestly dont know what i saw in this game
the game is so horribly crafted that its really a surprise that they released this game at all
the graphics are ok given the time it was released and the weapons are kinda cool
however thats all thats good about this gameif you are buying this game to relive some childhood memories i recommend not buying it because youre going to ruin some good memories
just keep it as memories dont relive it because you might see it differentlykeep away unless you are a fan of the alien series
this game is old and it shows
there is no dual shock capabilities and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors
it really looks like it could be a cell phone game
the story is there is no story
you are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series the trilogy at the time obviously and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the alien creatures and their varients
this game isnt very creative or well designed but it is classic
in the end and as a fan of the alien series i must say do not play this game
it will only alter your perception of the seriesto sum it up sony didnt do that great of a job trying to find a way onto the ever growing rpg scene on the playstation
it lacks a strong story mostly
you run around reviving genesis trees to remove the evil mist that has transformed kind creatures to evil little monsters
thats right an evil mist is your enemy
i as much a believer in the etherial realm of evil as most people but come on
you dont actually expect me to fight mist
they try to tack on a final boss but he seems oddly removed from the evil from the mist so his presence makes little sense
the battles though the engine is innovative are much to long
a battle can last anywhere from  minutes to almost an hour
the main reason that the battles are so time consuming is because of the lengthy entering of the combat combos that your character uses
the game just stops being fun when you have been in the same dungeon for two hours because you are getting into too many battles
the dialouge is also very dry and foolishly written
after meeting the character noa i knew that i wanted her to be killed by the mist
she is maddingly annoying and she runs around like some mental midget on steriods
the other two characters have no personalities
this makes it hard to get involved with the game
the pluses
the aformentioned battle engine innovativeness
also when you buy a new peice of armor or a weapon you actually see it on your character in battle and they actually use it
their are some really odd looking weapons and armor
the bad part is that gold is very difficult to come across in this game
my words to you
do not buy do not rent do not do anything with this game
it should be burned and its record removed from the planet
this game does not belong with anyone playstation collection
unless you are really hard up for some entertainmenti did not get anything from this product personally and i havent enjoyed this one at alli tried to like this game i really did but the controls are horrible and some of the worst ive experienced when trying to shoot something
when playing i also wondered why it took developers so long to utilize the second analog stick and why it took so long for them to learn how to develop for the playstation platform
while the story is welldone it was hard to appreciate under the terrible gameplay
so ill understand if syphon filter fans hate me because of this review but seriously the gameplay is terriblethis is an early military simulation type game and pretty much obsolete basically a mediocre pastiche of other stuff being done at the time
the graphics are supposed to be photo realistic but they arent the ideal in these types of games is that it should look like a helmet cam worn by a soldier in real life
everything looks very matter of fact this isnt a beautiful game to behold
the psn version that i have glitches and freezes up often i dont know if that was a problem in the original or not but it probably was
the gabe logan d model is the worst that ive seen in a ps game he has a sasquatch body with a lego character face and stands and walks like sasha mitchell
that has nothing to do with the limitations of the system but instead its a limitation of the artistic ability of the people working on the game
controls are pretty close to as bad as it gets very hard to steer your character mostly worthless autolock targeting
there is some creativity to the level design some okay variety but there was better stuff being made back then
i stopped playing a level or two after the helicopter boss because the enemies start wearing super flak jackets that take more than one clip it turns into a head hunting game where you have to go into manual targeting mode and are left a sitting duck unable to move from the sucky controlsway too many positive reviews for such a crappy game
thats what i think
syphon filter is atrocious
i received this game as a christmas present gee what a crappy gift back in the late s
i thought to myself well all the n players have goldeneye i can compete with them when i receive syphon filter for my playstation
how wrong i wasits not that the actual game is bad
i mean walking around shooting people is fun and its also fun to avoid being seen and make it to the end of the level without having to fire your weapon once and having to remain very quiet while doing so
the problem is that the difficulty is incredibly high and the storyline is about as interesting as watching the paint your baby brother smeared all over your television set drywithout a certain special code its really hard to get anywhere
the storyline is similar to one youd see in the tv show jag
its just not interesting to me
walking around shooting people is fun but thats all the game has going for it
now imagine if that special code didnt exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots
the difficulty would be out of this worldi also hate the game for the bad memories connected to it
the christmas i got the game i had a few bad personal things happen
but looking back syphon filter really isnt any good
its not surprising to me that the game is going for only a couple pennies right now used and only a couple dollars to buy brand new
its not even worth that muchits a shame that the sega saturn didnt succeed in north america the way that it did in japan because they received the arcade perfect version of this game for the saturn and to this date there still is not an arcade perfect version of this game for any home console
you could probably find someone selling a japanese sega saturn on ebay or something but thats a lot of trouble and who wants to buy an entire foreign system just to play just one great game and maybe xmen vs street fighter too
as far as the playstation version goes you are forced to select only one fighter and an assisting teammate due to the playstations lack of ram and vram the japanese sega saturn version requires a packedin  mb ram cartridge which allows the game to play exactly like the arcade version with minimal load times
however there is a trick if you are playing a  player game
if both players select the same characters then you are able to play the game the way it was meant to be played  vs  tagteam
this game plays almost exactly like the previous years xmen vs street fighter on playstation with some new features and different characters
if you liked the way the playstation port of marvel super heroes played then you will like this even better since it is more of the same with more character variety and more colorful graphics
aside from the cutbacks in gameplay style and missing frames of animation another downside to the playstations lack of ram
 this game is enjoyable enough if you arent obsessed with the arcade verion too much
i would still go for the japanese sega saturn version since it is arcade perfect or wait and hope for capcom to release a marvel anthology or another capcom arcade classics compilation with xmen children of the atom marvel super heroes xmen vs street fighter this game marvel vs capcom and marvel vs capcom  cmon capcomthe game arrived early which was nice
but when i played it the thing wouldnt save
it played fine but its hard to enjoy when you cant save
so i tried to remedy the situation by replacing the battery
however it just made it worse
so i just decided to take the hit and toss the thingi realize the vast majority of people love this gamea link to the past is great
i love that game loved it when i was a kid and love it today
and im willing to concede that the original gameboy doesnt have the advantages of the super nintendo
its understandable
however even so i still think the game has glaring flaws that i despisefor one it feelscheap
i dont know how else to describe it but something about this game feels unlike a genuine zelda game
between the plot the fact that its so campy bow wow the cheesy dialogue the unzelda like setting etcsorry but if someone told me it was a different franchise i would believe italso the item usage is just plain stupid
the fact that link has to equip his shield as an item to use it is ludicrous especially considering there are virtually no opportunities to use the sword and shield together you will always be using some other item
the constantly changing items slightly bothered me in a link to the past but in this game its even more annoyingthe biggest problem i have with the game is this the overworld map
the areas are all so illogically layed out
to get to one area means going through too many others
its not like a link to the past where everything was logically laid outit just somehow feelstoo confusing
this game must have been maddening on regular gameboysomething about this game just seems wrong
sorryits a game
but the acting is no worse than the movie so i give it one  extra star because you can do stuff not just sit there and watch the  lousey acting
quotqui gon i have a bad feeling about disquot  well  its kinda fun i guess
you get to whack things with yer lightsaber which  sounds much like the movie and the other sound effectsbackground ambience  are excellent in my opinion
music even better
gameplay ok  graphics  are not the best for now but very good for   you want a good episode i  game try racerboy this game was a real disappointment
i truly expected better for this game since it was based on a truly cool badass movie
the main reason why it wasnt so good is because of its difficulty this game was incredibly difficult
even with the players guide it was very difficult to beat
the last time i played it was probably  to  years ago though and back then i wasnt as skilled as i am now at video game playing maybe ill give it a second chance
still its chances of not being sold or something are not really goodafter all the reviews that i read i thought that when i tried my buddys game star wars episode i jedi power battles on my stepbrothers dreamcast that it would stinkcompletely but in fact it was the exact opposite
all the reviews i read kept saying how star wars episode i the phantom menace was way better thanstar wars episode i jedi power battles boy were those reviews experiencing strong cases of irony
jedi power battles was a lot more fun than the phantom menace and it was at a good level of difficulty
too bad i didnt beat it though my stepbrother doesnt have a memory card for his dreamcast
if youre a huge fan of star wars then dont get this game youll end up destroying the game after you see how many pointless missions you have to go through and how many impossibly difficult leaders you have to face  jabba the huts champion fighter  a huge and hairy beast  a thief who stole a part from anakins podracer  a coruscant mercenary  and ofcourse the incredibly powerful darth maul
sure it may sound easy but wait till you hear this you dont always play as quigon jinn and obiwan kenobi in quite a few levels you are forced to play as captain panaka and evengulp queen amidala
really im not kiddingi was hoping this was a racing game but its an adventure game so i am not very happy with it at this timei just have to say one thing first there clearly are not enough buttons on the n controller to make a decent variety of moves
instead in this game there are about nine moves most of them useless because they do so little damage
this alone makes this game so incredibly boring after two hours that i have to wonder what the creators were thinking when they made this game
even multiplayer mode loses its appeal pretty quickly because of the limited amount of moves
there are also a few too many items and it really makes it less fair that you can use a big baseball bat or a lightsaber or a beamgun to help you win
also considering that the gameplay wasnt good enough the fighting environment takes a new approach at trying to add lots of detail and affecting play but most of the battle grounds are far too plain for what it is trying to attempt
but i will say that the game has incredible graphics each character and scene developed beautifully
i also like that in practice mode you can change the speed of the characters movement so it seems like slow motion
you can make the characters go at normal speed or onefourth of it making for a great amount of matrixlike suspense
the two challenge rounds are also a challenge maybe too great a challenge especially with characters like yoshi who dont get a jumping boost but an egg to throw
the bottom line is this game is simply a rental because that is about the amount of time it will take you to get sick of this game
if there were more buttons on the n controller and the game had more play modes this game could have been pulled off very nicely but for now its just a short rentalthe graphics arent too good the cars look great but are loaded with more handling problems than ever before and the gameplay sucks
lets face it the oncegreat ridge racer series is now dead
and this is the game that helped seal its fatei dont see all the hype in this portable gaming device
the games graphics are so terrible so is game boy advance
the only good nintendo graphics is the brand new nintendo ds which has nintendo  graphics which isnt too shabby
but i really hate the pocket and color because its a waste of money
why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors its not that good and plus the addition of bad graphicsnow thats what i call a bad dealnot get clear about that game as nothing good not work on code i try as nothing and is that fake or not kind code for this game
i dont understandduke nukem is a pretty cool series
i use to own some of the nukem gamesi happen to buy this game along time ago at a game store called gamemaxthey had it for  bucksit was pretty sweet
the graphics were terrible but hey it was on the play station
the game play was kinda slow but still good
i dont know if this is and edited copy of the gamei can tell you is that in this version i got for ps you do see women take there braws off when you pay em cashbut they have starsliteraly covering there nipsand it also has a type of colorthe one that matches there brathe games violence is over the top
but still its a winneri happen to like the n versio more then this even though there isnt brief nudity like the ps version but in the n version there is more violencethe bodies explode when you shoot them again after there dead
you cant do that in the ps version but that doesnt really matterduke nukem total meltdown is recomended for a mature audience since this game does have over the top pig exploding violence plus you go to an adults only book store and there are half naked strippers with stars on themi had fun with this game
it kinda pissed me off cause you didnt get to do all the stuff you can do in the pc version but i still liked it
over all its a mediocer versioni do not recomend this version at at all
get the pc version
or the ni donno i just liked that versionits a great duke nukem gamelaterthe quality was listed as goodit was on the poor sideanalog feels broken and a feels buttons are stickybut it did work i recieved this game for one of my birthdays many years ago
at first i was excitedbut when i played itoh boy
the graphics were horrible too rough and generic
to make matters worse they looked like cheap cartoon drawingsthe missions were dull
your first mission is to fly though magical rings
the story is even worse you have to save random civilians using various powers
the levels keep jumping so your never in the same placethe multiplayer was kinda fun but it gets dull fast
basicly it shifts to fps and you shoot other people for points
other than that this is probably the worst game i have ever played
dont buy this gamerent it at mostor borrow itwhat what game im describing
its old its puzzling and its a blockbuster game
its you guessed it myst
and that is probably the easiest puzzle youll get concerning myst too
since it is a popular game  that was released a quite a long time ago youve probably heard of it by  now
ill just say this one thing  if youre deaf or impatient avoid
there is a puzzle that involves matching piano tonesheck even if youre  not deaf its still quite a puzzler
but dont fretyou can beat this  game in five minutes if you know how and it can be found in the many game  walkthroughs of the internet
after all with the difficulty of these  puzzles rest assured youll be looking for onei can see why this game was so hyped in   cdroms were cutting edge and the slideshow graphics are fairly good and so is the sound
however the story isnt as interesting as the ambiance would have you think and the movement is absolutely irritatingly choppyi dont believe anyone has ever finished this game without some help
there is too much slow clicking around and backtracking to keep the attention of even the dullest personi dont like having to resort to hints in order to play a game because its released before the necessary technology is truely readyrealmysti no longer care
riven and mysteven more clueless and annoying im surethis game continues to haunt my memories as an irritation because of its length and puzzles which usually amounted to no more than treading back and forth across the island of myst
while the environments were increadibly beautiful they fail to make up for the miserable gameplay which has you go to one place at least  times to solve five different puzzles
the story is intruiging yet the games ending fails to please the player since youll discover shortly after completing it it could be completed in a matter of minutesa good game for  to  dollars but you shouldnt spend more than that on this weekend gameothers have commented on the richness of the sound score the sumptuousness of the graphics and the immersion the puzzles provide for you
all true
but i find peoples devotion to riven and its predecessor  a bit overblownthere are design faults here that should be pointed  out
the slideshow effect when moving probably does allow sufficient  computer memory for photorealism while standing still but it compromises  the realism that the producers were otherwise attempting
besides that  its simply annoying
some have said that it adds a certain elegance to  movement throughout the game but i dont like seeing my surroundings  melt away as i move through them
nor do i like sterile empty  environments
oh sure it all adds to the creepy vibe the producers were  hoping for but a universe which is largely uninhabited is mighty boring  after a few hours
i wanted wayyyyy more interaction with people than i  got herei also wanted to understand why i was doing what i was doing
oh i could solve the puzzles given gobs of time and guesswork but at the  end i found the plot rather too spare for the amount of work invested
if  im going to spend weeks solving puzzles i better understand more at the  end of the story than at the beginning
im not altogether sure that  happens here
the universe here for all of its graphical excellence  left me hungry for more
clearly this is an entertainment crafted by  fine artists rather than fine writers
if youre happy with that  orientation youll be overjoyed with the final product
but if like me  you want a game to surround you with an active vibrant plot revealed by  characters of substance riven isnt much of an adventureeveryone did love this game i just didnt like it im not a huge turn base rpg fan if i where though this would be a fun game it was enjoyable but very longfor years nowgamers have said that this is one of the greatest games ever madei just dont understand why they think that iseven for its timeit was pretty dull and boring in my opinioni remember dropping  bucks on this game when it first came out back in and being very dissapointed with itthe main problems i have with this game are the graphicsexcept the cinematicsthe gameplay and some other elementsone of the main things that i hated about ff isthere is absolutley no speech in this game at allyou have to read everything that the characters are sayingit gets very iratating very fastall you do is readreadreadand read some morethe combat system is way beyond confusingits all about they hit youthen you hit themthen they hit you with a strong attack and almost or completly kill youthe only good thing i can say about this gameis the cineamatics are beautifulthey are very nice to watchbut the characters and surrounding areas are very blocky lookingoveralli give ff a twothe resident evil series has been on a steady decline since the first game came out in the mids
it seems that they make these games harder and harder than they should be and code veronica is no exception
its not the simplistic puzzles that make the game difficult rather its the lack of ammo and healing items that make what what should be easy battles far more difficult than they should bewhy do some zombies take more bullets than others
why do zombies respawn in some areas
whats up with all the backtracking in this game
youre still forced to use the stupid typewriter ribbons to save
these are some of the questions youll ask yourself when you play the code veronica
has the series evolved
if you get past the improved graphics the answer is no
the control is just as sloppy as it was in re albeit with a quick turnaround feature and a new twohanded gun mode you burn through bullets faster this way
a great deal of prior planning and trial and error is required which may have been good back when the series was young but it has simply gotten to be tedious todayeven the soundtrack is pretty forgettable
the game has a rather cartoonish look to itcould have looked more realistic but then again the dreamcast isnt exactly a graphics powerhouse
my suggestiondont buy it
granted ive owned this game for quite some time and those who are new to dc may have heard great things about cv but trust me this is a boring game
get shenmue instead as that game simply plays better and has a better storyif you like the original resident evil you will probably like this one for the most part
however i liked the original resident evil but found code veronica extremely annoyingthe annoying part has nothing to do with the game itself
the puzzles are a bit bothersome at times but nothing to complain about
the graphics arent bad and the story line works pretty wellthe big problem i have with the game is the play control
the editorial comment says quotless than perfect controlsquot well that is an understatement
you have to hold down the right trigger to use your weapons this makes firing while running and firing while retreating overly complex
moreover you have to go into the menu screen every time you want to pick up or use an item
there just had to be a better waymost of the time i would say that the play control only diminishes the fun of the game but doesnt ruin it
however in this instance it does
the control sucks the fun out of the game just as the zombies do the blood out of your neck while you are fumbling around with the controller
the game isnt very difficult but the play control makes the game more work then it is worthplodding firstperson shooter with tons of fog to conceal thegraphic weaknesses
oneplayer missions are tedious
only redeemingfeature is to play the twoplayer game with other quotsouth parkquot fans and then only if youve gotten the codes to unlock favorite characterseven with friends youll tire of it in a dayi simply find the game ordinary and boring
i really love the tvshow and was very much looking forward to the gameman i was  dissapointedthere is nothing new in the game
it is simply an ordinary  shoot em up including the characters from south parkadmitted there  are a few funny features in the game the cowshooting gun mr hanky the  christmas poo but even these things gets quite boring after a very short  whilemy advise is enjoy the tvshow and use your playstation for  something elsewwf attitude although a good game dont get me twisted was not worth it on the playstation because of the incredible loading time
 seriously if you picked owen hart gangrel road dogg or even kane or the undertaker you had to wait atleast  sometimes exceeds of  minutes just to get a match started
and if you picked a hardcore or cage match sometimes you had to wait even longerthe trade off was truly not worth it for me because of that reason
granted yes what you got on the playstation version rather than the n version was better
psone had more sounds more create a wrestler options in the voice and music and some clothes
because of psones memory capability the game could have more and that was a definite plus over the i will admit that once you got the match started on the psone version the game itself was faster than ns version but still anyone could appreciate not having to wait  minutes to play a simple game
the controls can be a little challenging at first but once you get it youre golden and you dont have to worry about a thingfor the game itself i will give a  star because it is still a fun game to play with your friends but because of the awful loading and wait time i give wwf attitude a zeroalthough i most confess that i did enjoy this game at first at first meaning from beginning to end i was happy with big areas to explore and really enjoyed the nemesis although it was no more different that that bald stalking guy of the inverted re hunting you down i most say this game is a fraud in what concerns story line structure which on its own right is the main mover of any storybased gameim going to simulate here the general structure re and re and re although this is acceptable in the original game follows quotso how did these creatures end up here
lets search the whole place while we try to get out of here
look out
lots of guns blood and guts follow wow jill that was close
hey he was supposed to be our friend
he turns out to be a traitor
hey look a secret lab within the main place house police station city or any other place of your fancy lets check it out
oh no this is the truth behind the monsters
we most stop umbrella
darn
this place is about to explode let us get out of here
look out a big mean monster
more guns blood and guts follow yeah
we did it
our heroes escape a few seconds before the whole place blows up
finquot wow we have a new resident evil game heremy point here is this game features the same story line structure of the past two games only this time we get to play before and after re
that dirty trick was capcoms strategy to make the games storyline a little bit different and engrossingi cant comment on code veronica for i havent played it yet but i think i will do so when it gets out for the ps but for what i can see the re series is going down the drainage
i will consider resident evil  depending on many aspects
i might be playing this game along with re again when i get me a ps but surely i wont touch it again in the near futurethere is more to horror gaming than just guns blood guts and linear story lineresident evil  may i say is one of the best games of all time
so was re re and re code veronica
but not resident evil   first of all whats with the difficulty mode
u either put it on easy and it starts u with enough ammo to finish the rest of the game with or u put it on hard and it makes it so u barely have enough
but the worst part is the tyrant
it chases u so u barely have a chance to explore
it literally follows u through doors and into new areas constantly
hes hard to kill and always comes back
plus he can kill u in one or two hits and is fast
it takes away from the fun of the game
forget this game and try resident evil  or one of the others you will thank me laterthis is definetly a misleading title its more like resident evil   i mean looking at the improvment between re and re this thing is more like  a side story
in fact it should have been the third disc in re then  there would be jill claire leon
i did enjoy nemesis he certinely  scared the heck out of me every now and then plus you have that added  preasure while playing the game that hes stalking your every move
but i  mean come on the story takes place at the same place at the same time  when i firsted played the game i was like quothavent i played this  beforequot the worst thing was the lack of story after completeing both  claire and leon discs in re  i was expecting more secrets amp lies with  the whole umbrella conspisy and a rule of a trilogy is going back to the  begining jill and finding out something that wasnt true in the first  place but i didnt get diddly squat
and the whole thing just got  repetitive without the story to drive me to find out what happens in the  end
i really wish i had a dreamcast so i could enjoy code veronica the  true resident evil what the resi series of games does it does well  ott hollywoodstyle scares and geneticallymutated things that go bump in the night
re  is no different providing more of the same for fans who love it
it also boasts one or two gameplay improvements but somehow cant quite get back to the glory days of the first  games in the seriesthe plot follows the heroine from the first game jill  hours before and after the devastating outbreak of the tvirus in re  a novel concept and one which capcom surely intended to exploit fully
the inclusion of the nemesis character a frankensteinlike monster who relentlessly pursues you from start to finish is also a nice twist adding muchneede dtension to the game whenever he makes an appearance
the menus and controls are also tweaked most notably the inclusion of the turn and dodge features which if learned properly add hugely to the gameplaygraphically re  is as good as re  its as detailed and lush as before
the intro is strangely disappointing being lores and choppily animated  the playstation s power is being overused
the sound is good though and the gameplay is the best possible version of an imperfect control systemthe problems with re  lie mainly in the games production
its nighon impossible to keep track of yourself for the first thirty minutes or so and the map for this portion of the game is difficult to spot
the baddies are soupedup versions from the previous games and are actually too difficult to kill initially
you waste precious ammo and health packs before you realise that you can take multiple paths
also nemesis though an excellent inclusion is again too intense for the early stages of the game and more often than not youll find yourself cursing capcom while waiting for your game to reload after hes dispatched you
againas the game continues you realise that the baddies have an unfair advantage over you and you will end up running past the majority of them
the satisfaction of knowing a zombie is cornered just isnt there anymore
you also miss out on some beautiful backdrops and vitally important clues becuase youre too busy avoiding some ridiculously overpopulated areaa vast sprawling game that does yield some rewards for diehard fans re  is not a good way to introduce yourself to the series because of its unforgiving difficulty
the storyline may also confuse newcomers
if youre a fan who doesnt mind being confused and frustrated then check it out
if not wait for something better like code veronica or anything in the silent hill seriesback in  capcom introduced  both japanese and americans gamers a brandnew world of videogaming
despite the rather awkward name of quotresident evilquot which is just plain out laughable the title has become a household name
this movielike horror series can be written down as a new genre of gaming horror
yeah very few games caused gamers to devastatingly sob aeries funeral in final fantasy vii some games built mystery or suspense gray foxs desperate attack and impressive dialogue in metal gear solid but resident evil led the player to leap in fright or frantically jitter
capcom inserted bloodthirsty zombies as the adversary and the players fear as the biggest opposition
in a sense it is a movie
useless to say resident evil was among the titanic series that landed on the sony playstation
the original game presented an amazing surface
however it suffered from terrible voice acting and a somewhat dull story
capcom extremely went hard at work for their sequel
powerful hype erupted when resident evil  was announced
anxious gamers couldnt wait to get their grubby paws on a copy
resident evil  altered the gaming industry
other home console companies decided to cash in while the genre was sizzling hot
konami cashed in with silent hill
survivaladventure games went mainstream
after re respectfully lived a third installment was introduced this time hype was scarce
it came out too quickly and sources claimed the interface was going to be identical as the other two
fearing the worst the third installment seemed to be a horrible move for capcom
and is
from the experience of the two resident evil games the player may expect the quotscare momentsquot while playing on a big screen tv with surround sound the volume almost reverberating the room and a sudden pack of grunting zombies crashing out a window i felt no fear
amateurs to the resident evil series may have a chill ride their spine but original fans will expect each scare attempt
though few changes have been added re fails to take a leap over the original resident evil  in other words just imagine playing resident evil  but with more rooms and more puzzle solving
re is the strongest and most remembered in the series
when catching a glimpse of re excitement was absent
re seems it brought the entire series in shame
the story must take a new direction
like taking a role of an umbrella agent or the tvirus spreading somewhere else than racoon city
nemesis a ferocious mean bazooka equipped devil who hunts the player proves to be a pathetic antagonist and challenge
the minigames granted after beating the game bring little life at the games abrupt end
the slogan quotif the suspense doesnt kill you then something else willquot lives truly in the second gamethis was one of the first games i remember playing on the playstation
so i wanted to replay it and i was very frustrated
i never finished the game back then and it was a big pain finishing it this time around
a lot of backtracking and poor inventory setup
i still think its one of the few titles for the playstation that you should give a try
i ordered it used and it came on time and i had no problem with the cd during gameplayfinally sega releases a video game system that rises above mediocrity
sega is famous for all kinds of failed and embarrassing video game consoles they brought to the world but this time they actually kind of got it right with the dreamcastunfortunately sega made a gigantic mistake that almost immediately brought down any chance of the dreamcast becoming a success
they chose to release the dreamcast in late   gaming fans vividly remember what happened to the sega saturn just a couple years before and people werent going to be fooled again
this was now or never for sega
if the dreamcast failed sega would be gone from the hardware market foreverthe release date for the dreamcast was getting closer and closer
it was in september of   people were still very happy with their playstation one because  was one of sonys highlights for spectacular and revolutionary gaming
that wasnt the only thing going on
sony fans were also anticipating the release of the playstation  which was guaranteed to become the dominant console thanks to the relentless power and popularity the playstation one was responsible for
it was during this time sony was far and away the most powerful company in the video game business
sega saw trouble ahead but continued to move forward with the expected dreamcast release datenintendo was also very much alive and in the big picture with the gamecube
nintendo was content on making sure their fans would not be disappointed with the gamecube the way they were with the n
nintendo fans are loyal
nothing can knock out nintendo
nintendo recognized their mistake with the n and knew they could make it right again
they knew they could give the playstation  a run for its money and looking back nintendo did just thatand so the release date for the dreamcast arrived
with nintendo and sony on top of their game what would happen
what would happen to sega
the dreamcast would hit the market and nothing
no sound
no noise
so little was said about the dreamcast on the release date that it was like sega had died right then and there
an eerie silence for a company that gave the world sonic the hedgehogthe dreamcast failed because there were already more than enough successful gaming consoles on the market in  and people didnt want the dreamcast to interfere with the superior soontobereleased sony and nintendo gaming systems
sega also failed because of their long frustrating history of ripping people off with unsatisfactory video game systems such as the sega cd and sega saturn
sega would fool people into thinking they had something extraordinary in the works only to end up not supporting it
they had trouble supporting the video game consoles they created and would often leave people with failed attempts and false hopes
sega would always fall asleep on the job
this would happen time and time again with sega hoping the braindead masses would buy their average incomplete gaming consoles
its like the people who worked for sega would always say lets start something and not finish itwhen sega failed yet again with the saturn people finally couldnt take anymore
anyone who was still a sega fan by that point pretty much lost all hope
sega was now the enemy and they had to go
a gaming console needs a giant selection of games and unfortunately sega only understood that one time in their lackluster history with the genesis
every other console they released only had a few classics to choose from among a bunch of average gamesin the case of the dreamcast sega tried to support it but it was too late
sony had defeated them
sony had defeated both the saturn and the dreamcast with the overpowering success of the playstation one
hard to believe but its true the playstation one knocked out both the saturn and the dreamcast  off the market making both of those consoles nothing more than a disappointing memory for sega fansin  sega knew they wouldnt be able to compete with the playstation  so they finally did the right thing in early  by announcing that they would never again make another video game console
sega was done
they admitted defeat
that my friends made milions and millions of people very happy
no more junk on the market
that announcement was the best thing that could have happened and if you happened to glance outside that day you would have noticed the sun smiling down on everyonethat meant no more arrogant sega promotion
i used to hate the way sega would always promote their games by putting down nintendo and sony
now i can laugh at it
sega really thought they could trick people into buying their crappy games by constantly making fun of nintendo and sony
didnt work
nintendo and sony fans are too smart and considerate for that immature nonsense
i bet everyone responsible for the playstations creation were laughing in piles of money over the fly play thing fly commercial that sega created in an attempt to make sony look secondrate
ha
that ugly graycolored box destroyed both the saturn and the dreamcast and i hope sega fans never forget itits almost  and people are still talking about the gamecube and playstation   why
because they are successful video game consoles
people will look back and remember them as successful consoles
no one remembers that the dreamcast tried to compete with them at one point
people forgot the dreamcast even existed when the year  came around
segas video game consoles immediately became dated and forgettable once companies stopped making games for them
if sega had put less energy into putting down the competition and more energy into offering their customers complete and enjoyable gaming consoles maybe theyd still be around today
as it stands they deserved to watch nintendo and sony destroy them
nintendo and sony didnt have to stoop to dirty tactics to win over fans and the world is now a better placewith the release of nintendos new revolutionary wii system coming to america this november along with the playstation  we dont have to laugh at segas silly attempt to compete only to end up being the laughing stock of the world
goodbye segasega finally got it right with the dreamcast despite the nintendo knock off controllers
this was segas last effort in the console wars but we all know how that turned out
by sega makes so good games on nintendoi bought the dreamcast with high hopesmostly because of street fighter and sonic gamesthe only good games are sonic adventure  and dead or alive sega has made systems that all have failedlike the recent saturnfor the first couple of days its goodconsvery loudnot may places to rent gamesnot many gamesnot many demo disksprosgood graphicseasy controlseasy to hook upeasy to hall aroundoverall the dreamcast stinksif your looking for a system with fair graphicslots of gamesgood gameseasy control id buy the playstationyou know sitting behind a computer screen im glad no one can see the look of disappointment that appeared on my very face the minute i began playing tekken  i am incredibly disappointed that after reading so many positive reviews claiming tekken  to not only be a significant improvement over the previous two tekken games but also tagged the ultimate tournament fighter that the actual game would turn out to be so underwhelmingtekken  really surprised me
but dont take that as a compliment
i went into tekken  with hardly any experience with fighting games whatsoever
i took a break for  years with tournament fighters after all those lousy d mortal kombat games brought me to tears
back then i figured okay either i dont like fighting games or maybe i just dont like the mortal kombat series
this was when mortal kombat  and  were popular on the super nes and genesisa lot can change with a human being in  years
we grow older we decide we want to learn about life and wonder where we came from and we develop an apprecation for the things we have and the people who are in our lives
to put it simply were thankful to be alive and feel good
but in some situations things can remain exactly the same
all those extreme feelings of hatred returned to me immediately after only  minutes with tekken  it was the exact same feeling of hopelessness i encountered with the mortal kombat seriesi really have no idea what went wrong
no not with the game i mean what went wrong with me
seeing as how i love watching people fight and kick butt on tv shows and movies i figured it was only natural that the fighting style in the world of video games would appeal to me
appeal to me a lot
that was my assumption
but apparently it still hasnt happened
tekken  was supposed to help me wash away all the bad memories of playing old mortal kombat games and give me a fresh start and hopefully help me develop an appreciation for the everpopular genre of games known as tournament fighters
nope
its really disappointing to me to find out that tekken  is just as bad as the rest of the fighters ive played and basically the same thing but with improved graphics for that matter
all fighting games feel the same to me
it doesnt even matter if they are d or d fighterstekken  despite all the positive reviews does not appeal to me whatsoever
the fighting is really clunky and it seems each fighter delivers very basic and boring moves to each other
its not interesting or inspiring at all to me
its boring to watch and even more boring to play
why is it so much fun when they fight this way in movies but not interesting when its time to do the same thing in a video game
i have no idea
if you want to pull off the really impressive looking moves in tekken  you have to press a bunch of buttons on the controller in a really complicated way in order to complete a move that could have been made much easier with a very simple and quick sequence of buttons
strong emphasis on the word simple
many moves actually require you to press the circle button and then jump over to the square button
how is someone supposed to easily master this
going from circle to square is not easyyou see for each of the ten characters in the game they have major power moves that are very important to master because these are the moves that are supposed to cause the most damage to an opponent
however many of these moves are incredibly difficult and sophisticated to pull off and this is a really bad thing because the company responsible for this game apparently doesnt understand the importance of making a fighting game easy to master for everyone of all ages
that way young and old people alike can appreciate the tekken styleit really bothers me how all of the developers who release fighting games assume the player is automatically completely aware how to play the game
they assume this every single time they release a fighting game
developers assume everyone who plays these kind of games will be able to understand them instantly
were supposed to be gifted players when it comes to understanding how to successfully pull off any number of lengthy and devestating combos to our opponents
were supposed to have enough time to press really awkward button combinations on the playstation controller during a fastpaced and intense fighting match
not just combos either regular moves too
were supposed to have enough patience to continue trying the same fight over and over as we die a million times and the frustration factor increases significantly and we realize just how impossible these kind of games arewell i have news for every developer out there many of us have a really difficult time with games like this
not everyone who plays fighting games should automatically be expected to be a skilled player
not all of us hang out at local arcades wasting tons of quarters as we try and perfect our skills
some of us are you know average normal gamers who just like to have fun
the developers of tournament fighters never could understand this and years later they still cant understand what its like to have fun
we shouldnt have to be a genius to play a fighting game
not all of us can press the exact moves at the exact moment and win fights
maybe one day a tournament fighter will be invented for a gaming console that will be specifically designed to be playable for people who struggle with them
maybe one dayother things i dont like about tekken  despite having excellent graphics the music is a bunch of horrible repetitive techno sounds that hardly make me feel compelled to continue playing the game
oh and by the way even though the graphics are really a notch above the rest theres absolutely no reason to jump with joy when looking at them
since the fighting is just as basic and uninspiring as that of oh i dont know killer instinct another terrible game you quickly stop caring about how the game looks
in fact id say the fighting engine is exactly like that old super nintendo game killer instinct
extremely uninteresting
when someone throws a punch its so boring to watch that you just dont care about it
thats what tekken  is all about
having a fighting engine thats so boring you dont even care if you win or loseim disappointed
thats the only thing i can say at the moment
maybe one day an easy tournament fighter will hit the market where the main purpose of the game is to have the computer opponents move along at a reasonable pace for all the normal people out there who constantly struggle with fighting games
a game that will give people the much needed time and patience to put a move on their opponent
a game where you arent expected to hurry up just to deliver a simple move
somehow despite hundreds of tournament fighters that will eventually hit stores i doubt this will ever happen
i will never buy another tournament fighter again
everif you want a basic hack and slash dungeon game where the puzzles dont require much thought then this game is for you
if however youre looking for a game with character development and a good story line with  intricate details and subplots then you probably wont enjoy this game  very much
ive played all of the might and magic games except for the  first two and even the earlier mampm games were better than thisthe  quests and storyline are very cliche
most of the skills you can train in  arent very useful
i have a fighter with th level repair and she still  cant repair anything without breaking it
trade and armsmaster are  probably the most useful skills as well as learning which helps you level  faster
one plus is that when you level you can up your stats even if you  cant afford to traina huge improvement would be if we could edit our  own levels and quests but the game doesnt even include thatthe  dgraphics arent too bad once you get over the hilarious way the  characters look imagine a barbie or ken doll crossed with japanese  animation and youll get the idea
another plus is the hack and slash  portions of the game are addictive
if only the plot was betterive played a lot of games in the past few years and dark stone has to be one of the most boring games in the world
when it was new it did have its halfway decent although a little too cartoonish graphics
but now that the game is a few years old it cannot even claim thata bad attempt at a slightly more complicated diablo this game just doesnt cut iti really love platform games
i guess it is because i love to explore and make my way through those coollooking worlds
and i have to tell you sonic adventures worlds look great
this was the very first  bit game i had played and boy was i excited
the game really disappointed and annoyed me howeverafter playing through the game a bit you will start to realize that after the fun action stages you will begin a squence of boring and annoying cutscenes that you cant skip that will drive you mad
most of them involve sonic and robotnik threatening each other or just characters talking
also the characters will pause between almost every sentence
it takes forever for them to finish what they are saying and you wont really care most of the time
boring
if you make it through the cutscenes then you wander through the adventure stages looking for the next action stage
mainly by going to a red hint sphere that will say something like quothave you searched the entire adventure stage yetquotwhen you find another action stage things will get a bit better but only for a while
some of the cool things you can do are snowboard speed through a futuristic highway
cool
but then it is back to boredom and the annoying voices especially tails
if you are a real platfor fan skip this one and get rayman  it may not be superfast but it sure isnt boring
and it has better worlds and graphicssonic adventure is a game that tries to do way too much
there are six characters and only one sonic is decent
most of the game is boring and the rest is usually to broken to be any funthe sonic levels which should have been the entire game are plagued with a broken camera it was on crack sometimes it would focus inside a wall and bugs
the boss battles are way to easy and when you started to pick up speed i felt like the game was playing itself i tried to fail on the whale level and it was impossible
plus the sonic story is super short
i didnt really like the other game storiesin the tails levels you just replay the same levels as sonic but you can fly
the camera and bugs are even worse herethe e gamma levels are a super generic shootem up gamein knuckles levels you search for gems in a map and is very tiresomein amys level you pretty much just walk around and hit enemies with a hammer it gets old very fasti save the worst for last big the cat
his levels are just a fishing minigame
theres nothing special at all just a boring fishing game way to go sonic teammost of sonic adventure you play boring sub characters and when you do get to play as sonic its too short and plagued with too bug to be any fun
this is by far the most overpraised dreamcast game out therewith all the great reviews i thought i would give it a try
yeah its dated but i expected that
some dated games are funi just didnt think this was one of them
i played it for about  hours on normal which was enough time to learn the controls and understand the game play
the map is difficult to readunderstand
the psychic abilities are okay but switching to them takes a little timeenough time for the zombies or monkeys to kill you
i found the interface a bit clunky
i just couldnt get excited about this game or the storynarration
i thought it was tedious not funi was able to get this working on windows xp home sp but it took a little effortif you need help go to youtube and search for this video hhgcxftubche does a good job of explaining how to do ithere it is in a nutshellinstall the gamefind download and install systemshockpatchexein the installation folder rename sshockexe to sshockoldfind and download systemshockxpfixzipcopy the exe from the above zip file to the installation folderin the installation folderopen shockcfg with notepadat the end of that file on a separate line add this safetexturemanagersave and exit the filewindows xp bootini changes be careful

i understand the tension that the developers were trying to create and they succeed but this is ridiculous
constantly low on ammo with weapons so defective the manufacturers would be promptly put out of business all the while being attacked by hordes of wrench wielding regenerating zombies
you aint gotta chance and thank heavens for cheats or i wouldnt be bothered
if you could get it for under  bucks go for it and kill some time
but i sure wouldnt spend the money that is being demanded on amazondont pay a penny for this folks
move on to an ea game
there is very little in the way of actual physics calculations between players in this game every interaction is merely a scripted animation
rbs are stopped in full stride by shoestring tackles
wrs run their routes at half speed while the dbs shadow them in front of their routes
offensive line programming is horrible
guards and tackles blow assignments on every play doubling up on a dt and allowing lbs to come free and tackle the rb at the handoff
there is no player momentum a flaw ive noticed in a number of sega sports games meaning any player can stop in midstride and immediately run full stride in the opposite direction
sit back and watch the computer play and out  and out  and out this was an incomplete game that should not have been released
so what if it looks pretty
it plays like crapi was very disappointed in this pc game
it was boring
everything about the game was chance
you have little control over what happens
game time is short and it is very likely you did not win anyway
it was a waste of my time
if you really think you need this game  buy it used or at least a new one cheapa fun shoot m up no less and regrettably no more
fans of the board game the series or even the role playing game will be in for a bit of a dissapointment
the game  has few options besides quotclick and shootquot
still i spent a fun few hrs playing it and a lotta dlrs buying iti hope well get a better more extensive version soonthis controller is an okay replacement for the original snes controllers but not as good
the reason why this controller is not as good as the original snes controllers is because the buttons are not as sensitive to button presses unlike the original which have very sensitive buttons the buttons after using them for several months or a little bit more start to sink down more inside the controller because the springs are not as strong as the ones in the original controllers are
in addition they are made cheaper than the original controllers and are not as durable so they will not last as long
my recommendation is to not buy these controllers and get refurbished original super nintendo controllers on  or the exact replica version because they use the same exact materials to make those controllers as nintendo does for their controllers
the only difference is the exact replicas do not have the nintendo logo on it
i got two refurbished original super nintendo controllers from that website and they work excellently and they will last for many years
and another thing about the new port controllers the first time you use them the dpad buttons are rather stiff and eventually lossen up after using them for a while and become easier to use
a last warning about the controller the down function on the dpad does not work very good unlike on the original super nintendo cotrollers the down function on the dpad works excellentlywith a formfactor nearly identical to the original playstation  controllers but minus the analog sticks of the quotdual shockquot  controller this controllers obvious benefit is to owners of  quotconnectix virtual game stationquot the playstaitononmacintosh  emulator
its also handy for arcadey titles and macmame the emulator of  classic arcade video gamesthe one place gravis makes a change is very  much for the worse  the four separate directional buttons are replaced by  a single pivoting directionalpad
as too often happens with designs like  this the dpad pushes two switches at once and always comes through as a  diagonal eg right  up when you thought you were just pushing right
the frequent inability to enter a true right left up or down is annoying  in some games particularly in navigating the menus of an rpg and deadly  in others psx quotasteroidsquot is unplayable when rotating your ship  sometimes inadvertantly puts you into hyperspace since thats what  quotupquot doesalso of note is the fact that this controller works  only with games written to use apples quotinputsprocketsquot
thats  true of most late s  early s games but not of some earlier titles  quotdescentquot which used to be bundled with mac performas comes to  mind and its not clear if sprockets will be supported in the upcoming  mac os xthat said driver installation is easy and has been hasslefree  on my two imacs and my ibook
usb plugandplay almost always works  without a snap though ive found its better to plug it in once the finder  is up instead of during the boot cycleif you play lots of mac games  and by the way
how
 this is better than relying on mousekeyboard  alone but the dpad problems are a major aggrivationthis will get the job done on most games however if you want to play games like street fighter or any other game that requires directional based special moves you can forget itsoftware on the site allows you to program special move buttonsthe buttons are terrible
they mush down
they are not springy as they should beon the face of things quotxwing alliancequot has the makings of an extraordinary entry into the star wars franchise
the characters are engaging with enough backstory given in the accompanying written material  to start a small movie
conveniently there is actually a small movie  which opens the game off with a real narrative bang
it makes one wish  that lucas himself had taken a page from the game producers when he was  making the phantom menaceunfortunately after this high point the  game soon degenerates into endless missions which advance the  plotpainfully slowly
oh there are cool points along the way
the cut  scenes are interesting and the sound environment throughout the missions  is superb
but the inplay graphics engine is fairly ordinary by  lucasarts own standards
the missions themselves are endless variations  on the same themes
and the games conclusion is less than satisfactorybut theres another side to the gamemultiplayer actionand for this  the game deserves some praise
as a vehicle for capturing the gaming  possibilities of the net quotxwingquot is worth the purchase price
theres a large loyal player base for the whole quotxwingquot series  so youll never be alone on the netstill there are better options to  get what you want out of a star wars game
quotrogue squadronquot is  an infinitely better singleplayer space game
and the upcoming  quotforce commanderquot promises to be something of a new standard in  multiplayer action
by comparison quotxwing alliancequot merely  feels like a solid update to an aging seriessure it was fun for the first hour then it died
i could never get the kids to stop vandalism
riding the rollercoasters werent fun at all
you want a theme park game get rollercoaster tycoon
rollercoaster tycoon not rollercoaster tycoon  but i wont get into that
where can i get a refundi loved theme park and theme hospital rct is the best sim game around so i had high hopes that theme park world as its called in the uk would go one step furtherbasically this is a kiddies game
its nothing like  theme park and your very limited to what you can do
there are fun rides  and the best part is walking round the park and going on your rides but you  dont have the same amount of control as in rctits nice to look at  although i didnt like the d style and you need a good spec machine  otherwise expect jerkovision or if you build too many rides
theres only   parksscenarios
unlike rct where there are loads plus an add on pack
my nephew liked taking pictures of the park and emailing them but it has  taken a whole new view point into sim games
this isnt a true sim game    i think we need a bit of going back to basics here and seeing what makes a  sim game
just look at theme hospital and rct
it also loses marks for  having the only online help assistant who is more annoying then the  msoffice paperclip one
luckily you can turn him off
i stopped  playing it after a week
so will true sim fans
bring on another rct add on  packsim themepark was not what i saw coming
right when i got it i popped it into the cdrom on the computer
i was so excited
but then the downside comes along
the installation takes forever
i had to try again to make it work
then it takes forever just to get into the game
and when i finally got into the game the colors were all screwed up
okay so i messed with some hardware on the computer but even after my mom fixed it they still wouldnt work right
and whenever i go into the game it gets stuck right after i click quotquitquot
so i have to restart the computer completely
since the day i first got this this game has not seen the cdrom
at all
i am looking into roller coaster tycoon and am hoping that it will work much better than this
thank you for reading my reviewi guess you could say that this game was pretty much a dissappointment
i probably would have liked it more if i hadnt already bought rollercoaster tycoon even though im not really a fan of that game its a lot better than sim theme park
i felt ripped off when i found out that there were only four theme parks to choose from which made this a very short lasting game
another major problem is  you can even build your own rides
talk about cheapoverall i give sim theme park  stars i gave the extra star because i probably would have liked it more if i got it before i got rollercoaster tycoon
actually this game is pretty good for all ages its just leaning a little more towards the younger kids about i guess  if you want a game for older gamers try rollercoaster tycoon
i suggest that you just ditch the thought of buying a game about building amusement parks and get a game like the sims or somehtingwell theres a lot of ways this game could have been fun if only they had tried to put more into it ok it says on the front box that you can chose from  different types of parks in reality all the parks are the same  just different animation they all have a feris wheel flying bird thing  ect the little talking advisor cannonball in the corner is insanely  inoying and yet they make it so that you have to have him to play the  game other wise youll not be able to get to problems in time
i mean are  programers idiots
do they think that a little cannonball making bad  jokes and talking in the most annoying voice you have ever heard is what we  really want to have as an advisor
and why do they animate the kids and  everything in the cut sceens so unrealistic and stupid looking
in almost  every game programers feel that they need to make humans look as stupid as  possible why
its not funny it demotes the animators intelegence
anyways  the only thing thats really good about it is that you can ride your own  roller coasters and you can turn the little cannonball guy off
although it will be harder to manage without himin the exact sense of the word the game cheated me
the suspense built up by the time you finish the third level culminates in one of the most shocking and innovative pieces of plot i have seen to date
whats the  problem
the remainder of the plot is a piteous attempt to bring the  innovation and tie it onto the quotand all was wellquot endingthe  graphics are amazing although there is way too much green and you spent  less time in originallooking levels than in the quotnormalquot ones
nevertheless from the beginning they look quite surreal and amazingly  lifelike
more than that  they are aesthetic
the main character is  pretty much nonexistent snce he has no lines and his only role in the  game is to capture monsters
the battle engine offers far too few choices  since upgrading your characters equipment is nonsense he rarely enters  actual combat and you cant equip your monsters
therefore the games  central and only concept is to go through level after level capturing and  merging monsters
theres nothing more to the game
oh yes there are  several original parts you earn money by selling the captured monsters  but they are too fewi recieved this older game quickly
but i was still playing the new tomb raider on ps and did not install it on y pc for a couple of weeks
i could not get this agme to work properly on my new computer
it loaded fine and background music worked but the graphics were  hmm  stone age looking
no matter how i tried to reconfigure my graphic card it would not adjust to be playable graphics
i deleted it from my computer
i gave it to my son to try and load on his slightly older system but he hasnt tried to play yet because he is playing his new games
i will update and post what he says about his experience with iteven when this game first came out it was fairly mediocre
lets move on shall we
there are many many games that topple half life and counter strike released since contrary to what the amazon editorial had to say about this game half life is not the bloodiest soldier of fortune is not the smartest no one lives forever and is not the scariest system shock  or clive barkers undyinghalf life is a hypefesti loved the first two gabriel knight games sins of the father and the beast within
they were creepy wellresearched and had great atmospherewell blood of the sacred blood of the damned had great potential  renneslechateau and vampires
neat
but poor gameplay really squandered that potentialto give you an example of what i mean one of the puzzles involves getting a vehicle so gabriel can get from one place to another
a perfectly good motor scooter i think its been a while is available
but noooooo  gabriel refuses to ride something so wussy
he has to have a big motorcycle
so thats the puzzle  getting the selfish jerk a motorcycle to ridelet me get this straight
hes a detective trying to solve a case but hes going to waste time finding a cooler ridethat was the point where i threw the game out the window so i cant comment on how it ends unfortunately
the voice acting was pretty lame i dont know who told tim curry he could do a new orleans accent but he cantnow that the price has dropped its worth trying if youre really into gabriel knight
otherwise there are much better adventure games out there that are also dirt cheap
try one of themon paper hellfire seems like a great idea
take a really good game add a couple additional levels quests items and monsters put in a couple of new classes and bam instant winnersadly that doesnt pan out in practice
part of it is that the hellfire design feels largely uninspired and lacks the cohesiveness balance and ingenuity that went into original diablo
in fact there are only two really good features in hellfire
the first is the jog toggle that allows your character to run in tristram
too bad it doesnt function in the dungeons
the second is the search spell that helps you locate items on the ground
unfortunately its a spell so you have to spend mana on it
blizzard rolled up both these features in diablo ii in much improved form
as it stands they end up not benefiting diablo very muchthe rest of the additions are just mediocre or worse
the new character class is fun but kinda unbalanced and doesnt really add a lot of depth
lots of stuff feels tacked on and has an inconsistent art style that doesnt match diablos polish
there arent really a lot of new quests
one of the two new area is downright annoying
some of the best features can only be enabled by editing a special file outside the gamethe worst part of hellfire is that playing it means making a tradeoff
it is not a seamless expansion to diablo  its almost like a separate game
your diablo characters arent portable between hellfire and the original game so you have to roll new ones
and while diablo went on to gain five more patches after hellfires release  sierra only patched their game once so hellfire players have to contend with bugs longfixed in diablo
in addition to those bugs hellfire brings a set of its own which never got resolved
hellfire players cant without hacking the game play multiplayer
this expansion is not playable on battlenet
the music in new areas is lacking and because it isnt read from the cd the game glitches whenever an item is picked up
the drop system is bugged out the wazoo to where finding some of the new unique items is actually impossiblei would really recommend this one only to diehard diablo fans
those without it are not missing out on anything
sierra tried to pull it off but they just couldnt match that blizzard standard set by the original game and the new features arent worth fighting the bugs and irritants brought on by this expansionthe expansion was outsourced to sierra online and the quality from diablo i was not maintainedthe expansion does not really add anything monsters seem out of touch music ending are nothing compared to the original
skip this and go straight from diablo to diablo ii which is another pure marvelthis is a joke of a game
lets see a campaign can be finished in an hour
the ai makes you conclude that enemy fighter pilots have a deep vindictive nature is mine the only plane in the sky
all in all this game is like a new level of computer chessboring as hell and yet somehow intelligently scripted scriptedif a game doesnt hook me within the first halfhour then im just not going to see it through to the end
homeworld just seemed like age of empires in space to me and the slow confusing gameplay really got on my nerves
i know that this game has an army of fans who will denounce my comments but i simply could not get into itusually i like space games and i was hoping that this would have a star trekish feel to it
i also quite the wing commander games and since it only cost me p then i thought i might as well give it a go
call me shallow but it didnt give me instant satisfaction and uninstalled it after only  minuteswell i must say that i was really disappointed by this game
i got my hands on it as soon as it became avayable
having played for interminable hours with the original civilization game i had great expectations from  this title
in the end it really turned out to be one of the worst sequels  everthe mayor shortfalls are  game speed
by the time you reach the  space age you will not have been able to explore much of the world and  will not have been able to build an army from a particular historical age
since the speed is so fast by the time you have an army of lets say  musketeers you have already discovered planes and the nuclear bomb
this  is very frustrating
 units fewer than its predecessors and less  realistic
 the space age it is only confusing and doesnt really help  to make the game interesting
 unconventional units you have now lawyers  and ecowarriors that work something like the spies in the original game
in the end they end up beying only annoying and totally confusing
it would  have been better to add a more sound political and economic sistem to the  game and add a few varibles afterwards ie
 political movements and  private enterprise
 customization it is now impossible to customize  the game like create new units as it was possible in civ  i hate that
 maps lacks a map of earth
it used to be the only map i played on in  civ improvements  graphics way better than the predecessors
too  bad that the other features in the game didnt get quite to the same level
 soundtrack improved somehow
 combat a tactical display now allows  you to actually play battles
nice idea to start with but it is somehow  badly put to work and has some incredible bugs like archers that shoot  down stealth bombers
my suggestion
wayt for a sequel or buy civ why didnt i just read the packaging and put it down
no i had to go and buy it
i played civ ii once alpha centauri two or three times and now call to power well i didnt make it through the tutorialone word  zzzzzzzzzzzthis game calls its civilizations quotracesquot and has slavery as a prominet part of the game but there is the abolition eventually
it does not feel like a successor to civilization ii
the wonders of the world are  all new as is the technology tree
the interface is new and you cannot  use a keyboard to move units
i did not care much for its supposedly  improved graphics over civilization ii i did not see that much  improvement and by now the graphics are not cutting edge anywaythere  are too many new units and cumbersome rules associated with them
the  cursed televangelist keeps popping up out of nowhere converting cities and  eating into your empires resources
the lawyer hides just as you are about  to move a military unit to kill him
building cities in space and under  water may sound like a lot of fun and a novelty compared to the two  original civilizations
but playing at lower levels this wont be  interesting becuase you will learn how to crush your opponents before  acquiring the technology for underwater and space construction at higher  levels the game becomes too difficult and too cluttered with units and  characters to persevere with marine and space existence
the only real  improvement over civilization ii is that governments are more stable during  war
in civ ii if you wanted to wage a serious war you had to install  monarchy or fundamentalism or your government would collapse
bottom line  maybe its because i am older but i did not enjoy this game as much as  civilization ii
what comes out of quotcall to powerquot screams for  help to bring more original and wellcrafted games to the marketsid meier is a true artist in the realm of software but with each new addition to the civilization family the games become more oriented toward conflict and less fun to play
in ac the believers will appear on your  borders within the first  turns and you will never really be at peace  again
forget about the fun of managing a nation this is a nonstop  darwinian struggle to keep your head above water
some players might like  this but i find it tedious
theres no point in trying to negotiate with  other factions because theyll just turn right around and violate your  territory or declare war
then after you have spent decades trying to build  up your industry when your output reaches a certain level the planet  itself will being to attack you with an inexhaustible supply of mindworms
every game of ac is a race to achieve the victory conditions before the  planet itself defeats you and theres not much sense of satisfaction in  that
add to this the fact that the game runs unbearably slowly
you will  spend more time watching units go plodplodplod across the screen than you  will playing
i really wanted to like this game but after a while its  defeatist atmosphere and tedious play just got too wearisome
lets hope  that in his next game side remembers that growing an empire is more fun and  challenging than beating onei would rent this game
it takes no skills what so ever to beat it
maybe it just came naturally to me or maybe im just to critical but this game is not worth buying
in my opinion this game would only appeal the the  age range and even then would they only play it once or twicei have most of the major flight sims and now i have this and have only worked with it a bit but i find it a little too overcomplicated its taxing even for someone who is a flight simmer and is already flight tested and combat testedthe graphics are good but first there was the necessity to download a patch which at mb is the largest game patch ive ever seen the list of fixes is enough to make you question why they released it in that form anywayalthough the amount of interactivity is less with the bombers in janes attack squadron so is the level of overheadif you are really a b nut though and you want total realistic immersion in that plane then youll like the simi grew up playing this game as a kid so after buying this game in this day and age i really tried hard to like it
i really did but i just couldnti remember playing this on dos with the joystick
the graphics are a little better then i remembered it and the playstation control is a lot easier to handle than a joystick
the level design is also very retro and original
you simply dont get such dark dysptopianish techno inspired level design like this anymore
speaking of techno the soundtrack allthough very short is simply the best soundtrack of the entire wipeout franchise
messhja being the best song in my opinionnow where this game sadly suffers is the gameplayantigrav racing has gotten faster as time moves on and as a result the original wipeout simply hasnt aged that well
you simply move too slow in this game
so slow that your thumb will actually start to feel sore after two races
i cant even play this game with the x button as the thrust anymore
i have to use the triangle button but that is not even the worst aspect of this game
the worst is that fact that your ship loses all of its speed every single time you miss a turn or bump into an enemy ship and thats another problem
nothing is more annoying in this game then having to pass another ship and have that ship bump into you slowing you down
a more minor issue i have with this game is all the weapon effects just look boring and uninspired looking
if im shooting rockets or missles i want to see a lot more than just a small cloud of dust
i want to see some sorta projectile and explosionoverall i only recemend playing this game if you never experienced the later wipeouts especially wipeout fusion
once you play fusion this game becomes pretty much unplayableok so i get the idea that you are a glove rolling on a ball
hmmmm
ok well here goes
if you liked this game you are an idiot
hello guys you are a glove
what the heck ive never heard of such an idiotic character
a glove
for goodness sakes ive heard that originality is good but this
ok i will stop yelling
but jeeze guys cant you see that only some kind of fool would actually enjoy playing as a glove that can balance on a ball
well i can
so im out enough saidi have played few games that were as funny as this one
why
take a bunch of game developers who hated the average controls of survival horror games get a bunch of inept writers to scribble down a derivative plot with a nice hook and horrible dialogue music composers who aspire to be better than john williams game designers who played way too many super mario games and anyone in marketing or professional game reviewing to pass the game off as a survival horror game and youve got a painfully hilarious game on your hands
this game doesnt do sega any justice and dont believe the lie that this was their first survival horror game they made their first two years before this on the saturn and that game deep fear was art compared to this
i felt absolutely lied to when i played this game thinking i was in for the scare of my life when i found myself rolling on the ground after witnessing some of the silliest character models inconsistent soundtrack awkward dialogue nonexistent atmosphere incomprehensible plot and obnoxious controls ive ever played on a dreamcast game
your characters run so slow youd think they had weights tied to their ankles but their steps look so played out its almost like theyre waddling away from danger
youll kill monsters who despite being four legged monstrosities will literally sprinkle you with gold coins
the overly dramatic music will play on and loop over and over again when nothing is happening
you want a farce
youve got nothing but farce in blue stingerloser
the cars in this game dont leave behind any dust they bite the dust
its no wonder that activision didnt dare tie this game directly into interstate 
there is just no comparison to the classic game
i would love to compare this game but since activision isnt doing that i wont either
lets go down the list of graphics control game play soundmusic and fun factor
that will give or take one star for each categorygraphics where does one start on the graphics
as far as the level of detail and the amount of destruction available it is indeed a very good game
games of this nature tend to over simplified with little or no detail in the buildings and surrounding terrain
activision programmers spent a lot of time on the details in the game i wish they spent the same amount of time on the games engine
the game engine plays like a first generation game
there is such an incredible amount of popping crazing stretching and disappearing polygons any good programmer should have never allowed this kind of thing to even leave his development pc
for those out of the loop ill define the problemspopping terrain popping up out of no where
programmers usually solve this with careful use of fog
yes folks that is the true use of fog
however fog in this game is under utilized
almost like it was thrown in at the last minutecrazingstretching this tends to be very similar
various walls or architecture seems to twist or stretch into bizarre angles
if you have the game drive the car directly up against a vertical wall and youll see it
the level with the lighthouse is a prime exampledisappearing polygons this is a serious no no in games
drive to the edge of any arena until the car quotbouncesquot if you can get the proper slope of land about a  degree angle
and the camera swings low enough parts of the ground will disappear and be replaced by a livid blue or red depending on the generation of psx console or some other factorcontrol unfortunately this game cant decide on arcadian controls or real world controls so it attempts to do a half and half deal
the cars accelerates and steers like its running through molasses unless of course it floats then it feels like its skimming around on ice
in fact controls so bad that i tend to get and use the hovercraft mode or the boat mode more often than not
the only major saving grace is that the controls are  configurable
i myself dont like the default uses for the buttons
especially for my style of play which involves using my thumb to press two or three buttons at the same time
old school mario style if you will
gameplay game play is frustrating at best
why is the quotarcadequot mode listed before quotquestquot mode
the various modes of the game should be fun but really are more of a frustrating exercise in patience
past experience tells me that arcade mode is a great way to quotpracticequot the details of the game
in this case it actually is set up that way
hints and tips are handed to you before each battle
cars can be limited in number and difficulty
and goals are clearly defined
however actually doing all of this takes a bit of work
the number of quotconfigurationquot screens one must churn through is heart breaking
whatever happened to a quotsimplequot game session
and the enemies seem to be overly ruthless
whereas quest mode seems to be the easiest of the modes having blasted through  of the drivers in the first few hours of playing
i really didnt have much patience to even try the survival modesoundmusic i try not to review music or sound in games but in this case it will be the only whole star for this game
the music is indeed sweet to listen to
the tunes are strangely familiar but i cant place my finger on it
it also appears that there is one song for each of the characters to play
the book lists  characters and i believe there are  songs
its quite fun to try and match the songs to the characters
the music would have been a blast if they used real world s music but alas the licensing would be too much
the only annoying sound effect is those stinkin ufos
kind of makes me want to turn the cd into a ufofun factor fun factor cant get much lower
the only fun things here is the quest mode and two player mode
its always nice to play any game with two players especially one that lets us rag on it like its elevator action waaay back in the nes days
the quest mode is nice for those late night nobrainer sessions where your brain is too fried to think about anything elsesorry if this review is just as jumbled as the game itself
watching the game world twist and spin in sickening ways scrambled my poor brain
the resultshalf a star for graphics but bad engine
no stars for the controls
no stars for game play
one star for music and sound
and half a star for the fun factor
thats all
hope activisions third attempt isnt a 
dumpi dont think ive ever been as angry with any software as i was with messiah
after an hour of dying around every corner or in certain parts on the first level i immediately uninstalled it and returned it
it is my  policy that any game that just about forces you to cheat is a bad game
yes the graphics in this game are good and yes the possession ability is  an innovative thing  but all of that is worthless when you get killed so  easily
 hits is all it takes and when your host dies expect bob to  die nanoseconds later
even if youre a crackshot and can kill a person  without making a sound reinforcements appear almost instantly and kill you  just as quickly
the message here is that combat is best avoidedso why  am i constantly thrusted into it
and the ai
superb yet stupid at the  same time
i accidentally went into combat mode with my fists at one time  and armed guards from across the very large room suddenly started  shooting me
also when i possessed a commander a commander for crying  out loud my own soldiers shot me anyway and i wasnt in combat mode
so  i figure either a they have a quotjealousquot behavior or b theyre  stupid
also the possession ability is an innovation but youll get so  frustrated that youll hardly give it a second thought when you uninstall  it
i dont even want to think about the later levels that have you going  against demons
my conclusion isif youre tired of the usual  quotshoot run repeatquot games and youre desperate for a change in  d shootersstick with quotthief the dark projectquot  let this  game die in piecemessiah is a third person game
set in the future you play an angel called bob sent from god to save the world from the bad humans
the angel is very small and weak it can be easily killed but it can posses any charecter it wants and take control of the charecter only after becoming someone it can carry weapons
the graphics and sound are average charecter animation are not very impressive
messiahs problems is that it is quite difficult to posses someone you need to fly behind him and jump into his back and that is very hard to do so because of the third person camera angle
the game is quite short toothis expansion pack ep was a complete wast of my time and money
it adds a couple new magical weapons and armor some new spells and a couple new areas to explore
there is no plot to the the ep just some npc saying  quotoh i lost my son in durlags tower
quot and stuff like that
the only thing that made this ep worth two stars is that they cleaned up a  lot of the rough edges from baldurs gate and increased experience points  to a point where your fighter and like one other class can go up a level
by the way it is just one more disk that you have to flip through if you  decide to replay baldurs gate
in conclusion dont buy this ep it isnt  worth it unless any new eps come out that require iti dont know why others rate this so highly  the graphics are ok i love the fact that you can play with friends although in the end are different schedules ruined this and i like importing my own pictures
but the  controls for this game are absolutely frustratingsome minor gripes  the manual doesnt have enough info combat used to be a major pain until i  stumbled over the pause commands and had to play with them to figure out  which ones to set having the main character enter a store makes life  frustrating for other lan players the plot doesnt seem multiplayer  friendly you lose all those npcs which are important to the story  the  party is so small the maps dont make a ton of sense group movement can  be really annoying and my number one complaint you cant use arrow keys to  move your character
i know it sounds minor but the view screen is only  large enough to show a few tiles so you have to scroll the screen click a  destination point by which time your guy has already walked there so you  scroll some more repeat  it gets so that you never actually see your  character because youre so busy setting way points for him to walk
at a  minimum if you have to play this carpaltunnel torture of moving your  characters leg by leg you should at least be able to make the screen  center on the character  the little guy just walks off the screen and you  dont know where he went
at a minimum let me see more of the map at one  time  i have a quot monitor and prefer looking at whats happening  rather than the large pretty pictures some artist drewthe plots ok  the dampd system is pretty sophisticated theres some real polish in  places and weve needed a good rpg for a while i loved fallout which had  lousy but still vastly superior map and movement controls so i got the  game the very first day it was released xmas eve and my roommates and i  played it for  weeks but eventually i got so sick of the control scheme  that i just erased the frustrating thingi enjoy rpg games
really i do
but for some reason i couldnt get into this one as much as i thought i could
but ive looked at all the reviews  on this board and most are raving about it
but what im also wondering is  if these very positive reviews are from mostly diehard rpgers andor  dungeon amp dragons fansi personally do not play dampd so im not  a diehard
but i did enjoy diablo everquest might and magic  and age  of wonders so im not against quotdungeoncrawlquotfantasy type games  as you may think i am
i did like the quotpausequot option in baldurs  gate so you can give commands to each of your partys members without  getting thrashed in the meantime but i didnt care for the graphics
but  to some thats minor and forgivable if you like the gameplayi guess i  just didnt
i also prefer faster paced games with a more linear storyline
but if you prefer a nonlinear storyline and sometimes feeling semilost  in a rather large world to explore thats all the more reason for you to  get this gamei also get a tired of too much repitition
every battle i  set my formation up pause issue relatively the same commands and  execute
in everquest i only went up to level  and quit thinking  whats the point
so the combat is repetitive but in baldurs defense it  does have a storyline and an ending unlike everquest
but it is time  consuming
but if you can afford the time and you like rpgs then youll  love this title otherwise spend your gaming money elsewheremaybe it is because i have a mac version but i was really really enjoying this game when my band of characters stopped going up in experience levels
i contacted the company but was told that that is just the way the game is
yes i do like a challenge but i play computer games to relax too and without an advancement in level i dont see how to win this game
i was very very disappointedi bought this game for my  year old son expecting it to be a good one
the graphics are average better graphics can be found with spyro year of the dragon and the levels are very frustrating i found myself throwing the controller away several times trying to help my son get through the levels even though i consider myself a good gamer
i finally recommended my son to play spyro the dragon instead to avoid anymore frustrations
i wont recommend anyone to get this gameokay
this game  if you think this game is good play tony hawks pro skater  and see what you think after that
this game lacks good graphics and doesnt have enough tricks to keep you awake
i mean come on
one lip trick
tony hawks pro skater  has plenty of lip tricks grab tricks flip tricks and specials
plus on pro skater  you have the ability to decide what tricks are performed for which button
if you are a true tony hawk fan dont get this game
it will upset you to muchok by reading the reviews of the people here i can see someone has figured this game out
i bought it not realizing it had missions where you had to do certian thing at certain times
i thought this was going to more of a graphics rich version of dune  or tiberian sunwas i dissapointedit takes forever just to get to play a mission
the mission starts loading up and someone starts talking i guess giving a little story to the mission you are about to play
but i can see that its all loaded up within a few seconds but the person just keeps talking
i cant get it to skip past that so i can go ahead a play
this is very frustrating
in a nutshell i stopped trying to figure it out and went on to buy another game to play
get something else this sucksis it possible for a game to be too realistic
the graphics are excellent and theres a lot of bass to everything
now shall i go into the negative parts
im against the claim that video games cause violence  in the populace but this game nearly changed my opinion
in kingpin its  quotfthisquot and quotfthatquot and quotdont look at my  expletivequot  even casual talk has the fword butting into the  conversation and i was very disgusted with the conversations that my  character engaged in
i returned the game soon after i installed it  because i thought the quotgrittyquot subject matters detracted from the  quotfun factorquot of the game
how can one have fun cussing and  killing other people that cuss back
sure quake and other games are  violent  but not as wanton gratuitous and obscene as this game
i admit  that i like some violence but not even i would defend kingpin from  accusations of youth violence
aside from that bullets leave exit marks  on the opponents but so does the crowbar the levels are very confusing  making you run in circles and objectives are very vague
heed the rather  large warning labels on the box please
this game is definetely not for  kidsand even some grownupsthis game could do alot better than it really did
it takes way to long to build something or to train something
but it has a good storyline where its humans against orcs
i do enjoy watching them battle it out and ending in a gory death
the land isnt detailed enough
what this game lacks is detailsi never could get this game chugging on more than one cylinder
the manual is irrevelant and no outside game helps are published ive looked for more than a year
play the stockmarket 
forget about it   if you are not into the esoterica of steam trains or stupid country music  the computer steals the fun and always has you dead to rights
historical trade and industrial patterns are treated very lightly indeed
i like to able to play the game but i couldnt make it do anythingthis popular title has a lot going for it  good graphics excellent maneuvering and physics and style to boothowever the difficulty is much too high for even heardcore gamers
there seems to be something truly amiss with the makers of the game  despite the negative comments regarding gameplay the games sequel driver  psx is actually harder than the originalin order to make the game playable you either have to apply a patch released by infrogrames or play in cheat mode
then it will become only barely playableunless you can find a cheap copy avoidupdated review march  i was completely wrong about metal gear solid
ive really grown to change my mind about the negative thoughts i once had and now i think metal gear solid deserves  stars  to be exact
i especially grew to appreciate the main purpose of the game which is as many have already mentioned being encouraged to avoid the guards that appear on your radar
the idea of the game is to find ways to avoid enemies not just go in and attempt to either shoot or break their necks
no wonder i originally gave the game a low rating
i went in expecting to kill everything that walked in my way
the gameplay is a radically different approach from anything ive ever experienced beforei originally said metal gear solid was one of those games i respect more than i enjoy
i said this because so much thought and energy went into the storyline and voice acting that i felt the game deserved to be respected and konami deserved credit for making ithowever playing the game today for the first time in months i dont know what happened
when i hit the triangle button to put myself in firstperson mode and looked across the hallway to see if a guard happened to be standing there or walking towards me i got caught up in the excitement and the quiet atmosphere of trying to find a way around him
it was addicting
i finally figured out how to break their necks and that was a lot of fun too
the boss fights are actually the very best thing about metal gear solid
every single one of them is fun not to mention they all require you to figure out the best way to defeat them using your rather large selection of guns and figuring out which gun is the correct one
i love fighting that ninja without using weapons and hearing him speak between the action segments
hearing enemies talk while youre fighting them makes you want to kick their butts even morei also love when everything is nice and quiet and then you accidentally walk right by a guard
when this happens a loud sound effect comes in that gives off a feeling of oops my bad
because now the guard is chasing you around
you now have to run for your life
i didnt realize last year that this is actually a lot of fun
this is a really good game
im sorry for saying it was average last year
sometimes i need to actually play a game before speaking my mindmetal gear solid is the revolutionary playstation game that showed the world a new lifelike way to play video games in the late s
the influence this game had on the future of video gaming is simply astounding
metal gear solid showed how you can take stealth fighting and wrap a gigantic memorable story around it
while im not a big fan of lengthy twists and turns in video game storylines i will give konami a lot of respect for putting an incredible amount of time and effort into the game and in the process having the metal gear solid series continue to do well on the playstation  and soon playstation i especially like the quiet atmosphere while you try finding ways to walk around guards
it comes off like youre watching a movie instead of playing a video game or to put it another way youre playing a movie
not many people can create an atmosphere quite like this
good job konamisometimes the guards arent as intelligent as youd like them to be you can actually walk into an elevator and they will walk right by without noticing you and apparently none of them can see you if youre standing only a couple feet away but you know these problems are actually pretty nice because it allows gamers to finish metal gear solid without any major difficulty problems
i can only imagine how hard the game would be if guards were extremely observant all the timei still have a problem with the overall darkness of the game though
more often than not an important health or ammo pack is located in a hidden dark area like near a corner behind a crate or somewhere you cant see
its really not a big deal though
just remind yourself to always check every dark area you come across
if youre still having trouble finding items just press the triangle button to put yourself in firstperson mode and hit the left or right buttons on the directional pad to scan around
this works really well
in fact the whole firstperson camera angle was a great idea from konamieven though  minutes of cutscenes and conversations isnt really my thing at least you are given the option to skip through them if you want by pressing any one of the four main buttons plus the start button
i hate when game companies force you to watch them
i dont think the storyline is bad in any shape or form
its actually decent
you see my whole life ive had a belief that a video game should be more about actually playing a game and less time should be devoted to storyline segments ill make an exception for rpgs
the storyline in metal gear solid is so big and lengthy that if you were to sit there and listen to the whole thing you would be sitting there for hours
honestly metal gear solid focuses more on storyline than actual gameplaywith changing times and technology people began to prefer the realistic aspects of video gaming
metal gear solid will go down as one of the originatorsi do have one complaint there doesnt seem to be an option for you to lockon to your target so you are forced to find and face the target
for example if a guard is located southeast of you you have to actually use the directional pad to face southeast and then you can shoot him
you have to face him directly or hell continue shooting at you until youre dead
this can be a pain because turning correctly is a bit of a challenge
this could have been fixed with one simple lockon nearest target featuresure you have guns that can zoom in on a target but to use these guns you have to get into a special position which changes the angle of the camera
by the time you get into that position the guard will have already killed you because it takes a few seconds to get into that position and believe me you dont have a second to waste once a guard spots you
i want a gun that features a quick lockon target such as a gun with high amounts of firepower and frequentlyavailable ammo packs
that way it wont feel hopeless when a million guards are after mebesides a bit of overall darkness a lengthy storyline and sometimes unfair situations regarding aiming and shooting i have no other problems with the game
these are really minor problems and its easy for me to look past them
a game that i should have given more attention to before attempting to give a final verdict
metal gear solid is a classic game
it just took me a while to see thatthis game is fun to play but the graphics are terrible
the terrain is green with some very sparsely placed trees and signs
it is fun to beat down other racers with pipe chain hammer etc but the bikes are nearly impossible to control at full speed
the expansion pack for the n is the biggest waste of money ive ever spent
it does nothing to help the graphics or sound quality
multiplayer saves it from the graveyardi saw this game rented it from the store and brought it home
it took me an hour to beat the game  and the graphics were awful
they were pointed all over and looked worse than lara croft from tomb raider i i would not reccomend buying this game enless youre a first time gamer or under  years old
rent dont buy if youre olderi could not get far in this because of some bugs and problems
not sure if its because it is an older type game but i just could not get into it to figure out how to get it to work
may work on older operating systems like windows  or windows xp with the program compatibility settings but windows  and  wont run it
as for gameplay it was not on the high list of mine the little that i did get to work around and try
just my personal tastes but fps games are not that great to meall you really do in this game is look around springfield and run into the occasional character
i finished the entire thing in less than  hours
plus it is not very vivid or deep
you can only visit  classrooms in the springfield elementary school there is only  angle of moes bar etc
all you really do is look at these locations that we are already familiar with and have the tiniest little bit of interaction with them
plus the geography of springfield in this game is not the same as the tv show
which is also inconsistent in its placing of many sets
moes bar has been in many different places for example
but then again in the garbageman episode the town was moved to another site
perhaps this is where it got all shuffled upthere are a few little and i mean little games included
one of the main games is to simply find hidden baseball cards
a ploy to trick into clicking on the screen and revealing slight animationin total there is just under  minutes worth of animation here and it is cool that the original cast provided the voices
but unless you are a die hard simpsons fan then i would leave this game be
definitely only for younger kidsthe playability on this pc version is terrible
the controls dont work like they should
even with my p and enhanced sound the soundtrack and voices lag and stammer
the puzzles are annoying and outdated
the layout of the route you follow is redundent
the game is tedious and slow
the plot and dialogue are corny
this is like a game from the s thats been updated with  graphics
i think youre better off with quake  or enclavei remember when i played the demo for this game
it was brilliant  you could stealth around you had to be startegic and the atmosphere  times as tense as any other game ever
you had to loot a mansion and you could pick up some jewels for yourself as well
you had to avoid making a comotion
the use of sound and light or lack of them was excellent as well
it was one of the best levels of any game i had ever playedi got my hands on the full version and rushed through the first level eagar to see what theivery lay ahead
when i started playing the second level i found myself making my way through a haunted mine where i had to avoid zombies kill spiders and eventually free someone from a prison
the whole thieving aspect had been taken away and not only had degenerated into a standard cliched fantasy hack n slash affair it was a bad hack n slash affair
the next  or  levels were the same
yes you had to be stealthy but not in the same context
i never played on  i had no motivation tothis could have been one of the best games ever but in attempting to appeal to the mainstream lets face it the thievery aspect wouldnt have sold well on consoles they messed it up and they didnt even do the quotitsbeendonebeforequot bit well
at least if it was done well it could have offered some shortterm enjoyment albeit forgetable so that i wouldnt have completely wasted my money but as it is it was a missed oportunity
doesnt even deserve the tag quotthiefquot most of the timethis game is unexplicably fun it drives you insane when your character dies it makes you go into tears when you acquire your spells
this game is evilfirst off you do one thing kill kill and kill
sure there are quests and of course tradeskills but those two things are only possible by killing and get boring and pointless
so then you just end up killing everything you keep going and going until it sucks your brain dry
dont buy this gameok bottom line this game starts out fun and addictive ok that said and done i wanna tell you how it really is
everquest is just what it says a quest that just keeps going and going now i know this may sound fun at  first but keep reading
after playing my character to lvl takes  forever    months i finally realised that the game is not changing it  never gets harder its always the same every enviroment is modeled after  another only changed a bit the monsters are uninspired and it takes  forever to get up lvls as you can see abovefor those of you who dont  know a lvl is what you gain after getting enough experiancewhich is what  you get when you kill a monster to surpase a limit which gains you a lvl  and makes you better at fighting monsters
the monsters have terrible  aiartificial inteligence they wander about the world until you or someone  comes into view then they attack you
there is no ai in this game a lvl   orc pawn will attack a lvl  warrior
how stupid is that
does the pawn  give any consideration to your supiriority
no it is simply programed to  attack whatever comes into view
the only thing that gets harder about eq  as you go along is how long it takes to get lvls
it can take you as much  as  months to a year before you get up to lvl the highest lvl you can  obtain
another thing is the price which all online rpgs charge you pay     to buy the game at the store but it doesnt stop there you have  to pay  a month to continue playing
now if you have to pay  a  month why do they make you pay  to buy the game
they should make it   to buy the game and they should lower the price of the monthly cost as  the game gets old but they dont so youll end up paying a ridiculous  price for everything and in the end realise it wasnt worth it
on the  plus side you get one month of play time free when you start to consider  whether you want the game or not
also the sound effects are pretty goodits made out to be a kung fumeets super space intelligence meets d and d type stuff kinda vidits just dark and not nearly exiting as all thattheres zero martial artsthe enemies are monsters not space ageits very hard to see what youre fightingits extremely easy to beatme and the ol lady took it out in a weekendi decided to reevaluate daikatana and i found i very ambitious game with a lot of features and some crazy ai
yes this was a much overhyped game when it was released and it did have a lot of bugs in it but what pc games released nowadys dont have any bugs that require a patchthere is plenty of action in daikatana and a variety a weapons
some nice levels but it all could have been betterok the good things about daikatana
if you can make it to the greek levels and the norway levels youll be treated to some of the most stunning level designs ever in a game
the greek levels in particular are quite stunning almost beautiful
plus the weapons in these levels are definately different from your standard fps fare
in fact the daikatana itself becomes the most powerful weapon in the game if you get it up in levels
daikatana really tried to be different
there are a number of rpg elements in the game and this was a welcome change in the fps realm
john romero really had a great idea in mind for this game and ill give him credit therenow the bad things about daikatana
the much talked about sidekick ai
yes even i ran into this problem right away
there is a patch available that does make a difference
i suggest to download it after you install daikatana
the first episode is just frustratingly bad
there is some truly garish level designs here as well in the final episode  in san francisco
also i set this game on normal mode and it is so hard
even in easy mode i died almost immediatly in the beginning of the game
this a bad thing in fps games
the first few levels should be a cakewalk to build up your confidence to continue on
but not daikatana
it is tough from the get go even on easy mode
this game took  years to make and it was overhypedeven after the fact this game should have been better
if you are curious enough to buy daikatana get the prima games strategy book
youll need itok this game was meant to be out  and a half years ago but what ever way you look at it even if it had came out when it did it would still have struggled to be competitive back thenwhat the creators have tried to  do is take a new approach by putting  games together in one through the  different ages played by the lead character
all of them are as bad as one  another
it plays like doom did and the ai is possibly the worst ever in  an age when ai is as good as theif and ss
i think pong had more  intelligent coding then daikatana
unlike games where you injure someone  and he runs to find his mate
shoot a baddy in daikatana and his mate will  stand lifelifeless next to him watching the world go byi was hugehly  dissopointed as i thought this would be a rival to half life and would  easily be the best first person shooter of the year to which soldier of  fortune holds the crown so far for me
this game rivals doom but i think  youll find doom is  times better
still it gets a star for the  ages  idea and em a star for the logo and nice boxi cant wait til duke  nukem forever if its as bad as this ill cryits technically competent and indeed competent is a good word
its  just very very uninspiring and after a seemingly endless and tortuous  wait the release was held back for three years during which time many of  the creators left the company its a disappointment
not a huge one as  people were beginning to suspect that it might not be very good
whilst  halflife had the advantage of suddenly appearing from nowhere  daikatanas gestation was extremely public despite the itll be ready  when its ready attitude
whats it like though
dull
thats what
whilst by no means as lacklustre as blood  its infected with an air of  carelessness
the graphics and sound are functional the gameplay is no  more advanced or entertaining than quake  the character ai and voice  acting are both simplistic and irritating your sidekicks are infuriatingly  stupid and their death instantly loses you the game and crucially both  halflife and soldier of fortune are much much better and cheapercome now who here really thinks they put some time into designing this  game
the games story is as horrible as it is clicheacute and is being voice  acted by people that sound too much like a student film class working on a  midterm projectcombat consistis of clicking your mouse button in timed  bursts or uning an asinine keybord interface to swing your weapon in three  different strengths
wheemagic spell creation is novel but quickly  become tedious and dangerous in the middle of combat when youre trying  like a madman or madwoman to heal yourself but cant get the runes  linedup in timeand even the graphics which are nice are loaded with  bugs
in most cases whenever an enemy would drop an item the background  would spring holes of black space around it and cause nemerous graphic  flaws until it would finally crash without explination
furthermore some  enemies would become stuck in some void on your screen preventing you  from being able to attack itoverall a terrible clone attempt at diablo  that should make eidos ashamedand lets not even bring up dikatana  okaycool concept and neat setting arent enough to make this worth a purchase
it was rushed out the door like no ones business and thus suffers from astounding slow down at time making the game unplayable and thus broken
this game was so rushed they didnt even have time to put music any music in the game at all
this would have been a must have for dreamcast if it was given proper time but deadlines cut the guts out of this oneits sad
i always liked the might and magic mm series
it was fairly simple but the builtin journaling and mapping tools made it less of a pain than other rpgs
unfortunately mm seems to be frozen in time and this version doesnt appear to have any changes from previous one
there is a new storyline or more precisely a new variation of a might and magic storyline but graphics sound monsters spells skills and interface at all the same
i couldnt get the game run with directx under windows  software mode only although the game is listed as ntcompatible
keyboard shortcuts would stop working and occasional clipping problems got me stuck and forced a reload to get out
the sound is what really drove me crazy
the character voices can be cut off but not the npcs
ill have have a pleasant evening
ringing in my head for yearsfor diehard might and magic fanboys onlyim a huge fan of the tr series and i like the movies  as well
tr and tr were the best in terms of story pacing and action
the cg sequences were cooler too
i hate to say it but im disappointed in this game
too slow
the levels go on forever and theres nothing to keep your interest
ocassionally you will have a ninja jump out at you or some scorpians but thats not enough to keep you interestedthe other problems is the levels require too much backtracking and are too complicated
i got stuck numerously and ending up getting a code off the internet to skip levels
the beginning of the game shows promise with young lara and there is a very cool level where lara has to manuver a jeep in the desert and over cliffs and whatnoti dont know what i can recommend instead of this one but i would say rent it or get it for cheap like  or less used or new
she tomb raids for too long with little payoffi like most who have played this game am a huge fan of the tomb raider series
i especially enjoy the puzzle solving of the first game and the actionadventure element and increased pace of the second one
this series starts off promisingly enough
outside of a mandatory groan training level the game eases you into the triedandtrue tomb raider gameplay we all have grown to love
the environments are large and exciting the puzzles clever
exploration is fun and rewarding and progress is logical
for the first  or  hours
the challenge level really picks up after the very neat train level and in fact starts to become downright maddening
do we really have to backtrack for  hours just to find  scattered items required to make it through to the next level
things get flatout obnoxious at the chambers of tulun and the trenches
this area goes something like this rope swing to hit a switch that unlocks an invincible guy in a room
go to the citadel gate level to obtain a nitrous oxide canister
return to the chambers and go to the trenches
obtain the nitrous oxide feeder
return to the chambers of tulun to obtain the roof key
go back to the trenches to get to the street bazaar
get the car jack and mine detonator so you can get back to the trenches
and so on and so on and so on
is this mad jumble of item dispersion that is being passed for level design really necessary
i really enjoy the high challenge level of the tomb raider series but this is ridiculous
if i didnt have a strategy guide with me i wouldnt have made it to the citadel which is where i am right now
this game is loads of fun for about  or  levels afterwards it becomes a chore to play
the graphics and presentation have not been improved drastically since the first tomb raider and the legendary level design has regressed considerably
many spots feel cheap rather than challenging
control while still functional still isnt perfect and it causes every jump to be deliberate and nervewracking
if you miss and survive then you have to make another series of jumps which can take another  minutes just to get back to where you originally were
i could go on and on but this game is just too much
get this only if youre a diehard tr fan but be prepared to fork out some extra cash for a strategy guidei am totally at a loss for this game
on one hand it has so many original ideas in terms of both plot and gameplay and has the closest thing to a sim dating game well probably ever see but the way you actually play it leaves me at a loss for words
its not that the battle system makes no sense or is bad even its the leveling up that confuses me
you dont get stronger when you level up
your defense gets weaker when you level up
you get more health but you seem to loose more health at the same token too
im am at a loss that the creaters of this game could make so many good ideas and make them so poor because they cant figure out commen sense when it comes to leveling upif you want an rpg thats original get thisjust dont exspect to get anywhere with itwell i bought this mainly cause i always liked the soundtrack from it and i thought it was cool that u could just slap it right into a cd player and listen to it
like tomb raider  loaded etc well with the greatest hits version thats not possible
not only is that not possible but it has a totally different soundtrack on it
i used psxmc to listen to it
so never really liked the game because of the d style gameplay definitely dont like it now since they change the soundtrack and stuff on it
greatest hits disk suxs
it did come with all the manuals case etcthis game looks like it was made in  minutes
it has horrible graphics and barley any improvments from the first grand theft auto
if you like this type of freeforall shootem up pick up the amazing gta  my alltime favorite for the psi dont want to diss anyone who likes this game but i cant really see much good in this game
the graphics are not really anything speical
it seems almost impossible to see the enemy and you find your self being shot and you cant see the enemy until youve had a major loss of life
the control is rather overly complicated and isnt exactly user freindly
the sound is okay but it seems to make you a little tence
the game is near impossible even on easy difficultys
i have owned the game for quite a long time and still havent beaten the first level by myself
the missons seem a bit vague and you think quotokay what the heck do i do nowquot too often
when i play this i cant help but get frustrated and it always feels like the games fault  even if you are in to army stuff you might want to rent this first
if this is your kind of thing i recomend medal of honor underground or syphon filteri love war type games and when my brother bought this i thought it was going to be great
i guess i was expecting a bit much maybe a lot much
the games graphics are putrid
awful sounds and weak gameplay
no good plots either
enemies have the strangest ability of shooting through trees and small hills at you but you cant shoot them
it took two days to finish it
it was the worst i have playedthe upside  
wait what upsidethe downside  about everything
if you are thinking of buying the game do yourself a favor and rent it first
you might just kick yourself about it lateri played this game years ago but i never got to where i am right now
im at the part where you should float on top of the pipes to get to zephons lair and one thing is that there is almost no way to get past that part if youre lucky you will make it the first time if not you will be trying over  times nothingthis game can also be frustrating as in difficulty you can get lost very easily
i just do not recommend this game unless you love to deal with bugs
avoid at all costsin rainbow six you assemble a highly skilled team of anti terrorist commandos plan out your assault and then control one or more of the team as you commence your invasionthe critical item to note here is that the majority of the game is spent choosing your team equiping them properly and then planning out the raid
this is not syphon filter where you jump into a room of bad guys and blaze away
you can be killed in a single shot
once the action begins you can play any one of the raid team that is engaging the enemy otherwise the sophisticated computer ai will guide them according to your plansi agree with the reviews that suggest that you rent this game first
it is very detailed and realistic
if you dont want to spend hours analyzing and preparing the missions then you wontt appreciate the games considerable depthi find that the detail level does not lend itself well to the standard dreamcast controller
there are too many things to do and the interface layout is awkward without a keyboard and mouse
i also found that the action part of the game moving the aiming cursor was overly sensitive and very frustrating to usethe other reason that this game does not rate highly for me was the poor boxey graphics and the medicore sound
they just do not take advantage of the dreamcast capabilities
on the otherhand the game does have a lot of replay value and very sophisticated aii thought the game was dull
it wasnt even scary
the storyline was weak and really didnt have a point to it
the playing screen was also small but the graphics were good
it needs more excitement and adventure
overall i was disapointedi really cant believe that this game has received four stars from amazon reviewersi had high expectations of this game because of the many positive reviews and the cheap price
the expectations where totally deflated when i realized how small the actually screen display was while playing the game
ive never had to deal with such an annoying small display ever in my pc gaming experience
along with the poor dialogue and story the opening was even worse
every time you restart the game after quitting you are taken to the beginning screen when you should be taken to the loadsave option
i admit this is a small detail to dislike but none the less it is unacceptable for an adventure gamesome puzzles were very difficult to solve
i had to replay the s scene many times just to get my idiotic character to say one particular line just so i could move the radio dial to enter a room which would enable me to finally finish the scenario in one minutethe somewhat creepy sounds and music and the fact that it deals with the paranormal are the only reasons why i rate this game with two starsafter the hated mortal kombat annihilation which i can have fun with its a guilty pleasure  it follows the  mortal kombat  storyline to a small extent they changed too much made characters like jade in name only  added fan fiction
now movies based on video games about all of them just suc k ok a movie  wont hurt the games but you had other stuff going on like the cartoon on usa network defenders of the relm that doesnt hold its not even a guilty pleasure
i remember they had conquest which that was garbage i cant even remember it
what about the games well mortal kombat  did good in the arcades  was released on n  ps in summer  it really didnt do the business that midway or the mortal kombat team wanted
john tobias who was the writer for the mortal kombat games around  wanted to do these character driven adventure games which means prequels which im sorry i dont like prequels
i didnt like these adventure games i havent ever played monks or whatever although ive heard good things about it
in  mortal kombat mytholgies was released  its a giant clunker bad controlls couldnt make your jumps you couldnt pull off your moves just an extremely bad game
mortal kombat special forces was released in  john tobias wasnt happy where the franchise was going i guess ed boon wanted mortal kombat to get with the times
john tobias wanted to make his adventure games he left right in the middle of production of this game
john tobias took part of the mk team with him
ed boon went ahead rushed it got john vogel to write the rest  what we got was a terrible train wreck mess of game
it deals with jax  sonya who are after kano
im going off of memory when i played this game like  or  years ago
you play as jax  well you get terrible controlls you cant turn around when your getting attacked from behind so you get pwnd
i remember you had solve password to get in buildings  i could never get them to work thats all i remember oh  my as  s  got burned to he  ll by a boss
i didnt complete this game it was that awful
thats what all i can  remember if anybody out there wants to send me this game as gift thats fine i can give a better review but i wouldnt play it right away
but mortal kombat gets back on track when evil comes in oh wowi remember playing this colossal flaming pile of turd
a friend of mine rented this game from blockbuster for a couple of days
and i wished we both could have taken back the time we wastedthey had great ideas for this game you take sub zero from the mortal kombat series use this opportunity to tell people more about his back story and his battle against monks set it in cool locales and incorporate mk inspired game play and controls in an action adventure side scroller with light rpg influences
what could possibly go wrong
how abouteverything in this gamefirst off sub zero walks and controls like a robot
second this game uses every button on the controller you even have a separate button to hit when you want him to face the direction to walk
third you unlock his special moves as you progress through the game and while many use the same directional pad  button combinations in mortal kombat they are  times harder to pull off
the bosses are petty damn hard so expect to die a lot
the graphics and sound do their job in setting the mood for the game while the music is standard mk and kung fu inspired theatrical sounding
the ps version features full motion cutscenes between the stages you fight in while the n gets the standard static artworki give it two stars for the cool music and graphics for its time
but that alone will not make a great game
you may be tempted to pick this up if you love mortal kombat and the price is right
dont do it
this is an example of how midway had great ideas for this game but executed these great ideas very poorlyi admit i did put hours into this game being the hugh mortal kombat fan that i am
gosh im sure happy this embarrassing mk game didnt ruin subzeros career
it is a side scroller in which you are faced with many evil monks oh and theyre all twins for some reasonsubzero has many powerups that prove useless
the megasized bosses are boring to fight oh and they never die for some reason
due to the fact that the game supplies no level maps how generic a strategy guide would be a must that is if you cared to bother with the game in the first place
two good things did come about from this mk disaster quan chi  shinnok
for mortal kombat that is a must see mk or the new mk deadly alliance
leave this one in the past where it never should have spawned
  stars is as high as i could go
im generousfor those of you who dont know you play the game as one of three towering monsters a werewolf giant lizard or giant ape and the point is to destroy cities across the world
sure the original arcade game is a classic with lots of punching and smashing to offer however this game world tour does not have much to offer in terms of fun
its fun for about the first five or ten minutes beating smashing punching and kicking then the reality sets in that this is a tedious game
there are over  cities and each city is not just a screen its a side scrolling level
it wouldnt be so bad if the enemies were not horrendous
its not just ten enemies on a screen at once its about thirty to fifty at some points shooting bombing flame throwing flying and stomping you
the entire game despite being  cities can be defeated in a single day but does have a save feature with the memory packs
there is a nice plus though lots of moves to learn and master lots of detail each city looks unique and features landmarks of that city and it is very educational for children to learn geographical locations
dont pay more than ten bucks for this game thoughi purchased this awful gameboy game  years hoping it would be as good as its predecessorbut no such luckmk doesnt have a link cable optionlike its  predecessors beforenor does it have any sgb enhancementsbordercolorsoundthough it incorporates the same digitize graphics and sound as gameboys thqs super return of the jediwhich  suckedneverthelesspick up mk insteadto start off this review let me tell you that i bought mortal kombat  for the game boy before  it had lousy ai good graphics bland music semiunresponsive controls and  difficulty modes novice warrior and master
but it was good enough to get  starswhat i found to be strange was that mortal kombat  on the game boy had several similarities to  the only differences are different characters and setting badder music and the controls a bit more unresponsive
everything else seems to be the same
its not like its a direct sequel is it
i mean the megaman series always had the same gameplay sequel after sequel
but i dont recall mortal kombat series having the almost exact same thingsthe graphics are good
the characters are digitized like how they were in the previous gamesthe gameplay however can be unresponsivelike all other game boy mortal kombats this game would be short
you only get to fight  characters in master mode  in warrior and  in novicethe best attack to use is just kicking
thats kinda sad
usually the uppercut would be the best standard attack to use but no
instead its kickinghowever even after all this it would manage to have some appealoverall its alright but if you want a great mortal kombat game for the game boy buy mk insteadwow this sucks pretty bad i liked mk on gameboy and thought if anything this would be an impove ment
i was wrong everything moves god awful slow and moves are so easy to do
i thought nintendo would have not edited this game unlike the first  mk games and put some blood in it even had an m rating  but once again i was wrong
no blood no guts isnt that what set mk apart form most fighting games
the graphics aint bad and neither is the music but the gameplay ruins all that in a heart beat
dontt even bothermortal kombat  is the first d game of the series
despite that the game boy version is still dthe graphics are good
the characters are digitized like how they were in the previous gamesthe gameplay however can be unresponsivelike all other game boy mortal kombats this game would be short
you only get to fight  characters in master mode  in warrior and  in novicethe best attack to use is just kicking
thats kinda sad
usually the uppercut would be the best standard attack to use but no
instead its kickingthe enemy ai is way too easy to beat
i got through master mode without any trouble
granted they can attack almost decently but just throw  kicks and then its possible heshed die
it can be glitchy when it comes to fighting scorpion and shinnok
you can still attack them even while they use their get over here attacks on you
it doesnt look like you are but then you see the enemys hp draining
if you attack them by just mashing a repeatedly and kill them you somehow use your fatalityfor some reason i just manage to get addicted to this game
i dont know how but i just ended up like thatthere are a couple special stuff in the game when played on the super game boyspecial and coollooking bit bordercolors change every screen to appropriate colorswhen played on the game boy color the colors make very detailed backgroundsoverall buy mk insteadmortal kombat trilogy was a popular game back in the early days of the playstations existence
even before the playstation mortal kombat was known as a groundbreaking game for its graphic violence on the super nintendo and sega genesis
it was the first of its kind or one of the first
looking back at the old d fighter games despite the heavy amount of blood and all the creative fatalities mortal kombat stinks plain and simple
the game tries to look dangerous and back in the day it really was a threat
parents were terrified that their children might experience all the blood and gorewere talking nearly  years since the original mortal kombats release and now we can look at the mortal kombat series for what it really is a cheesylooking and crappy series of uninteresting tournament fighting
thats what the entire series is until the game turned d then i dont know what to think
just the way the two fighters attack each other is so boring
even the best fighters like subzero and noob saibot are a total boremidway thought they really had something going when they created mortal kombat trilogy
it featured nearly everybody from the previous mortal kombat games
how can it be bad
well besides the reasons i mention above the playstation version is murdered with incredible amounts of loading times
people can say the playstation was a bad system when it came to loading all they want but the fact remains mortal kombat trilogy is quite possibly the most annoying game when it comes to waiting to play the freaking thing
sometimes you have to wait almost a minute before the game finally loads the fight screen
and the fighting is so bad because the entire mortal kombat series up until this point is severely dated and horrible that the loading times are actually the part i look forward to the mostill give the game one extra point for featuring all the fighters in one nifty little package
besides that
bad gamei dont know how people are rating this game so highly
i am a huge mk fan but this game defines why i try to forget that mk and umk came into existence
this is an absolutely horribly programmed one player game
the computer controlled players anticipate and counter every single move you do even on very easy
you have to pick motaro just to make it to the end and then who had the brilliant idea of giving shao kahn a throwthere goes the one way you could beat him with most players
avalance software must have spent one day configuring the ai for this stinker
then to make matters worse the playstation dpad controls like a tuna boat in a boat race
good luck not breaking your controller as you watch your character get decimated and wonder why the move you tapped in did not work over and over again
then after i finally beat the game with scorpion the machine crashed twice so who knows if he has an ending or notthe only reason i gave it two stars is that with two people you do get an almost arcade perfect mk experience but you still deal with the absolutely ridiculous characters of mk and umk and all its palette swaps
my advice is to turn off aggressor mode as well as all of those cheap auto combos and pretend you are playing mkii with some extra backgroundsfor starters this is an ok gamenothing more
the controls and gameplay suck hard compared to quake and doom the storyline sucks hard compared to quake or doom and the multiplayer sucks hard compared to quake or doom
so go play quake or doom i remember getting hydro thunder when it first came out on sega dreamcast
even when i had bought it new a long time ago i wasnt too impressed
it was okaybut not a stand out in my opinion
it was like if daytona usa which i think is better was transitioned into a water racer
and for a dreamcast game it sure looks visually like the ns typical graphics
the gameplay was simple controllerwise
and gamewise it was simple  repetitive
this is a game youd get more value out of by playing against friends
obviously a fair amount of people would dissagree w my opinions
while others may have similar thoughts on this title
id say get it ifyou find it for only a couple dollarsyour in need of adding games to your dreamcast libraryor you have played it or a game like itand liked itthis is one of  reviews so if you read this i consider myself lucky
alright lets get to it
first off it was a nice idea
finally a game that focused on loving and caring without being sexual and helping your fellow man
however i think that this is all they focused on in production
the game and this is sad for a final fantasy is bad
im sorry but it reeks
squaresoft is running out of orginal ideas and it is showing
although the ideas were innovative
enemies that level up with your characters
never will your characters be gods over an enemy
unless its a boss
for some odd reason boss levels are limited
so a player can beef up their characters all they want and then beat the messout of the boss without worry
the guardian forces while still a nice idea were poorly planned
a gf is like a pokemon in a sick sadistic way
it gains levels with your character and through it your character can gain abilities
problem is gfs can quickly make their host gods very quickly
at level  my main characters strength was through the roof because not only did he have ifirt equipped but all his strength increases too
he could cut down enemies in one blow
while thats nice it takes away from the difficulty of the game
the battle system is a nightmare too
if i have to push buttons to get more damage done then why dont you just program the game to register the extra damage
granted this only applies to squall but it gets very annoying to have to mash buttons to get a characters strength up
i hated it in super mario rpg and i hate it in this game
the gf spells have to be pumped up if you want it to do any serious damage
what happened to watching the nice animations and appreciating the work of the artists who designed them
the story line is my next pet peeve
the strength of an rpg comes from the story not the gameplay
the story in this game is shoddy
picture a writer with the exact opposite abilities of john grisham or micheal crichton
it is that bad
not only do you have to mash buttons in the battles but you have to mash buttons to get past the annoying long dialouge exchanges that seem to be written by a preschooler with help from their friends
it is worse than parasite eve s story
at least they tried
im done with my tirade now
you want the truth this game is not worth price it isnt even worth the rental
go to a friend who owns this poor excuse for a game and play it there or borrow it
for those who saw the charlies angels movie
this is the game the two since when is it two player kids are playing when barrymore pays them a visitfinal fantasy  is the worst of the entire final fantasy seriesas far as game play goes it holds up poorly
getting new items equip is not a part  of the system even though you can get items to upgrade your weapons nothing  gets done about armor
levels were pointless your increase was only a  slight one
the monsters did profit a lot from the levels you gained though  and you would easily be at level  halfway threw the game
the game  doesnt have many characters and the characters within dont have as much  personality is they did in ff
the only minigame within it is a poorly  done card game that gets boring fast
the gf system seems nice at first but  quickly you find out that spending an hour getting the max amount of  something is an easy way to over become powered and takes a lot of time
the only real control over your characters power level is how much patience  you have for getting more spells into your gfsas far as plot goes this  game also hold up poorly to other games
it may start off fine but to avoid  revealing too much im just going to say by the second cd its going in a  bad direction and it doesnt turn around
characters never get as  interesting as they were in ff and when youre on the third cd
i think  you well hit the one plot stop that leaves only the strong of heart to  actually bother finishing this sorry excuse for an rpgthe graphics are  only strong point this game has
they are absolutely beautiful
defiantly  the best ever for when it was made
you may end up summoning gfs you dont  want to summon just to see the pictures they show when summonedand  finally as far as length of time it can stay interesting its a long game  but its only interesting for about  hours into the game
if you need it  its length is one you well need a long time to beatoverall this game  is not worth buying unless you really like pretty pictureslets just get one thing out of the way the battle system in this game is bad
very bad
there are much too many random battles a lot of the time youre quotdrawingquot magic from enemies a horrible idea on squares part it makes no sense and is extremely tedious both to use and equip it to your characters
since the power of your equipped magic is based in the number you have and all of your enemies have an unlimited number of the magics theyre able to carry you spend a lot a whole lot hours of time just hitting that draw button and selecting which magic to get from them
yeah not fun at all
both the equipment and magic systems are bad
the new focus on summoned monsters as equippable characters which level up and gain skills to boost your character such as strength upgrades or upgrades to themselves which boost their damage or hp is really not fun at all since theres zero strategy involved
you just level up and decide which skill theyll learn after enough battles
i easily blew through the first half of this game killing bosses in a ludicrously low number of hits
i couldnt stand the second half it was just more of the same and the story line became very very stupid
a select few will actually like this sappy love story mixed with something about a summoner going to destroy the world and some other junk that i just didnt care about
the love story was actually the best part and the rest felt like a filler
there really isnt anything to praise about this game that separates it from previous final fantasy games
a subpar rpgif not for final fantasy ix switching gears the franchise may have died from this title
ffvii was a pure marvel and still is but viii lacked any good storyline and the characters werent the least bit interesting
its a solid piece if you want to have the entire series lets say pull it out once in a while to hack at it
its hard to stay interested most of the time although it does have some cool cg cutscenes to do it justice mostly its dull repetition and sits as a rushed follow up to ffvii and it shows
fans thank god for ix saving the day x bringing in the nextgeneration and xi xii coming up
so long from the dullsville ffviii calls balaamb
i hope the cadets have retiredim a huge final fantasy guy but for me  is just very close to trash
i tried to play it right when it came out but i couldnt stand it right from the get go so i quit early
i tried to play it again a few years ago and the same exact thing happened
finally a little while ago i forced myself through it
no exaggerationso i started the game for the third time thinking hey maybe it just takes time to catch on
but no i never really became addicted to the gameplay as i usually do in ff games
the only way to get stronger is to find monsters with different spells and steal their spells for your attributes which is fine and all but it got extremely annoying having to do that until you reach  and for each character
it doesnt sound necessary but trust thats the only way to get stronger because as your level goes up so do monster levels so yes theres no point in even leveling up
really stupid in my opinion but its a different type of thing that i think some people actually did like
not me
every other ff was great as they were because they did not deviate the gameplay to this extentfor every thing else the story was a definite plunge from   ff blew everyone away and when this cam out the characters were ok but the story was pretty lame but not too too terrible and the music was forgettable
the environments were about matched with that of  but less enjoyable
so overall this is not a great gamei feel like this game is extremely overrated getting so much positive feed back but for what
my expectations were much higher after being so impressed by   maybe the bar was just set too high
maybe square needed a break
then again there are obviously people who love this style of gameplay which gives them a much more different gaming experience
dont get me wrong its not the worst game ever but its just not the same final fantasy experience everyone lovesso bottom line if youre new to final fantasy and havent played this yet i would say consider a different ff game
but give it a chance if youre not that picky with rpgs
just dont expect muchas you might have heard this game was downright terrible
the only thing that kept me going was the story
in my personal opinion the story is very exceptional and the many months of work they put into it paid off
before starting i would like to comment that i was very excited to get this game after the twoinarow masterpieces final fantasy  and  and for the fact that it was created by squaresoft but i was extremely disappointed after about one hour of gameplay
now onto the reviewstory as you have most likely heard people say that this storyline is based on the theme of love when in many peoples opinion my own included this game is anything but love
the only thing close to love that happens is spoilerrinoa and squall kiss at the endingend spoilerwhich really isnt all that loveable in my opinionsimilar to final fantasy vii the setting is in the future irritating downside as insanely advanced technology is not that fantasylike but this is a mediocre downside of the gamethe story goes pretty much like this an evil sorceress is on the verge of enslavement of the world and a resistance to defeat this woman called garden trains military soldiers called seeds to battle against her and her troops
pretty lame sounding as seed and garden are really actually one of those ideas that a first grader could come up with in about  minutes but the story actually picks up at about disk three yes it is pretty slowsound and music the sound is really quite good in this game
squalls sword slashes when hitting a target quistiss whip cracks when snapping at a target and zells mighty fists make smacking noises when hitting a targetsuch as final fantasy vii the music in here is not that well conceived and memorable such as the earlier final fantasys
the boss music is sort of catchy once again such as final fantasy vii but the rest of the music is rather annoyinggameplay the single thing that totally mauls this game is the gameplay
the battling is terribly tedious and the magic system is completely raped of its glory
instead of learning magic abilities now you waste time quotdrawingquot magic from enemies
another terrible mistake squaresoft made while making this gamea new addition to the gameplay is the guardian forces gf which are pretty much summons just in a stupid term
these guardian forces are pretty much the only thing that will keep you alive in this game as you need them to enhance health strength and so on which i will get to in a moment
the guardian forces are the main attack force and with these forces there is barely any need for the quotattackquot command other than zells duel limit break
the animations for guardian forces are well animated but extremely long and tediouslimit breaks are the only other useful thing in this game but unfortunately they can only be accessed when you are in lifethreatening situation completely aboliting the wellconceived limit break barmenus and puttogethers this is terribly timeconsuming and irritating
the menu is where i spent most of my time on this game
gladly squaresoft got rid of the horrid materia system and added on the godhowcouldthisgetanyworse junction system
this system takes about a half of an hour just to understand and then you spend even more precious hours of your life drawing magic upgrading it so a boss cannot kill you in just one blow
for example you have to spend about an hour drawing  lifes from an enemy just so you can raise your health a couple thousand pointsthen after this boring proccess you must draw  tornados in order to raise your attack power i am almost completely certain this process is required to defeat the final bossthe second complete worst part of this game is the following there is no longer an equip option
what happened to equipping weapons and armor
there is a way to upgrade your weapon but that consumes serious time and involves ridiculous sidequests that are extremely boring
dont even bother going through the stress of completing these questsa ridiculous thing they did in this game is that the characters level up with you so you can finish the game at level  or so as leveling up is not necessary and bosses give you no experience pointsi completed it at level  or graphics the best part of the game the graphics
the fmv scenes are superior to every other graphics i have ever seen in my entire lifespan yes including ps graphics and even during gameplay the graphics are superior during gameplay they are worse than ps graphics i might add and the only flaw in them is the pixelations as the characters look a bit fuzzy
but that problem is solved in ffixyou remember the disgustingly distorted characters in ffvii
well thank god they are replaced with actual humanlike figures that look like humans at last
no more stubby oversized arms and legs with huge heads that remind me of cartoonsthere is only one thing i love about this game and it is the ending
as i said before the story is very good and is the only reason that i gave it  stars instead of  the ending is extremely good not as good as ffvis though and made me feel goodreplay value as many other people have done as soon as i finished wasting my time playing this game and finally destroyed the final boss i took out the disk from my playstation placed it in its case placed in on a shelf behind my other cds and it has not been touched ever since
this game was terrible and i wish i had my  hours of gameplay back
i say instead of even thinking of buying this game look for final fantasy anthology and final fantasy  insteadwhen people play a final fantasy game they expect several things to come out of the finished game
for one thing a great story great charicters cool battle system drama comedy and greatness cool graphics and overall a great game
that said and done final fantasy viii is the worst example of how to make a great rpg
when a great rpg company like squaresoft who been making the best rpgs for years now comes in and makes a game people expect it to be great
esspecally if its a final fantasy game
well let me tell you that final fantasy viii is anyting but a great rpg
in fact this game is so pooryly thought out i am at a loss of words
im sure youve already herd complaints about the complicated battle system cumcumber and glitched plot and lack of charicter developement
so ill spare you the details for once
lets just say final fantasy viii not only gives the final fantasy series a bad name but it also gives rpgs as a whole a bad name
thank you
have a nice dayif you fell in love with final fantasy vii like i did and are so hungry for more that you are considering this game i beg of you dont do it
it is nothing like the aforementioned masterpiece
the story was slow to get going which i was sympathetic to since it was like that in ff vii too but after hours it was still lame
for one thing you have a military ranking and it goes down when you explore the towns
i mean come on the whole point of an rpg is exploring
but that is not the worst part
the magic system has been redone and its horrible
instead of the productofgenius materia system in ff vii they have the draw system
you have to collect magic spells and use them like petty items
this is by far the worst idea everand then there were the characters
after falling under the spell of cloud aeris sephiroth and all the rest i felt like hiding under my blankets and sobbing after meeting squall rinoa and the other lame characters
their dialogue is lifeless and cheesy and i didnt feel attached to them at allalthough its a small complaint i must mention the graphics
the cutscenes are amazing and far better than ff viis but everything else is awful
the blocky toonlike models of ff vii have been tossed out replaced by characters that try to shove in the detail of real humans in tiny little models
the result
stiffly animated bland graphicsoverall do not buy this game
buy tales of symphonia chrono crossanything
please do not waste your money
these are the parting words of a weeping gamer
thank youthis is the worst final fantasy game gameplay wise without a doubt
not only is the learning curve hours but after that you have to spend hours getting magic from the enemies to use and equip
this game graphic wise looks like it has been in work for a lifetime and the fmv looks like ps or dc
the gameplay looks like it was made in a lifetime too and that is a bad thingfinal fantasy  and  are wonderful examples of how an essentially linear game can be manipulated and changed into something epic and enthralling thanks to excellent characterisation and plot
final fantasy  and oddly enough ff  are wonderful examples of how to bore people silly while forcing them to sit through some nicelooking battlesfor those gamers who like me need to like a character in order to fully appreciate the games plot let me say this squall is a moody horrible angstridden phallocrat
his supporting cast are forgettable with the exceptions of the consummately annoying zell dincht and the ridiculously feeble rinoa heartilly
the characters in ff  have none of the appeal of cloud et al from ff  or zidane and the lovable halfbreeds from ff for gamers who dont consider this to be so important ff  still manages to nicely ruin the final fantasy reputation by being one of the most boring and unrewarding games in the series
battles are innumerable and completely random and fall into  categories extremely easy and unfairly difficult
case in point you face seifers two main flunkies early on in the game by which stage your levels are too high to build up quickly on the feeble monsters available in the college amp the surrounding areas and too low to beat these henchmen without massive amounts of luck
the result
you end up running about doing frustrating battle with lowlevel wildebeests for hours and the game becomes very very boringthe graphics are shamefully poorlythought out
the prerendered backdrops for some of the major levels balamb garden edeas house are bland and have none of the charm of the cityscapes of ff  or the magical countryside vistas of ff  the character models are far too complex and look pixellated and rough at almost all angles
polygon popup didnt die out with the sega saturn its alive and well and working for squaresoft
the prerenders however are amazing approaching the quality of early ps  titles in their scale and realismthe sound is runofthemill poor playstation fare but the music is decent enough
better too is the magic system where instead of spending hours confusing yourself with materia you now junction elementals and spells
sadly the game relies less on magic and more on difficult limit break techniques and expensive items so this really isnt a huge plus until late in the gameall in all ff  is a very disappointing game lacking the freedom of exploration of ff  and  its a game on wheels which isnt a bad thing in itself but when the plot and characters are so forgettable it becomes a major problem
steer clearfinal fantasy is and has been for a long time squaresofts flagship product
all the ff products while not having direct connections to each other carry similar quotthemesquot  similarities of gameplay world design and so on that make them clearly final fantasy rather than something elsewith all the time and effort not to mention money expended on them one would i think justifiably expect that the series would generally improve as time went on
unfortunately this is not the casefinal fantasy vii was a reasonably good ff game but it was also the first playstation ff game and had some advantages which were at the time unique to it
it was incumbent upon ffviii to give us something more  something cooler and better
it failedthe overall story isnt that bad  the plot is decent and some of the characters interesting
however our main character is just not generally likeable squall has less interesting personality than cloud strife of ffvii and thats a pretty damning indictment since cloud didnt develop much personality until some way through the game
more importantly gameplay is if anything more of a railroading exercise than ffvii  which given that vii used the metaphor of a railroad from the beginning is a sad state of affairsby now square should have recognized that flexibility of play and so on is a good thing in crpgs
chrono trigger remains popular enough to garner commentary even today due in great part to its multiending design
why the ff series still relies on the idea that you have no real choices and get dragged from fight to fight boggles the mind kewl komputer animation doesnt make up for the fact that they havent added any new game techniques since the nintendo days
oh they have some cute little side games  card collecting and so on  but the story itself isnt even captivating enough
some of the battles can go on long enough to be boring in themselves
oh the animation cutscenes are pretty and some of the music very nice  and the past timeline sequence is sadly more interesting than the main onea disappointing effort from the people who have in past times produced some of the most innovative and interesting gamesi got this game and didnt really play it my brother mostly did and he said is was an awesome game until you get to near the end of the second disc and it freezes at a bossthe only down fall is that you my regret buying the used oneits a good game if it worked properlythis game should marketed as a multiplayer only
the graphics are gorgeous however there is nowhere to explore and nothing to findi only have a k modem  absolutely not fast enough
one has to have a super fast cable modem to play this quotdeathmatchquot game onlinethis was always bound to be a great title the quake name is like a way of printing money
but this time i am just not buying it
i dont have a very high spec pc and quake  just runs like a dog
its a amd k  with  mb of ram and an ati rage magnum with mb my message to people out  there with this spec of pc or below dont bother with q there is a very  good alternative quotunreal tournementquot its a brilliant title that  runs sweet on my machine in x in  bit colours colors
in summery  q great title but you will need an ass kicking specwhy did you do this id
no wait
i understand why but its still no excuse to create a game like this
multiplayer only
ok ok i need to settle down here
first of all i need to explain my situation
i have internet access but not the kind to play this game i have a lowly k modem with a insert appropriate insult here connection
this type of connection is definitely not the best connection even for games that have low data transfer like diablo or ultima
however in my apartment complex we created our own ethernet lan with the main hub in my own apartment perfectly ideal for this type of game
does this mean that i play this game
yes sort of
does that mean that i like it
i wish i couldive rewritten this paragraph four times already
there is no way to express my dislike for this game
simply put players will get separated into two groups
those with the skills to pummel anyone who comes into the arena and those who get pummeled
unfortunately the quotpummelersquot are few and far between
most of the quotpummeledquot will be amateurs theyll buy the game play through a few deaths and erase the game from their hard drive
my lan mysteriously quotemptiesquot out when i offer up a game of q
id blew it with this one
poorly thought out this game serves only the elite few with the grit skill determination and fast connection to play this game
lets hope that id gets a brainstorm and comes up with an actual story line for the next game instead of taking the easy way out like they did with this oneremember im not saying the multiplayer is bad
the multiplayer is awesome
its the lack of the single player that makes this game blow
in fact its the lack of everything else that makes me want to lose my lunchi didnt quite like it for the following reasons when fighting ai acts pretty dumb and is way too easy to defeat
game is waaaaaaaaaaay too  short i finished it in   hours and im not even good with  adventures the game would have been maybe a hit if theyd have put at  least   and in bnest case  to  of those missions the gamed have been  worth its money you dont get the freedom of acting in training on  vulcan nerve pinch when trying to use phaser it doesnt work sames when  you try to use phaser or vulcan nerve pinch on picard or data or sona  while theyre still not against youbut on the plus side heres what  most trekkies will find interesting about the game you get to see  corridors of enterprise and their main engineering
you get to meet  picard data and beverly you get to run around like a mad idiot with a  phaser you get to shoot sona and another race which im not gonna  reveal dont wanna spoil it gor you you get to explore a scifi looking  sona colony you get a chance to promote your ensign sovok to  leitenantim sorry if i spelled it wrong you get to use nerve pinch  but you dont get a chance very often only  times in the  gameoveralltrekkies might like it but as an adventure it stinksalthough a lot of people liked this game i hated it
for one thing this game was waaaayyyyyy too easy i beat this game in three days playing only   hour a day
the first game had me playing for mounths
youre supposed  to find this fairy to give you all your powers back and yet you start the  game with all your powers
plus i dont care how good the graphics are  rayman does not look good in d and does not belong in d
so get the first  game i dont recomend this game to anyonestunning graphics coupled with very clumsy controls make this game a feast for the eyes but a major bust when it comes to engrossing game play
in a  world dominated by such near master works as lucas arts indiana jones and  the infernal machine different is not necessarily better and the third  person perspective nocturne offers is as creepy as the games beautifully  dark images and spine tingling story line
i suppose the object was to  give nocturne a cinematic edge offered by some of hollywoods best  horrorthrillers but cutting from place to place using numerous movie  angels as our gruff but hardly lovable antihero stranger runs through  each scene ground level overhead etc trying to mow down swooping and  snarling creatures of the night simply doesnt work here and would likely  earn any film student a solid d for effort
with one additional option  first person perspective or even second person this might have been a  great game without it nocturne swiftly becomes little more than a tedious  test of your  vision and manual dexterity
bottom line if you can  get it cheap one major home electronics store recently had it on sale for   or can borrow it from a friend check it out for its amazing  cutting edge eye candy
but just like any fine work of art hanging in  some posh museum youll pause to consider nocturnes brilliant textures  along with its use of light and shadow but eventually youll move on to  something much more stimulating and rewarding like an amusement parkbefore i bought this game i downloaded the demo off theinternet and was completely freaked out
i rushed out and purchasedthe game and was completely freaked out by the money i wasted
do you love impossible control options very high system requirements and load times that have you kicking your computer
then you will love nocturne
this game had all the perfect elements to become a great game but it fell short on delivery
however if you love the resident evil genre then this game is for you but i warned you
endthis looked like a promising game and i really enjoyed it  when i could progress through it
it was crashybuggy on wink
i was halfway thru the werewolf town episode and hit a bug that no patch fixed unless i restarted the episode which i was tooupsetto doalso the way to progress is not really that intuitive
i found myself running around an empty castle a lot trying to figure out wth im supposed to do next
by far the worst aspect of this game was the camera angles
as you run down a hall you hit a map trigger that changes your point of view unfortunately you have no idea what view you will get
sometimes you will be looking ahead from behindabove your character other times you will look at your characters face from aheadleft
it is weird and extremely unpleasant as you can switch angles during fights accidentally and get your rearendkickedthe good stuff the graphics are cool not the most impressive nowadays  but still neat
although they arent technically superior anymore they once were i still like the way the game looks because the designers made the graphics so creepy
the art on the walls the dark woods crypts you go through all sorts of cool settingsthe music is creepy too and really helps set the mood
this is actually a scary game to playthe main character is pretty cool
hes the nameless clinteastwood type with the gravelly voiceall in all this game had awesome potential but was poorly executed
much of this could have been avoided by having  more predictable and sane camera angles and  a strategy guide
a lot of times i was stuck for hours and i missed some hidden place or something
with a quick cheat i would have had a lot more fun without feeling too guiltyi hope they come out with a nocturne  that addresses these issues i would really like to see iti got this game last year and i have only just completed it
in a technical sense this is indeed better than the other tr games
but i do feel that it is a victim of its own realisticness
it starts off brilliant and great to play
especialy the moving train effect
but once you get to the city of the dead things go downhill
i mean it gets so dark that even with the monitor on full brightness and the house lights out you still have to lightflares to see whats what
there are also not enough flares to get around with either
sure this would be the situation in real life but in real life you have the advantage of d vision to guide you
not in a game
not only that but the levels get boring towards the end aswell
it seems stupid that game programmers would spend out on hightech graphics and creative innovations and then blanket them with an over abundance of darkness
apart from that though
the sound is brilliant
the movies realy fit in well
lara looks better and if you can see them the graphics are great toowell i wish i could play some of these levels
sometimes thats made impossible because theyre so dark
i wish it would save my game too but it never has
there are patches available for bigger mistakes on their site
i would give anything not to watch those grating cutscenes again and again
the voices are all quite annoying and stilted though you get the sense the eidos guys thought the old man at the beginning might have been  he gets tiresome immediately my child this my child that this is how you jump wait this is how you jump
lara is still a bimbo character and its insulting to both genders a cynical view of the audience i wish she would stop breathing heavily
the controls are difficult
the puzzle elements are still worthwhile though they are a poor mans zelda
the  yearold lara was unnecessary when she gets her backpack were supposed to care
the likelyhood of her and the old man being in these cambodian ruins in the daytime and running through it like a preschool adventure playset is small
they seem to toss old tr elements like climbing vines and throwing levers in all the wrong places these elements are repeated and there seems to be little real joy in all of it like they toss the elements out until the game ends
the level designs are unlogical they detract from the realism that the games used to have and added so much to it
thats why you are bothered when you die from a giant spinning spike wheel that magically floats not because its hard but because you just dont believe things like that are there its as though the game breaks its own rules
i feel like the levels could all have gone a lot further if they just did some heavy internet research on the areas available to play egypt has stars and spikes
overall i feel this game was well worth my money but the series needs to improve or it will surely die
undoubtedly the first two tr games were the best they need to return to that these new games feel like acommercial spectacle
what i enjoy most about the series is the realism that there can sometimes be and the puzzles but mostly the scenery and locales the action is just the backdrop to me
buy the first  games before thinking about getting thistomb raider the last revelation is the fourth lara croft adventure game based entirely in egypt
a very long and challenging game built on a nice engine with great graphics neat animations and neat sound effects
good storyline and great gameplay with infinite saves
awesome lighting effects and a creepy atmosphere
great puzzles but a lot of annoying false paths
very challenging gameplay but can be too challenging at times because no difficuly option
good level design with a helpfull training level but the hub level layout is very confusing and easy to get lost
a lot of fun doing all the jumping but the controls are as usual very badly done auto aim is not perfect and the manual aiming is impossible
enemy ai is super dumb
tomb raider last revelation well deserves  stars but i will give it only  because it does not have good key controls and a difficulty optionpharaoh is a city building game like simcity but set in egypt during the predynastic period
you start by building a settlement addressing basic needs and continue onward
unlike simcity there are various goals to hit such as population goalsas the game progresses it gets harderunfortunately i found myself building and managing the population but having to check the deities almost constantly
unless you hold regular festivals constantly build shrines the gods will grow angry and exact revenge on your civilization
i found it to be more tedious than funwhen diablo ii came out i bought it immediately expecting it would be at least as fun as the first possibly more funi got bored of the game easily
the thing i really didnt like was certain enemys that just run  away
you have to chase them for what seems like an eternity till you  finally catch them and slaughter them and if you decide to just let them  run away theyll continuously come back to haunt you
then to make things  worse the game doesnt save what youve killed so if you decide your done  playing for the day the next time you play all the runners will be back
these enemys are called flayers and when i first encountered them i got  bored of fighting them over and over and discontinued my gameply and moved  to a different gameanother thing i didnt like is running
not that  running is bad in fact i love the fact that you can move faster the  problem with it is that the background trees grass etc
really bothered  my eyes with it scrolling past so quickly
that is not as big a deal as the  runaway enemys howeverif you like to chase endless hords of enemys  then the game is for you
if not dont bother with itlets get one thing clear diablo ii is nowhere near as good as diablo  there are more reasons for this than i can remember but ill try to list as many of them as possiblefirst off theres no way to save your progress through the game
all that you can do is save your character
when you reload the game all of the bad guys are back
this gets extremely aggravatingsecond theres just too much stuff
remember in diablo  where there were a dozen kinds of swords and like a hundred different kinds of armor not counting the two billion magical prefixes and suffixes and all of the unique items
well thats ten times as bad in d
theres twice as many different categories of items belts
what the
 and there are twice as many items in each category
it doesnt stop there either it is now possible for nonmagic items to have prefixes as well and many of those prefixes mean the same freaking thing
a belt can be poorly made low quality slightly lower quality chipped cracked rusty damaged even more damaged blah blah blah blah blah umpteen et cetera and it contributes absolutely jack freaking squat to gameplay
diablo  had  different potion strengths partial and full and that was all you needed but d saw fit to create five different potion strengths
you get the ideathird the outdoor areas are waay too freaking big
even with automap turned on its impossible to tell whether or not youve explored an outdoor area fullyfourth the new spellcasting system just doesnt make the slightest bit of sense
a barbarian at a given level will have just as many magical abilities and be just as good at casting them as a sorceress on the same level
and how are these magical abilities acquired
does your character learn spells by reading spellbooks like in diablo 
no they learn spells by killing things
yup you just go out and kill monsters and you suddenly know how to cast fireballs
what the heck kind of sense does that make
fifth character classes have no maximum stats
this severely weakens the distinctions between the character classes and for those hackers out there it makes it impossible to have a maxedout charactersixth theres too much stuff
i know ive mentioned this before but its just wrong that you could pick up every item in the whole game and still only see a tenth of all the different combinations of nonmagical itemsseventh theres no more apocalypse spell
apocalypse was a cool spell that should not have been removedd does have a few good ideas though
gems are very cool but the fact that they come in five or six different quality levels plus the fact that items can have widely varying numbers of sockets for them only worsens the too much stuff problem
the horadric cube is an awesome idea because it allows you to do really fun things
you put random things into it and if youre lucky theyll combine into something new
you can take  gems of a given type and quality and the cube will compress them into one gem of the next highest quality
combine  packs of crossbow bolts to get one pack of arrows or  packs of arrows for one pack of bolts
no one but blizzard knows all of the possibilities
i also love the addition of set items or in other words unique items that power each other up as you find more from each set
unfortunately it is for all practical purposes impossible to find all of the items in any one set leading to hours upon hours of frustrated searching
lets see i mentioned gems the horadric cube set items were there any other positive additions to d
i cant remember any morediablo  can be fun and playable in its own way but compared to diablo  its just horrible
there were too many bad ideas and too many good ideas that were badly implemented
dont play this game unless youve gotten bored with diablo besides having all the system requirements necessary and still not being able to run the game my biggest problem with it is not being able to save  the game state
this completely ruins it for meand probably for anyone  else interested in the singleplayer aspect
it is truly awful to have to  go back somewhere to get items that were perhaps left behind only to have  to fight everything that you already killed once all over again
sadly  this ruins the game and storyline for me
i know other folks who arent  bothered by this at all however
for me though its just a terrible way  to have released the game
i honestly think that they shouldve kept that  save feature in the game even if it meant releasing the game laterthe game has many flaws in it making it almost unplayable
the most notable is the anticopy feature on the cds themselves making it impossible for some cd and dvd drives to read
at present blizzard has no  plans to fix this feature
also the graphics and lag time in both online  and single play are bad
in order to get the game to play you will need to  tinker with the drivers and system options to get it to work
reminds me of  the old days of  dos where a boot disk had to be created to change your  memory options
the box reports a minimum of meg of memory i would think  it is closer to meg
if your character incounters a large amount of  monsters it will bog way down and the monsters will kill you before you get  a hit in
if you must absolutely have the game i would wait a month for the  problems to be fixed
there are already  patches in less then  weeks with  number  in the worksthis game would have been a masterpiece had it have not been for the stupidity of blizzard
this game would be extremely fun but there is one flaw and this one flaw ruins how much i enjoyed the game the damn saving option
this really pissed me off
after a hard  hours straight of battling you find out you have to run off to work so you save and quit the game
after a hard  hours of work you look forward to playin the pretty fun game of diablo  once again
you pop the cd in the drive start up the gamewhat the hell
i just beat all these enemies
yes that is right
after you save and quit the enemies return
sure its a good way to earn experience but i think it goes a little too far when you have to defeat about  enemies and spend about an hour just to get back to where you left off on your last play
at first its not that bad mainly because the enemies are not that hard and there are not many of them
but once i got to the third act i got so frustrated i just quit the game and didnt play it for a month
this gets so frustrating and timeconsuming it is unreali loved the first diablo and right after i beat it i went out and bough diablo  with an expansion pack right away expecting this fantastic game and all i got was a  hour excitement from the first  acts
now i am going to auction it off of ebay as quick as possible as the sight of the box i have reminds me of the mistake i made of spending a total of  dollars on such crapfirst things first
this game is fun and it got two stars for that onlydiablo  was fun for a while
not a long while like neverwinter nights but a little while
i didnt make it too far into the game because i lost track of the plot and the game itself was far too repetitive
every battle seemed to be the same and it was all too easy
the battel system was just point and click and there was no strategy to it at all
i know this is just supposed to be a hack and slash but it fails even at thatthe graphics are moderately good they are not bad but not real good either
the sound is good probably one of the best parts of the gameif you want a hack and slash to be addicted to for less than a week this is the way to go
youll be back
if you want a hack and slash to play for a while may i reccomend any of the icewind dales
if you want a hack and slash with a real good plot try neverwinter nightsi do reccomend this game but dont go wasting your money on it right now wait until it is in the bargain bin sos you dont get mad when you end up geting the game and becoming sick of it in three daysthis is it
is this what the hype was all about
totally disappointed with this game
again a game that took  years to develop isnt a guarantee that itll be good daikatana anyone
diablo  is just all hot air
lets start with the bugs
first of lets start with the technical goof ups
the  game had problems with some cd drives
it takes me  to  tries just to  have my creative dvd recognize the cd
this is a major bug
second the cd  had problems ejecting from my drive thanks to the patch they released  v it still didnt fix it
thanks for nothing blizzard
third the game  wont run on my geforceddr under direct d
so now im running the game  using directdraw from my geforceddr
i ran the game using dfx glide and  the graphics were so washed out and hazy
what do you expect from glide
now lets go with the gameplay
it is absolutely similar with the first  diablo
sure they upgraded the graphics and all but gameplay is still the  same old diablo
the game comes in  cds
the first cd will take you only  about  hours to finish it because the monsters are just too dumb and too  easy to beat
youll have the case of boredom by the time you finish cd
as you progress deeper into the game you start to realize that the  challenge becomes more of simply just finishing it because you paid good money  for it rather than seeing the end of the game
motivation factor is zero
there were a lot of new items and weapons not found in the old diablo but  new items and new weapons just isnt enough to save this game
maps are   times bigger than the old diablo
other than that this game is just a  waste of time because it runs and feels like the old diablo which is  already a tired old engine to spend your gaming hours on
i enjoyed playing  nox more than diablo ii
newcomers in the diablo world will feel just dandy  with this game
old diablo players will go hohum with this one
my take on  this game wait for the retailers to put it on the bargain shelvesthe only diabolical thing about this game is how bad it is
blizzards strategy is this make the game so much fun in the beginning that you sell lots o copies and than later it is no more fun
they make more money faster that way
but wasting money for this game which you will shelf after realizing theres nothing more to do is a bad idea
hack slash pick up hack slash level up pick up hack slash player killer hack slash kill level up
thats how i can describe the game
do yourself a favor if youre a hack and slasher buy a hack and slasher that is actual fun and doesnt try to be something its not
rpg fans should really turn away from thiswhen this thing was new it was certainly all the rage but its main rival the sony playstation was still a step ahead no matter nintendo did
nintendo releases games like goldeneye and starfox two great games but then square and sony release final fantasy vii to america which certainly changed things
on specifics the n is  times more powerful than the playstation
but the n cartridges hold no where near as much space as the playstations black cds
why nintendo didnt bother to use cds as they originally planned confuses many to this date
cds last longer and in truth are harder to damage
a bad drop on a tile floor may send fragments of plastic and silicon from your quotfzero xquot could be all over the kitchen floor
nintendo did have one thing going for it over playstation remakes of classic games
with the bit nintendo they started some great games out
then with the bit super nintendo they made bit counterparts to the bit games
now with this bit system they made counterparts to the  bit games
this was their edge and it made the system sell very well
in the long run was this systems downfall
games are much harder to produce for n than they are playstation
even though it it more powerful than the playstation it is still second to it
what will happen soon is anyone guess
nintendo next year will release their new gamecube
gamecube doesnt play dvds like sonys playstation  and it doesnt appear so far to be anymore powerful
playstation  will be hard to beat for one as you can see by its current demand
it seems that nintendo has become the underdog with giants such as microsoft entering the race
perhaps theyll pull through its unknown
segas dreamcast is certainly on its way down it will not be possible to compete with the much more powerful playstation  and microsofts xbox and possibly the morepowerful gamecube
word to the wise if youre planning to buy a top of the line system i do not currently suggest this system
dreamcast is a good bet for the buck but waiting a while seems to be a wiser choicei found this game to be just so so
with computer graphics youd think that theyd be able to make the aliens more alien
they remind me of stormtroopers in black armour
i feel this game was limited to s stile imaginationi do like pastoral games but this one was just a shade too soporific for me
i got about halfway through before i realized that i just didnt care if the aliens destroyed earth or not
bad signi was so disappointed in this game
it really had very little story line and the graphics were poorly done as well as the puzzles
i may have spent  hours on this game from start to finish and continued to be disappointed with the ending of the game
about all i can say about this game is that they triedi bought this when i was in my quotadventurequot mode
several other games earned my dollar such as lightbringer gabriel knight  kings quest  etc
this one however was not really with the  i spentthe visuals are beautiful
the gameplay is too linear however
you have to quotdo thisquot before you can quotdo thatquot there is no way to accomplish your goals in multiple ways
whereas this concept was astonishing  years ago it no longer appeals to the gameranother gripe way too short
if al gore had played and beaten this game he would have demanded a recount and a rerecount
loloh the political humor
buy this game only if you truly are a fan of mindless puzzles and rail gameplay
if you want a little more freedom in a game with a little more depth story character development and replay value look elsewherekeeping in mind the age of the game this was a decent if somewhat frustrating outing for the adventure game genre
the game takes place in a bladerunner inspired near future which is evident by the flying cars and the dark metroplis in which it is set
the plot revolves around a terrorist group and a corporate conglomerate trying to harness a new invention that may very well turn into global mindcontrol
your character has to figure out the truth of what is occurring and choose which side he is onas i said the look of the game is straight out of the blade runner game from a few years previous
but the gameplay is much different  at its core its still an adventure game
you collect items to be used on objects at later times sometimes in combination with other itemsweve seen this variation more times than we can count at this point  however i have gotten used to the recent games and the innovations they have offered so it was a bit of a shock to jump back  years to the way things used to be  by this i mean there were many unwelcome elements to the game that served to draw it out longer than it should have
most notably getting from one prerendered area to the next often meant having to sit still and wait while my guy walks from one side of the screen to the otherfurthermore this being an eventtriggering game means you may talk to one person then talk to a few more and find yourself at a seeming dead end because you dont realize that the first character you talked to now has something new to say or offer based on events youve triggered since talking to him
this backtracking stretches the game out longer than it should bealso in an attempt to add some depth i guess the game features alot of objects you can scan that end up being useless
this however causes you to miss some things along the way
i would search a cabinet and have the character tell me everything that was in there and what objects he was taking
later id search a shelf and be told nothing of interest
and yet sitting on that shelf was the very object i needed i just had to see it and click on it separately  this feels like a bit of a cheap trickwhats even more irritating is the attitude and voice acting of the main character
i think they were going for a film noir style but half the time clicking on something useless would result in him simply saying naaaaahhhh
at other times though you wouldnt even get that but a simply shrug of the shoulders as if to say what do you want me to do about it
i dont know why but i found this attitude to be supremely annoyingthe story was par for the course for an adventure game
predictable entertaining enough but certainly not worthy of a film or book adaptationgraphically the game was pretty good considering its age
once again think blade runner style drab and dark
it certainly isnt pretty by any stretch  but it has a consistent style appropriate to the storyif you find it cheap at halfprice books as i did youll make an enjoyable weekend distraction of it  but i wouldnt go out of my way to add it to your collectionit seems that most of the people who played this game liked it
and i must say that when i got it i was expecting a better experience than i got something along the lines of rainbow six with more running and shooting
however as opposed to most of the reviews i saw delta force was a huge dissapointment
with horrible graphics maybe its my computer but they didnt even have a strafing animation or realistic grass and stupid extras as weapons see the pathetic explosion from a strike the game was a massive waste of money
im beginning to think that everone likes it because its so cheapokay
some people like  and  year olds think this game is sooo cool
this game so very unrealitic
infact everything about this game is stupid
the weapons are okay but when you fire there is no recoil that makes you reticule the cross thingy that helps you aim go up and down
also  shot from any gun kills an enemy which is pathetic so why put your ma rifle on burst
just use single shot to conserve ammo
the games graffics are as bad and the screams that the enemies make when you shoot them are corny and cartoony
i suggest that you do not buy this game because of the reasons listed above
please save your money and buy a better game like counterstrike the best game ever made halflife the second best or rainbow six raven shield the third best if you are looking for realism do not look here at this game
its patheticsim copter is a quite old game 
the idea is that you start out with a helicopter and some money you need too complete missions to earn more to buy new copters and accesories
after youve completed all the missions you move on to the next city with tougher missions and more money
the gameplay is ok but the controls aernt very realistic
the graphics are horrific the cars sims and some buildings arent even textured 
the music and the sound effects are lacking and theres no ambiant sound
you can upload simcity  cities and play in them but its useless with simcity  the game does have quite a few bugs sims can get stuck your pilot can get stuck too and if you do it right your pilot can jump out right as your taking off and your copter will crash
overall this game is ok but maxis ought to remake it with better graphics less bugs more levels and stuff to buy and to work with simcity  cities
but you still shouldnt get it theres just to many problemsthey make a game that surpasses the power of most if not all computers of the year it was made and probably for many years to come
like wing commander iii it was unplayable when it was out and it is now but for different reasons
yeah in a couple of years youll have that nice p  ghz with a voodoo  and whatever but will your operating system be compatible
no
these showy graphics games like this are useless
no computer can run them
not now
not ever
if i had a superduper voodoo  ect
i could probably give you an acurate review
who has that
with windows 
as for graphics they are excellent stupendous never seen anything like them but since they are like a slide show i just see them as adequete
i imagine butterflys and what not flying gracefully and that would be quotstupendousquot but its just stupid on my machine
the acting is not as bad as people make it out to be it is well adequate for a game
not as bad as animae cartoons almost not
dungeons are fun and beautiful but are like tome raidera lot of people say that and now so do i
its pretty though and has dialogue
ravens fun
get redguardnot atall bad acting or tomb raider they will surely work on most computers
the only difference is this one does noti bought this with the hopes of a fun addictive and diverse roleplaying game
unfortunatly that didnt exactly turn out to be the case
the only way i see fit to best describe this game is by listing the pros and conspros amazing graphics makes you really feel like your in an actual world
npcs have sets of speech that actual actors speak
easy to play
fully useable terrain climb mountains swim get lost in the forest
day and night cycles and rainstormscons huge requirements this requireds a beastly system to play on otherwise its really choppy or in some cases doesnt even work
buggy there is tons of bugs that managed to make it on here that can make you very frusterated while playing
the main quest is almost always boring
even worse most of the side quests pertain directly to the main quest
this makes almost everything seemed forced
when your doing something your doing it because according to the quest your on you have to
combat is also very boring archerstaff fighter swordsman its all the same just run up to what your fighting and click away boring there is no quotworking up skillsquot the only advances your character gets are from completing part of the quest
once again very forced playstyle
sure the magic spells are neat but most of them are useless
i easily got through the whole game using minor heal and fireball the game is often to challenging to be fun i cant count how many times i absolutly had to refer to a walkthrough because i was stuck
most of the time the solution to being stuck was something i truely would have never found without looking at the guide
dungeons are almost all based on puzzles sure the puzzles were cool but with the exception of a few rats you might have to kill here and there the puzzles are all you do
boring
your virture you get in the beggining of the game had nothing to do with anything
it may say you start on the path of a druid but all that actually means is you will start with different equipment than that of a shepard
i was a tinker did hat i start with have anything to do with a tinker no i thought the ending was terrible i played the game for about  playing hours for this i save the worst for last
its quite easy to screw the game over
you have to do the quest exactly as your told or you can screw up the game and have to reload this should never happen in a game
in worst cases you may be following the quest and do something wrong withen it which causes the game to screw up
i vividly remember having to reload way back in time because i did the sacrifice quest before the justice quest even though the option to do the sacrifice quest was given to me the game apparently wanted me to do the jusstice quest firstif you want a good roleplaying game i really wouldnt recommend this
this game was hardly diverse boring and virtually everything you did in it was forcedyet another in the turgid wing commander series prophecythankfully reduces the amount of dull plotless fmv whilst notsignificantly improving the gameplay which doesnt seem to have evolved very much since the original wing commander
your ship still doesnt feel as if it is flying through space the supposedlyinvincible bad guys are more of a nuisance than a threat and if you fail a mission it will probably be because you failed to protect something that you were not told aboutimagine watching a bad lowbudget science fiction film whilst playing a modern homage to star raiders and you have the game in a nutshell
endi would have love to play this game but it would not work for windows  and windows xp or windows  it is new and the intro before the selecting a new game works but when i get into a new game it keeps giving me an error that wont allow me to get in it keeps giving me an error so i keep closing the program if there is a patch that would resolve the problem great otherwise than that i would never play the game again the box looks great and the manual as well looks great thanksstar trek new worlds gave us the promise of quotstarcraft meets star trekquot when starting the game you believe you are going to get this but then things go wrongvery wrongfirst of all there doesnt seem to be any logical method to what you need to build
sure you need power and mining but every other required buildings function seems to be very vaguenext the missions seem very difficult to complete
you build the required buildings and go on the missions but it sometimes takes up to an hour to really get goingall of this is made even more frustrating because of a lack of a save game feature
if this game had one it would make it so much better
you play for an hour or so and then loose
it is a horrible experiencethe most positive aspects of the game lie in the story and graphics
the opening movie and continuing story are excellent and very much in the spirit of quotstar trekquot the graphics are also top notch and are really detailedoverall i cannot recommend this game
if it had a save game feature you could overlook the other flaws and have a good timei guess ill never learn about the latest incarnation of quotstar trekquot games
i had earlier complained about quotklingon academyquot and now its time to complain about his game
it was great at first with the graphics and all but now that ive had it for a while it just about stinks
it took me forever just to complete the first mission
ive been on the second forever
ive managed to build the colony mine the dilithium required but i can never find that archeological area youre supposed to run science scans on
they need a strategy book for this game
its just too hard to understandi really want to know who it is out there who seems to think that because you slap a recognizable name like star trek on a product and sell it is all one has to do
i also want to know how it is that two completely separate game companies interplay and activision can produce two separate games  starfleet command and star trek armada that work almost the same and  reek of the same shoddy workmanship
it is products like these that make me  realize why i have abandoned star trek fandom in the first place
because  like deep space nine and voyager they are so lacking in the creativity  that made the franchise so worthwhile in the first placestarfleet  commanda space combat game by interplay quicksilver is so bereft  intuitive control that it becomes a laborious task to make any ship you  control do anything useful
case in point in my first mission with my  frigate sent after orion pirates it took me  minutes just to hammer down  the enemy ships shields and constantly fiddling with my ships weapons  systems just to get it to fire at the orion
of course while all this is  going on my frigate is endless rotating and turning all over the map
why  should it be harder to not do something than it is to do something
at  least in armada you can simply dragandselect your ships and click  elsewhere on the map to get them to go there
in starfleet command it  takes so long to get your ship to do anything that i was given to wonder  why i had to select crew members for my new ship in the first placeand why in the year  with all the great computer games out there and  the high level of coding in those games are we still playing socalled d  space combat games in  dimensions
i do not care if they is based on the  starfleet battles board game i played that to and realized that it was  limitation with it as well
why is it so hard to work in the rd dimension  and enable the player to go up or down
we live in a  dimensional  world and as homeworld proved its easy to control because the  programmers made an interface that was simple and intuitive as well as  functional
i am also given to wonder why people are not more critical  about products like this when they are so inferior when compared to similar  programs
if you comparison shop for a car why wouldnt you do the same  for a piece of software
it isnt like starfleet command is the only one of  its kind
it is your money afteralljust because it has star trek  tacked on to it does not automatically make it good remember star trek  voyager
maybe my standards are too high or maybe i shouldnt feel ripped  off for spending  and having the pervasive sense of not getting my  moneys worththe problem with star trek games is that they try to be too much like star trek
sound confusing
it is
to break the mold star trek producers are going to have to lean on other designs because the way they make their games now just isnt getting it done
i mean how can one series of games with all the countless titles all be so mindnumbingly below average gamesthe problem with starfleet command is ambition
the game boasts true d combat
this isnt true in the slightest
if you want d space combat go buy homeworld
starfleet command is on two axi the x and y no mention whatsoever of the z axis
everything is played on a flat plane
now im no expert of space travel but this just isnt accurate nor does it make for an enjoyable experiencedont expect to use your torpedoes with this game either
they miss almost every time you launch them
and it isnt because of anything youre doing wrong they just miss
the game is also very hard to figure out in its ship setup stage
if you want to load certain shuttles on your ship you actually have to tell the game to not load them to get them to be there
it is backwards thinking and i cannot believe that they shipped the game with errors in the interface like thisoverall it isnt terribly bad but is not very good either
it is better than  stars but not quite at  stars either
id rate it 
it has some nice features such as being able to command a starship and be in charge of every feature of that ship but you soon find that with the absense of hotkeys for most parts of the ship this game turns into a micromanagement simulation when you dont have time to micromanage because youre being shot at
the ai is generally dumb in the game when they are isolated but some missions can be near impossible and combine that with the fact that your quotwingmenquot do not do anything helpful it can be very frustrating when trying to destroy over  orion pirate ships in one certain federation mission
thats just it some missions are impossible to beat and the strategy guide does not help in the slightestto make a long story short i played this game for about  days then uninstalled it on my hard drive and sold it in an online auction
the game just does not deliver what it should for what a starship combat simulation shouldthis game is so boring i never finished it
for one you cant die you just resurrect so why even care if you get killed
also you can get lost and never finish a mission and not care because even if you do nothing happens
you dont build up armor or weapons and who cares any ways because oh right you cant die
you also cant build up a hunting party and people you meet have no real purpose because you can go anywhere
i never figured out the importance of any of the story linei really had my heart set on toy commander and when i got it the game just didnt deliver
the game concept is really cool on paper but it didnt translate into a good game
the jerky camera which comes as a result of the poor vehicle control actually makes me sick everytime i play it
control is so important in any d game and this game just lacking big timethe multi player mode is also disappointing as the small vehicles get lost among the colourful stages
the game is just not fun
the graphics and the sounds are great but the game is just lacking in the fun departmentim sorry people but the bottom line is that you can pass on this game and be quite contented because you saved a couple of bucksquotde plane
de plane
its stuttering
de planequot first of let me say that you need a computer the size of the empire state building to run this game
i got a piii  with a geforce  card and a  memory and  this game tore it to shreds in a matter of minutes
this made me think  again about upgrading my system
as long as you fly straight its ok that  is if you want to fly to the north pole or the south pole everytime you  boot up this game
but once you turn the aircraft youll experience  graphics turbulence
youll feel your computer shudder and shake as it  battles its way to redraw the scenery
youll see your frames slow down  really bad
lower the graphics settings
try it and youll just make this  game laugh in your face
download the patch
yes i did and it was still  stuttering
you can make every upgrade you want on your computer but if the  game is the problem then its a lost cause
if youre thinking about  picking up this game make sure you have a powerful computer that runs on  nuclear energy
like most other microsoft flight sims this one is geared  more towards the gamer side and not so much on the real simulator  enthusiasts
the planes are just too easy to fly
you could ask your kid  brother to do the takeoff procedure
realism is not that all real as the  game boasts itself to be
the game does have its own pluses though like a  huge database of airports downloadable jeppesen weather reports and of  course theres a lot of third party support on this
if youre a gamer who  wants to try flight sims then pick this game up
if youre a simulator   then pick up something else like fly k
very realistic or aerowinx  very very realisticive played almost every flight sim available today and some that are so old that they havent been available in years
i have hoped and  waited for microsoft to release a flight simulator program that not only gets the flight dynamics of a real plane correct but also gets the  graphics up to par with some of the other less realistic simulators combat sims mostly
flight simulator  disappoints again
i am  running a very high end system with a very powerful video card and the graphics on this game still are bad
when you look out of the  sides of the airplane left right back etc the program requires loading time in order to render the cockpit art
totally unacceptable in  my book
no amount of settings adjusting could correct this on my computerif the largest software company in the world is going to release a program and charge  bucks a pop for it i think that the graphics  should not only be adequate but should absolutely kick some behind
flight simulator is a serious disappointment in that departmentthe dynamics are interesting
i guess if all you want to do is look straight ahead and instrument fly you are in luck here because the  dynamics seem to be fairly realistic
the adjustable difficulty settings are nice and the variety of airports to take off and land on are a nice  feature as well though there isnt much difference between runways as far as particular problems in approach are concerned because the  ms flight sim world is completely flatpoor showing microsoft
hire some coders who can make the artwork something other than ameturish and you may just have something
look to some of your competitors work for an example or take a ride in a real plane and make an attempt to recreate not only the way  it handles but how the world really looks and what it is like to turn your head around in a cockpit
i guarantee it is nothing like fs this is just like starcraft except its not nearly as goodif you like starcraft this is a big dissapointment compared to itthe first age of empires was great
the second one just plain sucked
sure it has good graphics and an easy to use interface but the game would always crash both of my computers
you can only play in x or above  which is a downside also
my computers are not old either one is a p  megs ram  inch monitor voodoo etc
the other is a  amd k   megs ram ati graphics  inch monitor
i just wanted to put this warning  out to those who will be purchasing it
it may work fine for you but i had  problems
it sure is not addictive as the first aoe
buggy software
blahh
i am not anti microsoft by the wayasherons call is a basic rpg played online
you create your character from three different races of humans basically english arabian or japanese and then assign skills and stats to customize your character
and then youre launched into the world of asherons callthe first thing that strikes you is the scale of the game
its huge
the second thing is the unavoidable question what do i do know
now heres what i did after entering the game i wandered around for an hour or two trying to make scense of it all
i was then asked by another player if i wanted to swear allegiance to him which meant that he would be my patron and help me get started with my char
so i then followed my patron around for a few hours and did what he told me to do
i killed a lot of monsters and was given a lot of equipment
this quickly became boring and i quit playing and traded the game in at my local games store for a copy of quotsacrificequot which was much more excitingthe main problem with an online rpg is in my opinion the lack of meaning or a goal
at least in the beginning
you just wander around and kill things
theres no quests
theres no nothing
just wandering around in this huge note to get an idea of how huge it really is read douglas adams description of infinity in quotthe hitchikers guide to the galaxyquot world
another things that really bothers me is the fact that you have to pay a monthly fee  in this case to play a game you initially paid a fair sum of money for in my case 
why is this
im sure there are some expences in keeping the servers going but not  a month for each player
on microsofts webpages it said that there were over k people playing the game
multiply that number by  and you get the staggering amount of  a month no way it costs that much to maintain the servers
capitalism rules i guesseven though this game has a huge map great graphics and everything you need to make the perfect rpg it still stinks
i know this may sound crazy but it really isint
the main problem is combat
you select where you want to attack high medium or low and the computer does the rest
also you have to pay  a month to play it
there are many other reasons why this game is absolutely no fun to play but trust me it is no fun at all
remember great graphics does not make a game gameplay doesi have over  or  game boy color and and game boy games alone besides from just game boy advance
heres the games out of all about  games some i have
some i dont

marykate and ashley get a clue  gbcso for those of you buying this memory card for whatever gb system you have whether it be a gb gbc gba or gba sp remember if your buying this to see what all games it can save do not get the games that have passwords on them youll deeply regret it
if your only buying games that this memory card can save then get games that dont have passwords
if your buying both types of games ones with passwords and ones with out keep the ones with passwords to  side and the other games that are a save as you go type by them selfs like for an example as save as you go it mean games like pokemon and a few other different types of games believe it or not but pokemon games are not the only games they did that with making them save as you go types they also did it with mario and few disney and nickelodeon games for the gb and gbc toowell get this memory card if you have a lot of sayg gamesby the way sayg means save as you gowell if it is anything like ff i might not play them i liked ff and ff but they are too simple for me to finsihi picked this up for free pretty much i didnt know what to expect
i liked the pc and gbc versions but this one has gone a completly different way
it only has one veiw from behind
it would have been so much better to have a top viewsky cam or veiw from the side like in hot wheels stunt something that are on gb and pc and probably every other platform
the one veiw is just no goodits not at all hard to play
but its got no real challenge to it the graphics may be better then the side angled other version of hot wheels games but this one being from behind and all it is not as much funthis game would be great for kids under  especiely under  the controls are ok i guess the graphics arnt so bad but could have been a lot better the commentry is annoying till you turn it downbuy it for the kids maybe but anyone into a real race game will find its lack of reply value disapointingi think that the review at the top of this game has it right  not enough questions
also the  through  questions are too hard compared to the tv showanother annoying feature is the inability to skip past stuff that you have seen a million times that is redundant to youi bought this game out of boredom and i think that i paid about  for it
if you like the tv show then dont pay any more than that
but if you see it on the rack real cheap then hey pick it upholy fat mama
this game was the most hideous thing i have ever played
not only is it easier than the tv show its twice as dumb
the first and second questions i was asked the first time i played were the same stinkin  question
from the third game on i never went without a repeat question
you should stay away from this
it will probably eventually drive you  insane by the lowfi sound clip of regis saying quotfinal answerquot  anyways
try some of the notaspathetic games by expert software
such  as extreme paintball deer hunter and other quickly thrown together  titles
it gets a second star for being functional barelyas a big fan of the tv show i was really looking forward to the home version and undoubtedly so were thousands of other fans
unfortunately the folks at disney and jellyvision were clearly aware of that and the  rush was obviously on to get this game to market as soon as possible  before the craze could die down
the result is a game that doesnt come  close to matching either the tv show or jellyvisions previous  effortsthe most obvious problem is the limited number of questions
this problem is greatly compounded by the fact that the game doesnt seem  to make note of which questions have already been askeda simply  inexcusable error which results in repeated questions after only a few  gamesthe box proudly touts the fact that a quotvirtual regisquot  hosts the game and sure enough hes there
but his involvement in the  project was clearly limited he doesnt read any of the questions only  providing the pre and postquestion patter
thats understandable given  the amount of money that regis would have probably demanded for such a  large recording job but it does greatly diminish the illusion of being on  the showthe games incorrect pacing destroys the rest of that illusion
instead of encouraging the player to take hisher time as the show does a  second clock is inexplicably added
and while the game rushes you  through the questions themselves it needlessly slows down between them
since the designers couldnt have regis read the questions they clearly  wanted to maximize his involvement between questions so the game stops  after every question while regis delivers one of a set of long canned  remarks
this is tolerable later in the game but it comes across as  simply silly during the first few easy questions that the tv show would  blast through in short orderas others have pointed out even the  keyboard commands have problems
assigning a lifeline to the same key as  an answer choice is begging for mistakes and the lack of an quotis that  your final answerquot question in most cases further increases the  possibility of errors as well as erasing the remainder of the feel of  being on the showthe game does have its moments if multiple people are  playing a clever implementation of the fastestfinger round decides who  gets to sit in the hot seat
but frankly i cant imagine playing this as  a multiplayer game anyway the shows format simply isnt suited to be a  party game and this home version simply isnt exciting enough to  watchin summary the millionaire computer game has its brief moments  but simply isnt worth even the low price disney is asking for it
its  unfortunate that disney and jellyvision chose to put their namesand the  shows reputationon such a disappointing effortas others have mentioned this product has serious flawsespecially with regard to the pitiful number of questions available
for me however a larger complaint is the surprising unfaithfulness to the showthe  socalled quotfastest fingerquot questions are nothing really like  those on the show
you dont compete to put the answers in the right  order you just buzz in when the computer flashes up the proper  arrangement
its related to the set of skills necessary on the real  showbut its not the samelikewise when answering questions in the  quothot seatquot you dont really get the quotis that your final  answerquot prompting in a consistent way
only some of the questions  allow for italso the questions in the pre range are unusually  difficult compared with the show
there theyre ridiculously easy  complete with flatly idiotic possible answers
here by contrast the  early questions are much more serious
theyre still comparatively easy  but theyre not the gimmes they are on the real showhopefully the  producers will have found a way to be more faithful to the showand give  us more questionsfor the second edition of this gamei downloaded this from the nintendo eshop and i had played mario land  in the past which was excellent but this game is bad
im sure its not the worst mario game out there but its the worst one ive played
its not a horrible game but its just not as good as its predecessors or its successors
the biggest complaint i have are the controls and the physics
it doesnt even feel like a mario game
the controls are klunky and often unresponsive the physics are weird like the fire flowers fireball
it ricochets everywhere before eventually going out
the enemies are unlike anything ive ever seen in mario
in one world you have to easter island heads with arms and legs kinda like nosepass from pokemon
the koopas explode when you jump on them
i dont mean they explode and die i mean when you jump on them they go into their shell and explode like a bobomb hurting you if youre too close
the graphics i cant give too much flack to because it is gameboy but it doesnt look much better than the mario calculator games i played back in highschool
id say skip this one go straight to mario  its much much betterthis game is horrid
the graphics and the framerate are too choppy
the sounds okay sound effect wise but mkii was never known for its music
the control is absolutely horrid there arent enough buttons on the game boy and special moves are nearly impossible to pull off much less fatalities as theres only one per characterbut the worst of it all happens to be the gameplay
seriously i beat this game in half an hour
and when did blood ever become an ink errornot worth the price
i suggest that you should dust off your super nes and buy that version
avoid mortal kombat ii on the game boy at all costs
the only thing worse than this is the game boy port of mortal kombat if you think a super hero game can never be too fastpased this could change your mind
enemies come at you from every corner throughout the entire game constantly trying to take you under
youd swear you were in detroitif you want a slowerpaced game based on the animated series try the snes version
it doesnt let you play as robin but it has more depth and 
wait a minute
im not reviewing the snes version
as either batman or robin you throw various weapons at your enemies as you keep scrolling to the right and trying not to get killedbatman forever is mortal kombat rebuilt for batman
they put mks controls and suk random bat gizmo controls in it
i personally never beaten the game but maby i just suck at it
that or i lost patiance with it because i cant get pat the first hole in the floor
do youself a favor and stay away from this pile of bat crapi love the graphics digitized graphics awesome one thing though  gameplay muchwhy couldnt have been a simple beat up the bad guys progress to the next level game graphics over gameplay classic mistake
to use a gadget you have to put in a button combination like mortal kombat even the fighting engine was like mortal kombat
to get above and below areas is a chore
if i  told you how to get above and to get below areas youd  be like wtf
play batman forever arcade on ps  sega saturan or download it on mame  dont take my word for it play it i dare ya
its not as bad as some of the reviews say but boy is this game baaaaaaaaaaaaadi like the original batman game for this system as oppose to this joke
the graphics are very good i will say that but terrible gameplay
the fighting system in this game was different and it was more than just a rockem sockem still side scroller
i liked how each of the characters had a huge list of moves and how you can use them in the dual mode
despite this being a bad game overrall i remember myself and my brother loved playing this game back in the day
it was cool when i was a preteen but now its just one of those stale gamesthis game is impossible
you only have one health bar and one lifethats it
when you dieits right back to the start of the gameits a shame toobecause this game is actually pretty freaking coolits got an awesome storyline and the graphics and concept were truly ahead of their timebut oh my lordwhat a hard game this isive heard it said before that this game is very shortbut how am i gonna know if i keep dying over and over
overallif you wanna get this for youre genesis collectionthen i would recommend this gamebut as far as playing it goesi hope you love one hell of a challengeif you think that this is a good game then you seriously need your head examinedi can honestly say ive yet to play a good spiderman game
for all the hype good reviews and people willing to pay the big bucks over this one i thought it was sure to be the best
how disappointed i was to discover its one of the blandest and boring beatemups everyou begin playing as spidey but can later change to venom if you wish and you go about tiresome duties beating up generic thugs on the streets of manhattan
every thug looks the same and youll end up punching to death the same guy a billion times more so for those infuriating end of level bosses
the crap music is the same on every level
apparently the game has additional music by some band called green jelly who i have never heard of
i assume they must be some nonehit wonder grunge band from seattle back when all that was new
and quite what exactly they contributed to the game is a mystery as there are only  tracks in total level music and boss musicthere is some plot going on but i couldnt follow it
the comicbook cut scenes look terrible and the writing is too small to read
plus the are very slow and add too much time between the boring levelsthe controls and gameplay are dire
theres no fluent movement or grace in the fighting
its all just an annoying mess and terribly programmed
if you can bear to stay with the game until level  youll know what i mean
it was so rageinducing i almost gritted my teeth into dust and chucked the controls into the tvstay well away from this horrible game
as a beatemup it stinks
as a spidey game it stinks
it just plain reeks overallgraphics csound dgameplay dlasting appeal fnot many games are as mindless as t and believe me thats not a compliment
you do the same old thing over and over until you cant take it anymore
and while its kind of fun at first it dries up quickly
pass on this onewhen i think of the n i think about great games and memories
games like goldeneye  the legend of zelda ocarina of time super mario  and banjo kazooie
memories like getting my forehead shot by my brother grabbing my th power star and meeting princess zelda for the first timedonkey kong  doesnt come up in any of these if you havent noticed by now and for good reason
its slow pokey and not really all that fun
which is really a problem after the success of the donkey kong country trilogythe graphics donkey kong  seems to take the graphics roll from super mario  in that the characters are a little on the blocky side but their really not all bad
ive only come across a few complaints which is demonstrated in the following description in one area the room has a large wooden treasure chest with a switch of the characters face on it
sounds fine right
wrong the switch attached to the chest is made from a vent in one of the previous areas
a metal switch attached to a wooden chest
sheer laziness
verdict the story quite simple really donkeys horde of bananas have been stolen once again by king k rool ruler of the kremling reptiles
hes also done the liberty of imprisoning all of the other kongs in cells mapped around the game
the game introduces many new character like lanky kong and the banana fairies along with some pretty whacked up levels
its not really all that original but it worksthe verdict  the gameplay this is where donkey kong  kills and not in the good way
the game rips from the popular grab the golden item to proceed to more levels style originated by super mario  and banjokazooie
now that would be fine since the genre has pretty much held water for years but dk has you powerwalking your way through each task some of which are dragged on alreadyit takes me about  minutes just trying to go to the level i choose except the first level
the game is loaded with long hallways ledges you need to slowly climb and slow framerate issues at times
if rare had upped the speed to about  times faster i probably wouldnt have constantly been yelled at to leave my younger brothers room so he could sleep
oh yeah and i got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction
this game ruins hands and sleepy little brothers
the verdict  the music the game ranges from toy factories jungles pyramids and the like so you can imagine a wide arrange of tunes to come across
some of the music is pretty catchy but i didnt find myself dazzled by any means
i found myself humming  or  songs but that was it none of which youll be hearing very often
the soundeffects are fitting and pretty original
thanks to this game every time i see an orange i immediately think of the sound the orange grenades make in this game
pretty funny right
verdict  overall dk had a lot of hype and its a shame it didnt turn out since it was made by the same guys behind the donkey kong county battletoads and jet force gemini series which were excellent gems
i played this game as a kid years ago and completed everything in the game i really must have exaggerated greatly how fun it was back then because i cant seem to have any courage to attempt getting everything in just level  while the music is descent the graphics okay and the story shallowly good none of those elements are what make you play a game
you play to have fun to enjoy the universe of the characters and to enhance you skills
id be able to accomplish all those things twice as much just eating a banana and watching my dad trim his nails than playing donkey kong ooooh bananaoverall verdict  what a weird game
i got this expecting the same type of thing that was going on in those great super nintendo games
but hey if you like confusing and weird puzzles than you might enjoy this game
i suggest that you get it anyway but only to see how different it is than the dk country games
this is a puzzle level game not a dk country game
i got bored and annoyed with it and stopped playing after having it for a few weeksthese are my updated comments
recently i challenged my review above and my view of this game
i decided to learn how to get good at it thus leading to enjoyment of the game
i actually got hooked playing it for over  hours so far
point being this game is not awful it is however tricky
if you enjoy glover or even if you somehow found a way to enjoy mario  you will like this game
i would say that my new rating of fun would be  of  and my new overall would be  of   the overall is still low because of how frustrating this game isto say the least donkey kong took everything this genre stood for and made a muckup of it
endless item collecting muddy details and slow action leave this one for the chimps uh chumpsyou have bananas golden and coloured coins coconuts ammo musical notes etc
and for five characters
the collecting seems endless and when i was forty  done the game i just stopped
i looked at this forest level and i said this looks just like the desert and water ones only with a different backdropand whats with the story
some giant floating island or something
why does k rool have such a loathing for the kongs
why doesnt he just butcher them instead of placing them in unguarded easily escapable places
rare really messed up on this one
the sound isnt all that awesome the dk rap what the heck was that
 and the graphics were bleh this thing required the mb expansion
banjo kazooie looked twice as goodeven the characters are lame
i thought the release of kiddy kong in dkc was dumb but now we have three new characters that couldve easily been replaced by  old ones
tiny is the spitting image of dixie and lanky is the babyish side of kiddy while chunky is well the chunky sidei think rare thought their game was weak themselves that must be why they added this mediocre rd person shooter multiplayer isnt it
they didnt think they did a good job on the shooter part did theyi have so many peeves about this game its nuts
what difference is tehre between the gun and the instrument
they both unlock things
why did rare feel it necessary to have two things that can work switches
honestly the only entertaining and redeeming part of this game are the jetpac and donkey kong hidden arcade gamescertainly a long game but length is not always a good thing
look at conkers bfd it was short and still owned this game wicked bad
 hours of this and youll wish rare had stopped thereprosencourages explorationintense final battle against bossgraphics stateoftheart for its timeconsfrustrating anglestedious and repetitive gameplaybeaver bother you know what im talking about if youve played this gamei had always heard how dk was such a classic and so naturally i wanted to finally buy and beat itinstead of a classic i found a game that was well kind of lazy
you essentially have  levels before the boss level and you have to beat each of these levels with  different characters
so you have to spend your time getting all of dks bananas and missing the other  characters bananas because only diddy can get diddy bananas only tiny can get tiny coins etc
this means you have to basically go back and redo the whole level with another character all over againcouple this with the fact that camera angles are constantly changing on you it makes for a very hohum experienceat one point during the  hours it took me to beat this game i turned on the game and found all my data was erased
at first i was angry but then kind of relieved that i didnt have to feel like i needed to finish this game anymore
thats saying a lot because i always finish games i start
i turned the game onandoff again and the data was there again so i did finish playing it
but the point still stands i wanted my data to be erasedfor the nintendo  gaming system the two preeminent adventure games were mario and zelda
those games enthralled players with their tight gameplay and interesting stories
unfortunately dk  doesnt have that same tight gameplay and the story was never the strong suit of the seriesthe problem with this game is obvious after about  minutes its all about collecting items and very little else
whether it is coins tokens or bananas this game quickly devolves into little more than a scavenger hunt for miscellaneous items
making matters worse is the fact that each character needs to collect each item to unlock certain features
the game is tedious enough playing just as a single character but add in the four others and it becomes ridiculousthe music in this game is engaging the dk rap might just be the highlight of the whole experience
 but other than that nothing really stands out
if you dont mind collecting item after item youll like this game more than i  if you prefer a developed plot however than stay away at all coststhe game is maybe not terribly amusing but amusingly terrible
the gameplay from this game is pretty much the same as the original
the graphics are bright vibrant colours which are quite fun
the gameplay element is very redundant and gets old fast
its fun for a level or two but i wouldnt recomend this game for anyonestar wars shadows of the empire was released near the end of  and was one of the first generation games for the n
its a decent star wars game overall with nagging issues that keep it from being one of the better games for the systemset after the events in the movie star wars v the empire strikes back but before the events in the movie star wars vi return of the jedi and also based on the book of the same name you set out to help luke skywalker and rescue princess leia from the hands of prince xizor
choose from  difficulty levels and battle through  levels set in planets that are part of the star wars universe battling enemies and making your way around as you would in a platform gamethe pros well the overall presentation is good enough to make you feel youre in the star wars universe as the sound effects and music are what you expect to hear in star wars games
even though the game has  levels they are long levels so you wont be cruising through so easilythe cons unfortunately this is not one of the better sw games available for the n for several reasons
this game was part of the first generation of games for the n and it shows
the graphics did not age so well and back in   they were horrible
super mario  was a launch title and it had way better graphics
here the game gets choppy when theres a lot of action the frame rate dips every so often and there is lots of pop up scenery and dense fog to cover up areas that dont have any animation
the controls are no better than the ones in the ps title tomb raider
your character controls like a robot aiming is a chore to do and the game has horrible collision detection
add in the platform elements where you have to jump in certain areas and either you end up dying or trying to jump again because the jump button doesnt respond until a full second after you press it
on top of all that the games difficulty is pretty unforgiving
even if you set in on easy the enemies are still pretty tough and sometimes you have no idea if your weapons have an effect on whoever you are shooting atconsidering that the first level is easily the best of the game altogether youre pretty much hyped and cant wait to see the rest of the game
unfortunately when you do you realize that the game falls flat on its face
star wars sote had a lot of potential
its a star wars game and gives you the feeling that youre part of the awesome story it conveys
but that feeling goes away fast as the crappy graphics robot like controls bad platform elements and near impossible difficulty that this game presents keeps it from being the kind of game it could have been
only the die hard star wars fans would pick this up
for everyone else be warned as other star wars games released for the n are much much better than this somewhat playable effortfor the past few months id been picking up old n games that i didnt get a chance to purchase during their initial release and when i saw shadows of the empire i immediately grabbed it being the big star wars fan that i amshadows was one of the launch games for the n and while it might have been a decent game in its day maybe even a good game i cant however believe it was ever considered a great game it hasnt aged well at all
to compare i also recently grabbed super mario  the original launch game and still found plenty of charm left in that old cartridgethe graphics are a mixed bag
our hero dash is rendered rather nicely with more polygons than one might expect
the levels however have ugly textures that will remind the player of early pseudo d games like doom and dark forces
hardly the graphical quality the n is capable of
enemies such as the stormtroopers and mercenaries are fuzzy with blurred details
however the graphics on the flying missions and the speeder bike level are exceptional
with regards to sound john williams score has never failed before and fortunately the music combined with classic star wars sound effects is just what star wars fans wantwhere the game really fails is the gameplay
shadows tries to include many different modes of play and not all of them work
the snow speeder level is a classic as it inspired the game rogue squadron the speeder bike chase is rather cool as is the fight with boba fett
however in other areas of the game your craft is stationary and all you are required to do is shoot
its not much different from the super nintendo star wars games and the simplistic gameplay can only entertain for so long
then there is the firstperson levels which unfortunately make up the bulk of the game
though the game has multiple view modes dash is easiest to control in the firstperson mode but the player wont even see the tip of dashs gun as is customary with all shooters
there is no target reticle making aiming irratic
the levels are too big and empty and are too straightforward
its a simple matter to walk from point a to point b with few surprises
youll find yourself rushing through most of the game to get to the better levels but unfortunately theyre few and far in betweenif youre a star wars fan theres still enough here to warrant a purchase but mostly itll be for a piece of n star wars history
while i might have had different feelings about this game had i bought it at launch i cant imagine feelings much more impressed by it
shadows of the empire is the most disappointing of all the n star wars gameswhen yoshis story came out i was stoked thinking it was a bit sequel to yoshis island
i was so wrong
this game is aimed at  year old gamers
you go around chapters collecting fruit in the levels to advance thus levels have no actual exit
theres  areas in each chapter
 chapters calls for  total levels in the game
to make this game even more disappointing when you finish one level say  youd think you go to  but no
instead you go to chapter  what the heck
it turns out you have to find red hearts hidden in each level to unlock a level in the next chapter
to unlock all of chapter s level you have to complete one level die then go back
its a stupid setup
i was really hoping for a yoshis island  type game here but this is nintendo cashing in on their child fanbase
basically if youre older than  this game will be too childish for your likingthis game was a little bit dissapointing i mean its fun to play with your friends but even that novelty wares off kind of fast but there is pretty much no single player
the single player mode is completely boring
this game is kind of like something you would play at an arcade its good but i wouldnt really recommend itthis game was okay not one of the best fighting games ive played but it was okay
the characters are hard to controll and its hard to make them do thier specail moves
but its okay for a try i wouldnt buy itthis version of the trilogy absolutly stunk to high heaven
what the hell happend
i first brought the mk trilogy on pc
but after i upgraded to windows  the game would not install anymore it only worked on win  so i saw the playstaion version but i never liked the ps and i saw that it was exactly the same as the pc version so i figured the n version would be just the same
wrong
there is about  charactors missing from the  version for some unknown reason
they could well have included them but for some reason this game is more like mortal kombat  with a few extra charactorsi hope the pc version gets rereleased some day
or maybe ill just get a ps version rom because mk trilogy is the best mk game ever just not on the i was extremely disappointed with this title
you will like it if you like goldeneye but definitely go with goldeneye over this game
the multiplayer is  times better than goldeneye but the cheats and single player levels leave everything to be desired
for one thing it requires more sneaking around because one missed shot hits the wall letting the guards know of your presence who will then hit you with perfect accuracy and kill you in a matter of seconds because of your quickly draining life meter
you also run out of bullets faster and reload much slower
the difficulty is just about near impossible
if you cant beat goldeneye with everything as in cheats bonus levels record times etc do not buy this game
you cant beat this game on perfect agent unless youre a game tester and im sure even they had problems
the game is so hard it just totally degrades from the fun factor
the plot is also absurd
aliens and such
ha ha
amusing
dont waste your money
i strongly reccomend going for goldeneye rather than perfect darkthe actual game is okay but certainkly isnt on par with goldeneye
with the exception of the man dan carrington the characters are wooden and the story is very poor you never feel into the games story at all
the level design in general is bad like the supposed stealth mission in chicago where every enemy knows where you are anyway so there is no stealth involved whatsoever
some of the levels though are fun with inspired design like the sniping levcel in the snow but it doesnt make the game goodwhat does make the game worth playing is the multi player modes although the graphics take another turn for the worse they are acceptable in  player but with  you cant see anything at all without a massive tv
the multi modes make pd beating the hell out of simulants in slow motion can be fun and sure beats the game
this is what you should be buying the game for not for the story mode
the trouble with this is that the pd arenas are poor and its only the graphically altered goldeneye levels that are worth playing
a bit lazy on the developers partoverall except for the inclusion of mr carrington the story mode is a bust so unless you have enough mates to make the multi worthwhile dont buy itfirst off my rating is high because i really enjoyed this gamendly it was a n rpg which i dont remember there being manyyou end up using the elements as magic and you mix and match to kind of make your own play stylethe battle mechanics were odd but i always enjoyed games that were challenging so you had to think out what you were going to do sometimes you would lose a battle due to making a bad move and you can learn from it and do betterunless your someone who likes to play old games avoid this one there are games which are all around upgradestry fate or fablein my opinion the only thing this game has going for it is that it didnt have any competition in the field of rpgs until the zelda action rpgs
the developers of this game should be ashamed of themselves for creating this
i bought the game a couple of years ago and it still sits there and collects dust
i probably played it for four hours or so and put it away
i want those four hours back that i wasted
nevermind i would just waste them anywaysquest  is a role playing game that stresses d eyecandy with little depth of story plot and no long lasting appeal all three are essential along with others for a good rpgthe main character only has one weapon and a few items which most of which repeat themselves in a pattern throughout the entire gamethere are no side quests or red herrings to keep you intrigued no easter eggsthe battle system first of all is the most boring turn based combat system ive ever seen
oh and youll spend  percent of the game running around the countryside fighting monsters to build your levels thats all the games empahsis is on building levels and thatll bore you after about a couple of hours off and on
the games story seems to get loss in the building of levels after the first few hours or sothe amazing d graphics are the only thing really good about this game as its the only thing that really keeps it from getting one star
but still graphics dont make up for a game with such a linear monotonous flowi recently reread some of the previous nintendo powers reviews of this game hyping it up as being as good as final fantasy seriesthat was a sellingpromotional point more than anything else since as the first editorial writer above said quest  sinks in too many areas to paraphrase himif you can find this game used at a exchange store for  dollars nowdays then i would buy it thankfully i only rented it and the guide rather than pay  bucks for this game when it first came out you should do the samethis game is to dark to see anything and hard to play with the controls provided
id recommend upgrading to a different system for this gamewell this game features some of the best graphics ive ever seen and its easier to learn how to play than rogue leader but what were they thinking when they decided not to have a save optionn is a superior machine so its not like it doesnt have enough memory to support a save option and even old games like metroid and the legend of zelda let you save your progress with a password
this game is just like one of those arcade games at movie theatres because its fun to play for a while but pointless to try and beat it because it just doesnt let you save
the new star fox game for game cube sure as hell better have a save optiondiddy kong racing simply put is a game i have tried to love and simply cannot do it
i have even tried to play it but i cannot simply stand playing this insipid game
i do now know why but this simply is not a good game
perhaps it is particular tastes
but i simply cannot stand this game
the tracts are fairly imaginative
one grating thing about it is say you hit a tree
well instead of bouncing off like on many other racing games you stay bashing into the tree
it does have some interesting features however
the sheer volume of tracts had it been any other game would have been a plus shows ingenuity the story line is interesting but in execution the game just flails horriblywhy do i give it  stars
the concept
i love the concept
making an adventure out of a racing game and the format they gave it is an excellent idea
the sheer number of tracks is exhilarating
and on some courses there are three plane hovercraft kart types of vehicles to use
it is just a tragedy that in practice it doesnt come off at all
it is nowhere near super mario kart   that game is fastpaced and loads of fun the best racer to hit the n
size wise this dwarves mario kart   if they could have had the execution on mario kart  and the concept of diddy kong racing we would have had one hell of a game
sadly such a game does not exist yet
we have to settle with a badly executed game diddy kong racing with another racing game that is superb in all manner of ways
but with a little engineering we could have the best of both worlds
super mario kart  is the way to go folks
the multiplayer battle is really fun too especially block fort
superiour in concept inferiour in execution
thats the bottom linenintendo has taken one of the greatest racing games for snes and revamped it into a whole different futuristic racing game
for starters there are  racers rather than  and this game is very fast
but to be so fast and have  racers the game is very cheaply detailed
lets just say the car your driving is very small and looks like a box with rocket boosters
also with  cars  cars to start and  to earn it gets a bit confusing as to who you should chose to race as so there are detailed photos of each driver so that people can pick their favorite to drive as
the originality of the game is the fact that the track forms itself into any sort of shape
it goes into huge antigravity loops half pipes where you can drive on the ceiling and pipes where you can race on the outside of it all around it without falling off
there are three levels of difficulty customizable colors cars speeds acceleration and three circuits with seven or so unique tracks
finally there is an original battle mode where you must destroy other racers by knocking them off the track
this is a game you should rent before you buythis could be considered the companion to alien trilogy as it takes place in the fourth movie following the first three presented in alien trilogy
this game featured controls that people are more familiar with in these days but didnt understand at the time
the controls may be above average and the graphics are excellent for the time but seriously the level design is a piece of crap
what kind of space ship is this
very illogical design leads to boring gameplay that is only fun for  minutes with invincibility turned on otherwise youll die in  minutes without it because you move soo slow
an interesting thing is that if you get impregnated by a facehugger you wont be allowed to go through airlocks or elevators which is interesting that they followed through on this principal with the chestbursters and youll have to find a device to take out the creature before the time runs out
the thing that doesnt make sense with this is that even with a chestburster inside you aliens will attack you and that makes no sense
facehuggers can also attack you by hitting you with their tails
dont play this game id rather watch the moviealien ressurection the game makes the movie of the same title look like an oscar winning masterpiece well ok maybe not
the only reason it got two stars was for the awesome atmosphere and graphics that this game has to offer plus the level of geniune fear and suspense that it conjurs upnow for the badnothing ever really happens in this game
at times it is downright boring
you wander around in the pitch black half the time waiting for something really bad to happenbut it never does
when i say this game is dark i mean dark as in no light
you cant see half the time and the worthless flashlight that you have runs out of batteries every five minutes
the controls are sloppy and unnecessarily difficult
the weaponsammo are limited and you really have to search for them in some of the later levels which makes the game seem contrived like they added that feature only to make the game longer
alien trilogy was a much better game
like the alien movies too many sequels makes for a predictable and downright boring ridethis game is a kind of blend of space harrier gauntlet with fps influences
its not that interesting in any department
once youve played through level one youve just about seen all it has to offer
gameplay boils down to holding down the strafe and shoot buttons
the special weapons arent that useful
the small nuclear bomb is just a key that materializes right in front of the door you have to use it on its kind of funny the first time thats about it
you have a sniper rifle and a parachute but the level design doesnt use them to full effect
character design is mostly boring just a naked guy spray painted black the helmet is kind of interesting in sniper mode with the hud and darth vader sound effect
enemy designs generally look like fluctuating polygons the game runs too fast most of the time to tell what they are
platforming sections are harder than they need to be because the controls and physics arent that good you can phase right through some platformsthe good decent humor fast action cool sniper riflethe bad hideous graphics horrible jumping sequences no voicesthis is yet another great game by renowned developer tim schaffer who is known for games such as wild  earth worm jim and psychonauts
this game has a great dose of humor with things like the worlds smallest nuclear explosionits ingenious
tim always has the humor in the gameplay and not just with dialog and videos
the story is almost non existent as were most of tim schaffers older games you play a guy with a pointy armor nose and you take it off for a gun and you put it on for a sniper rifle
you have three windows on your rifle to see where your bullets are going
this is good for lobbing mortars into tubes to kill protecting enemies etc
while the action is fast paced there are a lot of problems
the jumping sequences are terrible thanks to the character moving way too fast
the graphics are hideous even for the ps
everything looks flat brown and boring
there are also no voices at all
if you can stomach all this you can pick it up fairly cheap its not one of those ultra rare  ebay gameshere comes the onetime end of an era
and sadly it ends not with a bang but with a whimper
like mm before it mega man  suffered quite a bit of backlash and this time around it was a result of the rather unbecoming bitish graphical structures on the bit wonders of the sega saturn and sony playstation and if you ask me it was not the title to follow the monstrous mega man x that came out around the same time
still for all the weeping against statues mm still serves up some classic mega man fun with that newschool mega man x feel
the searching for hidden items becomes more important and challenging this time around the action is still consistently hectic and the level designs are pretty nicely done with some rich and vivid color work
however theres a very cheesy sugarcoated appeal to this even more so than mm which i think was trying to emulate the american animated series that and the bosses and weapons dont seem as good as they could have been rushs abilities arent as important as they used to be and the voice acting is atrocious for certain characters dr light bass and some of the bosses are the prime sinners in this regardand rush shiraishi did a better job voicing x in x than she did mega man in this
it fits better if you ask me
still theres enjoyment to be had
just remember to take it at face valueand consider it a stepping stone to mega man this x game was just tedious
i remember the original x game on the snes was fun as were x and x but this one was just bad
playing as x or zero was fun but zero was hard to control and both storylines were well boring
i was almost to the point of yawning
plus it was easy to figure out who the final boss was for anyone who has ever played an x game
additionally some of the upgrades to xs armor made him harder to operate and well i guess what i really want to say is this was boring
i was bored stiff
i couldnt wait to beat it so i could move on to something else
unlike x x and x there is almost no replay value in this game
i mean beyond the cheat codes for the special x armor and dark zero nothing
i only hope that x and x are better but im not sure if they will bei could only get to the first boss
dont get me wrong i had fun with this game but many factors killed it for memost noticebly is the controls
the controls in this game are aweful
you have no idea how many cheep deaths the controls caused me
its the main reason why i could never get pass the first boss
this is an extreme problem when youre facing more than one enemy because the controls wont respond when you need them to
the camera doesnt make things any easier
when platforming the jumping controls and camera will often cause cheep deaths because you cant see where your going or jump at an angle that causes you to fall offanother issue i had is that when you get a game over you start all the way to the beginning of the game
extra lives are also hard to find
this wouldnt be so bad if the controls werent so badthe plus side though is that the music is wonderful and there are moments that are creepy and scary
i would love it if they remade this for the wii xbox or ps with better controls and handling but due to how long its been i dont see that happeningi bought this when i was a huge xfiles fan and i thought its ok but basically its hit a button see a cinamatic and i beat the game in like  days it isnt that goodafter i saw the movie i was in a real quotxmenquot mood so i went out and bought this game
when i started playing it i became very frustrated
it doesnt show you how to do any of the moves in the instruction book not that i ever need an instruction book to learn moves
to do moves in this game it takes a lot of practice
so to find out how to do anything with a character you have to go into this boring and frustrating training mode
once you master a character it is then easy to complete the game
but then if you want to play another character you have to go back into the training mode all over again
the endings in this game are very short and unsatisfying
the good thing is that after you have beaten the game with everybody you can view each ending linked up together and then it makes a lot more sense and you get more satisfaction
theres lot of things to unlock in this game but no codes
no secret characters
the worse part about this game is the gameplay
i recently went back to play this game after not playing it for about a year
i found out that i had forgotten to do all of the moves
so rather than go back into training mode i just turned it off and put it anyway
ill probably never play it againas a fan of the xcom games and shadow watch i was really looking forward to this game
based on the editorial reviews on this site i was expecting somethiing in a similar veinunfortunately there are some subtle  problems with this game that make it vastly inferior to the previously  mentioned titles and cause the game play to be rather slow and  frustratingproblems with the tactical level  extremely long  fights  most of the weapons in this game are frustratingly innacurate and  dont do much damage
as a result fights go on and on and on and on and  on and 
well you get the idea
in xcom and shadow watch fire fights  tend to be relatively quick and decisive
if a bad guy steps out in front  of you without cover he goes down
in this game though he can stand  right in front of you at a range of three or four spaces and it will still  take a few turns to kill him
you shoot and miss and shoot and miss and  so on
and then when you finally do hit the guy it takes five or six  shots to take him down
your mouse hand will get sore from all the point  and clicking
both the accuracy and the lethality of all the weapons in the  game should be about doubled or trippled which would lead to shorter more  decisive engagements
  computer controlled characters have a huge  advantage in accuracy  this is a weird glitch that becomes really obvious  from about the second fight onwards
all computer controlled units are  roughly two to three times as accurate as your supposedly elite mercenary  units
what does this mean
a couple of examples a
one of your  mercenaries with a high accuracy rating is lying on the ground firing at  an opponent lying on the ground with no intervening cover
the computer  controlled character will hit you about four times for every time you hit  him
b you have a unit which has carfully positioned itself crouching  behind a tree for cover shooting at a computer unit standing in the open
you will hit each other with about the same frequencywhile over all  game balance is preserved by the fact that your mercs can just take so damn  much damage it still makes game play awefully frustrating
here you are  knocking yourself out to find good covered positions to protect your guys  and the computer still hits them easily while youre missing its guys that  are out in the open
the problem becomes even more annoying once you start  training local militia to protect your villages
being computer  controlled the local militia also benefit from this huge increase in  accuracy which means that they completely outclass the mercenaries who  trained them
which makes you wonder why they needed your mercenaries to  come liberate them in the first placeproblems with the strategic  levelunbalance economy  simply put the amount of money running around  in the game doesnt balance out against the cost of most items
local  militia for example can be trained for  a sum so small by comparison  to what your mines are turning out that it doesnt even enter into your  strategic thinking
similarly the rewards for completing quests in the  game are ludicrously small wnen compared to your income
what do you say  to a major npc who is trying to get you to do some major quest by offering  you k dollars
quothello i make more than that in a single day of  mining
why should i botherquot
the numbers on a lot of this stuff  need to be adjusted
  a preponderence of innefectual hand guns  for  some reason most of the mercs that you can afford at the start of the game  come equipped with hand guns rahter than assault rifles
excuse me
a  professional merc whos going to airdrop into the middle of a civil war  with only a pistol
this is particularly ludicrous when you realize how  innefectual handguns are in this game
even at close range an npc is  likely to die of old age long before you ever manage to finish him off with  a  revolver
adding to this problem is the fact that you cant buy  rifles
oh sure the nice mail order company that you do business with  will send you ammo but not big guns grenades night vision goggles or  any of the really cool stuff that you want to play with
to get that  stuff you have to ever so slowly find it off the bodies of dead enemies
in the course of  hours of play i managed to find only two rifles
unfortunately they were of a calliber that i couldnt buy ammo for
arrg
why cant you just buy decent armaments in this gameoverall i would  have to encourage people to buy all the xcom games and shadow watch before  buying this one
and even then i would replay the former titles again  before sending buying this one
firefights in jagged alliance are  needlessly long and indecisive there is little variation between combat  locations and opponents and there is a lot of built in frustration in the  fact that your units are so vastly inferior to those controlled by the  computer
this is a game with a lot of subtle problems that should have  been caught in the beta testingthis is a superb shooting game with lots of realism and strategy incoprorated
graphics are great as is choice of teammates and weaponary
i guess that it pretty realstic in a lot of ways as your team mates get in your way and the terrorists are not as stupid as they are on some other games  they will shoot at you as soon as they see you
but there are times when you shoot at a terrorist and he doesnt die but shoots you instead
it seems to be a problem with the game
there are lots or really weird glitches too
you see dead terrorists levitating and half of them stuck through walls and their legs hanging down through the roof etc
i find it irritating that the designers take so much care to make tyres go down when you shoot them and different sounds when you shoot a bed or a window but then so little detail is given to other aspects such as the lights which dont go out if you shoot them
i have never seen lights like that
goldeneye has lights that pop so why doesnt this
a lot of this game is just too difficult to win at
in addition you get a mission such as the one at the datcha where you must avoid detection   this is really difficult
the idea is to plant a bug and a camera and leave as though youve never even been there
you can go round and shoot al the windows out and still complete the leveland no one will notice that there are windows missing glass everywhere and bullet holes in the walls
my point is if you are going to go for realism then go all the way or not at all
my low rating for this game is due to the problems i have had playing it on the pc
i think its a game with really great potential but you end up waiting all the time while the computer makes grinding sounds which freeze your action but while you are frozen it really impedes playability and you end up getting shot because you cant react
unplayable due to this and i have a powerful computer so thats not the problem
this is overambitious for the pc market and there are things that need rethinking to make it a better gamethis game has no sense of linearity to it at all you spend most of the game trying to figure out where to go next and mostly being wrong
i cant even really say this game was remotely fun to play
in fact the only reason i kept playing was because i was hoping to find some kind of story hidden in this madness but i didntthe game boasts seven different main characters all with their own backgrounds and skills
you can play the game as any one of them while meeting the rest along the way
the problem is that all the intertwining storylines get so crosswired that after a while you dont remember whos character you are really playing and what your original goal wasin the same respect the game is huge
once you get past a certain stage the entire world is left before you and you can go where you want and do what you want without having to stay within the confines of your particular storyline
some people may like this freedom but i found it annoying
i love the idea of being able to explore the world on my own but i never had a sense of purpose throughout the game
i never really knew where to go next and every time i went to a new city i just felt like i was going around in circles and not making any progressneedless to say i havent completed this game and i dont plan on it anytime soon
this game is just bad
if you want to wander aimlessly around a series of cartoony cities each with hidden dungeons and shops and no sense of purpose whatsoever then by all means get this game
i for one would rather spend my money on a nice root canal or perhaps a spinal tapinitially quotsaga frontierquot is quite interesting but unfortunately it quickly bogs down from there
the game offers seven different characters in seven different stories some of which are actually quite interesting this is a very neat idea but the action gets repetitive after exploring the same area in different stories
the fight action is interesting at first but this too gets repetitive in a rather short time
one thing i did like was the backgrounds some of them were just beautifully rendered
unfortunately the charactermonster graphics just did not fit in with the background they were two different styles that just did not mesh well with each other
if the game had offered a better combat engine and more unique areas for each character quotsaga frontierquot would have been a pretty good gameand thats being generous
ive never played a more lifeless dull rpg
the dialogue comes off as if it was written by an autistic elementary schooler
i understand the sequel is supposed to be much better but im  afraid ive been scared off for goodthis game was a real letdown for me
i really dislike the rd person camera
and it takes me forever to aim
i own all duke nukem games and this is the worst
look for something elseif you pay over  for the first dragoon game you need to understand its only  levels so dont spend that much when you can get it for  everywhere elsei remember playing this game a few times with my friend
and then i asked him why did he get itover and over
batman forever is based on the so so movie of the same name and as licensed games go developers rush it out the door as soon as possible to make money
so thats one of the many reasons why this game wasnt so greatas some of the other reviewers have stated this game used digitized graphics and controls made popular by mortal kombat at the time
so it looks great for a snes game and uses the batman license
unfortunately everything else about the game sucked
batman and robin both move around like either tanks or robots
basic things like walking and jumping are a chore to do
they each have special moves which are set up like moves you perform in fighting games except they rarely work
the enemies were super hard to beat and it seems every couple of minutes you see a loading screen you should never wait for a game to load if its on a cartridge
add in the lack of save features or continues and you got a hard game that wasnt meant to be played or beatenstay away from this crap even if you are tempted to buy it
it isnt worth it and it turned out to be worse than the bad movie it was based oni reviewed this game a while back on the genesis and yeah its not one of the better batman games thats  sure
with a few minor differences in sound and landscape design of the levels this game is almost identical to the genesis version and that being said your in for a lot of headachesthe set up of this game is very unique
the gameplay mechanics resemble something from mortal kombat or other fighting games but its actually a walkthroughbeatem up style action game though
you can choose as batman or robin and of course with the option of having a  player mode as well
like the genesis version they use real live digitized footage of actors for the sprites in the game so it looks pretty good overall
that is also where a lot of the pros end on this game the rest are consfirst off its extremely hard not just because of the constant barrage of enemies you face but the controls i think may have been designed by a programmer with a really bad sense of humor
the characters do not respond and sometimes feel glitchy and too perform the easiest of moves it takes a very odd button combination
so fighting the constant flow of enemies is super annoying and frustrating
and also the snes is known for having great soundtracks and sound quality in its games not here there are literally  tracks through out the game
othe adventures of batman and robin on the sega genesis is a great batman game and its port on the snes isnt too shabby either check out one of them but avoid this onethe digitized actors give the game an interesting visual style and the levelsbackgrounds bear a decent resemblance to certain sections of the movie
as someone whos played a lot of mortal kombat i thought the controls were decent but i can understand how frustrating gadget usage must be if you arent used to inputting special move commands all the timereally the game just gets boring and repetitive after awhile
theres not a lot to do except beat up thugs and the loading that takes place between each room kills the momentum and gameplay flow
a lack of continues or save feature keeps you from wanting to jump back in when you die
and beyond the graphics in the levels presentation is downright bad with bland elevator music and a weird batcomputer display that tries to move the narrative along
plus what kind of game do you have when the manual doesnt even list how to jump down between floors in a room
player coop does make the game a bit better until you either get stuck or get bored
overall another dud batman licensed gamethey shouldve made this game like the  before it
they just made it too complex and un donkey kong ya know what i meanits ok at first but it gets boring too fast
 at least its not nearly as bad as dk dont get me wrong its an ok game its kinda fun at the same time i dont see why this game is so amazing
the music is suppose to be good i thought it didnt do the snes sound chip any justice
gameplay is quite repetitive i know a lot of games can be repetitive but its a repition that bores me
your constantly locating stuff that got boring
but i will say if i was bored or just killing time before i go out it would be good for a few rounds to play
the story line is pretty impressive so i guess the game deserves props in that area
the game is good in its own little ways but i just dont rank it up there with some of the other classics
i have some friends that love this game so i guess i respect it for what it isthis review was updated on july th ive changed my mind about super mario world and actually think it deserves  stars
i was just in a bad mood when i originally gave the game a star rating
it turns out super mario world is not just a game you can enjoy growing up in the early s
it actually has a lot of replay value and years later our children can enjoy super mario world the same way we didi still stand by what i say in the original review the donkey kong country series for example came along with a similar idea and made it more exciting imo so if i were you id go with one of those games instead of super mario world
for the most part the levels in the dkc series feel different from each other plus they feel more creative and memorable
unfortunately many of the levels in super mario world are all basically the same and as a result i feel exhausted after playing the game for two hoursto put it another way in super mario world it feels like youre going through the levels simply to collect coins and extra lives
in the donkey kong country series you pretty much do the same thing except bananas instead of coins but it seems like the dkc series offers more creativity in the level design which allows you to look forward to each stage and think to yourself i wonder what cool thing i get to do in this stage
its not like that in super mario world
i still believe that but ive recently come to change my mind a little and think that even though most of the levels in super mario world feel the same thats not necessarily a bad thing
i also dont think the graphics in smw are as nice as many reviewers think
they sort of look blocky but to their credit nintendo games have always had plenty of pretty colors which is a plusso go ahead and buy super mario world if you want to experience the joy of oldschool mario the games my generation grew up with
after all its mario and mario games always have something decent going for them except mario is missing but with time weve come to realize that game never even existed
super mario world is basically super mario bros  but without all the cool mario suits and less creative worlds
i like in super mario bros  how you have water desert air plant and ice worlds in addition to more
in super mario world you just have unusual worlds such as chocolate island and forest of illusion
those arent as neat as the worlds in super mario bros   super mario world should have been the best mario game yet but nintendo took a few steps back but with a monster like super mario bros  i guess it would have been difficult to make a better mario game right after itanother problem in super mario world is that if you want to get a perfect score  you not only have to reach the goal in every single level but you also have to find and grab a key in certain levels but not all levels have keys
this means you have to go through many levels a second time
its sort of boring
once is enough
the concept of collecting keys wasnt a good one
i guess the good part is that if you are wearing a cape you can quickly fly through the levels except for water levels and any level where the screen pushes you to the right but thats not fun either because all you do is continue flying and pushing the back button to stay up high in the air until you reach the goal or the key
however at the end of the day none of this is really enough to make the game bad in any way
i just get tired of itgo ahead and get it
yes its a classicthis game has great graphics an excellent bit redo of the original soundtrack and an overall awesome game
but after the famous title sequence ended and the game started i was left in frustration
level one put me against thousands of dinosaurs scorpions and worms
after  unsuccessful minutes i used the flawed game genie ram editor to give myself invincibility and level  became a snap
level two started
i was put in mode  with a land speeder not good considering the age of the game
the clunky land speeder vehicle could hardly aim at the jawas and once i shot all  of them i zoomed towards the sand crawler
level  begins
it was an awful platformer with enemies that knock you back to the ground
luke cant even jump high enough to reach half the platforms
even with the genie granting my wishes it was still an impossible messi never got into the hype of mortal kombat when it came out in arcades it was good on arcade while the game lasted and then shipped to sega and snes
playing it on snes was pretty boring for me for three reasons
one was the lack of blood
it was probably the most interesting feature of the arcade game
two was the controller problem
i could never get a lot of moves done the way i asked for
three was the sheer boredom of it
the game is very one dimensional for me
there is not much to do except memorize the combo moves for each player and then the fatality move
after them there is nothing else anymore
the tournament is interesting but once the ladder is climbed to the top thats it
there isnt much to be said
all in all mortal kombat doesnt cut it for memortal kombat was really weak on the snes because it was so censored
no blood some people had different fatalities ex johnny cages foot in your stomach
blood was traded for sweat 
and because of those  reasons the game was truly brought down a notchyes its still a classic but its not worth it on snes
youre better off getting it on the sega system because that way you could overcome the censorship and at least put in a quotblood codequotpersonally id skip this one anyday and go straight to mk ii because that was just all out better than mk and it was a lot more enjoyable had better replay and a lot more characters
trust me skip mk on snes and go straight for mk ii on sneswhen mortal kombat  was released on the arcades nearly a decade ago it immediately became a huge hit
it was so realistic and the handtohand combat style was so extreme
the game also centered around controversy due to the incredibly unique violent content
fans anxiously awaited for the games arrival on home video game consoles
when it was released to the super nintendo fans wasted no time purchasing it
however the happy fans were quickly disappointed when they discovered mortal kombat to be edited
thanks to acclaim and nintendo this game has no blood amp guts
the fatalities are edited and toned down
the blood has been changed to sweat
mk fans were ripped off and very angry about the censorship in the game
at least the sega genesis version of mk had a blood code
the super nintendo version plays a lot like the arcade hit
the graphics sound music and animation play equivelant to the arcade
but without the bloody violence and original fatalities its just not the same
this is still an okay fighting game though which is why i gave it two stars instead of one
too bad its so old
i could do without it
mk ii and mk iii are a heck of a lot better
dont waste your money on this
rent it if you canbecause you need something like that to make this game interesting and enjoyable because its that bad
seriously this game sucks the graphics were great for the bit the sound isnt all that bad and thats were it stops
the gameplay is full of glitches and other issues
there is no blood though youll see a lot of sweat maybe some tears but no blood
you cant leave that out of the deal also the game was just censored to death
the combination of the bad gameplay and lack of originality that should have come from the arcades killed this version
i remember you could trip someone half way across the screen
 its just a dumb gameif you wanna make it good like i said in the begining get some beer and other things possibly get drunk and then maybe you might find it entertaining
other than that avoid this one but check out the sequeli missed the original mortal kombat in arcades and was introduced to the series through wordofmouth about how violent the title was
really if this was the only version id played i wouldve never gussed what all the hype was aboutgraphics and audio are pretty good far surpassing what the genesis version was offering and staying pretty true to the arcade version
gameplay however is a failure
nevermind that the fatalities have been changed and the blood turned to sweat  the actual fighting is stiff and unresponsive and it feels like the fighters have their feet glued to the floor
the only move that works well here is scorpions spear and its so smooth in its execution that it becomes the best way of landing cheap hitslook at mk objectively bad controls less characters than street fighter less moves a limited number of environments with no background animation though the pit idea was rather cool
the first installment was truly one that sold based on the strength of its gore and on the snes were deprived of that as wellmk fans might or might not want this version for completion purposes since it looks graphically like the arcade but removes all the violent content
everyone else should jump to mkii which really got the series startedthis is one of those snes games that makes me wonder how hardcore gamers were back in the s
its freakin impossible
the idea is hilarious but shaq has terrible moves and everyone else has amazing moves and super intelligent aidont pay too much for this game but its good for a few laughsi love shaq fuand i dont care what anybody else thinksits just so badthat its goodfunny charactersterrible ridiculous storyits greatthis game has become something of a cult classicbut the snes version is very watered down compared to the genesis gameit is missing charactersbackgrounds and a few other things as wellthe storyline is pretty much the samebut since characters are missingsome of the storyboards will be missing toothrough the story modegraphics and sound are a bit better than the genesis versionsince this is on snesplus the controls are easieralthough that wouldnt really matterjust as long as your using a six button controller on the genesisoverallif you love a good laugh at something awfulenjoy the full experience and get shaq fu for sega genesis insteadthis game is regularly voted as one of the worst video games of all time if not the worst and i wont argue with that but i think that the game is actually strangely fascinating
its so bad its actually comical
in fact its even almost like it was intended to be that way although im sure it wasnt
the game has a storyline that makes minus zero sense
the way it starts is shaq is in japan before a charity basketball game and he comes to this karate dojo by the way there is a bit of prominent pepsi product placement hows that for alliteration
here where an old man informs him that he shaq that is is the magic one and that he again shaq must go into another dimension to rescue some kid named nezu
then shaq goes through this portal into the other dimension
the story begs multitudinous questions and never answers a single one unless ive missed or forgotten something or more than one thing
some examples just why is shaq the magic one the only one who can rescue nezu
why cant anyone else do it
why was nezu kidnapped in the first place
why is there a portal to the other dimension inside the dojo
how does the old man know that shaq is the magic one that is the one who must rescue nezu
this next question doesnt really have so much to do with the story but just exactly how do you pronounce nezu
nezoo
neezoo
nayzoo
if i tried to list all of the questions that the storyline and other things in the game make me ask the list would probably go on for miles before i finished it
as for the actual game part i really dont think that it looks or sounds that bad although many other games including other snes games have done much better
i wouldnt say that the controls are that good though
your opponents are really bizarre  a catlady a mummy who is the main bad guy and assorted other weirdos
before each match you and your opponent engage in a bit of smack talking  bad smack talking at that
it seems that your opponents all have much better moves than you do they can whip your butt in no time
i find it odd that shaq has no basketballrelated moves shouldnt he at least have the ability to throw basketballs at his opponents
by the way get a load of the mummy guys name sett ra
those who are familiar with ancient egyptian deities or at least their names will probably get a laugh out of that
and for those of you who may not want the ending of the game spoiled skip the following paragraphthe game ends as ridiculously as it begins almost
shaq returns to earth with nezu in time for that charity basketball game  and who is there at the game but shaqs enemies from the other dimension or at least a couple of them anyway
then shaq dishes out a little more smack talk and thats itoverall a supremely cheesy game
it really makes no sense that shaq is even on the game
the game indeed appears to have been mainly just a cheap attempt to cash in on shaqs thencelebrity as he was very big at the time making a truly good game let alone one where shaqs presence actually makes sense doesnt seem to have been a priority
if you like games with storylines that make actual sense any sense at all this definitely isnt one of those games
if you like games that play really well this isnt one of those games either
but if you just want a game that is good for a few laughs even if that was unintentional this game might work for you though it certainly isnt worth paying much fori think the game play is great the music was good but the main thing that made me give this a low rating are none other than the lacking of the graphics they are absolutely horrible and it makes it really hard to see where you going sometimeswell thats all i got to say this game would have been great if it werent for the attrocious graphics and i think the pc version was alot bettersuper wrestlemania was pretty good back in  but later snes wwf games were much better and made this one look secondrate
the graphics were decent the sound was okay future wwf snes games improved on both graphics and soundroyal rumble and raw had very good music for a snes game and raw actually had a decent intro similar to the wwf monday night raws  opening for the tv show but where it really lacks is it features just a few modes of play  singles match player vs computer or player vs player and tag team match one player vs computer one player vs another player and two players together vs computeryou wont find any tournament modes in this one so you wont be able to go for the world wrestling federation championship the real world heavyweight title slappy
future snes wwf games allow you to go for the gold wwf world title in royal rumble and both wwf world title and wwf tag title in wwf raw
youd be better off with either royal rumble or rawljn was a subsidiary of acclaim entertainment created to make more games for the nes and it continued into the snesgenesis era
one of their first games they released for the snes was wwf super wrestlemania in  while it was great to see a game with the wwf license it only turned out to be a forgettable wrestling game that sorely lacked content and varietywwf super wrestlemania lets you take control of one out of eight wrestlers
from there you can choose to play a one player game to go against the computer a  player vs game to go against another player or a tag team mode where you and another player take on a computer controlled tag team
whoever pins the other person first is the winner of the match
thats pretty much the entire game
there is nothing else to do but to tweak the options before or after the matchthe pros for its time the graphics and sounds were top notch
the controls were simple enough so it doesnt take long before you pull off punches kicks body slams and jumping off from the top rope
the wrestlers look good enough that you recognize them
finally  player support means you can take on a friend anytime you wanted when you get tired of playing against the computerthe cons the problems here are few but bothersome
first off you only have  wrestlers and that is a small selection to choose from
second the game modes are scarce there arent any main story or tournament modes to play through
one player  player vs and tag team modes are no different from each other
even though they look like the real wrestlers the ingame wrestlers dont have any of their trademark moves
they all move the same and have the same basic moves so it didnt matter which wrestler you play with
then there is the ring you fight in
theres only one ring you fight in
the crowd cheers for you in the background but it loops constantly so it will eventually get on your nerves
at this point the game starts to get very repetitive with no real purpose other than to fight over and over again
clearly ljn just wanted this game out there since there were new gaming consoles that people were buying at the timeit was fun playing this game for a while but afterwards it got boring
the lack of game modes variety in the rings and the absence of trademark moves for the wrestlers just makes wwf super wrestlemania feel like a generic wrestling game without any of the things that mirrored the world wrestling federation at the time
if youre looking for a good snes wrestling game get royal rumble insteadthe original wrestlemania was in no way at all a good game
it was boring slow and every wrestler had the same exact moves and more or less looked the samewrestlemania wasnt meant to be a stand out game
i think it was meant to be the beginning of something else because after this came wwf royal rumble and wwf raw which some of us plated to deathi would surpass this one and go straight to either wwf royal rumble or wwf rawthe game is slow and there is no wrestling movesbut you get outside the ring action with any wrestlerps if you want wrestling get wwf raw or the royal rumble for snesgiven the prerelease hype from game sites i was really anticipating this game as the contender for the best rts this year
im pretty disappointedthe good first the game looks very nice
it has that same  technoorganic look as battlezone  not surprising since the same guys did  it
it runs fairly nice aside from the crashes
the framerate and overall  running is probably the smoothest ive ever seen on a d rts even  homeworld
the interface is also quite well thought out and a step forward  over other d rtss particularly the ease of camera movementother than  that the game is a dog
sorry fanboys but i have to call it like i see  it
gameplay is a real snoozer tons of dicking around and not much combat
everything is just deliberately slowaircraft move as slowly as infantry  on foot et cetera
if you are looking for fast furious exciting  gameplay this is not the place to find itthe unit pathfinding is set  up in such a way that they all move one at a time so that they dont  obstruct each other
thus youll move one unit and if any others are in  its way they will all agonizingly move one at a time to new positions so  the mover can get through
in any movement of groups this problem is ten  times as bad
youll watch in frustration as your units get ripped to  shreds while they stupidly maneuver into position before they start  returning fireno real story is going on here there are no characters  and nothing happens inside of a mission to alter the plot
there are some  vague cutscenes between the missions but theyre so irrelevant that you  could have just played the missions and made up your own story to string  them togetheroverall i regret having bought the game
i cant  recommend it unless youre compelled to get an rts fixi am a huge fan of vampire fiction in any form and also enjoy a good rpg
so i was ecstatic when i heard about vampire being translated from the penandpaper sources to the computer
and vampire is an amazing looking  game that i really wanted to like
unfortunately some bad design choices  and poor features prevented it from happeningill start with the good  points
the graphics are stunningly amazing
the animation of the  characters is fluid and weapons are superbly done
the lighting greatly  enhances the dark and sinister atmosphere
i kept going in many places  because i wanted to see what area i would visit next
the camera control  is also very smooth and easy to manipulate with the mouse
the gameplay is  actually fun for the first bit of the game while you are adventuring by  yourself and with one other party member
the source material and the  manual add a lot to this game
wandering around towns and seeing people  milling about made it feel alive
and it was always oh so fun to feed upon  someone to refill your blood levelthe rpg system is also great
there  are several positive and detrimenatl traits for the characters
a certain  level of blood must be maintained to use the disciplines spellsskills  and to keep your character from succombing to frenzy
experience points  can be distributed among such traits as strength dexterity intelligence  willpower and several others
very nicely done indeedhere is where i  have to get in to the demerits of this game
first off the voice acting  is not very good but its not the worst ive heard either
and the  sequences of dialogue are long and boring
the characters simply stand in  place and wave their hands about
npc interaction is left to a few  choices which really have little baring on the outcome of the game
nothing as rich and detailed as planescape tormentthe combat while  fun and reminiscent of diablo only keeps its spark for the first part of  the game
most of it consists of clicking on an enemy and waiting until  youve hit them enough times for them to die
a big flaw that becomes  noticable during the first few levels is that the enemies wait until you  are in range before they attack
they will simply stand idle as you  slaughter others in the same room
as the game progresses you will gain  party members and will bemoan similarly incompetant ai
i equipped one  with a bow and laughed in disbelief as he continuously fired in to a wall  when he should have moved a couple steps to the side before doing so
also you can control the other members of your party in combat but the  main character will stop fighting while you are doing so
aaahhhh
add to  this that you can go through entire areas and clean up with little to no  problem but then come across certain areas that will be nigh impossible to  pass
both enemies and your fellow party members will get hung up on  walls doors and other obstacles in the roomand here we come to the  worst sin of the game the save system
saving is automatically handled  when you transition between levels are areas
the only other way to save  is to be in your haven or safe area
one can get there by using the walk  the abyss discipline aka spellskill
but it takes a while before you  have one of these in a given area
so we are left hacking our way back  through areas and levels already completed
i found myself abusing the  autosave feature by running back and forth between levels to save
but  what if more than one person is playing the game as is the case on my  computer
its pretty much tough luck
this is a computer game not a  console
the game should have been balanced so that players could save  anywhere at anytimethe multiplayer sounds enticing with the ability for  one person to take control of the npcs and monsters
but if the gameplay  is similar to the singleplayer then i cant see it being much  betterwith great graphics a rich source material and so much  potential
it makes me sad to not be able to like this game
this takes  me back to revenant another game with a lot of potential but came up  flacid
maybe the patches will fix the problems i certainly hope so
but  much has to be done for the ai to make this game worthyhow many times do we have to tell game designers that game saves are an integral part of any game
game designers this is a pc game youre designing and not a console game
lets start with the bad points as im  sure all the readers would like to read first
the game committed the most  sinful act of not providing a save game feature accessible anytime and  anywhere in the game
you could only save the game when it loads a new  scene or level
i was in a dungeon for  hours realtime dying and i  couldnt save the game because you have to walk out of the dungeon to make  the game reload the level and save your points
this is crazy
this is an  rpg were playing here
i mean final fantasy iii console game had built  in save points in the dungeons
why cant a pc game like this have one
this  is a real turnoff
next is the interface
i still have to figure out how  to properly move the character
its so hard to control the camera as you  move the character in the game
the view pans out then suddenly pans in
the game tried to make its interface unique and it ended up making the game  more complex
graphics are good
nice colors voice acting was ok you need  a good sized system though to run this game like a piii  and mb video  card
story well this game completely ignored the pen and paper version  with too many battles in it
i beat the game in  hours
so there really  isnt much there to expect
will you buy this game
i say dont buy it until  they patch the game with a save feature
if youre after a rpg then look  somewhere elsei recieved my pre ordered copy of stv elite force today and i have already played through the game
i will share some of my impressions with youthe story is fairly entertaining though the gameplay doesnt let you do anything but exactly what you are supposed to
you cannot just wander around the ship and explore except for a few rooms at a time
the level of detail missing is fairly disappointingthe enemies nearly always shoot for you even when there are other crew members in your teamthe enemies are very stupid and easy to kill most of the timethe maps leave no room for error in navigation
you are directed to the next phase of the map because that is the only way you can go
this gets old after a whilesome of the exits from the rooms are frustratingly hard to figure out which is not only boring in my opinion but also takes away from the enjoyment of the game by drawing out the mission unnecessarilythe weapons are ok pretty standard first person shooter faresome of the voices are badly done
seven of nines voice especially
it doesnt even sound like the actor that plays her in the tv show most of the time
i have my doubts she did the voice for the gameif you have played soldier of fortune also by activision this game will not be all that exciting
the characters in the game move exactly like they do in sof
dying borg do that silly spinning fall just like the guys in sof did
they could have at least done some animation work that was original in this gameneelix is way too tall and looks dumbthe levels and savegames are frustratingly slow to load
a loading image comes up in the lower left hand side of the screen and just doesnt seem to go very fast im running a p  with mb of ram and a mb video card in case you wonderedthe scenes in between the gameplay are pretty well done but tend to be drawn out and uninformative at timesall things considered this is a just ok game
if you have played sof you will find this fairly similar and not quite as fun probably
if you havent played sof then you should and not this because sof is more fun
if you are a trekkie looking for some interaction though basic and very juvenille you will find some here and thus probably like this game just from the fantasy aspect
if you just like killing computer conrolled enemies and are looking for a fairly mindless shooting game this is your babytwo stars because like i said this is soldier of fortune in spacethis is a semidecent game
it will keep your attention for about  hours
basically you play the federation klingon borg or romulans
you control ship production and deployment
of course there is mining and resource  management
for the most part this is basically star craft with star trek  ships
the graphics are mediocre and the ai is horrible
the ai doesnt  rebuild once you destroy the enemy bases
i would wait on this game until  it goes into the sale bin and it will head there fast
this could have  been a really promising game the ship designs and attributes are okand i  like the feature of being able to transport troops onto enemy ships and  then take it over
aside from that there really isnt anything special  about this gamethumbs downi was unimpressed with this game
the races are too similar to each other
the ships within each race do not differ much except in size
mouse control is painfully sluggish
space is twodimensional  resource collection is uncreative
several ship classes are missing such as the intrepids
only  ships can be selected at a time
whether i played the borg or the federation i got the feeling that i was just building the same things with different graphics in a copy of starcraftgenerally a rather halfhearted effort at a realtime strategy game
its not bad really its just that there are much better games out there
like armada iido not even assume for a moment that star trek armada has any resemblance to relics homeworld the two are about as closely related as woody allen is to arnold schwarzengger
first off it has the longest install process  of any game i have ever played and i have a x cdrom drive
second the  interface is monstrous even though it looks elegant and simple
while  positioning ships is easy and it should be since they only move in   dimensions there is no real sense of scale plus they have a tendency to  bump into objects like space stations and other ships
secondly the  instant they see an enemy ship any vessel you control within weapons  range automatically opens fire taking interaction down a notch
also  unlike homeworld the user cannot assign formations to his ships making  dispersement messywhen the game starts the user is treated to a  rather nicely rendered opening scene with lots of fleet action between  federation klingon romulan and borg vessels that culminates on an allout  run on borg cubes
though one wonders how picard can face down locutus  since they are the same guy
did the borg clone picard
unfortunately the  game doesnt deliver anywhere near the excitement generated by a  minute  opening segue
at the title screen you have a choice to play a series of  missions as either the federation klingon romulan and borg and they all  must be played before arriving at the finale mission
overall the game  seems to have been slapped together to capitalize on the franchise lacking  both the quality and substance that lucasarts has put into their star wars  line of games
armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like homeworld  or even starcraft
if you changed the space scapes to ground and the  starships to zerg or protoss units armada would be starcraft except not  as much funarmada prolongs the star trek game curse when it should  have shattered it
the prospect of moving a fleet of defiant and sovereign  class starships around the screen should have been an easy game to create
perhaps if activision had optioned the homeworld engine for armada things  would have been different
however on the upside the rendered starships  do look nice as does the d lighting for all of the effects shots
getting  patrick stewart michael dorn and denise crosby to do voices will probably  get diehard trek fans to purchase the game to feed their piranalike  frenzy for franchise merchandise but style should never win out over  substance in a game like this
there is very little meat to this gamedo yourself a favor power up your warp engines and get away from this  title as fast as you canthe game idea was good but the running and loading lock up the computer or slows it to a crawlmax payne has been in development for approximately  years and it took all that time to publish a  game that doesnt include a multiplayer mode very very few cut scenes and one boring character who has the constant look of constipation or a reaction to stinky feet on his face  of the time its really very annoyingthe whole game revolves around bullet time a nifty idea that is great when its simply another feature in a game but to have the entire game built around it is simply boringmax payne consists of running into a dark room shooting everybody then moving on to the next room wash rinse and repeat over and over and overon top of that you get to read incredibly corny john woo style whatever that is dialogue read bad cliches and cinematic flairthe story revolves around you finding your wife and child shot by someone and you go out for revenge as a renegade cop of sorts and uncover a large conspiracy
the characters are completely uninteresting look much too similar and the comic book style text which breaks things up are as boring and dull as an episode of nypd bluemax payne shouldve been cheaper for the game itself is only about  or so hours long has little tono extras and limited replayabilityshooting people in slow motion simply isnt enough to knock my socks off i guessi really did not think i would like this game
but it is both challenging and fun
this is unlike any other game i have ever played
worth buying most definetlyi just finished mp and it only took me a day and a half
judging from other comments on amazon im not the only person to have finished the game in such a short time
the graphics are a real mix
the cool particle engine shines as a stunning example of what we can look forward to in the next generation of game engines but the scenery and background art looks brown and dull throughout the entire game  think quake without the aliens and youre not far offthe games one quotgimmickquot of a slomotion play mode is fun for the first couple of hours then just gets boring
i wish they had spent more time on producing a story it has every cheesy cliche in the book and is presented by a dull expressionless monotone narrationthe game was so gripping that i just had to go and fill in my yearly tax return instead
dont buy the hype buy a decent game insteadone main gimmick the bullettime feature and some decent graphics
thats all this overrated game really offers
and not only is it a  trick pony but its a very short one tooyou can finish it the same day you receive itsuffice it to say max payne is just poor value all round
its obvious most of the reviewers here either dont have the game or reviewed it while still in their hour honeymoon with it
its incredible how much a couple of days can sober ones opinion of this lackluster game
my two cents
save your money and dont bother till it hits the bargain bini heard terrific things about giants citizen kabuto and was sadly disappointed when i finally purchased and played it for myself
the most obvious annoyance was the lack of an in game save option
i just dont have patience to play the same mission over and over
and over
if you believe patience is a virtue you can develop it playing this game
as for me i couldnt even stand to finish itthe graphics are smooth and intense
the controls even though initially confusing are pretty good
ive gotten pretty far in this game as well  out of  levels completed after playing many many hours on this  gamesound good right
wrong
the difficulty of the dreamcast version  is terrible
i had been in the consolecomputer game business a while  back and one of the main flaws i noticed is that computer game developers  are hardcore gamers developing games for hardcore gamers
this is a  classic example
given enough time many  people could pass this game
however there are limits
after all its  just a game and should only take a maximum  hours to complete
this is  well beyond the  hoursunless you live and breathe video games and  you find ninetynine percent of all games too easy stick to another game
i cannot stress this enough
it is nearly impossible to complete for any  normal personthe goodfor the first time command star wars imperial and rebellion units in real time
the sound is truly the most excellent part of the game the unit sounds are fantastic and the metalized version of the  imperial theme is a nice touch
graphics are a bit dated but i feel  theyve done a good job with what they had using a dated d enginethe  badthe main menu and the user interface for controlling your force  looks extremely tackedon in a lastminute fashion and should have been  done much better
the interface makes controlling units a chore
this is  a common deficiency in recent lucasarts games though
the d perspective  takes time to master and until you do master it youll lose alot
this  combined with the interface reduces you to alot of micromanagement which  can get problematicthe worst aspect of the game is how resources are  derived
the game works on a system of quotcommand pointsquot whereby  you are rewared with the capability to purchase more resources when you are  succesful in combat
this sounds like it might have been innovative but  in this implementation what happens both in the single player and  multiplayer game is that the player or computer who wins early skirmishes  gets access to greater numbers of units and advancements thus quickly  overwhelming their opponent
this condition where the outcome is decided  from the start and youve virtually no way to recover from an early falter  causes frustration and represents to me poor designif you are an  absolute freak about star wars you might enjoy this game because youll be  able to reenact the battle of hoth and other scenarios
if however you  want an excellent realtime strategy game try starcraft or age of empires  ii
if you want strategy in d homeworld is also an excellent beti am a true star wars fan and i collect everything and love all the movies but this was definatley not an enjoyable game
sadley the gameplay did not come natural so there was a learning curve
the graphics were behind the times and character movement was horribloe
i even often found atst getting stuck up against a wall and unmoveable  a total frustrating moment
yes this is star wars and yes it is great on that respect
however compare it to any rts that came out a few years prior to it and you would be still dissapointed
im sure lucasarts will try again soon hopefullythis version of risk i thought was an overall bad idea because it just played of the original
furthermore  the original risk  disk was more than good enough in every department
the company who released this video game was just trying to update the game in which didnt needed to be updated
bad job over allalthough this game has different playability than risk  and good graphics it is the cheatenist game ive ever played it is nigh impossible to win these games except only occasionally and by then you are too worn out from trying to win to enjoy iti would not bother with it stick with risk  the originalim an old risk player from way back i used to play the board game with my brother in law many years ago and i have the pc version of original riskand even though that game cheats as do all computer games its not near half as bad as risk this is my least favorite game in the franchise
pinball does not count
the lack of a map and annoying chozo ruins music severely limit the enjoyment
however i do reccommend playing the st area of this game and then playing the amr demo
you will not believe the difference
i cant wait for amr
god bless milton guastitake everything wrong with mega man  and  on the nes and you get this
your fired shots travel way too slow on the game boy and these stages especially the fortress and space station at the end of the game are nearly impossible
plus if you lose in either you have to start over and that means if you die at the end of the fortress at the hands of a robot leader you have to fight the whole way back to them and any you beat must be beaten againrobot leaders wave one elec man cut man fire man ice manfortress robot leaders bubble man flash man heat man quick man and this aint no masterpiece and is for mega man diehards onlyearly levels are easy but watch out when you do the hard ones  the ai is brutalif you want to play the original that started it all this might be for you but if you just wanted one of the mario kart series look for the ds version or the one on wiii keep trying to force myself to play this thing because all  i read are rave reviews for itbut im not feeling it
first off half of the sound effects are downright annoying that crying baby mario makes me reach for the power button every timecouldnt they have thought of something else
then there are the controls which i find much less intuitive than other mario gameseven the way yoshi jumps is offits way too slow
even if i look past those issues i still dont find myself having fun while playing this game
wheres the funlike i said i do not like rpgs and especially this one
i have it because of course its mario and im willing to try any mario
it takes so long to beat it because the rpg and it gets on ur nerves when u cant beat a boss or enemy and u have to restart and beat them
at the begining it has some cheesey video of what happend to peach
it took me forever to beat it and as soon as i did i felt much better and it did not seem as much as a dumb game
the graphics r ur ordinary snes graphics and the sound is not as good as most snes games
i dont like it because its an rpg but the only reason i keep it is because it adds to the collection and my little cousin loves to play iti dont get the appeal of the wipeout games
theyre terrible
wipeout  and xl are no different
the music is good enough for a bunch of techno beats yeah im not a techno fan and the graphics are slick and futuristiclooking but the actual racing part has one big problem you keep hitting the side of the track as you go around a turn and for some reason that means you have to make a complete stop
it wouldnt be so bad if you just slowed down but the fact that your vehicle stops immediately is the worst thing everhow are you supposed to enjoy a racing game if you keep hitting the side of the track and stopping every couple seconds
theres so many turns in any one of the races that the problem is unavoidable
i dont understand when people say you need skill to enjoy these racing games
if i cant increase speed then what else is there to enjoy
if the appeal lies in playing each race over and over so you can memorize the track to avoid hitting the side then count me out
doing that would be way too tedious of a task
you need a lot of space to freely drive around or else a racing game wont worksure i can go around shooting other vehicles but who cares about that when i cant ever catch up to them
too many sharp turns in the wipeout series make it difficult to build up speed
right when i think ive got a good race going i hit the side and my car stops and there goes the momentum
what a way to kill the funbuy if you want a slap of crapi purchased a brand new factory sealed sega genesis  over months ago
it is very light weight and compact compared to the earlier versions
however in decreasing size and weight sega has also diminished the qualityi was very excited when i first recieved the sega genesis  console
unfortunely this excitement quickly faded
after plugging in the controllers to the connection port over dozen times the ports began to pull away from the exterior casing and pushing inward where you could not even plug in the controller anymoreon top of this the controller ports are fastened to the power switch circuit board which also pulled back with the ports causing the power switch to become inoperative
after removing the casing and leaving it off permanetly i was then able to plug the controllers into the exposed ports and use the system correctlyobviously this is not the way you want to use or care for your brand new system
now that circuit boards are exposed they are susceptible to far more complications with dust and possible component detachmentcould this issue have been a onceinamillion fluke
sure but after spending over  for the brand new sega genesis  i will not take a chance at purchasing another due to the fact that it does feel rather fragile and flimsy
i would recommend the sega gensis  over this model or even take my chances with the newofficially licensed sega genesis gen core system w  sega games builtin  cartridge slotno matter how good you are at this game nothing can prepare you for the lame cheap fest your in for
i beat this game countless times but it never stops pissing me off that the enemies are so cheap the game is so unfair and how they use the screen layout to their advantage
half the time no matter what you do you cant move because your getting gang raped and your sword magically goes through enemies running past you preparing for the gang rape then your screwed
i love games that are challenging but not insanely hard just because of crippled controls and cheapness
fun for a little while but the cheapness is too muchremember the moment in the movie jurassic park when dr grant raced across the plains of the jungle on the back of a galimums while shooting his machine gun at attacking helicopters
how about when he trecked through ancient aztec ruins while shooting flame thrower equiped janitors
and dont forget the time he ran around on a cargo ship while blowing up floors and engines with his arsenal of grenadeswhat
you dont recall those action packed moments
neither do i but thats whats presented in the sega genesis game jurassic park rampage edition
jurassic park rampage edition jpre takes an alternate more action paced look at the classic story of dinosaurs gone amok on a jungle island
where in the books and the movies grant was a quiet paleontologist who just wanted to dig up ancient bones in the desert here hes become a super military commando who makes rambo look like ronald mcdonald
where in the movie and books grant was focused on getting off the island without becoming dinosaur food here hes shooting everyone and everything in sightwhich isnt necessarily a bad thing due to the fact that everyone and everything on the island is out to kill himit should be said up front right now
jpre is the most unintentionally silliest games ive ever played
all the little factors add up to create an experience that is so silly and so dorky in all its aspects that one cant help but chuckle when you look back on the experiencewhere to begin
well lets start with the other humans
for some reason jurassic park is populated with thousands of soliders and janitors both who are equipped with military weapons and are for some reason out to kill you
no matter where you go youll find dozens of soldiers and janitors shooting at you and chucking grenades in your direction luckily grant can survive multiple grenade hits so its not too much of a problem
its a mystery why these guys are out to kill you when theres no logical reason to it
furthermore they seemed to have made an alliance with the local dinosaurs because they never attack them and the dinosaurs never attack them as well
it seems that poor grant is under the crosshairs of every single living thing on the islandevery stage you go through in the game with the exception of grants final level is packed to the brim with a riddiculous number of soldiers janitors raptors compys spitters and even a triceratops or two
how do you deal with these threats
heres a hint
you run
you run your stubbly little legs as fast as you can
while the whole point of jpre is to be an action packed game where you shoot every living thing in sight its simply much more efficent to just run and jump your way to the exit with this method you can finish the game in about twenty minutesif you want you can go through the game and try to kill everything with your enormous arsenal of weapons more on those later its simply not really worth the effort
for one thing youll probably get hit a lot trying to inflict damage on your enemies
trying to kill raptors is a pain in the butt due to faulty hit detection
a raptor or two will jump next to you and start bitting and whacking away with thier tails as you frantically fire your shotgun over and over again trying to hit them yet they take no damage
so you leap away and start firing and finally kill them after several shots
as a result of not being able to hit them at point blank range youve lost th of your health and a lot of ammo has been wasted
when attacking kamikazie soldiers and janitors its very common to have several grenades chucked in your direction before you even get a shot off
result
loose health before you even take out one guyand lets not even talk about the wackiest enemy in the game
attack helicopters
yes thats right
when going through the savanna level grant is constantly being assaulted by attack helicopters that fire rockets at him
when i saw one coming onto the scren for the first time i had to pause the game because i was laughing too much to keep going
here i was just trying to get across that blasted savanna being attacked by grenade chucking soldiers and machine gun equipped janitors and here im being attacked by an attack helicopter
what kind of psycho island is this
thankfully these helicopters can be driven away by shootingof all thingstranquilizer darts into them
wheefortunitly to counter the threat of attack helicopters and flamethrower equipped janitors you have an enormous arsenal of military grade weapons at your disposal
no longer satisfied with gas grenades and puny tranquilizer pistols from the original jurassic park game on the sega genesis grant has an arsenal of death dealing weaponry ranging from shotguns to machine guns to rockets and death dealing grenades
all of these get the job done but the greatest satisfaction comes from using the greatest weapon in the history of video games  the electric gun or as i call it the zappy gun
this amazingly fun weapon doesnt just kill bad guys it disintigrates them
simply fire the gun watch the bolt of electricity go out and when it hits the janitor hell go ogh
 briefly turn into a skeleton and vanish into thin air
it sounds brutal but its absoloutly hilarious to watch
and lets face it disintigrating an incredibly annoying enemey is tremendously satisfying
as an added bonus it also does the disentigration effect on dinosaurs as wellif one wants to have lots of gunning and running action while shooting dinosaurs then youll certianlly get it while playing this game
going through each level pits you against literally hundreds of soliders and dinosaurs so much so that at times its easy to get overwhelmed
fortunitly the game does include a desperatly needed checkpoint system which was missing in the first genesis game
this is the kind of game that you can play two ways
you can run and try to survive to get to the end or you can take your time and kill everything you come across so you do get a bit of freedom when it comes to how you playbut even with all the guns the sillyness of the game and even the checkpointsjpre just isnt much fun to play
as i said earlier its fairly easy to be overwhelmed by enemies in some levels but the game eventually just boils down to run and shoot or just run
there are items you collect for points but those points dont do anythingat its core jpre is a simple run around and shoot em up shooter
it has good graphics some nice music i do like the jazzrock theme but whether you like it or not is really up to personal taste
if you like mindless action games with gunslots of gunsthen you might like this
with many emulators on the internet why not try downloading it and giving it a try
you just might find yourself getting a laugh or two messing around with those crazy janitorsback in  sega released a dull lackluster video game of one of the biggest films of all time
quickly realizing their mistake they hashed out a different version of the game claiming it would be bigger tougher and betterit isnt
its a slow boring gameyou can choose to be either dr alan grant ora raptor
both have their problems
why would dr grant go around killing all those army guys just what are they doing in the game
and why a raptor be killing other raptors
weirdobviously not learning from their first mistake sega really dropped the ball on this socalled rampage edition
one of the slowest sluggish and dullest platformers i have ever playedwhat happens when you take away sonics speed
you get sonic labyrinththis game is more of a puzzleplatformer than an fastpaced platformer
which is why this game gets a  star ratingits honestly hard to believe this game was released in  its the same year that brought us vectorman rayman windows  and its games and lots more stuff movies like toy story
but why sonic has to step into the ring with sonic labyrinth on the game gear is beyond me
yes folks
even classic sonic had skeletons in his closet and this is one of themso apparently sonic happens to be wearing superslow shoes built by none other than dr robotnik
but the question is why
why does sega have to offer us a game that could have been the game gear equivalent for sonic d blast and remove sonics trademark speed
and to have to utilize a stupid storyline to go with it robotnik waits outside sonics house while hes sleeping and gives a speech about his evil plan
this wouldve been much more fun if sonic was sonic
granted he still has the spin dash but youll have to be using that every single time if you want to go somewhere
it gets annoying reallyon top of all that the music for once is terrible and forgettable and while the graphics are decent they wont be able to make up for the utter mess sonic labyrinth has to offer
stick with any other sonic game
sonic labyrinth is not worth the moneythe gameplay of this game is pretty good
original combining the commands and jobs and weapons of final fantasy with the turnbased gridpattern gameplay of dungeons and dragons
it was way too slow though and in an age where a gamer will rap out half an hour of play and then save before heading to school collegejob hourlong tactical battles just suck
especially when you lose most time and have to do them over and over again
but overall itd be a good gameif i could stand to look at itin this modern era of bumpmapping and cg animations that look real as in real a game where my green dot is beating the heck out of your purple square just doesnt do the trick for me
especially when their purple square always strangles the living snot out of my green dot
no way
id be willing to bet that the graphics on the gba are gonna look better than for the psso i played it for three hours and then gave up
i had an entire row of ps generation rpss to suck up my attention such as ffx and its sequel
which might not have the same old grueling fight system but i can actually tell that yuna is a girl not a green dot with brown lines on her headto get the bad out of the way this game is slow tedious and quottacticsquot simply is not a good way to describe it
there is very little tactical combat involved
moves happen immediately as soon as you choose an action
there are no attacks that change the position of enemies so a very large amount of the game is luck regarding the position of your enemies to allow you to cast widerange spells that will annihilate everything
adding to the bad is the downright broken leveling system
essentially it works like this perform an action get experience and job points
regardless of what action you perform
this ends up making you enter a random battle killing all except one enemy and throwing rocks at each other for an hour until you all have leveled up obscenely and can essentially learn any skill now
not very fun
the story is also pretty pathetic the translation makes the game very difficult to understand and the story itself doesnt stand out among other rpgs
personally i dont care for the whole medieval politics setup but it might please some
the good
there are a whole lot of skills and classes to learn and be and the idea of being able to equip two job skills at once makes for some prebattle strategy
for instance you can choose to have a hybrid black and white mage or a knight and a monk or a summoner and a gunman
its a nice little touch
the soundtrack is also pretty decent orchestral stuff that can be catchy at times
nonetheless the whole experience gets very old after a while
the battles are not very diverse you just unload your skills on everyone time and time again the graphics are annoying and the camera can be frustrating and overall it just isnt very fun
get disgaea hour of darkness for the ps instead which does everything much better is deeper and more stylish and much more strategyorienteda jumps and b attacks
that might work on the nes but not on the snes
on the snes in most platformers b jumps and y attacks
failure to comply with this standard pretty much destroyed this game
theres not even a configuration mode to fix the control problem
also graphics are unimproved over the nes
why
the games not all bad though
passwords allow you to continue from the level you left off on which is a major convenience
because of that alone getting this is better than getting the nes titles separatelythis is a mortal kombat clone with huge amounts of blood and two fatalities for each competitor
the only difference with this game is that all of the fighters are prehistoric
two apes a big dinosaur a fire breathing legendary dinosaur a raptor and much more
the gameplay is much like street fighter  and the gameplay is very slow because you are fighting as dinosaurs
another interesting feature is that for those who like to use the same move over and over again the game laughs at you
pretty cheap game rent it before you buy it primal rage is a game about seven dinogods who are set free from their prisons when a disaster strikes quoturthquot in the near future
the players goal is to defeat the other dinogods conquer their lands gain the most number of worshippers and end up ruling the new urth
the concept sounds okay but the game which follows the story is not reallywhen you turn on the game and arrive at the title screen you may think the background bird sounds are cool
but go to the player select screen and from there its all downhill
the sound and music quality is more like that of a sega genesis game
then there are weird scratching noises at times and a horrible quotcontinue screenquot music that will make you drop the controller and run for an asprin
the graphics are slightly easier to handle
the seven monsters are reasonable especially the trex duo sauron and diablo
sometimes however you may find yourself trying to identify which is the head and tail in the middle of the action
the backgroung visuals are also decent
but the fatalitiesare terrible
they are nowhere near the quality of mortal kombat
its hard to actually figure out what they are doing in somethen there are the special moves
some of them are okay like diablos quothot footquot and some of them are not like chaoss quotfartsquot and quotpukequot
talk about weirdness
the character vertigo is ridiculous
a dinosaur with the head of a cobra and the tail of a scorpion
some special moves are hard to identify as what theyre supposed to be
the controls arent quite what youd want
the characters are poor at jumping and even slow and clumsy on ground
its sometimes hard to identify if the move they are performing is a special move or just a normal one
oh i said something of the sort above didnt iso if you want a genesis quality game for your snes youre nuts then you can buy this
but whats the point
the snes has much more eyecandy and easier to control fighting games out there
this is one of the least appealing snes fighting games ive played
if you want some mindless buttonmashing with no real depth and unrealistic amounts of gore this game is for you
incase you dont realise the difference in quality right away play this first and then play street fighter ii turbo mortal kombat or even tmnt tournament fighters
you soon willi guess the people who like this game are kids because this game was seriously not fun and was a boring stale platformer
there is really no fun to be pulled out of this mess and is basically devoid of clear objectives interesting challenges good gameplay or a noticeable storyline
the graphics and character designs look great along with the environments along with some enemy designs
unfortunately all i found myself doing was collecting health killing wierd and stupid enemies and wondering what the hell i was supposed to be doing in this stupid game because apparently the developer did not make your objectives clear by some decision or another
so youll find yourself wandering a lot and trying to do a task all over again
this game is simply a chore and a nightmare to play
if you want to buy a good licensed game on a disney movie go buy the far better aladdin game for snes or genesisit was with great mourning that i retired my gravis xterminator and now i feel like crying a river and pursuing some means of electronic resurrection or wizardry to bring it back i was looking for a controller whether gamepad or joystick that took advantage of usb technology and provided proportional control for drivingracing sims as well as flight sims like xwing alliance and the new crimson skies
i looked around and decided on the dual strike seeing that it had some decent reviews and if i took the time to get past the  hour learning curve for its radical design id have an awesome controller on my hands that would let me do darn near anythingfrankly i was disappointed every step of the way
unlike my old gravis the dual strikes quotschemesquot where you control the function of the programmable buttons have to be loaded seperately under the game controller every time you decide to play a different gamethe gravis automatically adapted recognizing the programs loading upwhen i began to use the buttons i realized how poorly they were actually placed
all to often trying to press one button id wind up pressing another at the same time
the ltagt button top button on right side of controller is almost completely inaccessable and futzing around with the shiftkey during the middle of a firefight is downright dangerous
the triggers where your index fingers rest are a nice attempt to provide what other controllers easily offer but fail in that they activate during rough moves when you least want them to and you forget theyre there when you most need them because they just feel like a solid part of the dual strikes shellthe proportional control the swivelling part on the right does take a while to get used to and once you do its a truly innovative idea when it comes to fpss
great idea offering a lot of flexibility and control
unfortunately the quotcenterquot position is without any form of guidance in the form of internal resistance
youve got to futz around until your character finally stops moving to know when youve found it nothing intuitive about it at all
this was especially problematic when i tried to use the controller for need for speed high stakes and xwing alliance
frankly theres too much going on in sim environs and a greater requirement for an autocentering proportional control than that which the dual strike providesthere are better pads out there youre paying a midrange price for a hightech gimmick on a pad with belowaverage performance
im inclined to give the pad only star because i was really looking for something to help me out on the sims but to be fair it ranks about a  when it comes to fpss but they really have to figure out how gamers use the buttons to make this a decent fps padthe dual strike is an older controller and not supported by microsoft anymore but i knew that when i bought it
still it was cheap and i was desperately searching for something other than my keyboard and mouse with which to play my computer games
the biggest problem i found with the dual strike is that it isnt supported by any of the more recent games currently out there and the configuration app that comes with it doesnt workat least not on win 
i did end up purchasing a nice little program called xpadder which allows you to configure andor rearrange any button on your keyboard and mouse to your keyboard or mouse or any other controller device you may have hooked up
xpadder made configuring the dual strike to any game i liked very easyit also helps configure my mouse and keyboard to games that dont really support in depth key bindings
so now i have the dual strike and a means to configure it to my games
my next issue was that i couldnt get use to the funky way dual strike works
i think its a controller people end up loving to death or hating
perhaps if i practiced more with it id like it bettermany magazines have been giving this item rave reviews but i cant understand why
sure the design is elegant and innovative but it makes  games almost impossible to play unless you are in absolute darkness
the  glare from this light is just plain ridiculous and the only way to  decrease it is to bend the light to one side which decreases the amount of  light on the screen
there has got to be a better way to light up your  gameboy and let me tell you this is not iti applaud the creators for their effort which we all know was immense
im sure they put an insane amount of time and effort into this game and they did manage to create some immersion
however i did not care for the puzzles and didnt feel inspired to go on
video games work on a simple reward system
the level of difficulty should yield an equal reward
otherwise whats the point
well i found with myst that i was forced to accomplish and reaccomplish extremely large and time consuming tasks with little to no rewardin one age if u choose a wrong switch you have to go somewhere else and recharge a battery and to recharge the battery you have to pump water and this whole time youre running back and fourth and back and fourth
i love complex puzzles but what i hate is when they are spaced far apart and you have to keep running from a to b over and over performing trial and error
i wasnt really motivated by the story if there was one and the bit of acting in the game was silly
the ages were completely devoid of humanity making the journey depressing
oh did i mention secret hotspots
yeah if you cant figure out what to do next its because you havent found the secret hotspot
also the navigation is so confusing that you completely miss pathways
this is because when the curser says right or left it sometimes actually means its going to turn you  degrees
thats fine but when all the scenery looks similar you dont know you you just turned to the right or  degrees
its a nightmareone reviewer said their yr old son liked the game
yeah right
he just thought it was fun to play on the computer
trust me he wasnt actually playing the game
most intelligent adults that ive asked about this game felt that it nearly drove them mad and they got pretty angry at the game
not because they were not smart enough but because the game really tests your patience and most of all doesnt give you adequate rewards for your efforts
sometimes when you step in an elevator the door automatically closes
then another time you learn that you have to close the door yourself
i dont feel like im playing a game i feel like im just learning how the game creators try to stump us
i will not be playing riven or anything else by these people
which is truly sad because the graphics in riven look amazing
if they spent less time on complexity and size and put more work in the story and the drive it could have been worth my while
i had more fun playing aura even with the nauseainducing d nagivation
syberia remains the championthis game by any standards is violent
but thats about all that i can say
sure you can hit a guy in any of the  anatomical hit areas programmed into the game
sure its fun to watch a  guy holding a stub of  his foot after you blew it away with a shotgun
but how many of these  images would you really like to see for the next  hours until you finally  realize this is just what this game was all about
nothing else
graphics  nice opengl
might cause some problems with geforce  cards
interface  in game save
easy to use multiplayer options
gameplay regular shootem  up
very formulaic shoot blood run
do this for  hours and youll  finish the game
weapons ballistics are not that real
believe me i  know
ai can be intimidating sometimes
look before you walk into any  area
story weak bad guy wants to blow up world
overall youll get  tired of this game
if you want a good multiplayer experience though get  this gameim rather baffled by all the positive reviews for this game
i bought it a couple months ago after reading all the good reviews and thinking this game must be a shining gem that has withstood the test of time
well now im rethinking that assumption no doubt many people will disagree with me but on with the reviewgraphics  sigh
everything is pixelated
im not sure whether the graphics for this game were considered good when the game was released or not
on the bright side the character designs are good as well as the towns
the dungeons are another matter but more on that latermusic  i still cant figure out why people claim this game has a great soundtrack
ive even heard people claim that grandias music is some of their most favorite of all time
i wonder if grandia is the only rpg theyve ever played
anyway the majority of the tracks werent too bad
unfortuneately i remember some pretty bad ones
theres one jungle where the music seems to only be ambient jungle wildlife sounds which got annoying after the th bird call
unlike others i found the gumbo song to be one of the most annoying village themes ever
its okay right at first but then starts to grate on your nerves the longer you stay in the village
one more thingthe voice acting deserves mention
its bad
i rank it as the worst voiceing ive ever heard in a game
it sounds like they literally pulled people off the street and offered them  to read off some lines
terriblecharacters  the characters are interesting at first until you realize that everyones the same
all possess the same plucky happygolucky adventurer personality
i have nothing against lighthearted games but everyone really did seem to have the exact same personality there was just no balance to the party
speaking of party there was a high rate of people joining and then permanently leaving this or something else
really meant that no one really got any siginificant character development
most everyone had no back story of interest or at all and were not well developedstory  heres where grandia really starts to sag in the saddle so to speak
the first  of the game and the last  are interesting and engaging
i really enjoyed the start in parm rummaging through peoples houses reading justins diary for some amusing stories and laughing at the way any alcoholic references were changed to coffee
man those were good times
unfortunately it all goes downhill from there
the middle of the game becomes a neverending series of filler events
the first couple villages in need or musty old ruins to explore didnt bother me at all but after that i started to feel like i was stuck on the wheel of karma or something
it just got really repetitive until i just knew the next village i came to would have to be saved by me from some disaster
well what i refer to as the main story picked about the last quarter of the game but it wasnt nearly original or interesting enough to make up for the huge amount of filler crap in the middle
by then only my sheer will power kept me playing to the endbattle system  nothing really wrong with the battle system
its a variant of turnbased with a small bar in the corner indicating who will go next
while the bar does let you see when youre characters will go i didnt really find it all that useful
what keeps this section from a perfect score is the abilitiesand how you level them up
using them over and over again strengthens your magic but not how youd expect
speed increases not strength
i found this very frustrating and pointless
the speed doesnt really increase enough to make much difference and leveling spells takes forevergameplay  was the rotating camera really necessary
ive played games with rotating camera angles like xenogears that worked just fine but in this game it doesnt
the problem lies in dungeon navigation
if the graphics had been better or if there had been better dungeon design perhaps navigation wouldnt be so confusing
its really hard to tell where you are because the dungeon design is so bland and repetitive there are usually no landmarks with which to navigate with the result that i actually wound up back at the entrance thinking it was the exit
on another note something else that bothered me was the fact that even by the end of the game you couldnt really return to much of anywhere you had been previously
i kept expecting be able to return to parm eventually but no such luck
note this parts an extremely important partthe game is glitchy
it would freeze randomly forcing me to reset and start over
the cds themselves were in good condition with almost no scratches of any kind and ive heard this same complaint before which leads me to believe the glitches are a flaw of the game design
this is a huge turnoffthis added in extra frustration to an already boring game
this flaw knocks points off the scoreoverall  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
i must say given the flaws of this game id never play it again
its too bad really it couldve been a decent game if the makers had cut out the middle of the plot and fixed the glitches
i really wouldnt recommend this to anyone unless they absolutely have played every other good rpg out there and are just dying for something else to play
even then it may be better to just replay an old favorite insteadi am a diehard fan of  and also liked  when  came out i was with alot of fans in saying wtf is this
it was weird jerky shaky controls horrible and obviously rushed graphics and they messed up all the stories
i feel so bad for dave jaffe to have to see his creation ground up cheeze added and packaged with a brand name and sweettooths face
 doesnt do much better and yet has a few neat ideas added that make it not as awful and actually worth a bargain bin pricethe story is not one of those ideas although sweettooth in charge was a nice idea his being a circus mastermind with evil clown minions was retarded and totally throws him in a different direction then he was meant to bethe createacar was a single step in the right direction although far too shallow and making you choose one of a handful of stupid voices warcries to hear every time you shoot your special will make you shiver when i deliver ltltone of the warcries you must choose
although you can make several character cars and then choose them as enemies in a challenge match thats a plus since ild rather just kill them when i hear their warcrybringing back older characters as bosses and later playable was nice
super axel super thumper super slamm and super augerfrom tm
axel was the most fun of the super characters for meanother bad idea here captain grimm
why is the grim reaper of motorcycles a pirate now
and not even a cool pirate a cheezy amusement park pirate
well he wasnt my favorite anyhow but im certain that was a deal breaker for all mrgrimm fans
any fans of rob zombie would appreciate that hes brought his dragula along and is actually a pretty good characteranother interesting twist is that with sweettooth in charge calypsos pretty pissed and therefore competing in a scud missile truck
his special is to fire a scud into the air and then you bring it back down in a reticle and it looks a lot more powerful then it isi also want to mention the levels here in this one were better then  of course nothing in this game was better then the first  but in all twisted metal  proves to be a worthwhile car combat bargain bin game but not a true twisted metal sequel
i gave it  fun stars becuase i was amazed how much i actually played it it does have replay value to it though  is still far too much for thissome good levels some good cars
mostly nothing special though
if you want a good twisted metal game look elsewhere in teh series
if you want a good vehicular destruction game look to vigilante  or better still interstate  or interstate there are  levels in this game
on my first try i beat  levels
it is easy and short
you also cant save the game
if your lets say on level  and you lose all your lives
then you have to start at the begining again
 kind of like mario 
this is the really bad thing
if you turn off your gameboy and turn it on again you start at level  again
it is not fun to keep playing the same levels over and over
i would say this is for little kids that do not get frustiated easly
 if there is any little kids like that 
i say pass this up kirby fans and try another gameearly castlevania games tended to be hit or miss affairs and unfortunately this is 
when i originally posted this review in  i had made a concerted effort to create an honest review for the average player i was and still am quite fond of the game
if i were to redo my rating scale perhaps id score it slightly higher at three stars
all the same i still feel that this game provides a low amount of fun given the intense challenge and the rating is deserved given that overriding criteriadoesnt the classic gb logo give it away
this is not the fantastic gameboy advance title castlevania aria of sorrow nor is it circle of the moon or even harmony of dissonancewhat this is might well be described as one of the slowest sidescrollers ever made and thats without slowdown affecting the game
made in  this is one of the first titles in konamis game boy lineup and it shows
the level one music battle of the holy is excellent and a personal favorite but the aural experience is unfortunately quite limited afterward
i personally like many of the background details whenever they show up that is such as the trees and graves seen at the games beginning
much later on the ability to use exploding eyeballs as dynamite to open up a hidden area no joke
is a great concept well executedthe whip christopher uses in this game may be upgraded once for a chain whip and once more for flinging fireballsits not quite an adequate replacement for the traditional castlevania subweapons but it does give you unlimited attacks at rangechristophers slowness in this title and its sequel makes simon belmonts hunched back and slow gait appear like a semi barrelling down the road whereas christopher is perhaps the man trying to push a tractor trailer down the road
suffice to say that hes very slow  hyperbole aside he seems to move at roughly half the speed of simonthe worst part of it would be the intensely difficult jumps found in large quantities
this is the textbook example of frustrating level design nearly every single jump must be done within an accuracy of a few pixels
while the most difficult jump in the game requires you time perfectly across two falling platformsessentially three jumpsis thankfully optional used to snag a up extra life since i can only manage it about once in twenty tries an optimistic guess the normal jumps are too close to this required accuracy for comfort
one long series of jumps has you going over about a dozen blocks in such a fashion while theres solid ground below to fall down onto and the process of jumping may always be restarted its easy to mess up here
a later and quite ugly level where you are chased by spikes for nearly the entire level and one part consists of climbing upwards and jumping from rope to rope has the same feel to it as mistakes tend to get you killed quite oftentheres more
one level starts you off by bats which of course you cant hit right away because while a castlevania axe could take them all out you have no axe only your whip
getting through this section unscathed is more a matter of luck than skillthe end of the game oddly enough consists of the easiest dracula fight since castlevania  where you could simply lay on the laurels for invincibility for the fights duration
i wont give it away but draculas second form is even more pathetic in terms of an attack pattern than the first in either case dracula looks silly in this one
given how hard this game is though its probably not a bad thing to have some reprieveare there any more problems
oh yes the killer getting hit downgrades your weapon one notch so you essentially play the whole game with the basic short leather whipall that said i do love this game but its not easily playable
it brings solid graphics to the gameboy but the gameplayif it is solid perhaps we would better say that youll need a jackhammer to scratch the surface of this particular rockit gets the second star only because some people consider all terribly difficult games to be a challenge and they might enjoy it somewhat
as i noted there are some nice points later in the gameunfortunately just as with the previous years  castlevania arcade game haunted castle most mortals will never see many of its neat detailsmy recommendation is to pick up castlevania  belmonts revenge instead
you have subweapons less difficult jumps a better soundtrack overall and weapon downgrades have been checked significantly
pick that one up if youre looking for classic gameboy actionno it isnt
this is a standard platformer with extremely sluggish control no secondary weapons and slow movement
plus your whip loses power each time an enemy hits you
this is a pain
the saving grace is that you can obtain a whip that shoots fireballs and the first stage has great music
but that cant save the game
even castlevania fans should steer clear of this onethe batman returns game on nintendo is better than this one
the sega version is boring and the gameplay is not that goodthis is a good batman gameits  just a tad too difficult  lol  the graphics are dark and gloomy  perfect for batman  but they lack the visual detail  of the movie  but a good job by sega   now the super nintendos batman returns is a excellent game  which i still play to this daythe graphics are well done the music is from the movieand had digitized scenes from the film the other batman game that is really done right is by sunsoft  batman the video game from the  movie again for the genesis all in all if your a batman fan get all of these gamesi used to love this game before he was caught brown handed in the  year old chocolate cookie jar
typical of michael to make sure he has a fun game for little boys
looking at this game now its so dirty
you have to run around saving little boys oh yeah girls to
hmm
michael didnt like girls but i bet he just didnt wanna look suspicious
good by and good riddanceever since sor  came out in  i wanted it
i never actually managed to get my hands on it until last year as it went for insane prices on auction sites and was very very hard to come by in video game stores
luckily for me i was given it as a present from someone clearing out their attic
i couldnt wait to get home and play it
all i could think about was loads of hours of solid beatemup action and a return of those ultracool tunes by yuzo koshiro that made the first two games so memorableas soon as i started to play i was shocked that streets of rage  is actually a really really bad game that may be impressive in terms of graphics but in regards to music and gameplay is far far behind even the firstfirst of all the game is just too damn hard
and you need to play  it in hard mode otherwise you wont be able to get past level  and this time were given a little bit more story and cutscenes between the game levels
if youre playing the american or european release of this game id just skip these as they do not make sense and there are holes everywhere
the japanese version bare knuckle  has a different plot entirely and looks and feels like the real streets of rage in sor  the story has mr x in what limited capacity he now exists in kidnap the chief of police and plant bombs all over city
he wants to replace highranking officials with evil robots
or something
so typically the gang set about smashing the syndicate again as their way of stopping himhowever in bare knuckle  the opening cutscenes with the nuclear explosion show the destruction of a city called wood oak that was the first victim of a radioactive bomb powered by the newly discovered element  laxine
the victims are given as an estimated  dead and  injuredin a letter from blaze to axel she says that the syndicates laboratories seem to be involved in the research of laxine and that a group in favor of a war with the country of lima have captured the army general petrovmr
x tries to start a nuclear war by replacing the antiwar us general with shiva before a speech at the white house
in sor  city hall looks suspiciously like the white house so im led to believe that the level was just recycled and renamedin bare knuckle  you have to successfully prevent a devastating war by rescuing the general and the destruction in the city is just a slap in the face while in sor you basically have failed your task if you let the time run out the general now chief of police is killed with poisonous gas
if you rescue the chief in time you go straight to mrxs island lab but if he dies you go to city hallwhite housesecond yuzo koshiros music is horrible
what happened
the first  games had awesome music that showed what the meager sega genesis was capable of
the man was truly a pioneer when it came to composing stunning music for simple machines
in sor  there are no cool tunes at all
its all pathetic tepid industrial junk that would sound rancid coming from an atari
a major letdown considering how amazingstreets of rage twowassor  also has deleted characters that feature only in the japanese version
namely the character of ash who looks very very homosexual and resembles bennett from commando or one of the village people
i guess the pc powers that be thought the western world couldnt handle such obvious gayness
the dialogue is also censored and naughty words are replaced with clean words
character names are also radically and inexplicably differentif you want this badly then the japanese version is the only way to go
seriously its a complete disappointment otherwise
im not saying that the japanese version is great its only slightly betterstreets of rage  oh boy
streets of f      g rage part  you know sega of america just butchered this game for the us  european megadrive owners
sega took this gamesb  all  s away censoring the way some of the female gang members are dressed
they took out a funny sub boss
even segas  crew  e  d with the gameplay like when i run up to an enemy  hit a grand upper as axel sometimes it doesnt hit
oh  axel doesnt say grand upper he says bare knuckle in  or  year tobacco chewer
theres a review i did on an older account where i was more positive thats before i got my hands on a copy of bare knuckle iii the uncut japanese version
the japanese version plays better feels faster paced
the only reason that i could think that sega would dumb the story down  censor stuff is cause around this time a group of authoritarian democrats had some hearings about violent video games thats the only reason i could think of why they would mess this game up so bad
these lawmakers wasted money during these hearings they went after poor bill white of sega i mean they just picked on this guy for no reason
anyway sega of america was probably afraid that big bad herbie kohl would go after them
oh btw no matter what party your congressman or woman senator or governor are if they are an authoritarian try to get theira     voted out
im sorry if i got too political but moving on i beat if youre reading this i bet you never expected to read a political rant with in a game rant
the story is stupid in the ntsc pal version so skip it if youre playing the ntsc pal versions  be prepared to get beaten up a lot
the bare knuckle iii storyline dealt with terrorism theyve totally destroyed a city call wood oak city thats part of the the lima nations mr x has this chemical called rakushin  hes trying to supply the lima nations with it so he can make a lot of money theres a general named petrov who is against these lima nations going to war so the syndicate has captured him
in the us pal versions well the chief has been kidnapped  mr x is going to replace high ranking city  police officials replaced by robots
the american  european versions is basically a generic beat em up i mean i could do without the plot cause its some kind of bs out of a saturday morning cartoon
if it didnt have axel blaze  skate returning this game couldve been called something else
adam also returns in a couple of cameos so hes not playable he figures into the plot in both sor   bare knuckle iii
theyve changed the color of clothing the characters axel wears a yellow shirt  black jeans
blaze wears a white shirt  white shirt
cause sega says they were being gender neutral more like they were being politically correct
sega took out the original opening theres cut scenes with dialogue but scenes the sega rewrote all these cut scenes before  after each level skip it i dont even know why they left it in cause none of it makes sense
the st level it starts off with a bomb being defused also youll notice at the character select screen the music is mediocre
anyway level  is starts off in this warehouse where you have  sections a warehouse dock  an alley where you fight a returning shiva
you have new enemies such as these assassin that wear suits  shoots you punks that dress like justin bieber which gives me more of a reason to beat these dudes up as well as mowhawk punks
you have these female enemies that with blond brush cut haircuts who have been censored so have the whip ladies instead of their revealing clothes they wear jackets skirts pantyhose  high heels
i dont mind the music on this level its not streets of rage  music or even the st game for that matter its not as bad as some of the music later on
after the st level blaze knows where the nd bomb is at level  starts out downtown at this shopping district where you have bikers  yellow jacket mowhawk punks after you along with your basic punks
you have an evil psycho clown  kangaroo as the sub boss if you beat the clown st then youll get the kangaroo as a playable character yep they wont let you play as adam or bring max back but you can play as a kangaroo
the nd section is in this disco which is was pretty good you have to go through your basic punks  mowhawk punks blond brush cut girls  whip ladies
the boss of level  is mona  lisa theyre the returning blaze clones from sor  only theyre not blaze clones  theyre not as difficult as in sor  the music in the disco is ok as was the boss music
at the end of level  theres a news segment going on where youre told that axel has kidnapped the chief which i think if sega had to change the story make where axel has been framed for kidnapping the chief  he has to go along with the team to find the chief  so he can clear his name they might have been too mature though
level  is where the music goes tos      t youre in this construction site where you fight off yellow jacket mowhawk punks with the various punks  guys dressed as justin bieber i guess thats a reason to play it you get to beat up dudes dressed as justin bieber  he is a punk
you have the chicks with whips  the ladies with brush cuts
you can also knock them into pits which is fun if you can pull it off in this version cause youll get beat on a lot
nd section where you have a black doug funny punk trying to kill you with a bulldozer  you have some really awful music like someone put their hand under the armpit put it up to the recorder  made f  art  in  g noises
wtf yuzo koshiro
you have to fight off the bulldozer while smashing a brick wall if you get to the end the black doug funny will crash a barrel will fall on top of him killing him then the rd section is on this lift which playing this again i was burnt out on this game that doesnt happen with bare knuckle iii i can sit beat that game
this section has more of the same enemies but it introduces a newer samuri type kung fu villain  theyre more of a challenge than what they were in part  the boss of level  is robot axel
level  is in this tunnel youll probably die a lot here cause there is this this subway cart that comes through in bare knuckle iii i dont get hit a lot by it
in the nd section you wont have to you have to fight off these ninjas that have returned you wont have to worry about a the subway cart hitting you cause you can go in this corner  let it pass sometimes it will hit the enemies
the music in the nd section of level  sounds like something that would be used in a s cat food commercial
the boss of level  called yamota you have to defeat  of them  this boss fight is fun in bare knuckle iii in streets of rage  its the longest boss fight of the entire franchise im not joking the boss music used is some of the better in the game
level  you go through the syndicate hide out where its in about  or  sections the st section is you have to fight through ninjas  samuris the nd section is in some kind of hallway with a great tune its  of the few i like where you fight your basic punks yellow jacket red  blue jacket mowhawk punks the fat guys are back as well as more samuris
the rd section is on an elevator where you fight off punks brush cut chicks  whip ladies  basic punks you get to the top floor where axel has words with mr x you fight off some more punks  whip ladies
mr x stands up catches fire  its a robot  if you beat robo x  youre playing on easy youre f    k you go play on harder difficulty
when i saw this back in the day i was like wtf
i wasnt aware of the level select cheat back in the day or the  lives cheat
so the game wants to play clue with you but im not wanting to play clue i want to play streets of rage  so however you get to level  you have to save the chief from being gassed to death you have to destroy  control panels you have these hopping robots they are not as fun as in streets of rage  but you have to take a lift to get to these  lower floor each control panel is in the nd room on the  lower floors
the rooms contain whip ladies  samuris
you have to save the chief cause the syndicate has sent a disguised chief to make a statement at mayors mansion if you dont get to the chief in time then you take an alternate route going to the mayors mansion which looks more like the white house
the level  boss is the return of the jet pack guy who is backed up by  extra jet pack men
he provides a better challenge though
you can beat them with jump attacks  special moves
adam makes a cameo where he guns down the jet pack men at the end of the boss fight
if you save the chief then youll go on the right route where the st section starts off outside your fighting off ninjas hopping robots  bikers this is very annoying
the factory is the same where you got mr x robots then you have to fight off hopping robots a mr xs assassins  a jet pack guy
then you have a sort of sub boss a scientist named dr dahm trying to kill you with lab equipment
you have to jump attack it
all this stuff is fun  challenging in bare knuckle iii
you face a very difficult robot controlled by whats left of mr x all thats left is his brain
now in both bare knuckle iii  streets of rage  this is hard but its a fun challenge
you have to beat the neo x in  minutes if you have defeated him after the  minutes have passed youll get a bad ending telling how you failed  try again
if you defeat it before the  minutes passed youll get the good ending  all i can say is keep using your special attack on neo x adam gets you out of their on a helicopter after the battle
im going to wrap this up by saying streets of rage  really bad a story thats not needed since sega of america messed up the ntsc pal versions
most of the music is bad other than the redone streets of rage theme i like the music in level  section  the music in level  b where youre at the white house is my favorite on this game  the round  boss music is really good
i can just listen to those tracks on you tube or in the options menu
i have heard streets of rage  didnt do well i mean just look at the cover i mean the us box art for sor    is bad but for sor  its terrible axel  blaze look like theyre in theyre in their s axel looks like hes put on weight
zan looks dumb  the kangaroo is on the cover it looks so laughable
if i wouldve saw this in a store i wouldve been like wtf  it probably got a bad word of mouth
anyway next review will be the real streets of rage  bare knuckle iiixmen is a fun game on ameatur difficulty level
when i cranked it up to hero since you cant get any farther than the third level on ameatur i found it almost impossible to do anything
i got tired of playing the levels all over again fighting the same almost randomly apearing enemies coming from doors at any moment and surrounding me
although the game may have captured the feel of the xmen i didnt think they did a good job with the actual game aspect which is probably the most important thing
if you want to play a good marvel game try marvel superheroes war of the gems
it is much more balanced and fun than segas attempt at making an xmen gamei know this is going to sound like sacrilege but i was never a fan of the mortal kombat games
having playedstreet fighter ii special champion editionandfatal furybefore it i just didnt see much point in another fighting franchiseplus the digitised graphics which were supposed to be groundbreaking and make us all go ooohhh ahhh were just really rubbish
they were so blocky and resembled just a few big chunky pixels vaguely in the shape of a human
i tired of it pretty quickly im afraid to say but a few months after i stopped playing it i went back after finding cheat codes in a magazine to restore the censored gore
but even that was dumba gallon of blood splattered into the air every time you punched someone and it just looked so stupid that it had no edge
and then later on i got the cheats for the finishing moves and babalities and animalities or whatever such nonsense
but by that point they just took it too far and i never went back to it again
the sequels never took my interest eithernot the best fighting game by fargraphics csound cgameplay clasting appeal cthis is one of the worst versions of the original game you can buy
the graphics are horrible the fights are boring and this version just lacks the depth of the super nintendo version
only reason i dont give this thing  star is because of the code that you can use to unlock the gore and the fatalities that arent found on the other version
but other than that stick with the far superior super nintendo version
this version aint worth looking forthis collection of games were okay the best one out of them all was super packman
the rest were not worth playingthis game is a monsterous disaster
even if it was rare i do not understand how anyone could have possible considered paying as much as  for this gamethe gameplay mechanics were borrowed from its d predecessors however the conversion into d was horrible
the game moves slow the graphics are mediocre at best the difficulty can be overwhelming at times controls were shoddy the game had horrible load times considering there were better games that also loaded for that period of timethe only good that i really saw in the game was that it stayed true to the series and featured a good sized cast of characters spanning from the dragon ball all the way through gt but not every character and there wasnt much of a story per se existent in this gamebreakdownthe gooda huge roster of the dragon ball universe warriorsretains the original voices from the shownice cutscenethe badthe graphicsthe gameplaythe frameratethe priceespecially when the game first went out of printbelow are the differences between the japanese and american  releases
the biggest fight intro song was replaced with some crappy instrumental that sounds like a boss theme sound effects were in the japanese version but werent present in the us one
the graphics are pretty good but i have one problem you have to jam on the buttons to get the characters to move quickcast of characters with biggest fight playing is missing at the end and the credits the japanese one hironobu kageyama is singing in the end credits while the us just replaced it with an instrumental of the same song
i dont know why they couldnt use the instrumental of the biggest fight i found hidden on the disc itself for the intro
the voice acting is awful i know this was rereleased but couldnt they redub it with the funimation actors instead of those mediocre ones
japanese the original voices from the original animeyou create thingsthats about ityou also fight these little flying lizardthings that pour our of a hole in the ground until you build a building over itthis game will keep you entertained for about an hourthen it gets boring quicklymy advice is to rent the game before buying iti usually break down every game that i review from story to sound to controls and yada yada
this game will not require such a breakdown being an old school snes platformer in the vein of a really bad castlevania
allow me to be more specific as i mentioned in the title that the controls are terrible
by terrible i dont mean if you press forward the character moves backward of course not
if you press forward your character will move forward and if you press attack he will attack
the problem is when you move him forward he sluggishly moves forward as he doesnt seem to be a very motivated statue possessed by a god
i would have liked the flight mechanic much more if they utilized it more in the style of demons crest
the problem might have been that this game came out before demons crest so didnt have much influencing it in that department
you dont really fly with those wings but rather glide
and you usually glide right into fifty enemies attacking you at once causing the game to slow down significantly
or you usually end up missing a platform as a result that even if you do end up landing on your character has to cartoonishly put on the brakes the second he lands and slides forward a bit
the enemies respawn especially at the most inconvenient moments and at times they even respawn right where youre standing so theres no way you can avoid them at times
i know people like a challenge to their gameplay but theres the difference between a legit challenge and just plain cheap deaths
if you want a legit challenge save another  and get castlevania iv if you dont already have it
i know someone is going to find this review unhelpful just for the fact thats it a negative review
there are some praiseworthy elements in this game such as the visuals
the graphics and backgrounds are beautiful for a  bit game and wouldnt look any better even if you added another  bits to them thats  for those bad at math which consist of most playstation  games
its a game that is definitely at home on  bit consoles but the gameplay just isnt up to par
it is possible to get good at this game and beat it as it isnt completely unplayable
the problem is youll end up losing your voice from cursing at the game before you actually end up getting good at it
i just dont think its a game thats worth spending a lot of time and effort to playing when the snes has a vast library filled with much better games
buyer beware that if you end up purchasing this game you might be stuck with it and not like it
try the rom for yourself first
this isnt a worthy successor to the original and its part of the reason why another actraiser game hasnt been made since
this isnt one of those diamonds in the rough so just glance past this abomination of a sequel and stick with the predecessor
no hard feelings toward anyone who does like this gameif you were expecting anything like the first game you will be disappointed
what i especially did not like was the lack of the simcity mode
its all actionsidescrolling now
the first actraiser had interesting sidescrolling levels with a nice array of challenges and enemies
the levels in actraiser  are just frustrating
theres nothing wrong with a challenge but the level of challenge even in easy mode is so ridiculous its discouraging
theres nothing wrong with losing lives while trying to figure out a level but it takes so many attempts to go through a level because the enemies keep coming at you
trying to work out a strategy to deal with enemies becomes timeconsuming and after you beat one level you know youre going to have to do it all over again with another level
the time spent trying to master one level sucks all the fun out of the game
if youre a masochist who enjoys being frustrated this is your game
otherwise avoidi have to say the first actraiser was a classic but actraiser ii is trash
the wings might be the most annoying feature in fight mode
do not buy this gamefor those of you who had fond memories of the classic arcade game captain america and the avengers steer clear of this port that came out for the snes during its heyday
this was doomed from the get gofirst off the game was made by mindscape who did not have a great track record when it came to video games and not by data east the original developer of the arcade game
second the graphics and music were downgraded significantly to accommodate the low rom space of the snes cartridge which ended not looking or sounding great
lastly the controls were so rigged and stiff that moving around and fighting your enemies were extremely limitedas a twist of irony this was later released for the genesis by data east with graphics sounds controls and difficulty mirroring the arcade versionmy best friend picked this up and i played it several times trying to get myself to enjoy this game but i didnt
get the genesis version or track down the rom to play this on an emulator because the snes version was butchered beyond relief
save your money and dont buy itso this game sucks
the only good things about it are the music when you are playing which is ghetto but awesome and the fact that you can run into impossibly strong panther heads that shoot lasers from their eyes
seriously dont waste more than like  or  on this gamethough any snes game bearing the title final fantasy can now be called a collectors item this is definitely the least sought after of the bunch
this is a hard game to appreciate having experienced parts  and  but for younger gamers this is the perfect game
the story is strictly storybookstandard fodder nonviolent and pleasing to simple minds
the graphics and music are not even worth mentioning as they cannot rightfully be called final fantasy materialbut considering the target market it would be unfair to totally trash this game
if i had a son i would get this game for him as an into into rpgs
the better installments could wait
i wouldnt  call this game the worst rpg of all time since i have played much much worsei know theres some of you whod like to see this game get  star but come on its not that bad
for examplethe music although not excellent throughout is pretty good
my favorites are the volcano boss and gale mountain themes
the boss theme is especially goodthough one of the best ive heard
i know that many of you complain quotoh i dont like the random battlesquot well let me ask you this would you prefer  ten mandatory battles on the world map before you can go on to the next area
i didnt think so
the dungeons and caves are a different story though as you can avoid most enemies they appear onscreenunless youre going down a oneway tunnel
so the battles are a mixed bag as you can see
next being a very early snes title the graphics and story are very blandcompared to later squaresoft titles
amazingly enough im glad that squaresoft made this game
yes glad
why
because when a system first comes out companies arent too sure what the full potential of that system is
wouldnt it be dreadful if squaresoft tried to put their best storyline characters music gameplay you name it into this first gameonly to realized that the snes cant handle it or that they could have done better later on
so i guess you could call this an experimental squaresoft game just a way of sticking ones toe in the water
and before you start slapping your green numbers down in front of the cashier or reaching for the download button i suggest that you read other reviewsdo a google search or somethingbeforehandsome might say that to compare final fantasy mystic quest to the rest of the series is unfair since it was clearly aimed at a younger audience
however when you use a brand name to sell a product the product had better live up to that name
this game is not a final fantasy game and only a complete ff completist should own it
it takes under  hours to beat and even a six yearold could probably beat it
thats pretty much the point of it
final fantasy ii and iii for the snes are far far better than this monstrosity and they still remain my two favorite games of all time
save your money and buy those insteadthis is the black sheep of the final fantasy family
it is barely mentioned in any discussion about final fantasy and there is a very good reason
this is the worst game that i have played that actually bears the final fantasy name
simply put this game is not good
by the time this game was released squaresoft had give us a simplified version of final fantasy iv and called it final fantasy ii
ffii was more complex and had a deeper story than mystic quest
the american audience had proven that we could handle more complex rpgs but the next final fantasy we got was the childrens game mystic questi finished mystic quest the first time in about  hours at most and after that i could beat the game in less than  hours
had there been an actual story to the game this would have been just a warmup but instead the game was complete
mystic quest would have worked better as a side scrolling adventure rpg rather than a straight rpg
as it stands the game is closer in feel to final fantasy adventure for the gameboy than any final fantasy in the numbered series
the story is simple gather crystals and save the world okay ff i and iv had this story too
the gameplay was far too easy
most enemies would go down in one or two hits and you can just fly through the game learning some spells and whacking enemiesmy description isnt quite doing justice to how dull the game is and how little fun it is to play
because of the weakness of this game the only positive is that the game is so short
if you must play it go into it with no expectations
if you want to play a good snes rpg try final fantasy ii or iii or chrono trigger
if you do play this game remember to use the cure spell on the final boss
it makes life easiermaybe thats a little unfair
im admittedly not a big final fantasy fan square has made some other stuff which i enjoy
the ff series is mostly okay but mystic quest is terriblemystic quest was as far as i know a pitiful attempt by the japanese dominated market of the time to create a trainer rpg for stupid americans
those stupid americans were woefully underestimatedmystic quest has a plot more suitable for a sidescroller than an rpg find the four crystals and kill the main bad guy and thereby save the world
thats about it
the standard talking and house invasion system is used but nobody really has anything to saythere is a small assortment of friendly characters who join your party at the games discretion
they dont really have much to say either
the one guy is a ninja i guess which is nice
he was my favoritethe combat system is nothing just straight turnbased attack button pressing
you can also cast one of a small number of spells using a system in which you can cast a certain number of each spell type white black rather than using magic points
also for some reason unless you change it your hp are represented by bars rather than numbers
between towns you fight in arenas by the way there is no wandering in the wilderness which are boring but you get prizes so i did them anyway
there are also only random encounters in some of the dungeons and set monsters is the others one is even a mixture of the two
dont ask why
having mostly nonrandom monsters earns mystic quest its first starthe graphics are downright bad but ive come to expect that from old games
they arent too much worse than say ffiv
the music on the other hand is great for old school stuff
good enough to earn mystic quest its second staranyways mystic quest is awful though almost comparable to ffiv but much worse
maybe it is good for training people into rpgs
someone who is young and hasnt played any rpgs
maybe
it took me ten hours to beat but could be done in five if you didnt mess around
take some advice from someone who paid  for mystic quest if you cant find it for money or less dont botherthis was without a doubt the worst final fantasy game that ive ever played
even final fantasy ii had its moments but this game just annoyed methe same great music you remember is here but everything else was left at the curb
fuzzylooking graphics characters lacking any sort of personality or conviction overly simplistic storyline these are just afew words i would use to describe this gameand its not just that this game is lame in comparison to other final fantasy games
on the contrary this was the first final fantasy game that i ever played and if it werent for the fact that i had already ordered final fantasy iv online then this game wouldve stopped me from ever buying another one ever againthe only thing that i actually liked about this game is that monsters showed visible damage once their health was decreased past its half way point wish they wouldve put that into other final fantasy gamesother than that this game should be avoided youre better off spending your money on another final fantasy game
whichever one you choose its sure to be better than thisthis game is the worst final fantasy game ive ever had the misfortune to play
the bad graphics are only masked by the horrific gameplay  loss of convincing heros not to mention the absence of convincing storylines that made the final fantasy series such a huge hit
the only fantasy that comes to mind when playing this game is the fantasy of killing yourself or throwing it out the window and praying to god for the souls of the people who put this game on the market
i warn all newcomers to the final fantasy world do not play this game
if your looking for a good final fantasy game to start up with i recomend final fantasy i  ii dawn of souls for the gameboy advance or final fantasy origins for the psonewritten byshadowmage the game maniaci remember this game being fun
i recently bought it and its very confusing and a hard game to beat
its fun at first but then they add a stupid hang gliding test that just sucks
the game is tough and if youre into a challenge where you have to go though rings for points and land successfully this is it for you
you have to use differentiate speeds and elevations for certain levels
i would have to say this game is similar to star fox but i dont remember star fox being hard to playthis game is one of those titles that you either love or hate and while its more loved than hated im going to say that i dont like this very much
now i know that multiple people have wrote the same type of review here but this game frustrated me so much that i felt that i needed to chime in as well along with the two others who wrote a similar review to mineon one note i actually loved the color and diverse environments in this game but there are two major flaws
the menu is extremely excruciatingly difficult to navigate through you have to keep pressing x and y all over again to find what you need and the battle system is simply unforgiving
you have to wait for your attack to charge and sometimes you dont have time to wait for your attack to charge and you end up getting gang beaten by all the monsters around you because your sword does not even hit the monster half the time yes you heard me right
half the time
that is unacceptable especially for an action rpgfor a turnbased rpg i may understand but even on turnbased rpgs enemy evades rarely happen and only happen when the character has an agility lowering spell cast on but no in secret of mana you have to miss the enemy more than  of the time trying to hit it and it really aggravates me
there is one more thing about this game that is an absolute dealbreaker
when you try to exit a room you have to forcefully gather your characters by either hitting select or going back towards them but what if an enemy is still in the way well you character meets the reaper
this is the epitome of poor game design i absolutely cannot fathom that this game has even passed testing let alone getting the nintendo seal of quality back in its release in  and being rereleased on virtual console without the ai problems addressed
thank goodness i only wasted  on this game and not  on a snes cart
please play breath of fire ii or chrono trigger instead or if you really want an action rpg you can play illusion of gaia or zelda link to the past you will thank me latera friend at work recommended this game to me he being an rpg enthusiast just like me was surprised when i said i had not played it
ive beaten legend of mana so hey why not give this a go
honest opinion not as great as i expected
i did enjoy it to some extent but about  hours in it just gets cheap
im talking ruby weapons quicksand attack cheap
enemies start multiplying bosses start coming in pairs and heal each otherrevive
ive come across this before in rpgs star ocean legend of dragoonpaper mario but in secret of mana its way out of control
i guess thats how they chose to make this game difficult just give enemies dopplegangerinfinite healinginfinite revive
not my style
its not like me to just up and quit a game right in the middle so im a little disappointed
as for this being one of the greatest rpgs ever
i wouldnt go that far and i wouldnt bring it up in a conversation concerning that subject
also its absolutely not worth that  used price tag it holds
maybe its on psnahem on a much brighter note
may i recommend some highly acclaimed games like legend of zelda a link to the past final fantasy  aka  or chrono trigger insteadanywho if youre a fan of this game no disrespect
this is just an opinion dont get all hurt
quiet frankly i thought legend of mana was an ok game
havent tried dawn of mana but was told to stay far far away from itsunset riders is just like any of the tmnt teenage mutant ninja turtls games except this one has cowboys and its set in the old wild wild westyou play as  different sherriffs bob billy steve
and cormano and your objective is to take down the most evil and dangerous men in the wild wild westok
this is what makes this game stupid the enemy to hero ratio is completely off
there are always a lot more enemies than heroes on the screen for the most part and that makes this easy game a little confusing and a little too challenging seeing as how if you get hit like once or twice you die and when a screen full of bad guys shoots  bullets in all different directions its kind of hard to didgeturtles in time is a much better  player game but if youre looking for a slight change of pace heres your chance with this cowboy shoot em upthis game is terrible the graphics are bad the controls are worse you cant tell what you can hit and what can hit youit looks like a bad nes game
its just not worth your time
i only game it two stars bc i do love wolverine and i had expected so much more from this gamewhy do video game companies always put out bad games for superherosit makes no sense
only get this game if youre just a huge fan of wolverine and dont care how bad the game isotherwise i suggest buying the xmen game for the snesu can be wolverine and its much more fun and the graphics are great
try that one insteadthe snes version is way too hard to finish the sega genesis version is alot better  easier to finishi played the first few hours of this game in utter agony
dont get me wrong it started out promising the music is amazingly atmospheric it gave me the creeps
 and the game definitely has originality going for it but yeah thats about itearthbound is just soslow
and boring
the humor isnt very well done either i might add
its juvenile and blah its obvious that its intentional but they could have been more creative i think
the battles are painfully slow and the enemies are far too strong
i found myself having to level my character up ness within the first few steps out the front door
not only are the enemies too powerful but to heal you have to fight to power up your magic stats high enough to survive your way to the next plot point isnt this game supposed to be a comedy
why the insane difficulty
it makes no sense to me hereanyway im not going to rant on forever
im only giving my honest opinions
which are few being i abandoned hope so early for this game
its definitely not worth the asking price go for the wii store route instead
why spend so much on something so mediocre unless its for nostalgias sake
and thats where i will end this review in saying that it is obnoxious to even imply that this game is the best rpg evarrrr because its far from the truth
panzer dragoon saga might be the only rpg worth shelling out this sort of cash for
not earthboundthe cable rattled when i first recieved it and didnt work so i cant really give a good review mwhy is this game so expensive
it was by far the worst megaman game  along with x and x
and i beat them all might i add
but x had nothing new
the only two things new is u can play as zero
but if u die with him he is gone for the rest of the game
and there are  capsules
but  are the normal armor and the other  are extras
but u can only get one extra
megaman x is alot better and so is x
get those two and u are setlufia  rise the sinistral is the epitome of the mediocrity no matter whats the legion of fanboy snes rpg tell you
its avaragethe puzzleoriented dungeon design is the strong point of the gamethe positive great use of puzzles in the dungeons capsule always escape no casual encounters  only world map dungeons are fun good extra love storythe negative terrible storyline simple and cliched plot really a disappointment stereotyped characters the game dont aged very well the gameplay is a bit monotonous ugly and repetitive graphics its a  game and secret of mana release in  has much better graphics
 mediocre soundtrack poor presentation easy near the endgraphics soundtrack story characters gameplay fun factor miscellaneouslenght  a  hours gamedifficulty  easy near the end but despite this is goodreplay value  avarage good amount of extralevels are way to small and game play isnt very exciting
characters wont think for themselves at all and if one gets killed you lose so much for the red shirtsim not even sure it was worth the  i paid for itaway team could have been much better
it didnt seem to stand out from all the other simulator type games out there
i was expecting more but i was a little dissapointedthe graphics are mediorcre and the sound and instruction a little confusing as you play
a little predictable too
i guess i was a little disappointed based on all the other simulator type games i have alreadyyou be the judgefirstly in common with activisions previous star trek title elite force this is far too short for a full price game
the plots none too poor and has some pleasant twists that suprise but the gameplay is repetitive and limited so that by the end it has ceased to be a joy and more like a test of stamina
of major concern is the lack of an equiping screen and though you do get to choose the team that goes out each missions requirements pretty much pick the squad for you anyway
couple this with the fact that you have to micromanage your teams every move they wont even shoot back when shot at just cry out and theres no multiplayer option except cooperative over a lan means that this is one isometric squadbased shooter to be avoided
if you like this style of game you could do worse than buying fallout tactics instead or save yourself the money and pick up a copy of abomination  the nemesis projectwhat a shame
great idea great concept but so poorly delivered
this is not a patch on commandos  and it lacks everything that made commandos  so good
the characters are dull and the games leads you rather then allowing you to  direct the flow of the gamecommandos  took me best part of a month and i enjoyed every minute of it as a trek fan i looked forward to this one but i finished it easily in two days and was sadly bored for most of it
avoidnow when i first played this game i loved it
but after awhile of playing i came to this one boss that i have spent a month on and havnt been able to beat
and its not cause im not good at fighting its because whenever he hurts you his life bar refuals to whatever amount he hurt you for times two
so if he takes away  health points from you then he will gain  health points from you
what
and because i cant get any more health than  it makes it so im at a major dissadvantage
and for the record  that i attack him i miss even with the special attacks every one knows that special attacks shouldnt miss
other wise that makes it a regular move that just costs something more than a special attack
now thats unfair
now im not saying the game is bad because i was really enjoying this game up to this point
but now i feel forced to buy a hint book or i may never beat this guy
shame on the creators for making such an unfair boss
i feel like i was robbed of my money for this gamehorrible graphics bad controls annoying guy in your ear saying quotno tangos in sitequot  it took me about  minutes to beat on the hard difficulty level
i bought it back when it cost  bucks plus i thought i had to buy a control pack to save a game
you dont need to save a game because if you cant beat it in one sitting  you shouldnt be play video games
go out and buy a ps and play some real games n is deadi am a professional gamer and this is the hardest game  i have ever played not only that but there is rarely any action to it so dont let the beginning fool you this game is worth it if you are professional i beat it but not very many people have  the worst buy i have ever bought so dont get it unless its cheapbusido blade  is as original as fighting games get
one strike one kill style asain sword fighting
as for how that translates to game play though  give me a boreing old overhead life bar anyday
the rounds in busido  blade  last seconds
it is near imposible to block a sword strike
in  the origional you could at least defend yourself a bit making it a much  better game
so only play this if you are the most die hard fighting fan
i will take tekken  or street fighter alpha  over this every day and  twice on sundaythis game is fairly primitive both in gameplay and in graphics
its a straightup fighting game that pretends to have a story and a purposebut basically you go from fight to fight and thats about it
i hardly ever play fighting games or any games really and i finished the game with one character in about a half hour
supposedly they expect you to play through with every character but hearing each characters voice or slightly different way of fighting is hardly a reward
compared to a game like virtua fighter  this game pales and im sure there are lots more martial arts games out there that are more worth your timei got this game expecting a lot
i was very disappointed
but first the good
the game is innovative being a departure from the standard rpg by squaresoft
the battle system was a good attempt but didnt work too  well
the cinematic features of the game were not disappointing
the cut  scenes were wonderful and the overall graphics were pretty good
the  storyline was interesting as wellunfortunately that did not make up  for the confusing nature of the game
the weapon modification system did  not work well and as i said before the battle system did not end up being  as good as it could have been
the gameplay was not immensely fun  eithercall it my opinion but i did not enjoy this game at all and  couldnt wait to trade it inits a little late to be writing a review on such an old game but hey this was my first play through and thought a review might help someone make a decision on whether or not to play parasite eve
now a lot of reviews do a great job of summing up the flaws of this game bad running system very short game super linear etc
heres my ultimate beef with parasite eve
it fails to be a worthy rpg and lacks cunning elements to be a decent horror game
i ordered french toast with hot maple syrup and sausage on the side and what do i get
a dry lukewarm bowl of oatmeal and no milk
blehmy other beefs with parasite evescut scenes before boss battles
anyone who likes rpgs knows how utterly frustrating it can be having to watch the same cinematic before a hard boss fightbad weapon system
why use a rocket launcher when you can upgrade a pistol to do just as much damage as well as make you act faster in battle
whoever was assigned to work on this part of the game was in my opinion lazytwo discs only  hours of gameplay
what
already mentioned in other posts toolinear linear linear
ok not final fantasy  linear but close to itboring story
think of a corny scifi movie and there you have it
nothing new or exciting
if anything the story borrows on resident evil and tries to mix in its own thing
whatever that is because i totally missed it
same old same oldadding techno music to a game isnt a great idea if youre going for horror
its catchy but destroys the mood when youre in a dark hall and theres creepy ambient noise
then all of a sudden puch puch puch surrounded my monstersad last boss battle
its a fairly easy win but heres the catch
after the battle you have to run from the creature through a ship
think resident evil  ada story but if you take a wrong turn and it catches you guess what
game over start over from last save point
only your last save point was before the  minute cut scene before the boss and the  minute boss fight
so after all the failed attempts just to run from the boss youre looking at a  hour last boss battle due to failing to run away from itnow parasite eve does have good graphics for its time and a very nice soundtrack with some catchy tunes
is this enough to make it a great game
in this case noahem check please
its just lacking way too much to be worth while as many others have already mentioned here on amazon and doesnt really pull out anything uniquealso on a side note if youre a christian i highly recommend skipping this one as it manages to drop the name jesus twice in the first five minutes of game play
then four minutes later you find a journal that mentions the bad guy wanting to  sell their soul to the devil
mix that in with a bunch of hells and god throughout the whole gamei bring this up because ive played a lot of rpgs in my time
i mean a lot
and its very uncommon for stuff like this to be said in a fantasy game especially on this level
poor choice of dialogue the guy who translated this to english should have been fired
im sure you wont find this type of dialogue in the original japanese translationits games like parasite eve that make me ask why
why dont i have millions of dollars to make a game to show them how its done
that would be great but i dont
so im stuck just throwing in my two cents on how and how not to make a game
sighanywho all is not lost
if youre looking for a classic rpg thats worth while why not check out vagrant story or threads of fate
a few months back i played vagrant story and it was actually pretty decent
solid story and gameplay
very similar to parasite eve minus all the bad stuffthanks for reading hope this helpsto anyone who is trying to play this game today i just want to say that i played this under optimal conditions christmas break  at the height of my ps gaming powerand this game was extremely extraordinarly mediocre
i know that a lot of people are falling over themselves to play the sequel but you have to ask yourself if a sausage factory like square has waited over  years to make a sequel to one of their most at the time expensive franchiseswas it really all that greatthe game had a few good perks to it customizable weapons beautiful cg cutscenes a pretty unique storyline for an rpg at the time but if you play it without the rose colored glasses of nostalgia and collectibility you will find an utterly mediocre gaming experience
i beat the game from start to finish and at the end of it i could only say i spent  hours of my life on this
i gave it  stars mostly because it was a risk on squares part to break away from the successful final fantasyscifi settings which is commendable in itself and i had approximately  hours of enjoyment out of it but if youre seriously looking to spend  on this game its not worth itover the years i played road rash and had many happy memories with it actually it wasnt this game it was road rash  this game is a disaster and a blight to the road rash franchise
to start off the combat mechanics really dont work and feel and haphazard
unlike road rash  which has smooth and tight combat mechanics and controls this game doesnt do just about everything right with the controls
it has a stupid driving mechanic you use the second analog stick to drive while using r to attack
what the f
whats so hard about using the x button to drive
next is the crashing
when you get knocked off your motorcycle you have to run back to get your bike
with road rash  you get put back on your bike automatically as with this game you have to find your bike and get back on it
the graphics are better looking than road rash s and the character models arent recycled but this game is incredibly flawed and not fun especially when a car randomly appears in front of you and you get hit
this game is so disatisfactory that im going to change my road rash  review and give it a higher rating
avoid this game retro fans you will hate yourself for playing itthis must be better as a pc game
now i see why it was so cheap
the controls and maneuvering are so ridiculously difficult to learn and master
and the game has no tutorial or any way to learn what all the little squares and whatnot mean
i spent over an hour trying to figure it out on my own and couldnt so i put it down and never picked it back up
i hear the one for the pc is a real classic and very enjoyable thoughgood idea bad trynobody well come to ur townnone simciy games r playablefrom what people make this game out to be it was supposed to be the quotbest game of all timequot perhaps but i saw it completely different
i dunno if it is just me but i found this games storyline incredibly boring the battle system was ok in some areas and the music was absolutely dreadful
let me break it down for youmusic why
because it repeats the same tunes overand overand over again
the reason i gave it one star is because when you first hear the music it sounds good but after hearing it in so many areas throughout the game its tedious and very annoying
and when it comes down to it i wasnt very satisfied with the music to begin with
like for example most of the areas in the game will play the same exact music so it gets very repetitivestoryline i found the storyline pretty horrific as far as being interesting and captivating
not once in the game did i really care about the characters or what was really going on
and there is so much talking in this game i could probably fall asleep after drinking  glasses of cafe mochato be bluntthere is way too much talkingand the story isnt explained till the end
so throughout the whole game you are confused about what the heck is going onentertainment why am i giving it a decent score for entertainment
well there are a lot of interesting mini games here and playing in the xenogears mixed with humans is also interestingplayability this is probably the only good part about this game
you can actually jump around here unlike most rpgs and there is plenty to explore in your environment
this sometimes makes traveling through long boring dungeonsnot so dullgraphics the graphics are alright not good enough to give four stars but pretty good for when it came out
i am a sucker for d playstation one style graphicskinda the oldschool style that playstation rpgs used to have
if you are looking for final fantasy  graphicsyou wont find them hereoverall if you have a lot of time on your handsor like playing games for extended periods of timethis is for youi however do not enjoy playing games for  hours just to see the ending
yes thats right  hours just to finish it off not including finishing everything such as side questsjust the storyline
how someone can sit through  hours of jabbering and a boring storylineand lets not forget annoying musici have no idea
i hope some day i will understand why this game is considered to be so greatbut i dont think it will happendo i recommend this
nopei loved the sim theme park game on pc and when my brother got a ps for his birthday i went right out and bought the sim theme park for playstation
well i was dissapointed
the graphics have been reduced greatly
it is also difficult to create a park in my opinion and the it takes a while for our version to load
however there may be a scratch or so on it since i did get it used i am cheap lol
however most playstation  games have lower graphics so it isnt that bad
but honestly i like the pc version much better than the ps versionpros fun creating your own theme park the great pc game comes to pscons pc version better low graphics controls are difficulti think nintendo  was probably the worst nintendo system next to the standard nesthe standard nes had a strong library of games but that didnt matter because only  or  have a save option
nintendo  on the other hand has strong graphics and a short amount of games
there are only  or  games on this system that are worth owning unlike game cubes  the graphics are not a weakness what is a weakness is that nintendo  just didnt have enough quality gamessuper mario super smash brosf zero xms pacman maze madness are the only n games worth owning
those games almost make up for the limited number of gamesits still worth owning because of its great games but dont get your hopes up after all these years there have been only about  or  games worth owningthe super nes also had a pretty limited supply of games but managed to be one of the best systems ever made because the  or so games for it were masterpiecesi suggest you get a game cube because it has more worthwhile games than any other nintendo system before itit is a known fact that the n got its barn doors blown off in the system wars
upstart sony took the technology that was to be the foundation of the snes cdrom addon and proceeded to give the world the sony playstation and theyve been on top of the biz ever since
the n was crippled by nintendos stale conservative business attitudes a lack of games aimed at anyone over the age of  and an expensive cartridge medium that required inflated prices to recoup any sort of profit fromand that is where we stand today nintendos current contender gamecube is being smacked around by both sony ps and microsoft xbox and as if that isnt enough humiliation nintendo still wants consumers to shell out  bones for what amounts to a  model automobileare there good games to be played on the n
of course
its just ludicrous to expect the gamebuying public to pay the equivalent of gamecube prices for an outdated dead waypasttheprimeitneverhad system
its a shame because there are some fine titles to be had but no one will buy them when they can simply sink those funds into a stateoftheart machinedumb marketing thy name is nintendoi found this game more aggravating than enjoyable and was constantly reloading maps to try and place my units in a more strategic areawhich i wasnt very successful at
when my units did have los enough to quotfirequot they spent most of the time yelling about quotno clear shotquot
meanwhile the americans can do little to nothing to stop the german tanks while in reality a well placed round from a sherman at gun or even a bazooka could at least immobilize a german tank
the computer controlled german tanks have  comprehension of the terrain and even the layout of units they shouldnt be able to see firing all the way across the map
the computer controlled mortar crews can knock out every half track and armored car you own while in reality they shouldnt even be able to see them  yet while your mortar crews are useless most of the time
the player controlled units are slow their turrets are usually traversing the wrong direction and they are always quotaimingquot and rarely firing
a target can come around the corner its turret already rotating and knock out a sherman before you can even make its turret line up to fire
very very annoying when american armor is in such short supplybut it lacks punch anyway
watching the historical accounts of tank battles  shermans in real life could knock out even a tigerin this game they can only draw fire to themselves while not doing a bit of damage to the enemycant i at least immobilize a panzer once in a whilethrow me a bone here
however the infantry units are great fighting a hopeless battle until the panzers show up to blow em to helli found cc to be more forgiving to sunday gamers with the russian ts and tank destroyers being an even match for panzers
i would love to see an at rifle score at least one hit on a tank thoughsome day maybewell i cant say that nintendo made false promisesthe game gives you your pokemon in all their d glory with their cute little attacks in   bit graphic splendorwhat else you ask
well thats the problem
there isnt anything else
this game is fun if you and your friend want to  play pokemon with better graphics
there is almost nothing else to do with  this game  although it offers multiple other features none of these  merits any praisefor example the game comes with  quotmini  gamesquot of sortswhich are all basically variations of each other in  that they all require mindless button mashing
some require timed button  mashingwoo hoo
the only one that speaks to be something worth anyones  time is the clefairy memory game which requires you to remember sequences  of arrows and repeat them within a time limit
these games get real old  real fast
but thats why its worth renting not buying
blockbuster will  even give you the nifty little controller pack to upload your pokemon  should you so desirequotbut it comes with other stuff too you biased  punkquot  it does
oh yeah that silly single player thing where you  can fight against a bunch of ridiculously easy trainers toearn nothing
no exp cool items secret endings or anything interesting like that
why  bother when you could be kicking the living crud out of the elite four  again and again for experiencethe one redeeming thing about this game  is the single player oneonone vs computer mode
you choose  pokemon   all level   and your opponent does the same
these pokemon all have  attacks preassigned to them  and higher evolutions arent necessarily  better because the lower evolutions have superior attacks so that  everyone isnt choosing charizard over cute lil ol charmander
in essence  the only way to win is pure strategy because you cant go out and level  your pokemon a bajillion levels and try to use brute forcebut then  again the primary audience of pokemon is little kids
and since when do  little kids use strategy in these games
excuse me while i go knock on  woodagain to summarize its a renter not a buyer
itll keep you  entertained for a night or two and is great for pokemon trainer parties  but beyond that the game is a waste of everyones moneythe only reason this got two stars were the mini games which arent near the quality of mario party games or pretty much anything else
what this game is is the annoying random battles from rpgs without the fun magic systems plotlines or general gameplay
transfer pak adds nothing to the replay value and will be worthless on the n avoidi may not be a pokemon fan anymore but i loved the series when i was a lot younger fun fact a jirachi card was what motivated me to ride my bike
actually id probably go play pokemon sapphire again if i were to come back to pokemon fandom
now let me tell you im not one to troll nintendo
im a huge nintendo fanboy just so you know see lots of my other reviews for proofbut then when you look at pokemon stadium youd probably think omg pokemon on nintendo 
it would be one of the best nintendo games ever considering how awesome the series was on game boy right
wrongpokemon stadium isnt what youd expect to be the next big entry in the franchise
rather than it being an rpg the seriess turnbased battles replace it all
its all about fighting your pokemon
nothing else
in turnedbased battles
how the heck is that supposed to work
its not
if its an rpg with that stuff then wed be all over it
you cant have the turnbased battles make up a whole game by itselfokay maybe it actually isnt all about the turnbased battles
there are minigames and some of them can be rather interesting
but they only remind you that this should have been an rpg
we had to wait for pokemon colosseum to give us the experience that we really needed
this should be left alone as one of nintendos few pieces of crap
at least the graphics were amazing for the na game where you play as a trainer and command pokeacutemon to fight other trainers sounds awesome right
pokeacutemon stadium is possibly one of the worst nintendo games i have ever played
now when i was a kid it was really fun to do the free for all mode and chose the best pokeacutemon the game had to offer but after you played that a few times it was time to shut off the nintendo and plug in another game
there is no main story to keep you involved its only tournaments after tournaments
in retrospect the idea of a pokeacutemon battle game sounds amazing but if you thought it was going to be anything like the hit pokeacutemon games on the gameboy your surely mistaken
the one thing this game had going for itself was its stunning graphics
pokeacutemon stadium used the nintendo  to its full use on detail in this game but the soundboard on the game can get slightly tedious and annoying
with an announcer restating every move you just made over the loudspeaker it makes you want to play the game with the sounds off and if your going to play it with the sound off you might as well not play it at alloverall i give this game a  out of  it has great graphics but the game couldnt seem to pinpoint the certain aspects of a pokeacutemon game that its players love the story and the adventure sideat first mario party  seems like one of the best games
dont get tricked
after a while mario party  will be the most boring thing ever
the minigames will get old and it just wont be fun
the multiplayer mode is good for partys but even then will get lame
this is a rental onlythe controls in this game are confusing because you cant tell what the messages or options mean
however if you want to play this kind of game i recommend reading the instruction manual daily
why
because the rules are completely forgettable
otherwise this game may not be worth playing unless you have a partner to help you play itthe transfer pak only works on a limited number of games and u wont use it a lot unless u have pokemon stadium or perfect darkif u have those games and hvae game boy versions of them buy this
if u dont theres not a real reason to buy this if u dont own those gamesthis pak is basically only for the pokemon stadium game which is quite fun for me since i love the strategy of pokemon
anyway i got this and did not know that pokemon gold did not work with pokemon stadium  and i also discovered that you cannot mix and match pokemon
for example load one pokemon into the game and then rent pokemon of that type
maybe i am not very experienced with this or did not read up on the product more
however if you can get it for a low price it is interesting
but it hasnt worked for me since i lost my pokemon red gamepros you can add more pokemon that you cannot rent you can play the gameboy version it is a low price especially when you get it usedcons not enough games that work for it simply not really much pointthis is the so called quotbetter versionquot of pokemon blue and red
the only thing thats better is that you can get charmander  squitle  and bulbasaur
the graphics chanmged a little bit and pikachu is the only pokemon that cries its name
why is that
but pikachu learns new atyttacks like dulble team at lv
it raises your envade
slam at lv  
a normal phsical attack 
and thunderbolt at lv
pikachu is your starting pokemon
but it cant evovle
raichu like kicks ass
raichu has one attack pikachu doesnt mega punch
for people that dont know this but sometimes you nmeed to make some of your pokemon to elvove to mlearn new movesthere are good zombie games and there are bad zombie games and i hate to say this but this game has to go under bad zombie gamesthe gameplay itself is fun but when was it invented that zombies could shoot machine gunsalso the plot is not so good who wants to chase after a young man who does not want to show his face to until the very endmy last gripe about this game is the graphics are aful for a system that is supposed to have very good graphicsthe reason i even rated this two stars is one it gets a star for booting up and two for having some creativity but not much creativity at all though do not get me wrongonce you play the first scene all others are the same
you have the same type of customers and the same moves within the cities
i got bored after  minutes of play
the only highlight of the game were the soundtrack from hit bands the offsprings and bad religion
one of the bad games sega had madepick people up and drive them through an impressively rendered city to a limited number of destinations
along the way you can chase people off the sidewalk bang into cars dodge traffic and even drive across the bottom of the ocean but so what
you cant shift except to put it in forward and reverse
the car acts as though the wheels were under the center
theres no power sliding around corners
people always get out of the way on time
some of the roll overs look realistic but theres no real damage
you almost never get up to speed as there are so many obstacles and sharp turns
the cars all handle about the samethis is the kind of feel good game
it all takes place on a bright summer day
the convertible taxis go bombing around with their tops down but i get a little stressed with all the rush rush and the traffic
i just dont feel like this is that much fun
its stressful and tedious
people say this is a racing game but it really isnt
its a driving game sort of a fake driving game and i think its best suited for an arcade where the glitzy graphics can pull people in for a couple of rides and then let them get on with their lives
playing it for more than a few minutes just shows you how little it has to offer
i dont think they even have different views and im sick of this town san franciscoif you want a decent racing game get need for speed for psx or even ridge racer
at least rr had powerslidesoh yeah
the music sucks and the chatter gets old even faster than the gamed has its moments but for the most part this game is just plain boring
the graphics are stellar the cinematics were well done and the controls  are pretty easy to learn but when it comes to actual gameplay there is a  lack there of
the game consists of four discs of little more then  repetive cgi movies
you control a women who never speeks on camera but  supposidly does off
you are forced to trek back and forth to the same  spots over and over again killing the same monsters in the same spots the  same way each time
 of the time you will have no control of what is  going on and just sit back and watch
and for every little thing your  character does open doors pick up an item and so on you are forced to  watch a quick cut scene everytime
it gets very old very fast
for those  who actualy like to play games rather then look over your friends shoulder  and watch look elsewhere
dont even bother with this coasterthis is not a game it is a completely computer rendered movie with good dialogue decent story and wonderful music
the problem is i play video games to play and this title lacks gameplay in a woeful manner
you switch modes so there is some upclose gun battles alot of em in fact thats all the gameplay really consists of besides wandering around
the hunting mode is fun for about ten minutes until you master it
i would buy this game for under  twenty bucks and be happy with the entertainment value i got from the fmvs and the soundtrack both of which are incredible
if you are looking for a scary little movie that you push along you might just like it but rent firsti definitely dont care for nonlinear games
i may go back and try to solve this one again some day but for now i prefer games with puzzles and progress
i did a lot of dying the few attempts i made at the last expresstraveling on the orient express amidst intrigue may be perfect ingredients for an adventure game but in the case of the last express the souffleacute still collapsed
starting with the unorganized activities that are required of your character plus a dash of the bizarre the last express is a messy depressing game
this combined with some hopelessly outdated graphics make this game one that i wouldnt recommendthe game is mostly in first person yet you do see the main character in the third person
unfortunately the creators of the last express decided not to use real actors in the game like myst and titanic adventure out of time did
they instead digitalized the characters a mistake in a time before the technology was there to make semirealisticlooking computer animated people
the result is that the characters in the last express look like cartoonsanother fact to take into consideration about this game is the real time aspect
instead of events being exclusively triggered by another the character sometimes is required to wait until a certain amount of time has passed for the next part of the game
this was not much of a problem except in one part of the game where you must wait to get to the next stationby themselves the cartoonstyle of the characters plus the real time aspects of the game arent a big problem
a big problem with the game is in regards to the plot
its confusing and what the character is supposed to be accomplishing is not explicitly explained
ever
the game takes place before world war i and involves international intrigue with sinister communists and germans
eventually you can glean information but basically you are dumped on a villaininfested train with no clear goals
however thats just the beginning
the plot which is rather an unorganized one also takes on some bizarre twists
first the game includes a strange dream sequence which gives the game with a strange atmosphere
the ending of the game also includes an incredibly unrealistic and bizarre sequence
spoilers follow
the main character also falls in love with a woman on the train whose life he saves at least once
at the end of the game she leaves him at the station handing over her dog to him for safe keeping
the game closes with the dog barking mournfully
it was a depressing ending to a strange game
end of spoilers
also be warmed that there is violence in this gameliteral throat slitting gunplay and handtohand combatalthough he character animation makes the blood look very fake
still if you dont like this kind of thing avoid this gamemy recommendation is not to play this game
the plot is uncoordinated with a depressing ending and the outdated graphics dont help at all
if you like the spyespionage thing trytitanic adventure out of timewhich has an excellent plot and takes place around the same time
and if the orient express interests you tryagatha christie  murder on the orient expressinstead of this gamethis game stinks
  buy it if you want to occupy yourself for  days
its basically doing the same thing over trying to achieve new goals that each mission sets
not much of an rpg juz plain strategy with a medival themethe game is a typical real time strategytactics
it combines elements from familiar microprose games eg
masters of magic with real time components
the major drawback of the game is that theres really not much to do  the game kind of plays itself
you only contribute by building buildings and telling them to produce units
the mechanism for controlling the units is kind of awkward even if somewhat different than other games
you set a price on a territory to explore or a bad guy to kill and the units respond based on their character
theres no way to give specific commands to units
the game gets old really fast the variations in strategy from one scenario to the next are negligible
its interesting at first but gets boring very quickly
in addition the scenarios are kind of easy
i gave it up after the first two hours
i think you can find tons of better rt strategy games
i am a huge fan of the microprose titles and this was a big time dissapointmentin my book this is a major investment for any quotgamequot so when you plunk down that much green youd better end up green with envy that you werent the one responsible for designing such  an amazing product
in the case of gunship
youll see plenty of green but  only in the form of the aircraft the ground the trees did i mention the  ground
and loads of lifeless buildings stacked together like some  survivalist compound
the excitement in gunship
hardly went further than  the slick graphics and screen shots on the box
as for performance the  play of this title is just plain plain sort of like cream of wheat if  you dont cook it with a pinch of salt all the sugar in the world wont  help and it doesnt help gunship
so to avoid that familiar dull sinking  feeling you get in your gut and your wallet because youve been lured once  again into the cold murky depths by the sirens song ie
slick packaging  wait until it goes on sale or you can get it in your local secondtime  around software store for lesslike i have said before when i reviewed tiberium sun westwood provided a excellent battle interface and look
now i just want westwood to give a game with a good storyline
in tiberium sun it was horrible how they gave james earl jones and michael biehn such abad storyline to act tonow in firestorm we have to relive all the nonsense again
why did i buy this addon
first of all i got it for dirt cheap and i wanted to see what the new units had to offer
firestorm is truly the worst addon pack that westwood has ever made
at least the orginal cc addon pack had the dinosaur levels
why anyone would want to play the same storyline twice is beyond me
the ai is truly stupid
on the gdi side just amass a large group of orca bombers and you can obliterate anything and on nod side you can pretty much sub apc engineers and steal all your enemys buildings and easily defeat them
i finished the addon in one day
the addon is that patheticthe addon is centered on one thing destroy cabal
now i happen to think that cabal is pretty kewl especially when you are working with him
but now you have to destroy him twice in both campaigns
one of the new units the reaper you do not get to build or create which is pretty much useless
and in the last mission on nod campaign cabal attacks you with both nod and gdi units
the computer always has to cheat doesnt it
the game play is still unbalanced and you can whiz thru most missions like a breezei dont recommend this unless you are really bored and want to play thru  missions on both sides that follow the same storyline
i truly hope red alert  will be a improvement
i really dont think anything can top the storyline in the orginal command and conquerlike many of the other previous reviewers i bought the game because the demo was outstanding
im finding in practice that the game really doesnt measure up howeverto ground controls credit this is probably the  best d landbased rts game to come out yet
however it still doesnt  manage to escape from a lot of the shortcomings of its fellow d  rtssthe nature of d rts at least so far seems to be that units are  more realistically proportional to the terrain
while that may be nice on  paper in gameplay what it translates to is that you spend hours moving  your units from one place on the map to the other because theyre so small  in proportion to the terrain
in fighting battles youre obligated to zoom  out to such an extent that each unit is only a blip of a few pixels on your  screennot much fun to watch or look at while directing the troopsi  dont find the elimination of resource management to be a plus for ground  control
what that ends up meaning is that there is no reinforcement  available for you to build or buy you cant simply play and have fun if  you want to try different things in a mission
you have to carefully and  tediously position your units so as to incur as few losses as possible
add  to this the fact that there is no ingame saving in ground control and you  find yourself playing very carefully and tediously indeedtopping this  off there just isnt a good story happening here to keep you interested
its mostly told through the thoughts of the two side commanders rather  than through good character and dialog
the cutscenes are handsdown the  worst ive ever seenthey are videos of the game engine it looks like  and theyre so badly compressed that they look like theyre being streamed  over the webblocky blurry and awful to watchon the positive side  the game does look great especially when you zoom in close to the units  fighting
it plays better on lowerend systems than other games of its  type but youll still need a blistering machine if you want to see it in  its full glorybe warned also that its not entirely stable
a patch was  released the day after it hit retail but not all of the bugs are out of  it
one of the worst is that it will crash on completion of a mission and  you dont get credited with the mission
ive spent more hours replaying  because of this than id care to admitas a former army officer i think  there are some cool tactical things happening in ground control that  havent been modeled well in other gamesfriendly fire fire support  formationsbut in the end when all is said and done i have to say that  the game just isnt that much fun to playyoure getting  of the  experience in the demo
if it really floats your boat after seeing it then  maybe you should try it
other than that buyer bewarei loved fallout  and mostly enjoyed fallout new vegas so i decided to give one of the older games a try and was pretty let down
the main problem with the game is that its very unresponsive
things occur so slowly that you cant be sure whether or not the game has even registered that you did an action or notif youre dying to play this game and are willing to put in the time it takes to deal with the finicky controls then you may enjoy yourself but those looking for a quick fallout fix should just check out fallouts great wikidoa is a fun game to play with friends that can play it alsofirst off the game has no extras
that in itself is disappointingsecondly the single player game  big time
as a result the team battles and versus battles with friends are all you will have to hang on tothese  flaws really killed the game for me
i love extras and a good single player mode since i cant have friends over everydayon the plus side the graphics are great and the gameplay is fun espically with friends
ill recommend this game as a good game to play with friends
if you dont have that option then you couls let it slip byfails
ive never played baldurs gate
i remember my sister asking to so i asked my dad to play icewind dale
he set this up for me and i remember playing to the vale of shadows
i stopped about half way through
the most ignorant part about the games is the battles
as you go they get increasingly frequent
i hate haveing to fight a skeleton with  hp every other second
as for fighting the game lacks as it is more of a point and clicki started playing again from the middle of the vale and finally got out of there
i then went to a temple which was alright
after that i realized that i was going to another dungeon type cave
this time i read a strategy guide to find out that it was about  levels of fighting
thats not fun
that is not fun at all
i could respect a short game with few battles but when i fight battles every other minute just to drag out something it almost seems meaningless after a whileanyways i stopped playing there and decided to remake my party earlier today
i am enjoying it more mostly because i know to make really powerful fighters and forget about druids
my druid last game killed about  units
my main character killed about  this can only tell you that my druid was bad
fortunately i was able to change him later in the game
although when i did i got stuck with a level  character who was easily killed off
so yea dont think because you can change your party means you will be changing later in the game
the feature is useless because by the time you discover just how bad your fighter is the game will be too hard for you to changethe game does a great job in voice actors though
the fact that i create my entire party is fine
the graphics could use some work
i get tired and bored of the same old dark environments every other minute
even the snow seems depressing
other than that the game offers repetitive battles and little more
online play isnt fun at all considering on gamespy there are usually one or  games going
once you do get in the game you will learn that everyone exported characters who fought enemies on easy and had the option quotmax hp on level upquot setheres some advice go play baldurs gate
my sis sister is playing it again
she is enjoying it
this game is bland depressing and repetitive
sorry but dont get it unless you wanna blow  bucks  its  frustrating too the point that it isnt fun
im an avid gamer
its fun to roleplay low level characters
an orc or two can be a very scary thing
this doesnt translate well to a computer game that wipes out an entire party in ten seconds even with the ai scripts on
the visuals are cool but i wish i would have plunked my money down for something else
this game does not deliver
boring linear plot and hackndie
buy some dice a figure and paper for a real roleplaying gamei would have liked to play this game but it would not cooperate
it kept crashing crashing crashing
i wish developers would finish a game before they release itlara looks like a stick insect and there are so many moves and controls its very confusing
also i didnt even know where to go and the enemies are stupid
do not go out and buy this either hire it first or dont  bother at allthis game really isnt as good as wwf smackdown but i think that it has  things in it that should of been carried over to the sequel
one you can rename your finishing move so it sounds cooler like if your name is jack you can do the jackcold stunner instead of stonecold the other in this version you can see the move names as you do them it was really helpful when i had a backyard wrestling federation it made choreographing the matches easierthis was the first of the smackdown games
while it was very fun to play when it was first released this game is almost unplayable today
being that we got much faster games like smackdown shut your mouth and smackdown here comes the pain
the gameplay is actually very slow which is something ive began noticing recently the controls arent as advanced as the later games are and youll just be wasting money buying this game when you can get one of the more recent smackdown games
dont pick this one up now
it already seems dated and pointless nowyes i went out and bought this new tr installment and i have to admit that it isnt that great
although titled tr the lost artifact it is in fact the equivalent of triii gold however since this installment doesnt include the original triii levels eidos has simply marketed this offering as an expansion pack to the tr seriesthe choice not to  release tla as part of the gold series is a flaw to be honest
new gamers  who are perhaps unfamiliar with the tr series are forced to purchase both  triii and tla
for gamers familiar with tr there is as of yet no rebate  offer available to owners of triii and rumors abound that the tla levels  will not be available for future free download such as with tr gold
put  simply eidoss marketing strategy for tla is awful strangeall this  would be moot of course if tla was a blast to play
sadly however it  has the feel of leftover levels rather than new crucial levels
i had no  problems completing this game
i was never once stumped by any of the  puzzles
in truth i finished the six levels in breathtaking time
i  admit however that i did a pathetic job at finding all the secrets
so  possibly i may have missed some treasured gameplaying nuggets
secrets  aside though the levels should still be fun challenging and involving
a classic tr level with challenging puzzles should take hours to  complete
none of the levels in tla took me more than a single hourso  unless your a tr fanatic id stay away from this one
or id at least  wait until the price dramatically dropsmight and magic viii was really a dissapointment when i first played it
it has the same game engine as its most recent prequil but with some downsides
first you only get to create one character your main character  and the rest of your party is filled up with characters you meet
second  and lastly the characters are ugly expecially the male knights
if your a  diehard might and magic fan like me you should definitely buy it to add  to your collection if not stay away from it
i dont like to dis might  and magic but when a product stinks it stinkshaving played mampm and mampm i was really looking forward to this game
unfortunately once i started i lost interest pretty quickly
it is so similar to the earlier games that i felt i was just replaying one of the  other titlesmy biggest problem is that there have been few if any  upgrades to the basic game engine since   dont get me wrong i like the  basic game engine
the world looks interesting and is easy to navigate
however some of the problems that first bothered me in  have become even  more annoying in the later titles
namelyhoards of unintelligent  monsters all monsters in the mampm universe behave in exactly the same  way
once they see you they charge to attack
ok  a few will shoot at  you from range but the principle is still the same
no opponents use even  rudimentary tactics
as a result every fight feels the same
and there  are a lot of fights
there are so many damn monsters in this game that  your finger will get sore from pressing the attack key and the repetition  gets pretty mind numbing
in particular i got sick of the pirates on the  first island
theres a trigger zone that creates new ones every time you  enter it
how many times do we really want to kill the same monster  offmonsters dont react to events around them the game uses the tired  dampd cliche of the dungeon crawl
that is you go into the first room  kill everything there
rest
move on to next room
repeat
guards in  other rooms dont react to your presence until you attack them even if  that is months later
frankly i would be happier if the next game in the  series used a system like the one in fallout  where all the guards in a  complex react in a coordinated way to your presence once they realize that  you are there
this forces you to use stealth dialog skills and to  really think about who you attack and whenthe story is still very  linear basically you have a bunch of quests you have to do
you have no  real choices in who you ally yourself with and who you attack
the world  consists of people you talk to and people you kill with no overlap between  the twothe npc system could be vastly improved  you have no choice in  how you handle npcs
you hear what they have to say then do their quests  for them
i would much rather see the game move towards an npc systme like  the one in fallout  which is really quite good
your lead characters int  determines how many things he can think of to say and his oratory skill  determines how well he can lie and manipulate people
and you always seem  to have at least two or three different ways to approach any  npcoverall my big problem with this game is that there just isnt a  lot of thinking involved or much freedom of action for the player
you  slog your way through endless fights against repetitive and brainless  monsters only to collect a reward and then do more of the samei have long been a fan of this series and i jumped at thechance to get the next game
i knew before hand that the graphicswould not be the best around but that wasnt important
the problem was the game felt hollow
there was much less of a plot then any of the others in the series and was overall disappointing
the gameplay isnt that bad but i wouldnt recommend this game for any but the most stalwart fans of the seriesmight and magic  and  were great games in my opinionshould have been the title
which is a shame because the opening sequences were well done and promised a good solid fpsps with a unique feel and it performed well and looked very good on my computer
i especially enjoyed the underwater sequences with floating bodies a sunken ship and nasty looking fish but the game soon deteriorated into endless hacking and chopping of an army of large crablike beasts through neverending caverns all the while on my knees
combine this with a monosyllabic quotheroquotno wait
quotmonosyllabicquot implies some form of speech or communication
this neanderthal doesnt even grunt
conan the barbarian is a poet compared to this guy and im supposed to care whether he lives or dies
either way i didnt make it through the first level before i returned the game
perhaps you will have more patience than ia little to fast and a little to short but this game comes with expansion that gives the campaign more missions that you have to unlock in different difficulties which i find very uselesschallenging
no impossible is more like it
just remember to download the cheat codes first before playing this game youll need themthe graphics sound and user interface are exceptional but those features are overshadowed by the short amount of time players stay alive in the game
this is not really a serious gaming experience its more of an exercise in futility
the only time youll last longer than an alkaseltzer tablet in a glass of water is when you play as the predator and even then your life span is not that long
the alien cant heal and the marine is the ultimate victim
the game settings should not be quoteasyquot quotmediumquot and quothardquot they should be changed to quotslow suicidequot quotquick deathquot and quotdont bother fighting backquotalien vs predator is a first person shooter
avp has a very poor ai and does not have much of a storyline it is just a get from point a to point b by killing everything that comes in your way
you could play as three different charecters alien predator and a colonial marinealien  the alien levels compared to the others are very easy
it does not have any weapons besides its claws and tail so to kill someone it needs to get very near the enemy but a couple of attacks could kill the enemy
it moves really fast and can walk on walls or any surfaces
it can see clearly even in darkness
the alien gameplay is orginal and a initially a lot of fun but gets boring fast because the same thing happens in every level no new weapons or new enemiesmarine  the marine levels are very difficult and quite unplayable
he has a lot of weapons but is given only a few for the levels and sometimes after the level completion the weapons collected are taken away and is given only a few
each level have a lot of monstors but you cant see them comming because the levels are very dark and you need to use the image intesifier to look ahead it makes the dark areas green and the bright areas white if you fire a weapon with the image intense on the screen becomes white and you cant see where the enemey is
one minuite you could be walking with full health and aurmor but before you know it zero health zero aurmor and game over
the marine levels are very difficult even on the easy difficultypredator  compared to the marine the predator levels are very easy but not as easy as the alien
the predator moves very slowly and can become almost invisible it has many weapons and can take a lot of damage
the predator has four types of visions to see in total darkness and it can also heal itselfeach of the three charecters have six levels each if you complete a charecter you could unlock a few bonus missions and the number of bonus missions that is unlocked depends on the difficulty you play
avp gold has a limited number of saves depending on the difficulty
i would recommend you to play on the hardest difficulty directors cut though it would be very difficult it would unlock many bonus mission i dont think there is any difference between the difficulties besides the number of saves you are limited
avps graphics are sound are ok the special effects are very good
compared to the other games it ran very smooth and it did not crash much either
alien vs predator is a good game but only for very good gamers it is the most hardest and the most frustrating game i have ever playedtenchu itself isnt an utterly terrible gamei know ive put in a good   hours or more on it but whats frustrating is how there is so much  promise and so much failure both in the same package
the feel of the game  is that activision rushed this one out the door and throughout the game  youll find bugs glitches and all sorts of annoying problems that would  lead one to believe that the game wasnt even beta tested
heres my list  of gripesthe controls are worse than tenchu   of course tenchu  is  clunky but they are even worse here
a lot of wouldbe perfect kills will  get ruined because what should have landed you right on top of your enemy  has you rolling out in front of them or some other stupid  stuntridiculous ai  tenchu  did not have the best ai but it was far  superior to this
ive walked in front of guards and had them not see me
on the other hand some guards are capable of seeing me through the back of  their head
also guards quickly forget your presence and seem completely  uninterested in pursuing you once you are out of sight
yup you can be  one foot away from them but under water and neither can they see through  the water nor are they patient enough to wait even a minute to see if  youll resurface nor wonder why a bamboo airpipe is suddenly sticking out  of the water
this is really a let down given that there were reports  that the ai would be vastly improved guards noting blood running along a  stream or looking for fallen bodies blood doesnt run down stream in the  game anyway
other guards can see you without even being present
this  is a neat trick when your ki meter is in the teens or lower and you cant  see anyone but they can see yougraphic interface or whatever you want  to call it  graphics are just plain sloppymy ninja is often teleported  up four feet instead of actually having to climb or jump over fences  anymore 
in the same manner when dragging bodies ive been able to leave  them hanging in mid air as though supported by an invisible floor of  glassgraphics in general  sometimes the backgrounds go through  objects ie you can see the sun and clouds through a wall of mountains
also sometimes you can see guards out of your perriphrial vision but not  straight aheadinconsistancy with stealth kills  again not only can  guards see you out of the back of their head but some cannot be stealth  killed
period
this wasnt evident until playing tatsumarus labor  shortage level where certain guards could not be knocked unconscious even  with  tries or so
incidentally this level seems nearly unbeatable and  i think gives even more evidence that this was a rushed job
with  tries  on this level i could not beat it and i cant say i really want to  anymoredifficulty level  a good friend of mine nearly sold this  within the first week until we dug up the cheat code
the game is nearly  unplayable without the armor but it is almost impossible to get a grand  master so you cant get the armor
this would be different if i could  start looting guards for blow darts on level  but even then those are  useless against bosses and between the combination of worsened controls  bad camera angles and two hits and your dead boss damage activision has  managed to take all the fun out of tenchu and turned it into a tedious and  frustrating derision of the first gamevoice assignment  this is  thefunniest glitch
sometimes the voices of the guards are the wrong  gender and probably the glitch that had me laughing the hardest was when  the shark started talking
cmon folks
the shark should not talk
please test your game before releasing itmission editor is a joke  ok this isnt really a glitch but really i cant even make roofs in this  thing
the saving grace would have been being able to make an island full  of cats or something but all you get are boring people maybe you can make  a bunch of godhas samurai and evil samurai line up like some insane  football game
my overall take on this game is that while activision  certainly added a lot of new things to make tenchu the  it should have  been they lost it where it really countedthe outstanding game play that  made tenchu   sure tenchu  has a lot of improvements but none of this  makes up for the lack of ai a soundtrack good controls and an  environment that reacts in a realistic way instead of one that has so many  bugs in it i never know how it will reacti sincerely hope tenchu   will be the game this should have been
there are a lot of great ideas  here but they just seem so poorly executed that it makes one long for the  game this should have been
its still somewhat enjoyable especially with  the cheat codes and its glitchyness is sometimes amusing but all and all  it isnt worth the  price tagmaybe you should look around your local  vendorsmy used copy will be showing up soon the seller was galactics
i paid  bucks
it worked fine on my pc running windows xp home spthis is a space simulation game
the graphics are a bit dated
the controls are awkward lots of different keystrokes to remember for various actionsmovementthat made it tedious
the story is mediocrenothing newi had high hopes based on all the positive reviewsi played and enjoyedfreelancer
this is not like freelancer the graphics are better than freelancer but the game play and controls are notfor me its not a keepervisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsthere is nothing to do in this game its very redundantits only fun for  or so minutesit is way too short alsobut it is very detailedlike when you swipe your sword on the wall the sword will bounce back and make a spark and most games just have the sword go through the wallthe graphics are very goodthe gameplay is okthe guy swipes the sword fast as hellthe bosses are easyor most of them arei reccomend buying this game if you wont get tired of stuff and like a lot of bloodlustthis has to be the worst idea ever
sonic used the genesis consoles hightech processor to run at amazing speeds
he would run through a loopdeloop
he slid down water slides
he jumped so high that you could see star light zones night sky
can an bit processor do that
no
when sonic runs in this it gets really glitchy
my game got confused and shot sonic to the end of the level
the controls are not as accurate as the genesis game they lag a little bit and have bad traction
the zones are built terribly
green hill zone has had every signiture loopdeloop removed
bridge zone was an awful autoscrolling bridge that had a horrible collision system
sonic jumps onto a scale and waits for the rock to fall on the other side but it does not bounce him high enough to reach land
he ends up falling and dying
sometimes the pieces on the bridge fall not a glitch but the issue is that so many fall that the game starts to lag
do not get this gamegame gear games i recommendsonic blastsonic triple troublesonic driftgenesis games i recommendsonic the hedgehogsonic the hedgehog sonic  and knucklesif you have played this game in the arcade or on a dreamcast unit you know how fast and colorful a fighting game this one is
truth is it is one of  the best d figthers you can playhere is the bad news though  if you  own a playstation and want this translation you will be disapointed when  you play
first of all the lack of the tag feature really does kill this  game
without being able to tag in another teamate mid battle it takes  away some of the games statagy
i think it also seems to move and load  much slower on the playstation than in the dreamcast
we just have to face  it this game is a next generation game on a five year old piece of  hardware and it just does not live up to its true potential
i love my  plastation but i have to advise all to pass on marvel vs capcom for it
play street fighter alpha  instead if you insist on getting the best d  fighting action you can out of your old playstation boxthe dreamcast is the way better version to get as this one is too slow and too easythe playstation port of this game is sadly inept i am a psx fan but this game does stand short to the over versions  visibility
i had to screw with the brightness on my television just so i could see the opening screen right
everything is in a million shades of green and youll be constantly running into obstacles trying to turn yourself around while an enemy slowly chips away at your health  difficulty
on the easist setting i still can only get three levels into the game
its not that im a lousy gamer its just that certain spots where there may be a concentration of plastic helicoptors infantry etc are next to impossible to get around
i let a friend who is an excellent gamer borrow it for a week and he couldnt get any farther than i did  twoplayer mode
twoplayer modes are supposed to be fun
this one well isnt
the levels are too big and youll spend ten minutes hunting down your friends flag and once one of you gets the others flag its too easy to cross back over into your territory without getting caughtplease i beg of you dont make this an impulse buy like i did
rent first and even then youll probably feel like youve wasted your money
 starsnot so much a game as a mild thumb workout mutant academy looks nice  its by the same people who did the excellent gbc version of street  fighter alpha but is much too easy
you can quite literally win every  fight by holding down right and pressing the a button extremely  quickly and its surprising that the creators didnt spot this before they  released the game
there are plenty of xpeople to play as and theres a  handy vs mode so that you can bore a friend but unless you deliberately  handicap yourself this isnt much of a game which is a shame as there  arent many decent beatemups on the gbcim going to guess these people make console games or wish they didthis game is rd person a really bad choice for this game
the camera is often stuck behind thingsthis game is hard
thats ok but you cant save a game and you will die thanks to some surprises so expect to get bored playing the same thing over and overthere are only  maps i think and most are very small
the game is short although they stretch out the game play by preventing you from saving the gameits a minor complaint but why dont any of these asian gangsters recognize a tall white albino bald guy with a upc code on his head
is his disguise of a shirt and pants really that goodthere are numerous bugs
or maybe they arent bugs just bad design choices
for example you cant walk through a guarded gate unless you first touch someone who has walked through it  bizarethis could have been a really good game but it isntthe initial thought of the game seems good enough trying to break down the alltoolinear approach to first person shooters and give the player alternative ways to finish off your objectivies
but this is exactly where the game fails
the missions are clearly designed for two specific approaches  blast your way through which is remarkably easy or follow a very fixed stealth route
the first level could be an example
here you are supposed to assassin an important trial member
you can then either choose to shoot everything that moves or get on top of a building an snipe the target
those are basically your two options
and quite frankly i had expected a much more open gameplaythe computer ai
is also horribly bad
on one level you can easily stand against a corner shoot two guards that are in the room and then wait for other guards to come running in and shoot them too all the time you hardly take a hit
heres another example at one point youre supposed to kill a trial leader
after having disguised yourself as a waiter you attempt to give him a poisened bowl of soup
unfortunately for the trial leaders bodyguard he has to taste the soup and ends up dying
theres a cinematic gunfight where the leader escapes
now heres the thing after the gunfight everything returns to normal and all the trial guards in the resturaunt doesnt seem to have noticed anythingthe positive thing about the game are the graphics
the movement of the characters are fairly realistic
i especially like dragging corpses behind me and watch how their bodies bump into furniture and such
if you try dumping a body over a toilet youll see how it slumps down the side and falls to rest on the floor
very nice
the jungle levels are also impressive with the trees and the plantsbut as they say gameplay above graphics and here quothitmanquot fails miserablylooking at the box of this game i expected it to be really cool and from reading all the reviews that say it was good but when i bought it it was a very large dissapointment
after the first few missions the game becomes so frustrating that you will want to break your computer
the controls are very messed up and the camera fews always get stuck on walls so you can not see anything
this game is frustrating because  of the game is trial and error
if you go the wrong way you become  because most of the missions are timed  so you lose the mission
i got to admit the visuals in this game are very eye pleasing but it doesnt not make this game worth the  that it is
hc also had tons of glitches and bugs in its system which eventually  the  out of you
well my opinion is not to buy this game but u can try it for yourself and see what you thinki got this game cause my cousin gave it to me
the concept sounded awesome  like youre this hitman going around doing missions and killing people
to be honest i have not finished the game
the action is very slow paced
you have to plan things out
theres no way you can finish a map the first try cause you have to know the pattern
for example when the limo driver makes his routine routes or when the bad guys go inside the shops or when the bystanders are not looking etc at first it starts out really fun  like everyone has mentioned
but as i progressed in the game the missions got a lot bigger harder and more complex
even the maps get more bigger and its so big that it takes forever to get around
sometimes you have to do  submissions on one map which can suck because if you screw up on the th submission for example then you gotta start all over again
basically its a lot of trial and error
im more into fast paced games like half life and counterstrike and unreal tournament and delta force so this wasnt my type of game
i basically got bored of this game and it does get frustrating
maybe itll be better with a cheat or whatever
but im going back to playing counterstrike and unreal tournament
its time to pass this game to my other cousinafter purchasing deux ex and falling in love with that game i looked within the eidos family to find another fps with the same kind of action and functionality as deus ex after reading many good reviews on hitman i decided to give it a day in court
i just want to say that hitman is a satisfying game in its own right but when compared to soldier of fortune and deus ex it simply cant hold its water
so i urge you to give deus ex a try and give hitman a go only if you have a day to spare to fly through iti got this game thinking it would be at the very least a little bit of fun since i had never played a motocross game before but instead it was a pathetic disappointment
first off the graphics while not terrible are disappointing especially since this is a relatively new game the bikes and riders arent well detailed and the tracks are even worse
the sound on the other hand is horrific there is absolutely no music with the exception of the opening movie and the sound effects are bad your bikes engine sounds weak and there isnt any background sound and another completely unexplainable problem you engine sounds like its idling whenever your bike leaves the ground even if your gunning it
another huge disappointment is that all the bikes handle exactly the same according to engine size so a honda cc and a yamaha cc will handle identically
there is no real tournament mode there is something called procircit where you enter a set of races to earn money but there is no way to upgrade your bike you cant even buy a new one as you progress though more bikes will become availible but since there all in the same engine class there is no difference and there is no choice as to wether or not to repair your bike so once you choose your class your just racing to keep in the black
the manual claims that teams might let you join but i found no indication of that in the actual game
the ai is almost impossible to beat and if you dont place dead last you can consider your self a great racer
the physics are contradictory because takeoffs are way overplayed but landings are almost impossible
overall this is yet another game that could have the best of its genre but because of microsofts lack of attention to details it will be doomed to the bargain bindont get me wrong this game isnt that bad but there are quite a few things that i dont like about it
for one you can only do so much stunts that they get boring very quickly and in no time you would get bored of the current event you are doingthere are several game types that you can choose from like stunts baja and some others that let you go through courses
these arent that fun for mei dont have much to say for this game except i would not want anyone to get it maybe if its in the bargain bin for all digimon fans out there rejoiced when this game came out and so so many were disappointed
why
lets see holy highlighters standard breakdowngraphics    this game sorely lacks by any standards
while i wasnt expecting it to rival highend rpgs by highend companies like sony konami and square this games graphics are remniscent of the earliest playstation games and i thought developers had moved far beyond this
blah
blah
at least the fmv is decentsound    ok the sound quality is just god awful
that and the digimon sounds are really damn annoying like the fact that a blaringly ugly sound is made every time a legless digimon quothopsquot
you would think that since this game would only become popular due to the tv show that they might have included the theme songbut no of course notcharacters    the characters are decently developed i suppose and reflect the typical airheaded attitude of the tv show
the biggest gripe of most gamers is that none of the tv characters make an appearance
whats the point of having a digimon game without any of the characters from the show
another fatal misstep on the part of the designers  most of the awesomely cool powerful digimon from the show never show up
there is also very little control over which digimon your basic digimon evolves into which annoys me greatly
the other annoying aspect is that every  hours of gameplay or so your digimon dies and you have to start the process alloveragainplotstoryline   there isnt one
thats all there is to say  the whole quotlets bring digimon back to file cityquot crap is not plot its a pathetic excuse
 of the actions of the digimon do not revolve around the plotsysteminterface    the battle system is unique which is the only plus this game has
in order to make your digimon even close to usable you have to play an assortment of quotminigamesquot where you walk up to a sign press a button and loandbehold your digimon gains stats
at first i thought that letting the digimon participate longer in this game would make them gain more stat points  but it doesnt matter so basically more mindless button mashing is all that this thing does for you
battling is  of the game and it gets boring relatively fast especially since every  seconds or so you have to feedclean upimmunizerest your digimon
even tamagotchi arent this needybut there must be a positive thing somewhere right
well yes the game is amusing for about an hour before you realize that its just repetetive and doesnt pass off as an rpg or an action game or anything else for that mattertoo many feedings and too many bathroom trips getsannoying fastwhat did they put in the foodpruneswhenon the training fieldi often had to stop training just somy digimon could use the bathroommost of the timemy digimondidnt make it to the bathroom on timeresulting in a ratherunsightly little pileanother gripe is that my digimonevolved into the practically useless numemon of thetimei often let him get killed off until i got a digimoni likedmy advice is to rent this gameive been touting the dream casts sports game for some time now
generally they are some of the bestnfl k nba k virua tennis i suppose it shouldnt come as a surprise that sooner or later id find one that isnt that great
and im not surprised it is the baseball game
unlike football and basketball there really is no movement in a baseball game which i think is partially responsible for how much i dislike this game
just being baseball itself
add that to a difficulty in pitching and batting and the problems with fielding a ball and youve got a game that isnt real great i remember a nintendo baseball game that was more fun even if the graphics werent that great
i will say that the stadiums and graphics are beautiful but it takes more than a pretty picture to make a fun game
and this game isnt much funthis is the worst baseball game i ever played
i had moreenjoyment reading the negative reviews on this than actually playing this game
every negative review about this game is  correct
the only good thing about this is graphics
game play stinks i dont want the computer fielding for me or running basesand what ever happen to the infield fly rule
i was cought up in  tripple plays because the batter popped up in the infield with two men on base
this is crazy
a total waist of money
im putting this game up for sale after only having it for  day
 sega need to be sued for false advertisment
most of the info on the back of this game is false
no hot or cold zones no  different pitches if there is the game book doesnt tell you how to throw them cant control base running the men on base are running on every hit ball no matter what base theyre on or the amount of outs in the inning
sega can i get my money back and at a  increase of funds for putting up with this for a day
pedro i like you as a red sox pitcher but disappointed that you got your face on the cover of this gameonei was all pumped up about dreamcasts first baseball game
i went out and reserved the game
bought it the day it came out and found out that it was  a huge disappointment
ive only played it twice so far but i could tell  that they were in a hurry to get this game out
first of all theres is no  homerun derby in the game
if you think about it almost all baseball  games have a home run derby
why doesnt this game have one
another huge  let down was that this game only allows up to  players
thats pretty sad  considering nba and nfl gives you the ability of up to  players
i  also found that it was unusual that you have to hold down the quotrquot  button then release it to hit the ball
also pacbell park doesnt look  like the real one
the only thing that the game has going for it so far is  the graphics
it is by far superior then any other baseball game out there
now keep in mind that these were the things i caught after only playing it  twice
it probably has tons of glitches such as nba and nfl
dont  get me wrong there all great games but they need to stop putting out  games in a hurryhow can this game be good if you can not even control your fieldersso what i am trying to get to you is what kind of a baseball fan likes a game where the computer controls your fielders and not youthere are also other glitches in the game like sometimes in the infield your infielder runs in place before catching the groundball whitch results to the computer being safe on firstthere is one good thing world series baseball k has good updated rosters for the  season not the  seasonalso pitching to the batters can be fun but with all the glitches and not being able to control all your fielders drags the game down to a twoi really had high hopes for k to bad the game is not gooda total waste of time
never has a game with such potential and mouth dropping graphics been soo horrible
i got the game thinkin i could get atleast a little enjoyment out of what seemed to be a great game
but as i began to play a little and realized how bad the game really was i started to wonder if it was the same game as shown on the case
but after minutes trying to convince myself that the store had made a mistake packaging i realized i made the mistake of buying the awful game
no lie here the worst baseball game to date hands down
just take my advice stay awaythis game has some cool featuresthe batterpitcher matchup is reasonably good players are except when theyre sitting on the bench very realisticlooking
it also doesnt eat an entire memory card like nfl kjust a little over half of onethe bad news though is that there are some incredibly big problems with gameplay
number one fielding fielding fielding
the worst are grounders through the quotgapquot between first and second
the first baseman is apparently unable to move even three feet to his right in order to snag the ball
uglynumber two baserunning
how many majorleaguers have you seen running on an infield popup with less than two out
play this game at all and youll see guys who get paid more than the gnp of some small countries making that very same bonehead move
the player has to physically remind his baserunners to return to base on a popflythese two very large problems are enough to really take a lot of the enjoyment out of what would otherwise be a very good gamethere are some other problems too the little graphic that shows where the ball tiny white pixel defensive players tiny blue pixels and runners tiny yellow pixel that is nearly indistinguishable from the ball is almost completely useless
the fans in the stands look like something out of a nintendo  game
theres no way to skip past the incredibly awful renditions of the national anthem at the beginning of each game
the replays arent very interesting
the commentary is wooden and nowhere near as welldone as in say one of the excellent nfl games
the controls are not always very intuitive or responsive especially irritating when youre frantically pressing b to get your idiot baserunners to return to base while they blithely jog along finally realizing that oh
you want them to do something
these are all pretty petty little quibbles really and none of them would be enough to really make this a bad game by themselves but when combined with the fielding and baserunning problems the annoyances just mount and mount until you want to chuck your controller at the tv
barely worth the  i spent on it usedfor the graphics and to tide me over until wsbk comes out in a couple of weekswell the graphics are amazing and the batter pitcher interface is smooth  and well thought out
the rest however should have been worked on a  little morethe greatest strength is by far the pitcher batter  matchup
when playing against another player the game simulates reality  very well
the pitcher can set up the batter like in a real baseball game
you can throw a fast ball high and tight and then fake the batter by  going low and inside with a change upthe biggest problem i have is that  about half of all atbats are popups to the infield
the rest are  harmless grounders or strikeouts
this game is incredibly difficult to hit  with and makes it lack really any playabilityother problems are that  stats are not readily available at the end of a game the sound is  reminiscent of a bad genesis game controlling runners is a pain and there  is not much control on defensethis game is like an untested prospect  lots of potential but not really ready for the big time
best to wait for  world series  if the dreamcast can survive that longi expected a lot from sega as they have delivered on almost every account of the quotworld series baseballquot series no pun intended
also with the dreamcast finally deciding to show its true ability i saw stills of this game and was in awe
this very quickly ended as i first played the game
oh my god yes the graphics are amazing
that is where it ends
players are detailed and stadiums are replicated down to the upperdeck chairs
but this cant save the game
the control is quirky at best batting is a real hastle
hmm perhaps defense will  be better
no quite the contrary
there is absolutely no fielding whatsoever
the ball flys in the air and the computer moves a player to the spot then u decide which base to throw too
sound like fun
didnt think so
lets go try another mode
ha
no extra mode for you
we are presented with exhibition and season
oh well lets try playing a season with some of our friends
nope cant play on the same team as a friend
with lack of extras poor control and lack of it as well and no team playing this game avois a  star with its amazing graphics
this game is horrid to play and i strongly suggest playing tommy lasorda baseball for sega genesis over this game
at least you can fieldwell i thought i was getting sooooooo much more after all the hype but honestly this was just plain boring
pretty to look at but shoddy controls and not enough fun stuff to do
mostly running around talking to npcsnon player charactersand opening doors looking for npcs
yawn
yes it looks pretty but unless you like long drawn out storys and watching a game more then playing skip it the one word to best describe shenmue is not quotgroundbreakingquot its repetative
talk to  persons to find the one with the clue to carry the game forward and when you get that repeat
action is sparse and senseless wandering is essential to the game
i hate talking to everybody to discover that i have to go to meet someone the next night
to make things worse youu cant skip time so you really have to wait and wait and wait
the quotquick time eventsquot are cool but too far apart to save this snooze fest
shenmue got old after disc  and went downhill from therethe graphics are awesome and the idea behind the game is cool but not well done
this game can put you to sleep faster than sleeping pills
the worst part of this game is working in the harbour for  days and having to do that stupid forklift race each day yawn and tedious to the max
i have no desire to finish the game as you never face the bad guy not even in part  you just keep walking and talking walking and talkin walking and talking get the point of this game
if you like wasting precious life that could be used to live then this is for youotherwise get a more fulfilling gaming experience elsewheretwo stars for graphics and innovative conceptwith all of the hype surrounding this game i thought it would be a whole lot better than this
of course by now youve heard about the great graphics
okay ill give you that but i want a game not a movie so i care about how it plays and thats where shenmue falters
the gameplay consists of punchpunchkick style action and at times its restricted to you hitting one button along with the movie scene
yawn
i actually dropped off a little during part of it no joke
while it is certainly a technical achievement its more movie than gamethis game is one of the most timeconsuming and frivolous games out there for the dreamcast
the missions are dull with hardly any decent action
the one quest that stands out in my mind the most is one where you have to find mr yakamoto
you are given no idea as to where he lives and go door to door trying to find him
it always happens that his house is the last you look at
another problem is the fact that many of the quests are given to you at one time and you have to wait  hours before you can actually do them
there is no way to make time go forward so about  of the  hours needed to complete this game will be on waiting around for the place you need to go to openthis game is very disappointing and if you are somewhat interested in it borrow it from a friend
if you dont have any friends then only dish out the  to rent only if you think you might like itthis is a good game but not a great one
i hate to say it because i like the loose concept of the game but i was disappointed with shenmue
i have to give recognition to the fine artistry and graphical quality
however herein lies the problemso much emphasis was put on the graphics that they forgot to add the game
shenmue really isnt a video game at all
it is more like you are watching a movie and every once and awhile you have to pause it do some tedious task and then you get to watch a little more
you really dont feel like part of the game
it often felt to me that i was not playing at all but watching someone else play
i kept waiting my turn and before i got my turn the game was over
this problem was also exemplified by the fact that you can not die lose be killed whatever you choose to call it
i dont know about you but i like a bit of a challenge
not even having ryos fate in my hands made me feel even more like a bystanderone other problem i have probably the most significant to me is that after all that playing you find out that you are just going to have to wait for the next video game to see what happens
you can form your own opinions about that but i have to admit that i felt a bit taken
i just wanted to play a game
i didnt sign up for some longterm deal where i would have to buy several sets of discs to find out what happens
they should call the game shenmue chapter one
at least then you would know that your entire money is going to only one chapter and not an entire gameif you want to see some great graphics and casually watch one chapter of a story unfold then this game is for you
however if you want a challenge the possibility of losing a game that may come out differently if you were to play it again i dont think shenmue is for you
i recommend halflife and final fantasy  for many hours of video game enjoyment
happy gamingwhen i first bought this game after getting my dreamcast i thought it was decent
i really didnt like the time limit i didnt like the fact that the spray button and the center camera button were both mapped to the same button and i didnt like the mediocre frame rate
but i liked the graphic style and the soundtrack was pretty coolafter playing the xboxonly sequel jet set radio future i realized that it had everything this game was missing
why put the primary function that needs a clear view on the same button as the one that resets your view  especially when theres no manual camera control a problem with many dreamcast games
answer dont especially when theres a whole other button the right trigger that isnt being used
jsrf fixed that problem easilywhy have a time limit when your character both moves slowly and is always being chased by police
answer dont
get rid of the time limit speed up the characters movement and restrict the police encounters to certain areas
jsrf fixed those problems easilyill admit the better graphics and frame rate are the result of moving to a higherpowered system instead
so i wont fault the game for not being on better hardware when said hardware didnt exist at the timeit might seem like im just bashing this game for not being the second one butactually thats exactly what im doing
jet set radio future is more fun less frustrating has better controls and since it was briefly the packin game for the xbox is going to be cheaper
buy it and leave this one as what it is a rather uncomfortable stepping stone to a smooth rock thats aged far betterthe concept of making wario immortal was in my opinion a stroke of genius and handled flawlessly in warioland  in this game however it wears thin very quickly especially in the boss battles where one hit is often enough to send wario flying off the screen making it almost impossible to beat any given boss in less then seven triesthe games level design mustve looked good on paper but is very poorly executed
you must go through each stage four or five times to find all the keys chests and tresaures
time of day is factored as well and after finding a tresure almost every stage in the game is radically changed
for example find the seeds in one level and now there are huge vines growing everywhere in the levels youve already completed allowing access to new areas and items
it can get very repetitives very quicklyalso for some reason warioland  has the worst graphics of the series
the first game even looks better
backgrounds are almost nonexistant textures are bland and although this game was the first made specifically for the game boy color wario is made up of only two colors
huhon top of all of this you must track down your abilities which wario seems to have lost since the end of the last game
while this system worked wonders in metroid fusion its tedious and unnecissary in this game the weakest of the otherwise outstanding wario seriesi have a lovehate relationship with this game
ive played it for hours and hours and gotten a lot of fun out of it
but there are three things that i have done my best to overlook but cannot  that the thing is full of bugs
presumably this is because it was rushed to press to coincide with the release of the th star wars film  who knows
but there are many times when your guy will suddenly die for no reason because you fell down some invisible hole that kind of thing
your lightsaber is absurdly weak
in the movie the jedis lightsabers cut through those droids on naboo like butter
in this game youll be giving them three or four whacks
that doesnt look right and thats not all  the droids can give you a vicious uppercut that will fling you back about  feet or so
it makes for some absurd viewing
back in the day i remember a couple of gamers who nicknamed this jumping jedis
jumping challenges are par for the course with such video games i guess but the problem was the programs lighting shadowrendering resolution  or whatever  was not good enough for such contests to be fair
theres one fairly hellish sequence on tatooine where you cant tell where your guy is how far he has to jump which way exactly he is facing etc
i think the game should have toned down all the jumping challenges until they were able to render the graphics with enough precision that you can tell where your effin guy is on the screenthis game is very boring all you do is kill the andorids in your way which is easy to accomplish and then your faced with a big robotand you think that is the end of level  it not then you kill more andriod then your faced with a bit space ship
this game reminds me of the old mario bros games where you walk foward and get to the end
i was excpeting this game to be more like spyro with hiden rooms challanging villians and clues to figure out this game is so not like that
also my biggest pet peeve about this game is you can not save it at any time
you have to complete the whole level before it will let you save your game
after playing for  hours and not finishing level  i unfortunatly died and was not allowed to save my progress
i had to start all over from the begaining
it took me another  hours to finish level  after starting over from the begaining  times when i finally finished level  i was finally allowed to save my game which sucks
if you get tired and want to save the game and come back later you cant youll have to finish the level before you can save itthe storyline seemed borrowed the first game that came to mind was legend of legaia
a big problem for me was the battle system ussualy i can stay up late and play videogames but with this the attacks were insanely hard to do
i ended up missing more than i was hitting
the best part was the videos were crazy cool and probaly why it was so many cds
its a long game and if you like it you will love it and if you hate it you wont be able to get through one cdthis is the first rpg i couldnt finish
its not because it was difficult
i stopped playing out of my own will because ths was simply put the most generic boring rpg i have ever laid my eyes uponwhat would have become a great game changed into a catastrophic failure
first off these characters looked like they were taken from ffvii given a different haricut and stripped of all their personality
dart looks a lot like cloud
shawna looks a lot like tifa
see some sort of resemblance here
now if only the ingame d models moved and looked as good as squares offerings
the characters lack any real depth of color and the animation is choppy
the music lacks any power at all this was also the first game i turned the sound off for
the songs were too repetitive and the voiceovers were patheticnow my main gripe the plot
what kind of halfassed shit is this
as one person put it quotive seen a power rangers episode with a better storylinequot the plot does nothing to keep you in its grasps to make the game at leats somewhat attractive to its players
the first plot twist will occur at the end of the second disc
thats about  hours away for things to get interesting
that would be a little forgiveable if only the characters werent so damn boring
each character sounds the same they lack diversity with one exception the really big guy that sounds like a retard i cant remember his name at the momenti will however give credit where credit is due this game while it has lackluster character models also features some of the finest looking fmvs and backgrounds to ever grace the playstation
if youre a gamer that enjoys great eye candy most of all this is the game for you
if you enjoy strong plots go with xenogears if you can find it or chrono cross
if you like three dimentional realistic likable characters pick out a final fantasy or a lunar gamewhat a generic title
given the game thats par for the course
the legend of dragoon is certainly the most generic game ive played on the playstation
its sort of sad in many ways that it was released by scea only months before chrono cross and final fantasy ix and over a year after final fantasy viiiwhats generic about it
damn near everything
the main character is a spikyhaired blonde dude whose small village is destroyed by an evil empire and who is designated the chosen one by a pendant previously possessed by a mysterious stranger
can you even name how many other games that borrows from
do numbers go that high
and i forgot to mention his representative color is red
of course the empire is still on the prowl and dart has to chase them with a diverse group of heroesand thats not even touching the translation the legend of dragoon boasts some truly embarrassing translation errors
square learned this lesson after final fantasy vii which took a lot of flack for its stereotypes and writing but that game had an interesting setting and strong enough characters to make up for it
the legend of dragoon wasnt just several years behind it was at least two games behind by ps jrpg standardswhile the story is generic and perfunctory its not really the problem
lets talk about the combat
the legend of dragoons basis for combat is a series of timed button presses known as additions
when one chooses the attack option a reticle focuses in on the enemy and a button must be pressed to time with the animation
while this basic idea has been done in other games like vagrant story final fantasy viii and the mario and luigi series the legend of dragoon makes it the core of combat and thats a fatal error
while timed button presses were integral to the games i mentioned the important thing is that they didnt slow down the combat
the legend of dragoons combat forces you to do this chain of animations every time you click attack and when you miss you get to see your character freeze in place as a number appears only once in front of the enemy
random encounters which are the majority of the game in rpgs take forever and feel clunky
the dragoon transformations a flashy sequence comparable to power rangers are also longer than necessary and the dragoon attacks do little to change my complaints about the rest of the gamethe look of the game is very generic as well
while the prerendered backgrounds of the game look fine the character models outside of combat are simplistic and poorly animated
the incombat look is marginally better and while the dragoon transformations look good the default character models arent very detailed and neither are the enemies
the combat environments look especially poor many of the floors and walls are a single polygon with a blocky texture applied to itas far as im concerned the greatlooking cinematics dont count when were talking about graphics though it is worth noting that the ones in the legend of dragoon look great
but you might as well jump on youtube and watch all of them instead of playing the game or rent advent children or the spirits within or shrek for that matter if thats all you care about
the art design of the game doesnt lend itself to playstations technologyi hesitate to speculate on matters like this but the legend of dragoon strikes me as an attempt by sony to cash in after the success of final fantasy vii
the game looks an awful lot like that game with a fantasy setting substituted for a steamcyberpunk one
i wouldnt call that an improvementlegend of dragoon is one of those games that you either love or despise i of course belong to the later groupas one reviewer already mentioned legend of dragoon was sonys answer to rival squareenixs insanely popular final fantasy vii
i have to laugh when it took them three years to cook up this title that cant even dent the final fantasy fanchisei dont think the final fantasy series is the greatest thing since sliced bread i actually like the wild arms series the most but the only thing legend of dragoon really had going for it was its graphics which i will admit where pretty sweet at the timeoutside the graphical engine legend of dragoon is second rate rpg in every category
lame enemies lackluster story generic locations and some of the worst music to ever accompany an psx rpg ever its really that bad
fights are also annoying due to the socalled additions system which has you doing timed hits all day yeah thats what i call fun when i have to hit a button  times in a row at just the correct moment just to attackother problems also arise such as the fact no one can use magic outside of their dragoon transformations meaning their is really no way to heal your characters except for items which you become way too dependent on in this game and can only carry so many
outside the dragoon tranformations the battle system is very weakplay legend of dragoon only after you have destroyed every other psx prg
by that time youll realize that this is not what any and all psx rpgs should be compared against
even if final fantasy is extremely overrated at times even the worst ff is better than this
i dont think ill play this one againis one of my favorite games
when i first started playing it it was doing good
then it kept freezing and i had to return iti thought that this would be an excellent rpg like ff series but i was horribly wrong
it had an extremely linear storyline with uninteresting characters and the controls were awful
the graphics were not bad but very few cg scenes
seriously i wouldnt recommend this to anyone unless if you are a true rpg gamer
i like rpgs but i had to stop playing this game on the second disc
it was still too boring and the story wasnt going anywhere
i gave it two stars for the graphics and thats iti played this game for several days because although i was having very little fun from the start i couldnt identify the reason
usually when i dislike a game this much i always have some overriding reason why such as the story is a bore the battles are tedious or even the graphics are so bad that i cant even see it
lod had none of these problems but i just couldnt get into it
i got all the way up to disc  and yet it still felt like pulling teeth just to turn on the psone so i put it away and bought hack
i wound up having a lot more fun even though that games story didnt make any sensego figure
by reading the reviews here it seems that plenty of other people were disinterested too so im not alone i guess first off  any of simon and schusters trek games are virtually impossible to get to run on a modern system without extensive effort and technical knowhow and this is no exceptionthere are multiple ss software items out there
the interactive technical manual the captains chair the omnipedia and omnipedia update the interactive encyclopedia the star trek  borg and star trek  klingon interactive movies the starship creator programs and deep space   dominion wars the only conventional game in the bunchall except dominion wars use quicktime and macromedia director as their media playback tools
its entirely possible to get the director program to run on any bit computer but dont bother on a bit version except in a virtual machine
and its entirely possible to have the versions of quicktime these various programs require installed provided you dont have later versions of quicktime installed again on a bit machine but not on a bit one except if using a vmthe biggest problems ultimately come from the use of director as the playback framework which used to be owned by macromedia but is now owned by adobe who have it available for download but havent touched it in years and from quicktimequicktime is horrible  because apple the maker of quicktime released later version of the same software which have nothing to do with the earlier versions whatsoever and are not compatible
oh and apple likes to install extras which do fun things to your computer  like a recent itunes update which caused cddvd drives on tens of thousands of users computers to disappear from windows explorer
apple frankly is responsible for more bad things happening to my windows based computer than anything else ive ever encountered
and i like competition
i just dislike sabotage
in my case i have abandoned all hope of getting any of them to run properly in windows
but i have had good luck installing and running them using microsoft virtual pc  with an installation of windows se running inside of that virtual machine running on a windows xp real machine
i see no reason that this would not work just fine in the virtual machine in windows  for that matter  but you need to be able to install windows x into a virtual machine it seems so if you dont still have an old copy of the installer disk for one of the winx operating systems youre likely out of luckso the only way ill install apple software old or new is in a virtual machine
that way it cant break my main installation again as has happened more than once
fortunately in the case of the simon and schuster applications except for dominion wars this works out perfectly wellso  now that you know how to make it run lets talk about what it actually isthis is not an action game nor is it a tactical simulation
and its not really a technical reference either
it tries to be a hybrid of all three
but it doesnt do any of them very wellbasically  you start off by creating a user account within the game
this is not a bad approach as you can create as many users as you wish
that would be great if there were several people in your home all wanting to play this or if you wanted to create multiple independent game sessions
each users is an admiral and the concept is that youre in charge of a fleetyou have a limited amount of federation credits which you can use to buy and outfit ships in your fleet
you earn more credits by completing missions
so far so good rightyou pick a ship class and then get to pick and choose from some alternative part appearances making your ship look unique
you get to pick a name and a registration number for your ship
and there is a small d interface within the game which allows you to see a lowpolygoncount version of the ship youve assembled
this is the only d element of the entire game though and it doesnt really add much coolness factor to the game really
okay you also get to see the same d lowpolycount model when you log out of the game
they did provide an option to export your custom ship configuration to the only real game ss put out dominion wars with the warp  version of this program
so thats of some minor interestyou then start choosing systems which cost credits for your ship
you get a fair amount of potential tweaking for any ship and theres a fair amount of technicalmanualtype information about each system youre choosing to install
eventually youll want to upgrade every ship in your fleet to the max settings though  initially its just a matter of determining what to buy firstyou also get to pick a crew or rather key crewmembers you dont pick the entire crew
these are mostly characters from onscreen trek
its possible to create your own characters though not from within the application and there used to be some extra downloadable crew i got those for peter davids new frontier novels for example
again the crew costs money but youll eventually want to upgrade to the best available for each ship so its really a matter of choosing what to upgrade firstonce you have a ship that you think is suitable you choose a mission to send the ship on
success in a mission earns you more creditsthe problem is that the gameplay at this point cannot really be called gameplay at all
rather you have a small window which is essentially a map and a scrolling communications message list
and you just sit there and watch things unfold
if you set the speed to be higher this can happen quickly but if youre letting it go in real time get a book to read between messages and eventsyou dont get to watch the ship doing things in real d
you dont hear the comm chatter
you dont have any real control over whats happening at this point
you just sit watch and waitokay theres some interest in discovering if you have come up with the best configuration for your ships for a particular mission  but this is about the most tedious way of doing that i could imaginethe sad thing is if someone were to try to remake this today and use voice actors modern graphical presentation including d inside and outside the ship youre watching and so forth it might actually make for a reasonably fun game
the concept isnt terrible but the execution isi tried to like it i really did
the idea had some great potential
but the execution is frankly only suitable for aiding in combating insomniaout of all of the ss programs and i purchased them all the starship creator games are the only ones i have no interest in getting running againconsidering how bad the first one was i didnt expect its sequel to be any different
it wasnt combines the worst of all worlds chessy soudtrack chessy graphics and a missions operations manual that defifes all logic and reasonthis seems to be the general sentiment about this game and its true it has all the problems that the first version hasyou get more ship hulls to work with that is true but thats about it
the game still has the same lame missions that take forever to play and are not fun
also the user interface is still pretty much the samethe developers needed to make some major changes in this version such as being able to captain the ship you built even in a limited quotstar fleet academyquot manner and to unlock better hulls and equipment other than using the quotcreditquot system
how about promotions to higher engineering positions
that makes more sense
i downloaded a money cheat so i could mess with different hulls without playing all those tedious missions
this extended the games life on my pc by a week but i still got frustrated by not being able to fully interact with my creationsi though that was the whole point behind this gamethis game was actually a freebie when i bought star trek deep space nine dominion wars
i recently bought star trek starship creator deluxe which was made a year before this warp  sequelstarship creator deluxe has much more ship constructions to chose from than the new warp  has to offer
in warp  you only get akira soveriegn intrepid constitution defiant galaxy and klingon brel class ships to construct
in starship creator deluxe which by the way includes starship creator and starship creator addon you may construct from more than  different ships  excelsior miranda constitution defiant akira oberth prometheus soveriegn intrepid and galaxy
warp  has less ships and the missions are pretty boring
you could sleep through it and the mission would still be successful
the computer plays the missions out without any real play control from the player
you can however design that dream starship you always wanted to create
if you really want to buy a starship creator i would recommend buying the star trek starship creator deluxe which allows the player to create  federation ships whereas starship creator warp  allows only  federation ships and the additional one klingon brel
on a plus side warp  allows the player to export their designed ships of akira galaxy and defiant into star trek ds dominon wars multiplayer mode for gameplay online
however the galaxy class starships that are exported into the dominon wars game turns out to be invisible a really big bugglitch
some ships appear to not have been modified at all during exporting  such as akira class ships and they appear to be discolored example engines powered down and lights on the ship are off even during combatgameplay  graphics  sound  value  okay the graphics are stunning and about as good as the humble ps is going to get but ive got quite a few criticisms of this game so here goes its hard to know what youre supposed to be doing half of the time so a lot of the gameplay is spent running around doing nothing the combat is ok but it can be very annoying a lot of the time due to the affinities of weapons and the risk system weapons and affinities are a good idea but the way they are implemented is dreadful
i found it infuriating the weapon creation system is appaling and it is almost impossible to find a combination that does anything
and when it does there is no way of checking so it ends up just as a bad time wasting issue the story is okay but its hard to get a feel for the characters and get involved with the story as in mgs and ff gamesoverall i wouldnt buy this gamei never got to far playing this game
up to the first save and after that im stuck and cant proceed in the game
so i really didnt like this gamewhen you see the quotvertical standquot and quothorizontal standquot listed next to each other you may think that theyre similar products
dont believe itif you stand your ps unit vertically a hard jolt could cause the unit to fall over which could cause damage to a disc in the drive
the vertical stand will prevent this from happening
this is a good thingif you stand your ps unit horizontally it will not fall over unless you pick it up and dropkick it
and if you do that the stand wont do anything but injure your foot and youll probably void the pss warrantee
a stand is not necessary for a ps in the horizontal configuration
the sony ps horizontal stand will not improve your pss stability
it will not lift your ps by more than an eighth of an inch or so
it will not make it easier to access any of the pss controller ports
it will not significantly improve the pss cooling
in short the ps horizontal stand has no practical use whatsoeverso is it a completely pointless product
not quite
if you look at the picture youll notice a raised blue strip at the front of the stand
when you install the horizontal stand this raised blue strip covers the bottom halfinch or so of the ps at least the parts of it not used by the ports
in my opinion this does make the ps look marginally better though it looks perfectly reasonable on its ownso if youre looking to make a minor fashion statement for your ps then by all means buy the horizontal stand
just dont expect it to be anything more than thative been a fan of sonys gaming machines since the debut of the ps all those years agowhen my big old box of a ps one of the first to come out mind you up and died in november my heart was broken
but thankfully the pstwos were coming out the same day
what a great coincidence
i ran out and bought oneflash forward four months
here i sit staring at the nowdead pstwo
she will no longer play any games or dvds giving instead the dreaded the disk could not be read error modified up from the old disk read error messagethanks sony
lens cleaners have failed and theres no little white wheel inside that a felt tip marker and some internet help can adjust as was the case in the older models
did it overheat
she gave off a nasty smelland its known that the pstwos get very warm to the touch despite being loaded up with heat sinks and yes even a little fan that does a great job blowing the already scorching hot air on to critical parts
was it just an unlucky bad unit
did it have something to do with sonys rumored use of cheap parts
do these new units have some inherent design flaw which results in a very short and terminal lifetimei dont know
you decidejust keep this in mind before you plop down a hundred and fifty bucks
the ps is still the best console with the best selectionbuy criminey
whatever happened to the days when youd buy a product and it wouldnt fall apart after a few months
happy gamingsony did just fine with original ps
sure its graphics arent nearly as good as xbox or have a hard drive like the xbox but it has way more games and allot of them are really fun
instead of optimizing the hdd sony has cut it out
it made the system quiter but reduced the size of the fanwhich equalls more disk errors and game freezes and it happens faster than ever
this system is completely pointless and insufficient compared to the original ps
i love playstation but i cant give this system praise like all the other ps fans out there because it was made by sony
here is how it isxbox is a much better system ps has many more fun games to play
put the two together and it would be impressive at least
i suggest anyone looking to buy the new pstwo to spend the extra  and get the original or an xbox
if you want to buy a present for your kids this flimsy toy thing will be smashed within a month waste of money and timei dont see the point in this remake
for one thing the disc drive is now toploading so if people would buy this becuse they dont have much space in their cabinet can forget it
for example if you had slipped it into a small space you would have to remove it when you want to put a game in
althought this is slim and great looking i dont reccomend it
what has annoyed me about sony is that the more popular the playstation gets the quality gets worse because they think that it is so popular that it wont matter
i own a ps fat a gamecube and a xbox
out of the  the xbox is the best then ps then gamecube purely because of the amount of games my ps was given to me about a year ago and it was one of the first pss made because my cousin bought it on the launch date
i havnt had any problems with it at all but most of my friends who own pss have had something go wrong with them
i think that the more popular ps gets the cheaper sony makes them for so they break more
i reccomend the fat ps because it has sliding disc tray and iy is sooooo better
one of my friends has the slim ps and it is tiny about the size of a ps game case
but the disc toploader feels flimsy and when you open it it is not a smooth action
if you have buy a ps buy a fat one because they are the best in my opinion but buy an xbox because they are the best or just buy an xboxalthough the ps was the leader of the last wave of consoles it was the least appealing in graphics and game play
i personally would suggest the xbox if your into features like a internal hard drive with out memory cards crisp graphics custom sound tacks online play out of the box responsive analogs and controls or the nintendo game cube if controls childrens games and even easier game play matter to you more
i would not recommend this to any one unless they have a soft spot for the controller which is comfortable but when it comes to game play it is the least responsive or if you really like kids rpgs or final fantasy games
the dvd player is an awesome feature but too beware of over heating on the smaller model but this is a very rare problem
personally i think it has always been over priced
if you notice it is still the same price as the xbox which has greater features or the game cube that has better graphics and better first party games
now i did point out allot of negatives about the system but it really is the least impressive when it come to actual games
what is impressive is the amount of games in the library
i say age will play a factor
online is available only on the larger version of the consolei bought a mini ps and was fashioned with it it looked amazingly it was fantastic until with a friend we realized the most interesting lie of our lifes we discovered that this new ps has a lot of problems that the old ps block will never have
i traded  week after that the new mini ps for an old block ps with a hardly very difficult problem cause they didnt want to get itthe mini ps has a lot of problems first the lector lens is more at the open air you can see if when you open the top part of the ps while the big block ps lector lens wont be seen unless you open it
this makes the lens more weaker and it can get dirty more easily than the big ps lenssecond the power source for the mini ps is attached just next to it while you are playing over an hour long the ps will overheat more than normal and it can get damage for that even the lens can get overheated
instead the old big ps had a separate power source so that it wont overheat the ps nor the lensthrid the new mini ps is more fragile so if you drop it it will break even if you drop it to the ground from  feet above the ground it can break or get damage
instead the old block ps can resist all hard handles so you just care it and mess with itto be honest i prefer my new old big block ps
i been rude to that and it wont let me down so if you need to choose pick up the big block ps
its way betterupdate okay i just got an update for you guys there is a reasonable amount of mini pss that are getting damage between the first  and  months i have had friends that regreted trading or selling their old ps for the mini one as it wont last long it will break overheat or get burned
ha what do you think about itmy biggest complaint about this game is the totally abysmal mouse movement
i found myself wanting to throw it at the screen so lousy is the navigation
this game is the winner of the worst navigation plan ever conceived
i give it the golden  blind mice award only given to games that cannot figure out how to illustrate to the player any visual clues to where they are supposed to go without a cane
even with one you will be tapping your mouse so frequently without any results that you might as well put on tap shoes and dance across the keyboard waiting for something to happen
the pda console takes up too much of the screen the inventory methods are sloppy
this is an awful gamei usually raise a few eyebrows among fellow nes enthusiasts when i reveal that i do not have this game in my library
the truth is that i wouldnt have it in my houseon its face it looks like a great game
i enjoyed the graphics and sound the first time i fired it up years ago
the story was fun and silly and there was plenty of humor in the level design  characters superhits
then i reached the third level and the difficulty just shot through the roof
perhaps the most telling event was when i attempted to leap the first of the lava pits
i lined myself up at the edge of the platform leaptand passed right through the far bank
i lost several lives before i realized you have to line yourself up in the middle of the platform a substantial distance back
the game is loaded with counterintuitive occurences like this onei reached the conclusion that battletoads isnt really a game
its a sequence of buttonpresses you must execute in a specific order
you dont play battletoads you memorize the sequences much like those sega cd games where you just match the onscreen controller directions while stuff happens in the background
for example the speederbike level is actually harder if you look at the screen
the best way to play it is to make notes on where the walls appear and look at those with only occasional glances at the screen to check your position
worst of all there are a limited amount of continues which is completely unforgiveable in a game demanding so much trial and error
subsequent levels are worse the snake pit being my least favoritei think i only ever beat the speederbike level once as a child then died within seconds of beginning the following ice cavern
and im a player who can beat contra with one life
i went back years later and beat the game using an emulator to save states and you know what
i still didnt enjoy it
its just not a very good game
i prefer to look at the screen when i playbattletoads stars  so much potential but the difficulty really prevents most players from getting very farah yes battletoads
in gaming culture this game is home to one of those levels
you know the kind that appeared impossible when you first played it and then 
after a broken controller and lots and lots of swear words and three hours later still appears impossiblethen you youtube the level and like watching someone play eddie van halens guitar instrumental eruption you see someone pass the level with oh god apparent ease
these players must be cheatingthere are lots of levels like this in the nes catalogue
adventure island 
ninja gaiden  and then the end bosses
the legend of zelda dungeon six
the dam level on teenage mutant ninja turtles
at least with tmnt at least the title of the level makes you feel like youre swearing which is probably pretty cool when youre twelve
pretty much the entirety of the nightmare that is ghost and goblins
also silver surferof course the level i am referring too is the speed bike level which is the third one early on in the game
battletoads is one of those games that tradewest the developer had crafted in hopes of turning into a tmnt type franchise
colorful characters over the top villians in this case a darak queen and anthromorphic toads
for early s the concept fit right into popular culturetheres only one problem
the game is hard
as hellyes you want challenges
but honestly so many people stop at level  because they cant get past the friggin stage
and this was a game marketed for kids
by the time you give up youre so beat and humiliated you dont want to see another battle toad as long as you live
its kind of hard to feel connected to a franchise when you cant even get past the third levelwhat is so unfortunate is that beyond level three there are some intrinsically intriguing well designed game play the surf level the elevator shaft the dark queens tower
unfortunately most people never saw that game play
then there is the snake level which is almost as insane as the speeder bike level
of course there is a second speeder bike level and this time the stones you crash into are mobilean earlier reviewer said that battletoads isnt a game its a sequence of memorized button sequences
while that could be argued for a lot of games it gets to the heart of the main problem with battletoads
for a game primarily marketed for kids the game is simply too difficult for its main audience and for most other players as well
of course tmnt had similiar difficulty issues but that was already establishedanother rather famous attribute to this game is the coop game play
although nintendo has said in recent iwata asks interviews that they have been trying to get coop gameplay in super mario titles since  with super mario bros  other developers were able to get coop play without issue this game contra
however given how frustratingly difficult this game is there is a gamebreaking bug which if you get to the dark queens tower with two players which is highly improbable to begin with  you think the speeder bike level is hard with one player
try two
 apparently there is a game breaking bug that completely freezes the game
that would be so rage inducing id probably just throw the nes out the windowtradewest who owned both franschises did a cross over title having the battletoads team up with double dragon another legendary video game franchise with the  title battletoads  double dragon
although tradewest owned the double dragon franchise back in the early s they have since sold the tile  although a genuine cross over the focus is largely on the battletoads franchise
there are also some inconsistencies between the double dragon canon proper and this title
the game is also very difficult just like the original battletoads though thankfully there are no godawful speeder stages or snake stages this time aroundoverall decent game that is marred by its most famous attribute its difficulty
and the fact the difficult stages come so early on it prevents most players from really seeing what the rest of the game has too offerthe video game website ign rated this title as the th greatest game on their top  nes games of all time
for those looking for great unknown nesfamicom games you simply must play moon crystal a criminally unknown famicom exclusive
the graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo ninja gaiden amazing music in depth gameplay and a fantastic storyline
absolutely amazing
had this been released in the us for the nes i feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the nes canoni have bought two of these with the standard new buy button and both cases were eerily similari ordered this expecting to get an original nes controller or at least a tolerable rd party controller
the nes knockoff controller that comes in the box looks fine at first glance
pretty much indistinguishable from the real thing visually except a qc sticker on the back and the redlettered nintendo above the two face buttons is gone
however when you pick up the controller you start seeing the problemthe first thing youll notice is that the paddle is heinously lightweight
its paperlight
if you put this down with any tension in the wire or if you accidentally touch the wire the controller will shoot like a rocket towards the console  floor
and you will be accidentally hitting the wire often because the wire is several feet shorter than the original controller
that means youll have to get creative on where you place it  no stashing it next to the tv its gonna have to stay near the console
and you are too while youre playingnow i can tolerate how it handles out of play just fine if it plays well
but this is where the generic is just shameful
the original nes controller had a very reasonable roll to the control pad and some respectable size tolerances on the face buttons
the control pad for starters is way too sensitive on the diagonals
you cannot play contra with this controller because you will accidentally get up from the prone position with bullets at standingchestlevel on a regular basis
and its just flat out uncomfortable anyways being a very hard plastic that has a very sudden give to it as opposed to the original which was more gradual about the downpress motion
the start and select buttons are plastic instead of that rubberlike material which makes them clicky and feel far less pleasant than the originals i wonder if itd be nice to have all the face buttons be rubber
the red face buttons are loosely moulded and wobble quite fiercely but besides the obnoxious rattling wont present any gameplay issuesits a terrible controller only good if you need to have a quick nintendo fix on a leftorright only game and you just cant stand the thought of buying used
otherwise pass on itthis is just a tomee controller
when i first plugged it in to play the dpad almost was completely unusable
after taking the controller apart and cleaning it a little bit it started to work a little bit betteronly a little more advancedyou do have a lifebarbut it depleets very quicklylots of high jumping enimies that throw stars and slash at youthe only thing i really liked about this game was the music during the levelsonly pay  maximum for thisthe game reviewer a zz who gave it five stars in a one sentence review and posted it twice was just trying to be funnythis game is pretty terrible and hes an idiotthats right folks
this is another beatupthebadguysandsavethegirl video game from the makers of
actually technos made this game
i know next to nothing about technos
double dragon is a game of three distinct trigger actions jumping punching and kicking and seeing as how the standard nes controller has only two trigger buttons tehcnos decided in part  as with the previous games to make jumping accessible by through pressing the both the punch and kick buttons simultaneously there is lenience so both buttons do not need to be pressed at the exact same time
from a jump you can perform one of three attacks as billy or jimmy cyclone spinkick a or b arial kick left or right and b or monkeyflip your opponent left or right and a
when monkeyflipping your opponent you somersaut over your opponent grab hisher head or hair and toss himher through the air
this is especially fun when fighting on ledges  just make sure you dont get too close and fall off yourselfon the downside there are no playable females which seems to bother only myself
you can still fight against a few female thugs thoughanother hex is the high level of difficulty that stems from the questionable playcontrol
for example the first boss who somehwat resembles the jack of hearts has a long reach which makes him hard to hit and he often ducks when you try to whack him with your cyclone spinkick leaving you open for attack thanks to a lagging recovery
you also cannot monkeyflip some enemiesas for chin and ranzou these two have slightly different attack methods from the double dragonschin has a diving kamikaze headbutt which is activated through jumping towards your an enemy and then pressing a when your press a or b after jumping he does some weird air dance that only attacks from one side
his weapon is the iron claw similar to vega from street fighteryagu ranzou is in my opinion the best character
he uses a katana instead of his bare fists and he can use his other weapon  times as opposed to chin and the lee brothers who can only use theirs five
ranzous weapon is the shuriken or flying ninja staryou can play as chin and ranzou only after you have beaten thembilly and jimmys weapons are the nunchukuesnote in case you buy this game used and without an instruction manual you need to hold the select button for two or three seconds during gameplay to activate the options menu for using your weapon andor changing characters
have funjoin billy and jimmy in a similtaneous brawling on the streets game
this is the same game as ever just with less graphics
they tried to incorporate a new idea to this game by having billy and jimmy on a quest around the world to find billys girlfriend maria
the game gets very old quickly because of how long it is and the lack of enemy varietyout of the  nes double dragon games i think those of us who played all  and werent just stuck with owning one of the  back in the day would probably overall agree double dragon ii is the best of the series
double dragon  was tough but fine double dragon ii was just about perfect and when we heard ddiii was about to come out anticipation was at a high to play ithowever what most of us found was a game not equal to ddi or ii
i think like many at first who played this after the first  wondered why the heck the game was so hard and lacked options to make it easier
both the original games started off on the street this one starts in  a dojo okay maybe they wanted to try something new but it seemed to be wrong from the start
straight away you start off against  opponent once you beat them you have to go talk to a friend dieing on the side of the screen who tells you he tried to stop the new bad guys but he couldnt and the main person to beat is thats what it says is leaving it like a mystery as he dies
i guess that would be fine but its the way its shown dd has a cut scene of marian being kidnapped before you play ddii explains it in the intro that you can skip but in ddiii you have to wait a few seconds for this on screen dialogtalk to hurry up and finish before you can resume and that is just an annoying step backwardsnext up you find your moves you got used to from ddi or ddii are again something different
i used to think the only way to improve ddii would be to have included the ground punches and headbutt moves back into the game
now ddiii has a few familiar moves but lacks in them
in double dragon ii you relied a lot on your jumping  kick that you could preform from the jumping up or down or jumping to the left and right in double dragon iii you can only perform it by jumping up and down you can not execute the move jumping in either direction which is a shame
also needed was the return of the jumpingpowerknee and superuppercuts from ddii but they are sorely missed in ddiii even the reverse elbow smash from ddi would have been a nice additionso what has been added to the rd one move wise
apart from regular kicks and punches the only returning move is the jumping  kick which you can not do jumping left or right now
a run feature has been included and a move where you can jump and flip over your opponent grab their hair and throw them across the screen you can also now do a move where if you run at a wall you can bounce off the wall with a super flying kick which is a decent move if you can do it and there is also a couple of doubleteam moves for  players one is a flying kick your partner helps throw you in and the other is a joined hand dancing spin kick fest that is probably the best move in the game but can only be done in  player mode double dragon  really had lacked in quality from the other double dragon games as being a great game on  player or single playit almost seems like this game was being designed and new ideas where just not working so instead of scrapping the game or improving what flaws it had to be a great game they released a demo and forgot to tell people to send in their thoughts to help improve the game
even in the  player intro screens the game says the two heroes are billy  bimmy lee bimmy
a spelling error like that in a nes game
or maybe it is correct maybe jimmy lee refused to be in this sarky game  so acclame asked their retarded cousin bimmy to be in it instead
the other thing that bugs me is your enemies are not supposed to be shadow warriors from the previous double dragons then why does linda williams and whatever other enemies make a returnwhat makes this game harder from the previous dd games is the lack of options there simply isnt any
you can make the game even harder by selecting  player b and beating up player two so you can solo play against twice as many enemies but if you wanna make the game easier you will need a proactionreplay or something to help you cheatthe biggest issue with this version is extra lives there isnt any
you get  life you die youre out
do not pass go do not collect up hundred dollars nope youre screwed
if you can manage to beat two other character in the game some slow and fat ninja guy and a samurai these guys will become your extra life
you can choose to select these guys by pressing select and choosing them to take over or if you die as who you are in the game one of these guys will take over as your main character what i do not get is why the heck couldnt jimmy be selectable in a  player game as your back up life
there is a little trick you can do to make that so what you do is start the game on  player b and beat up jimmy or should i say the retarded cousin of the lee brothers bimmy who accidentally misspells his own name on the gameplay screen as jimmy
anyway beat the first baddie then beat up jimmbimm until your next hit will be the one that kills him
then position him sort of in the middle of the room in a way that when you perform your jumping spinning  kick he lands on the guy you have to talk to
if done right jimmy will activate him talking to you guys instead of dieing
then make sure billybobjim doesnt die during the battle with the next few bad guys
once the dojo enemies are gone have jimmy exit the room first then billy
when you emerge from the room on the street jimmy will be gone but if you press select jimmy is there as your nd option of character and your backup life however dont use jimmy till you have reached level two as he will still have the ready to die energy he had from your beating until it regenerates in level twonow as i was saying about the extra guys you can choose
they are useless what moron thought it would be a good idea to allow you to use two extra characters that are just about useless
as boss enemies they are decent but to play as them is pretty weak especially if you lose billybimpdaddyjimbo and are stuck playing the rest of the game as one of these losers as i did getting stuck with the samurai guy to finish the game off and yet somehow the dead jimmy still gets the glory in the endso i havent said many positive things about the game yet one option i do like is your option to swap characters during game play and have a special weapon you can choose to use at any time however unless you know how to rom hack like i did and add jimmy as your second character by default play and also have unlimited use of the special weapons not to mention invincibility then they are more something you have to plan and use strategies for when you are going to use them and how
using cheats like that was the only way i could beat this game
maybe you are good enough to do it without using any methods of cheats but being someone who can beat double dragon ii with my eyes closed and then coming into ddiii like someone who dies on the first goomba of mario bros it really picheesed me offonce game play was over and done with i was not impressed one little bit with the ending of the game
at least the first ii double dragons showed something that made you feel like you had passed the game but this ones text where are they now screens really do show the lack of thought and imagination put into this game billy  bjimmy rode off into the sunset to teach kung fu while fuman chu and tom cruise become emperors of kmart discounts what kind of ending is that
no scenes no decent ending just a what happened to them bye screen
i hate these games that are so hard to beat and reward you with nothing once its over
i suppose its not quite nothing nothing would be a single screen with no pictures saying thanks for playing sorry you wasted so much time to see this text bye
but this game here may as well have said just thatso i guess thats why i dont particularly like ddiii
not on the nes anyway least the arcade version was pretty decent and even allowed a rd player but most importantly had extra lives for as long as you could drop coins into it
and you know what the worse thing about it is
its one of those rare times when you can truly say even the sega had a better version the nes
sure the nes version isnt as bad as the gamegear version but its sad when even the gameboy has a better version then the nesi think with the lack of effort put into the game and its terrible reward for beating the game that is why it is so hard
the game makers dont want you to be able to beat it so you can see just how unrewarding it is
at last moment before they decided to release it like i was saying before about it being a demo i really think game testers where thinking that the game is so bad give people  life so they cant advance to the end and see just how shbadly we have made this version but because ddi  ii sold so well this one is guaranteed to make us a few bucks anyway so just release it as it is now no one will see the end of it anywayis it just me or is this game impossible to play
unfortunately my game genie went missing about  years ago and it didnt work in the toploader anyway so unless everybody else is just straight up better than me a possibility theyve gotta be cheatingi was lucky to get out of the first room a challenge in itself but even after i started to get a hang of it i could still barely make my way into the first level
is there more than one level
this is supposed to be a long game
how can anybody possibly know that
you get one life and no continues
yeah i know right
enemies are tough and repetitive and if youre lucky enough to make it on top of the building they can easily knock you off and send you back to the start screen
maybe its easier with two players but my second controller must be hidden with the game geniewhatever happened to making games that are fun to play
forget about fun how about playable
let me play for more than ten minutes without screaming in endless frustration
who are these impossible games made for
suckers i suppose
chalk me up as one
stupid double dragonalthough im not too impressed of the cover art of this title but what i found to be much unimpressive is the horrific gameplay
for those that dont know the famous italian actor name fabio lanzoni is the model posing with the sword on the games cover like a badass and its a common marketing tool to get kids parents including a horny middle aged housewife or single mother  lol to waste their hard earned money on a mediocre game for their kids
for starters the characters kuros sword attack is very short range and awkward you dont stand a chance against any melees when neccessary
there are other alternative attacks like projectile spells but they deplete your magic very quickly and they must be conserved for the elemental boss battles of which swifter than lightning strategies are mandatory
weapon upgrades dont help as much and you cant perform a jump attack which is neccessary for those multiple airborne creatures that must be warded off
the jump configurations are useless and i thought it was me but its hard to steer while in the air
the games music is pleasing and so are the graphics and color schemes
the games objectives are simple and to the point  defeating all four elemental guardians who stand in your way to obtain the iron sword you must use to defeat the evil malkil in the icefire mountain
to progress through each level kuros must find a golden artifact for each animal king for each elemental domain and they will help you advance toward the domain so he can find the neccessary magic spells and armorweapon upgrades range of the weapon still sucks needed to defeat each guardians
as i said before the controls are very flawed and adding on the the difficulty is the absent after hit invisiblity fast depleting life bar difficulty in seeing whats ahead before its too late due to the screens influent pace and limited continues
iron sword looks like it couldve been a very good game but due to the mild success of the previous game and the cover art of the game it misleaded many gamers and kids wasted their money and time on this mediocre title
the game designers are laughing their heads off and collecting their money while many frustrated gamers like myself are biting the controls as early as level  because we die from multiple enemy attacks due to the cumbersome controls
the game designers didnt want to repeat the same formula as simular themed great games like the legend of zelda gauntlet and castlevania but i think they took three steps back by trying to emulate an average game like capcoms ghosts  goblins but they failed
i wasted a good  on this title and i cant take it backthe little mermaid for the gb is a very average game
in this game you go through sidescrolling levels with some up and down movement
you can use shells to open boxes and kill enemies
there are powerups that you can use to defeat enemies
you use bubbles to trap enemies in the game
it is extremely easy to beat
the graphics are pretty good for a gameboy game
the sound effects are average with nothing special about them
this is a very mediocre game with nothing special or overly bad about itmega man v is definitely the weakest of all  original mega man games
its so easy that you can beat it with the mega buster all the way through
you dont need any of the weapons because each of the bosses dies very quickly as good ole blue mega man
i beat the game within a couple of days i laugh when people write that paperboy is a very difficult game
no it isnt but how they played it probably made it too tough to play
for me i took the wimp route and beat it without a problem
no its not a game genie that was used
listen up follow this simple strategy and it will work for you
notice in the game how you are able to advance to the next day if you have enough white houses
thenthats how you beat the game
get it
no
okfine
theoretically and basically you will advance to the next day if you have at least one white house standing on the route
pretty much who cares about the fact that you either make  out of  perfectly or miss a ton of them
as long as you make one perfect delivery to a house you are good to go for the next day
thats exactly how you should play the game
so here is my perfect strategy in terms of beating paperboy forget about racking up points by throwing tons of papers forget about throwing papers to every white house in hopes for gaining a house next day unless you have no fear of being run over by an obstacle focus on making a perfect run avoiding all obstacles along the way without losing a life and just hit the two of the easiest houses on the route
the game is much much harder if you juggle through hitting white houses as perfectly as you can riding the bike in an aligned manner avoiding obstacles side and front and picking up newspapers
i pretty much focused on aligning my bike perfectly as i can and just worked on the same two houses every day
i dont even care about the training course since it doesnt affect my lives
i prefer to crash once i am in there just to save my hands from getting sore
thats how the game is easy for me to beat
i actually survived the whole thing with one house left another one was added on sunday for a perfect delivery making the entire game a joke
even the farewell part was lunatic to observe seeing how laughably i missed so many houses yet i won
thats how bad the game is
i know paperboy has been regarded as a classic back then but lets get realthe game sucks
anybody can beat it if my simple strategy is followed
otherwise tough game and not worth attemptingthey said they tested their games before shipping but when i got the game it wouldnt play
i was so looking forward to playing it too you play as a sportscar on your way in eight races against cars that all look the same
the play control is really bad as you can only go forward nor can you even turn around just move left and right
this was the first racing game for nintendo so what do you expect
there is still big challenge as you cross checkpoints to get more time which makes the game so challenging because there is so little time and the races are so tediously long
another big thrill about the game was it is the first and only game that features d
the game came with d glasses and a d mode
even though it never looked at all d which is why this never caught on and no more d games were madethe game did not workyes its a diffrent game with mario characters yes its not the best mario game
but this game is actually a decent game and its actually a fun game in its own way its not a bad at all in fact the truth is why we got a doki doki panic with mario characters is cause smb  jap  is very hard i know i played it on the all stars collection
nintendo just used this game to tide players over for smb  nintendo thinking of there bottom line released this instead becuse smb  jap would have killed mario  cause they would have thought that smb  was st not as good as the st the rd super mario world mario  but still its a decent mario game its fun too
maybe underrated maybeok the original version of smb  was only released on the famicon which really sucks
this version of the game was a remake of doki doki that is why the story seems really strange for a mario gamei will reccommend mario all stars if you want to play the original version of this game
at all costs dont get this doki doki crapmy recollection of this game is that it survived a very short time in rotation as the lead mario property
smb had taken america by storm and changed the way nes was packaged and sold
people  old people of  years or more would get the thing out at parties and challenges would start to the point that some wives would hide the cords when hosting guestssmb however was a damp squib
the game play was so radically different to smbs runjumpandsquish that people were not happy with it
hell i sat with one guy and we couldnt figure out what we were supposed to do from the start screen
after a few minutes we just played something elsei recently scored a copy of this for the wii with the other mario bros games and started to explore it
the vertical drop start was stupidly annoying but i did eventually get it started this time around  after an inordinate amount of time wastagein fact it is no accident copies of smb for the nes are rare
nes hurried smb into production that featured a more natural smb mechanic and added a sort of modest exploration mechanic too and stuck in some ace puns like the flute from legend of zelda which has a very different effect in smb
smb faded into welldeserved obscurityit wasnt just that the game wasnt as much fun as smb and smb it fought you when it came to figuring out what you were supposed to do and that is just poor designyes i get that the game has its fans who think it is the best thing since sliced bread
good for them
i wouldnt have it any other way
there was a shortlived buzz of interest in the early nintendo fun club magazine which became nintendo power later in life to prove they are not alone
but to claim this game has all the appeal of its predecessor or successor is stretching the point as far as the buying majority is concerned
even spy hunter is more fun than this game in my opinioni also know the eventually unveiled real history of this game which was irrelevant to me by the time it was made public
i always knew it as smb
excuses about it not being a real smb game are lame and beside the pointthis is the only smb game i am never tempted to revisiteven when i was awesome at video games this one made me mad
whoever designed this game must seriously hate kids
sure its neat to play as the turtles and beat things up
but it gets so hard that you want to break it in half and throw it out the window
seriously whats wrong with peopleit is a side scrolling game where you play as all  teenage mutant ninja turtles and pause the game to select a different turtle
donatello has the longest ranged slowest and most powerful
rapheal has the quickest shortest and least damaging
michaelangelo and leonardo are somewhere in between
this game is more difficult than fun
difficult as opposed to challenging
most everything can kill you quickly
there are top down areas which seem almost pointless where you wander from sewer to sewer where the real side scrolling action is
foot soldiers and various other enemies that dont quite make sense for a turtles gamethis is a game that requires some prescision and the turtles control pretty poorly
there is quite a bounce back when you get hit
jumps are tough to control
not a good game at all
it is just a missed oppertunity for what could have been a great debut for the turtles on the nesthe next two turtle games for the nes were much betterthis is a dull near impossible flight simulating game
its not all that based on the movie there is no real story you are just a f fighter in hostile territory
you have guns and select the rockets and missiles to use before each mission levelit is a nice flight simulator but its just dull with long periods of sky no clouds no sea no land no obsticles
then there is the challenge
enemies firing rockets at you from sea and air
one rocket and youre dead i suppose its like that in real life
enemy jets get behind you and you need to shake them before they destroy you with their rockets or missilesthen halfway through a mission you will need more jet fuel so the flying fuel tanker flies in and you need to get the fuel just right or die trying
at the end of each mission you need to land on an aircraft carrier with perfection
too fast you crash too slow you crash too high you crash too low you crashits a prescise game so if you love prescision this is your game
however for casual gamers this is a frustratingly difficult and unfun gamewell it looks like acclaim was trying to get their feet wet with the first licensed wwf video game
i picked this up at a flea market a couple of years ago but really i had no memory of this game as a kid
maybe because it was the first one they made or maybe beacause it really isnt that good
i played a lot of the other wrestling games as a kid mostly for snes and was hoping it would be like an earlier version of those games with the old school wwf characters that we usually dont get to wrestle with
seeing hogan on the cover just reminded me of when i was a kid so i bought itfrom the start it looks good
theres only  wrestlers to choose from but there all classics with there own invidual moves
the characters in the game for the most part look like the wrestlers except million dollar manlooks like a fat cowboy
when you start the match youll notice no crowd is present the ring is surrounded by nothing but black space
the actual gameplay is pretty basic
kick and punch hold down both buttons and do a body slameach guy has a custom move like bam bam bigelow doing his cartwheel
you can climb the bottom turnbuckles and jump off them
thats about it
unfortunately body slams dont play too much into this game
get down the moves and see if you can beat the tournament
if you do beat this game chances are your going to do it on kicks  punchesi would basically skip this game all together if i could have
go with any of the other titles that came out after thisno energy tanks fancy gadgets spike invulnerability when hit and two less robot masters than most games in the series make this debut the bad kind of hard
the stages and bosses are extremely hard without the right equipment
the next one mega man  is where greatness would first be reachedthe game is good but apparently the seller i bought this from is not
it took  times for the game to even come up and it randomly crashes
the seller said it was in good condition and it was not
it was rattling and the outside of it was a bit rough looking
be careful who you buy this fromahh zelda arguably the greatest video game franchise ever made
i owned and still own the very first zelda video game and i must say it is to this day the greatest  bit game ever designed
i had never played the zelda  for the nes before
i had heard a lot of negative things about this game for being a rather weak installment in the zelda series
not listening i decided to purchase this game for the wii virtual console
guess what
they were right
this game is bad
i kept saying to myself there are no bad zelda games
there are no bad zelda games
as you can probably see i ripped that quote off from the wizard of oz theres no place like home
quite fitting if you ask meadventure link is quite the sloppy one
you go from one perspective to another
quite irritatting if you ask me
its a shame how good the graphics are and how unfitting the gameplay is
the gameplay is not stiff but slippery
it feels like you are in an ice level throughout the entire game
no jokethe change in graphics are very good for the nes system
i find it quite detailed and a big push for the nes console
i also cannot take the fact that the music is absolutely beautiful and the only reson i play this crappy game
i mean just listen to this trackawesome rightthats about all you get out of this game
overall this game sucks
i can certainly see why fans didnt like it
a combination of hard platforming bad gameplay and poor writing makes the game unplayable
i know i am a huge zelda fan but i have yet to play a link to the past
i am planning on purchasing it on the wii virtual console in the next couple of weeks and once i do i will review it immediatelythanks for readingalthough the first in a popular series this isnt the best and is incomparable to super metroid
granted the game is big which means there is lots of exploring there is one set of closely related problems that make metroid less than steller all related to attacking samus curls or does nothing if you dont have the ball when you press down so she cannot duck and shoot disabling her from attacking small anemies on the ground until she has the ballbomb or wave beam much later in the game
additionally samus cannot shoot diagnally in any direction and she cannot shoot downwards
in my review of super mario  i said that one shouldnt only complain about what a game does not have however these features would be practically essential to the gamebuy only if you are a hardcore metroid fan or you really want to play the game that started it all
otherwise look somewhere elsethis game for me is a weak attempt to copy the game tetris
it just  isnt as fun or challenging as i had hoped
the only plus that i see with this game is that it would be preferred over tetris by children because of the colorful graphics and cartoon look
so if you have children and are looking for a good clean kid friendly game to keep them entertained and expand their handeye coordination then this game might be a good choicemickey mousecapadethree stars  somewhat playable by todays standards but theres better fare out theremickey mousecapade the first of a series of highly successful capcom games using disney trademarks was published by capcom in nintendo but actually developed hudson soft in japan
it the only capcom published disney game not actually developed by capcom
several sprites from the game are directly lifted from other hudson soft games
mickey mousecapade is certainly one of the more obscure titles in the capcom library
the game has some rather ugly graphics even for an nes title but the game certainly has its own style of charmthere are numerous regional differences between the japanese and north american versions
the stage bosses are all different between the two versions and so is much of the enemy roster
the japanese version is more heavily based on alice in wonderlandthe plot of the game is to rescue a friend of mickey and minni who turns out to be alice of alice in wonderland
the final boss is maleficent from sleeping beauty in the us versiona nd the queen of hears from alice in wonderland in the japanese version
pete who is often the final boss in disney games is the fourth boss in the american versionstrangely enough there is a hidden mickey embedded in the circuit board clearly visible when the game cartridge is disassembledlike the nes the adventures of tom sawyer the graphics are ugly and primitive
although published in japan in  mickey mousecapade was published in  in north america the same year ninja gaiden blaster master and the guardian legend were published
the grapchis are so bad the game looks like an nes launch title rather than one published laterultimately capcoms other disney games far outshine this title
unless you are nostalgic for this title the nes offers much better fare than this
although to be fair the nes also offers much worst fare than this game as wellwhile mickey mousecapade does offer some enjoyment i would recommend duck tales duck tales  chip and dale chip and dale  little mermaid aladdin or the jungle book over this travestythe video game website ign rated this title as the h greatest game on their top  nes games of all time
for those looking for great unknown nesfamicom games you simply must play moon crystal a criminally unknown famicom exclusive
the graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo ninja gaiden amazing music in depth gameplay and a fantastic storyline
absolutely amazing
had this been released in the us for the nes i feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the nes canonif you likes hooterstwo stars  barely playable by todays standardscapcom usually creates awesome games after disney titles but when they came out with this it was questioned whether or not capcom were capable of licensing disney titles since mickey mousecapade was its first
its a stty game
it starts off as a ok game you find magic stars in a fun house and shoot random animals and moving deadly furniture but the formula goes on and on and on  the levels do get harder too hard for a kids game but the repetitiveness and cheap deaths doesnt fair too well
the cheapest death is when minnie falls off the ledge your character mickey falls with her
she is a liability throughout the whole game so controlling her while playing as mickey can be a bh
the second cheapest death is getting hit and stopping in midair especially when youre over a cliff or water in midjump
this doesnt give you much time to steer your jumps but its better than the backwards hit bullst found in other games
the game frustrated me as a kid and i never got past the final level because the damn eagle is always kidnapping minnie and rescuing her is always a hassle
also on the pirate ship level level  you might as well turn the game off if you didnt happen to get the second magic stars for minnie in level   pegleg pete will throw a zillion of knives at your direction so it will be impossible to deck him without loosing a life
the only trick is making sure minnie has her stars because shell be immune to petes attacks making sure she jumps on the ledge of where pete is attacking is kind of a hassle
without a word of mouth from a friend who happened to make this trick work through trial and error or with a nintendo power magazine youre stuck
though the internet will may now give you a clear walkthrough on this frustrating abomination its not worth a dollar go buy a mcdouble cheese burger with it instead of this stty game
other disney titles that capcom will make in the future would be a huge improvement in gameplay and graphics such as duck tales rescue rangers and darkwing duck so try those out and stay away from mickey mousecrapade pleasei got this game hoping it would be just as good as any sonic game on the market maybe even better
this game is way to easy
dont get me wrong the graphics are incredibale
there is just no point to this game
my friend also has this or i should say had it
he smashed it and threw it in the trash he hated it so much
dont buy this
get sonic and knucles insteadim probably one of very very few people who liked carmageddon  better than the second one
the controls are poor
more often than not the enemies would fight me a bit then run away somewhere usually getting trapped in some tight corridor where i couldnt get enough speed to destroy them or the godawful water
i mustve spent a third of my time trying to work underwater
sure it gives you an underwater ability powerup but it doesnt help very muchi guess killing peds is fun but it gets old pretty fast
so does ramming your car into your oppenents over and over only to have nothing happen
no damage
no credits
no time bonus
nothing
even once i had built up a lot of armor power and offensive i still had a problem with ittheres a lot of flipping over in this game
a lot
way too much
i got stuck upside down or on my side even from just hitting a slight bump
the enemies got flipped over a lot too
not very funthe game was alright at first but it got old really fastthe first mana game final fantasy adventure was awesome
so was its remake called sword of mana
and secret of mana for the snes was an amazing classic beloved by many after all these years
so what happened with legend of manafirst off this game doesnt have the free flowing world and fighting of the previous games
there is no linking areas to travel between
each areadungeon has its own little space and must be found by doing quests
after you have obtained the new area you can place it anywhere on the world map for reasons not wholly known or cared for
its a very strange concept at bestand the battles
oh what a terrible systemwhen you enter a battle all of which are preset and cannot be avoided your character moves in stutter steps
heshe moves somewhat like a fencer a pace at a time
this makes for awkward movement
and if you want to dodge enemies you have to move up and down
want to attack
you can only attack the left and right
this twoway dodgeattack system was totally uneccessary compared to sword and secret of manas free moving combatand the difficulty of the game or lack there ofin battle you can hide in a corner and slowly replenish life
have a teamate
stand close to them and you will regain life about x faster then normal
and sometimes defeated enemies drop candy which replenish all or most of your life
oh and after every battle you regain all of your lifethere are more ways to heal your character in battle than to attackall in all this game is a garbled mess
its a failed attempt of square to make a unique mana game which strays from the original formula
i cannot believe this game came from the same company as secret of mana the chrono games and the final fantasy games
avoid at all costswhat a shock
thats all i can say
secret of mana som and its ilk that used the same game engine most notably secret of evermore defined in my  heart what a live action rpg should be
there where several key things  that defined the som gameone was the coop play with another player  up to three players total
this allowed the game to be put into the  quotplay at partiesquot pile
games are fun by yourself even more fun  when two skilled players are in on it
sadly this is poorly implemented in  legend of mana lom
its bad enough when the other player has a hard time  interacting with the game world
worse when you have to go to a  quotspecialquot place for that second person to join
even lower still  when the npcs are unstable
by that i mean in som the two npc characters  only left the main character alone for any great amount of time once after  joining the party
lom npcs dont stick around for very long
at least the  other player can quotimportquot their charactersthe other was  the incredible item wheel
this gaming innovation allowed the player to  quickly select any item or spell in the heat of battle
this wonderful  innovation in gaming is sadly missing and once again players are forced to  suffer through menusand finally the battles stink
som allowed  complete and total freedom when dealing with the baddies except for the  level bosses
you chose to stay and fight or you chose to run for cover
lom battles are loaded on an area by area basis and running is not an  option
this isnt a problem at first but your patience will wear out very  quickly after you fought the same dang monsters for the th timei  own the japanese sequel to som
suffice to say it is not fair to make this  kind of punishing leap to the american market when the american market  expects a sequel to som and not seiken densetsu  all of the key elements  that made som a sleeper hit in the us is missing in this one
lom is  nothing more than an empty collectors item
although this game does have a  few redeeming qualities
i gave one star to the eyepopping eyecandy  which make this a great game to watch
and the colorful world is a joy to  explore but strip it all away and what do you have
an empty game that is  trying to cash in on the underground success of somi give another  star to the insight of ingenious programmer who configured the controls for  onehanded use
youll need it when your brain reduces its operating level  to a minimum while playingthe sequel to th guest th hour turns what was sort of a fairy tale horror story like frankenstein into something much more gritty and adult
i was very dissapointed
issues such as rape mutilation and lots  of gore are brought up in this game and all of the psychological horror of  the previous game which is what made it such a ball for me to play has  been forgottenthe plot goes along and youre a reporter seeking his  friend who is trapped in the mansion of stauf
a lot of things from the  previous game were ignored in th guest the mansion ws up on a high  rocky hill and in th hour its now in a grassy lot with an iron fence  around iti didnt like the fact that they decided to make such a unique  concept into something more adult and gritty and as i progressed through  the storyline i began to pretty much hate everyone in the game character  wise
arent you supposed to want to save peopleon a technical aspect  the folks that have rereleased this game have done nothing to update the  software at all and there is a very high likleyhood that this wont run on  your machine
my copy decided to install a little shareware vga driver on  my computer without my permission and it was an annoyance to get rid  ofoverall the dissapointing story and software problems made this game  not worth the money even at the reasonable price being offered for itif youve played th guest youve played th hour
its the same house  the same puzzles  the same general story  and most of the same actors
did they think that adding more and better fmv cutscenes would disguise that
puhleasethe only really positive thing about the game is how much fun it is to wander through an abandoned house poking at things
the puzzles are all of the improbable chessproblem sort and several of them require you to play against the computer a situation that is not always winnable
quite frustrating
especially since every wrong move you make gets you an insulting remark by the overacting villain
add to it that the basic story is hopelessly contrived and silly the ending unrewarding and the neverending music boring and hokey and  well i wouldnt call it a winnerif youre intrigued by ghost stories go play th guest
its more fun and at least has the benefit of originalityi would have given it two and a half stars but ill have to give it two
there are some fun puzzles in this game but it lacks a lotone  some of the puzzles are badly unoriginal
the worst example of this is a player piano that imitates the game quotsimonquot where you have to remember the tune and play it back
other puzzles almost repeat themselvestwo  the puzzles do not interact with the game play at all
the game is basically just a walkthrough movie with puzzles here and there to solve so that you can make it to the next part of the movie
in this respect it is somewhat like the game quotfools errandquotthree  the animation moves too darn slow in the puzzles
when you click on a move the characters or icons on the screen move annoyingly slowoverall though if you buy it cheap off the rack it will be worth it for you
but it is still not a great game at allsim city k unlimited is definately a great game but it doesnt work correctly on many systems
this is the only pc game i have ever encountered that my cd drives scratch just by using it mind you i have no clue why
i excanged it twice already
it only works correctly running windows  or  none of the  editions me  xp
if you are a fan of the sim city franchise buy this game and make sure you have the reccommended requirements for best gameplay
otherwise i wouldnt reccommend itsimcity k has great graphics handsdown but if youve played oyther simcitys then youve played simcity k
the gameplay is identical with minor tweaks here and there but with most of the hype that went into this game left out
you cant tweak individual buildings or really get into the management of a city as you would like to
once again things like subways and buses operate without an revenue generation what country in the world gives away public transportation
 thus tying your economic fate to basically taxes which are a simple model as well and some policies
graphics are great but the gameplay is the same as beforei have liked every game dreamcatcher has ever released but this one was a little tough to swallow
in typical dreamcatcher fashion the graphics are wonderful and the music is very relaxing and laid back
i think the reason for the calming music was the fact that this game is very annoying
now
i consider myself to be pretty good at solving puzzle games and if i get stuck i call a couple of friends and we work these out together
but neither of us liked this game very well
the clues arent detailed enough and many of these puzzles are repititious
you dont know if you have done the puzzle right until the end of that sequence
very annoying
when they speak to you its like your speaking to confuscious
very hard to discern the clues they are giving
my suggestion is spend your money on another dreamcatcher game traitors gate
that is a game worthy of all point and click puzzle solving game playersthis game has very good graphics but the excitement is not so high
this game is very theoretic and leaves you thinking
personally i wouldnt recommend this game just because it wasnt as fun as i thought it would be
but hey thats just me
its a good game if youre in to serious philosphies and wonders about lifequake for dreamcast is a huge disappointment
the games has a useless irrelevant single player on par with outtrigger and since online in no longer available the game is all but virtually useless except if you have friends overthe game play is a little too fast and control on the controller although it can be customised is difficult
aiming and tracking enemies becomes unbearably difficult with the controller and brings the game down more than anything else
nothing is more frustrating than trying to dodge and return fire through strifing it is accomplished much easier in outtriggeroverall quake arena is a serious let down
i have quake  on my pc and enjoyed the single player missions which are in no way found in quake arena
i was really excited to get this game as i read all the overhyped reviews on this site and othersbut my heart was broken by frustrating and frantic speeds coupled with annoying aiming or lack of aiming mechanismi was first introduced to the genre through the multiplayer deathmatch of rainbow  rogue spear on the dc and that was a much better experience with my friends
the idea of stealth sniping throwing grenades around corners and planting c all made that title a much better investment
quake arena lacks all that and exchanges it with fast running shoot run out of ammo run run shoot with no strategy run etc
you get the point
the game simply has you running very fast and struggling to process all the actionon the plus side the game has good graphics sound and the ability to turn blood offthats it the positives end theremy final word is simply thisquotlook elsewhere for a good fpsquotdue to the hype of other dreamcast enthusiasts i decided to purchase this game around  years ago
unfortunately to this day i do not understand why so many claim this game as one of the systems shining titlessix years ago was about the time many online games on the dreamcast were being shut down for good
since as a whole i was new to the online gaming scene at the time i wanted to try all online dreamcast games before it was to late
this led to my discovery and experiences with games such as phantasy star online and unreal tournament
both were highly addictive in their own special way and they were also well developed for the dreamcast in terms of control and performance online and offon the other hand this game was most certainly not
from the first time i played this game and subsequent times after only pure misery has followedfirst theughh good partssince this game allows pc players to host games and dedicated servers it is still to this day one of a definite few titles that remains online on the dreamcast
as a result of the pc link there are also a couple mods that exist for the game when played online to
in addition i will admit that it is graphically superior to many of the systems other previously online fpss and while not by any means fun it does offer  player offline action
it also offers iffy as youll read later completely customizable controlssadly those are all the good parts i can think of and i tried hard
 so now onto the badyou have to get a keyboard and mouse to get any enjoyment out of it
for starters i dont like the statements people are making that interested parties need to invest in a keyboard and mouse to play this
though the keyboard is certainly good for communication purposes i have always felt the combination of it and a mouse do not belong on a game console
furthermore this statement is just giving an excuse to the developers of this game for poorly implemented controls and functionalityas i said previously the controls are basically impossible to work with
though i cant quite remember its layouts ut had very good control configurations
in addition there was a small hint of autoaiming that made the game fluid to control i will gladly admit the dreamcast controller was horribly suited to fpss
this game however gives you  or  preset controller combinations that all feel bad and overly loose
there is no slight autoaiming and you cant help but lose all control of your character when you become engaged in a firefightto add to the package of horrible controls the game also brings bad network functionality
quake  cant even hold up with  of unreals maximum player count even if its games are hosted on a powerful dedicated server
ill admit  on  games run decent but anything more is just a total lag fest which is totally unacceptable
ugh unreal tournament supported  players over dialup and it ran buttersmooth to boot
to this day i cant imagine any gamepc or console that was better performing over dialup and as horrible as it sounds i wish this game would have lost its online functionality forever instead of unrealthere are likely many other factors i may have missed going over in this review
suffice to say the subjects of control and network functionality are  things that count above all in an online fps to me and this game completely missed the mark in those areasi still own this title since i have a hard time letting go of even my least prized games but hear this now it will never hold a place in my heart as one of the best dreamcast games everthese sega sports games all suffer from the same problem they rely on looks and not on gameplay
this game is repetitive drivel and i cant find a reason for recommending it
so i wontbefore i wanted this i expected this to be a fun entertaining experience
instead i got this bad ai boring gameplay and only  playable characters
i expected more out of sonic shuffleon paper sonic shuffle is great  picking out cards moving to spaces and getting the most precious stones
in practice it is the opposite
this is a very boring game and with the ai they can be very hard to beat even on the easy difficulty setting
the games story is horrible  a fairy named lumina asks the sonic team to help her get precious stones and save everyones dreams from void
yeah its a baby storythe graphics are suprisingly goodthe sound is so badthis game doesnt live up to its full potential
add minigames that are either frustrating or confusing and youve got one of the worst games ever madei rented this game with some of my friends mostly because i think sonic is really cool and i thought this game would also be
i couldnt believe it
besides this game being mario party with different characters it has a huge learning curve
i will explainsonic shuffle is basically a board game in which you get cards that have numbers from  amp s s is a random number from  in which you use to defeat enemies and screw up your oponents
a gem is placed somewhere on the board and it is a race to the jewelas soon as you reach the jewel you have to face an enemie that defends the gem and if defeated you win the gem
the learning curve is not knowing where to go
the computer knows exactly which way to go and even shortcuts to the gem
im not saying i am a sore loser but they could atleast make it an easier learning curve and not have putten a n game onto a bit system mario party
if you are looking for a fun party game look else where and see what other player games they have out for sega dreamcast
good luck shoppingbrowsingim gonna get this out of the way right now this game is aggravating
it starts off slow and does not pick up
i first got a taste of it at my friends party last weekend
we were both pumped to play it and couldnt wait for other guests to arrive so we could have four people playing at once
well the excitement wore off as soon as we started playing
the game board was right out of mario party and didnt look too exciting
the minigames were dull and too shortbefore too long the other guests watching were getting bored out of their minds
and so were the people playing
but its not like we didnt give it a chance
we persisted
we wanted to like it
then my friend did us all a favor he turned off
sadly the rest of the guests cheered
not the sign of a good game
im sticking with board gamesthis is by far one of the most boring rts games i have ever played and i have played alot of themjust like in most rts games you have to collect resources
i spent most of my time waiting for the resource collectors to bring the resource
it was so boring
the single player mission was spent over half the time waiting
waiting for resources
waiting for your ships to build
waiting for researches to finishthe graphics were ok but given the fact this was a  game i can see where the graphics would have been pretty good though i believe total annihilation starcraft and especially age of empires which all  came out before homeworld looked better
the ships looked cool but if you zoomed in on them they looked pixally
and the cutscenes were just ok it was cool to be able to see a  view of every ship thoughthe battles werent anything spectacular
you couldnt really see of hear any of the fighting going on
just the same droning music over and over the music was cool the first few missions but gets rather boring later
it was also impossible to follow the battles as your camera follows one of units or the otherthe best thing about this game was the story
the story goes like this a spaceship was found buried in sand here on earth
using that technology and the history found on the ship they built their own ships so that they could head to their real homeworld
as the story unfolds and new enemies and friends are made the story keeps this game going
at least for me that is the only reason i continued to play this gamei read all of the reviews on many gamesites including gamespot and gamespy and many of the reviews here and maybe my expectations were high but one review said that no has since done what homeworld has done
and i believe the reason is who would want to
the idea about completely d space game is good in concept but it takes away from the gameplay too much
this is definitely nothing like the games i mentioned before but having played over  rts games this one didnt do it for menext up is homeworld cataclysm
i bought all  homeworld games at the same time because the price was cheap
so i dont feel like i was cheated too much
game wasnt for me but maybe it is for youwell somehow they managed to make a followup that is not as good as the firstplease note that the people who made this sequal are not the people who made the original even though sierra handles the productionpay attention to the negative reviews this game has received many fans of the original feel a bit betrayed by this oneyes there are some tweaks that are good waypoints for movement you can make vessels fly around in circles some different shipshowever this game does not have the magnificent ambience of the original the voice overs are sickeningly americanaccented it simply does not have anywhere near the class and atmosphere of the firstdont get me wrong it is a good game and if you are starving for more homeworld then go for it but dont expect the beauty of the originalif you do not have homeworld get homeworld
its better to enjoy the original first
you wont lose anything by playing that one first
then play a demo of this one and if you can stomach it go for itsierra get your act together and make some cheap original homeworld mission packs thanks that would be well appreciatedthis game gets boring after an hour or two
the interface is a bit confusing at the beginningstep into the real world with a new and highly competitive version of monopoly
this is not competitive like you roll the dice see where you land buy the property then build houses once you get a monopoly
this is a game where at any given second you can lease a property from the city where then it goes to auction instead of you just buying it or you can build a residential or retail area without owning the land you just rent it
it makes for some interesting things such as someone will build lots of buildings on rented land then another player will buy the land out from under them
once you start enjoying the game then it unfortunately ends because this game goes in scenarios not fulllength games like playing a demo that cuts off after  minutes
its also very tedious because its the same city over and over so you basically go build the same stuff over and over
the scenarios sound basic make  sales earn  profit in one day reach an empire of  have the most money by  but they are difficult at times because the game does not offer insights as to how to complete the scenarios
there are nice smooth d graphics to the game but the tools to create buildings are troublesomelet me explain this game  however bizzare it may bebasicly you are some business tycoon building shops renting different businesses and getting rich
perhaps some  yr old retired business man may enjoy this but definately not the general publichowever it still has a good side starting shops apartments ect but that becomes boring and repetitive after about  hours
definately not worth more than grandprix  is simply one of the worst racing sim i have ever played
one of the most important points in setting up a formula one car is the camber ajustment which is missing in this game
mr geoff crammond what on earth were you thinking about
the only level i can beat these racers is the rookie level you see i drag race for about  years and i know how a car is suppose to handlei use all kinds of input devices and the steering from the center position is way off
i had to add the  patch in order to get the main buttons on my input device to work
the  of damage done to vehicles is ridiculous
all of the gamers that think this is real formula one racing is either stupid  or unaware of how formula one racing is done
i will suggest to the gamers that think this is a great game is simple the next time formula one racing appears on tv
 look at it please
to all formula one racing gamers let me give you the names of three fantastic f games official formula one racing  by eidos interactive  f  by electronic arts  f  by electronic arts
now not one of these f sims are as realas the real thing because thats impossible but the three games i refer to are the most realistic trust me peace i dont believe in stepping on any body toes but i believe in telling the truth thank youthis game is very difficult for beginners to pickup
after playing the home version with the dc controler i realized how much i miss those twin sticks
trying to get use to the controls takes a very long time and the pay off isnt worth itgraphics are only as good as the arcade version perfect port of the arcade visually which is now datedhardcore virtual on fans seem to like it a lot everyone else should pass
there are better rewarding games that take less time to figure out
oh yeah where is the internet play activisionbeing a fan of the legendary chrono trigger i was enthralled by the coming of this game
chrono cross is actually not a true sequel as said by the creators but originally a game called radical dreamers
anywho this game did not live up to my expectations at all
read on to see whythe goodfirst of all the graphics are actually quite colorful
the backgrounds are well colored and animated
the battle graphics also flow quite well
even if some of the characters are not all that great they are nicely created
however these are the only good points i can say about the gamethe badabout the characters there are about  characters jammed into this game and they virtually have no personality
its like the creators wanted to boast about the character quantity as opposed to memorable awesome characters that we play the game for
who cares about  characters
the music the remixes of yasnuori mitsudas themes from ct are actually excellent but the rest of the games music is strictly mediocre
quite a shame considering the same musical composers from ct are here
the battle system many have boasted about is not that great at all you virtually dont even level up
its pretty much a final fantasy materiaxenogears combination of a battle system but it comes off very heavyhanded not to mention the colors are annoyingthe uglythe critical point about this game is the fact that it doesnt really transcend well into ct  the glenn here is not frog as many have said and is a very vindictive character that we quickly dismiss
schala was very messed up at the end of the game being blonde and in different physical shape
lavos was supposedly killed in ct and yet he somehow survives something which the game doesnt even explain it well at all
which leads to the worst part about the game the storyline
what couldve been a unique storyline is muddled by inconsistencies and loopholes examples humans evolved after apes but in ct the people were human long before lavos entered earth lucca supposedly gave up her purpose in life that is creating machines to be the head of an orphanage which goes against luccas character
she also talks about regrets which contrasts the more confident lucca from ct the game states that guardia was destroyed and the masamune was stolen but why even bother when it doesnt even appear as ruins in the game
and the ultimate sinrobo appears in the game very briefly and once you find him he dies
he was my favorite character in ct in a close race with frog and killing him off like a worthless character was the ultimate sin
speaking of frog the game assumes that he died and the masamune was stolen from himoverallif you take away the references to ct it doesnt hurt nearly as much but its still a rather generic rpg
rpg fanatics no doubt love this game which is why this game is very overrated and i wouldve given it three stars
however since it blatantly defies the ct legend with a muddled storyline unappealing characters merely average music and just for being vastly overrated this game doesnt deserve anything above  stars
youll hate me for this but i demand that an rpg has a decent storyline a decent battle system and appealing characters
this game fails in all three departments
only get this game if youre an rpg fanatic
otherwise pass it on especially if you are a fan of the classic chrono triggeron a closing note dont get me wrong people the majority of squaresofts games are excellent
the point i am trying to make by the statement at the very beginning is that there are too many fans out there that are blindly devoted to the company they make hits and misses like everyone else
fortunately this is one of their few missesthis game falls short when it comes as a sequel to the illustrious chrono trigger
the weaknessesstrengths with this sequel are as followsstory amp characters no connection is made to chrono trigger until well into the game also very few characters from the original ct are mentioned or shown
espeically the sorceror magus you do see a passing mention to his real name in a letter to kid thats it o and he may be one of two guys in the game not too mention they got his sister schalas face structure and skin color all wrong at the end
also the first ending is quite weak and dumbthe  character roster is ridiculous having this many characters stresses quantity rather than quality
many of the  characters have no personality besides an accent or odd way of speaking or story or plot threads behind them
most of the characters in this game have no individualitythe sory is somewhat confusing as well as the two dimensions see below as its hard to keep straight what happens between the two nearlyidentical worldson dimensional travel the dimensional travel back and forth between worlds would of been great that is if square would of put at least a little bit of distinction between the two worlds so they do not look nearly identical perhaps give different continental shapes as in the first ct
this adds for a lot of confusion when you are completing tasks when going back and forth between worldslevels amp magic instead of leveling up like in normal rpgs you gain stars for defeating bosses
so the game leaves you wondering if you ever got stronger at all or if you ever will
also magic is not learned it is assigned by quotcolorquot
and this gives the game even more of a completist quotpokemonquot feel not too mention the  characters by classifying the characters all by color again ruining any chance of individuality between characters
about the only individuality characters have are different tech skillssound amp music the opening wellorchestrated theme quotscar of timequot will blow you away
the other music in this game is very well done some of it being slight remixes or remade versions of music in the original ct except this time its played with real instruments and not synthesized
there is one point in the game however where you will want to turn down the volume
although accompanient lacks in some areas like the acoustic guitar themes the sound overall is greatgraphics amp animation absolutely breathtaking
the animation for the spells during battle are well detailed and flow very smoothly this section along with the sound are the games strong pointsthe game for a hardcore ct player i swear i played chrono trigger so much i had every detail memorized is somewhat below average
for one thing there are too many characters keeping it at  max would of been fine secondly this game was developed to begin with not as a sequel to ct but rather for a japanese satellite system called bs where players in japan can play together it was called radical dreamers back then and many of the developers and designers said in interviews it is not a true ct sequel if we are lucky the loyal ct fans might see a real sequel we can dream cant we
the bottom line is if you never played ct youll enjoy this game
but if you are like me and were expecting a good sequel to a great game youll be disappointed like me for some of the many reasons ive stated abovei have played almost every rpg ever made for almost all systems thats how long ive been a gamer and chrono trigger will always be in my top five not for the story but just for sure funfactor and inventiveness
in hindsight i dont actually believe chrono trigger is nearly good as i once did when i was a kid but it still blows this game out of the wateri didnt hate this game either dont get me wrong but its just not there
the graphics for the time were amazing i suppose and the battle system is differentoften to the point of annoyance but different isnt always good
they tried to create a plotline as lofty and intricate as something like xenogears
you go to so many places and meet waaaaaay too many party members to the point where they all seem to lose their respective face
you only really need the first two main party members and then pick one more from the other gazillion to form your party
honestly i thought the choice to add so many potential members was quite stupid
also i feel the storyline is too confusing
havign beat this game a few years ago i remember almost nothing of what actually happened except for the fact i had already forgotten about most of it before i was even doen with the game which usually doesnt mark a very enthralling affair in my eyesmany people love this game and i suppose if you try to play it as a game set apart from the chrono franchise as it were it is a fair standalone outing
the chrono tag is merely a means to an end however it is there to sell the game
this game has nothing to do with the original except in name and the use of timetravel
i would not recommend this game as a good rpg to start off on if youve never played one before
if you want the best of the best rpgs then go pick up persona  ffffxffxii xenogears star ocean or suikoden  to name a few
this one can easily be bypassedbattery screw up made me sad i forgot to read that game plays like it should
brings back the olden days they need to do remakes for the new consols but as long as we can fix it at home with a new battery we will keep playing themthis game has an extensive bunch of moves maneuvers special items secrets and it has a huge amount of spiderman memorabilia in it
this is a very detailed spiderman game because it is a whole d world you as spiderman or one of his six playable alter egos can swing from building to building hang upsidedown create a web shield web the band guys or create web boxing gloves
everyone is included like venom carnage the scorpion rhino and a  ft mysterio
you must beat them each in a unique way rather than just beating them up
there are twentyfive levels however the big downfall is that you can beat the game from beginning to end in only two or three hours which makes it like a movie
to add playability to the game you can pick up secret outfits characters d profiles on bad guys and even comicbook covers documenting the history of the comicgraphics look ok sounds ok but i for one do not wish to spend a few hours studying the manual before being able to play a game
and even then its a drag to input all your commands and having to return all your troops and credits to the staging area at the end of each missioni bought this game after trying the demo which seemed pretty neat
however after playing ground control this game seems constricting boring andforgive medepressing
allow me to explainfirst the graphics engine although good looking does not allow for full camera freedom
this means that you are limited to a top down view of the battle unlike the far superior ground control where you can look wherever you want to
i personally find this quite limiting especially considering you cant zoom out far enough to make any sort of real strategy or troop movements easilyalso the whole environment of the game from the music to the seemingly omnipresent fog to the rain to the plot to the night is just depressing
it doesnt make you want to play
i found myself slaving through another boring and overly long mission just to see some new technology one of the cool parts of the game and eventually i just gave up and moved on
there are some great lighting and weather effects but i really dont think the atmosphere is condusive to fun gameplayin short  if youre looking for a great fun beautiful d rts buy ground control
this game just isnt worth the effortim an avid fps first person shooter fan and i was very much looking forward to playing tribes   id read many glowing reviews and heard lots of buzz about the game
unfortunately after three separate attempts to get through the tutorial i was hopelessly bored with the game and annoyed with the physics enginebottom line is that this is a complex game that is probably a lot of fun for people who are big into teamplay and resource management but if youre a diehard shooter fan like me i think youll find that this games lack of polish and emphasis on complexity is not your cup of teaif you have a voodoo card dont believe the box which says it is dfx compatable dont buy this game regardless of your machine specs
i am using a voodoo  and i am lucky if i get fps out of itnot unplayablebut not worth it either
the game is so fogged in that you might as well be playing indoors
it does play ok over the internet though
if you have an nvidia cardgeforcegeforcetnt you will probably have better luck
i really liked the first tribes and thought this one would follow in its footstepsi will give an honest review and personal opinion that makes sense
i love playing these first person shooter games and i play things like unreal tournament and counterstrike and rogue spear most frequently
i was expecting a great game from what i read on reviews and from word of mouth on the internet can you really trust it
i have a p mhz with  mb of ram using a voodoo agp card
the game runs pretty decent going on x bit on directd mode
however opengl is a different story
even on x it was really choppy and unplayable
although the graphics looked superb in opengl  this game is a machine hog as everyone has stated earlier
this game sort of reminds me of team fortress classic and how everyone needs to work together
problem is nobody does
everyone just runs around shooting and killing anything
i played on several servers and there is no team work as people mention about
even though its a team based game team work is not there because everyone wants a piece of there own action
so it was not fun in that sense
the weapons to me personally are like whatever
they just shoot plasma lasers rocket etc and you just hit people
people are just flying and driving vehicles everywhere and turrets are firing everywhere
for some reason this game just wasnt fun
sure i got the hang of the game farely quick but i found myself wanting to play counterstrike instead
the thrill is just not there as in counterstrike
as for technical problems  none for me
everyone else on  on the forum have so many problems
but i have not seen any serious problems on my computer
my personal recommendation is to wait for this game to drop in price and get counterstrike if you havent done so all readyi give credit to the graphics but this game is no different then most multiplayersi played this at a computerarcade place er what ever there called nd i didnt like the game that muchthe gameplay is alright but nothing specialbut it is fun when youre playing with friends i can tellyou that but over all its very overratedill make this short and sweet for you
i went to a cyber cafe so i can play this gem and see what all the fuss is about on this game
overrated
i have no idea how people prais this as the best game in the world
how silly this game is just plain average  if you wanna play a nice game from valvei dont need to tell you but ill give you a hinthf lfethis game is just pure garbage and the online is boringand i dont need your flaming or bashing just cause one mans opinion differs from yoursthe goodvisuals are good i guessbadvery mediocerplain boring combatnothing newonline isnt that greatextreamly overratedtrust megets boring after awhileand yes i played this out for more then an hour bucks ill never get back out of  stars  extreamly overrated not worth my  bucks and thats all i got to saypeacefirst let me say that i wholehearedly agree with the review by tiberius
back in the glory days of counterstrike  this game was the beall endall for  online video games  firstperson shooters  pc games and  any video game basically
it had reallife weapons the graphics were superb at the time the maps were extremely wellmade the system requirements are still obscenely low and damnit it was fun
then inevitabely the hands of time began to take their ruthless indiscriminate toll
video cards supported better graphics new and yes better
games came out battlefield  unreal tournament  hacking became the unmistakable poison of counterstrike and a lot of the cool casual gamers grew up or moved on
from  to  counterstrike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance
by  to present day it has become a problem
great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their moms wornout  megahertz pentium iii pcs running windows  counterstrike is still one of the most popular games of alltime with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day because people just dont seem to have enough selfcontrol to give up their hopeless addictiontoday server admins are for the most part humorless dictators and will not stand for anything that deviates from this games undeniable monotonous drone
people are still playing the same maps from the  release that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential
it always feels as if ive played the same round a thousand times before and i probably have
even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony
fyiceworld is fun for  consecutive seconds
many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way and all look disguisting
ive played on probably over  servers and downloaded probably over the same amount of quality custom maps and not more than  have i ever seen a server run in its rotation or voted on by the players
furthermore people are still playing the game using dialup and cs veterans are always complaining about camping even if its a tactic used to complete the objective
as far as the objectives are concerned counterstrike has basically become a deathmatch game
no one will listen to anyones plan on the rare occasion there is one no one tries to rescue the hostages and everyone always calls someone a py or nub if you use the auto shotgun or awp
and to top it all off valve cancelled the outstanding wonnet and replaced it with this steam garbage a utility soaking wet with incompetencel speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded counterstrike culture and has become its own incessant frustration
but i wont even get into that
if youre new to cs dont bother veterans of this game are far from friendly and youll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if youre a beginner
for now if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game check out world of warcraft battlefield  sven coop or even team fortress classic a dated game with an awesome community that has yet to lose its initial charmrr v came with my ps bundle so i cant say i wasted money on it
i was just happy to finally get a ps
anyway the graphics are amazing as you would come to expect on the ps platform
the music is fantastic
there are some awesome techno tracks
the car selection is cool
you can even choose a little modified honda civic hatchback
i have played this game for about two months off and on as i get bored with my sports games madden fifa etc and it is decent
i am not a big car racing person so i guess my review is a little more negative than most but this one just has more negatives than positives
i hate the following  the announcer is lame
the whole deal is some radio dj announcing the race coverage in a quotso calquot voice
i thought i had one of the members of blink  in my tvdude
 the steering sucks
i like to have a car that hugs the curves not one that slides around like a pig in mud on a rainy day in july
 the car never gets damaged
i hit a wall going  and the car just slides offwish my real car did that
 the game is hard but hey i already told you i am not into car games
i will take you on in madden any day of the week
my advise rent before you buythis game was just a reminder to me why i switched from ridge racer to gran turismo
the graphics are decent especially in the replay but thats it
the controls are horrible and if the announcer would show himself on the track i would gladly run over him
the game itself has  courses that includes the reverseand  different cars
but there are only  different views to choose from
when i bought this i was excited and thought it was the racing game that was going to hold me over till gran turismo  comes out but i was wrongthe rr series has always been sort of selfexplanatory
realistic looking cars in a realistic environment but playing like an arcade racer
no great amount of depth like the gran turismo series but not quite as cartoony as beetle adventure racing or top gear overdrivethis is just more of the same
is it the best looking rr ever
yeah and it should be given that its the only ps version of the bunch
and truth be told it should look better
it does score aboveaverage marks in the style department but the highly japanese flavor to it might turn off some gamers
basically it is what it is another ridge racer game
type  was good for psx and a lot of people expected more from this one but didnt get quotthe next levelquot of rr games just another in a seriesif you want a decent racing game wait for gran turismo  or if youve been a rr devotee then by all means go for this one
for most gamers its a quotbeen there done thatquot kinda thingwhen i first got this it was hard
then i played it more and more i used the slowest car and i beet the game in about  hours
the game is to short when you beet it all you have are the time attacks and the races were you try to beet a fake computer guystime attackand how the hell do you get medlsafter the very classic super nes title quotsuper castlevania ivquot konami released another super nes game in the form of quotdracula xquot  im not sure whether the genesis game quotbloodlinesquot preceded it or not so im not going to make any judgments in terms of which came first
i will however state that bloodlines is a far better game than this thing
its extremely rare nowadays and for good reason
heres the lowdownthe goodthe graphics are very good for the system
they are almost oh so close to the graphics represented in playstations quotsymphony of the nightquot  im not kidding
unlike some other reviewers i liked the level designs they werent perfect but they certainly werent terrible
unfortunately these are practically the only two things i can say positive about the game
wait three things its rare so many people didnt waste their money with this
ha
didnt think id find another one did youthe badoh man with so much potential youd think this would be a classic with its storyline that links to symphony and its highquality graphics and level design
the bad comes crashing down on this one you play as richter belmont like in symphony but the whip doesnt twirl around it only stays straight and it never upgrades or changes when you die
i couldve spared this game some dignity with the lack of movement for the whip but why did they make it to where its always the same
thats going against castlevania tradition
youve always been able to change your whip and why this game doesnt is beyond me
also the music is very subpar mostly consisting of rambling techno noise and heavy metalish music which normally wouldve pleased me that doesnt really go anywhere
richter also walks very slowly almost like the game boy titles and the jumping is horrid here
its almost as bad as controlling your character in the n castlevanias
i cant emphasize how bad this is
bad bad badoveralli highly do not recommend this
im a huge castlevania fan and i even know not to buy this game
if you do buy it get it for a decent price
i saw this store have it for  bucks with a torn label and cartridge only
my friends super castlevania iv was far better than this piece of plastic
ultimately this game had great potential but it comes off as rushed and uninspired
i hate to bash on a castlevania game but i had toi also noticed and apparently reviewer ted did as well that many castlevania fans seemed to like this over bloodlines
i cant fathom a reason why since bloodlines is a better game
sometimes you people make me sickin  on the turbo grafx in japan they released a castlevania game called akumaj dracula x chi no rondo
translated thats demon castle dracula x rondo of blood
the game is a direct prequel to the  all time best symphony of the night
unfortunately in  when dracula x came out to the super nintendo entertainment system the game was greatly altered from the original japanese version
in other words this isnt the original dracula x but a different version and one thats far inferior to the originalyou play as richter belmont who is out to battle with dracula
it is up to the belmont clan to keep ridding the world of dracula and now its richters time to shine
the game opens up in transylvania the very first stage of the game
all the classic castlevania things are here
you wield a whipthe vampire killeras well as having a set of subweapons
a knife axe holy cross and holy water just to name a few
you can use these subweapons by collecting hearts
anyone who has played a castlevania game probably knows all this stuffdracula x is one of the games thats fairly simple to pick up and play
the controls are by no means hard to learn and the mechanics are also by no means hard to learn
it all comes to you pretty easily
there are some parts of the gameplay that were used in castlevania iv however that just didnt get into dracula x though
for example your control over the whip is limited
in many installments of the series you can usually let the whip dangle and you can manipulate it the way you want
thats gone in dracula x  the only thing you can do with the whip is swing it
you cant let it dangle and control itwhere the game really hits a low point though is the flow of the gameplay
this game is unreasonably challenging
and it isnt due to your enemies being tough its done by some unfair game physics and level designs
lets get it out of the way most level designs are horrendous
partly due to the jumping physics of the game
when you jump you dont really have a whole lot of control and richter always jumps at an angle
there are some platforms where you have to be literally one step from falling off before you can jump to actually make some
likewise each time you sustain damage from certain enemies youre knocked back
most of your deaths will not come from simply losing all of the health in your health gauge
theyll come because you just landed from a jump only to have a enemy pop up from no where and knock you back into a pit
this wouldnt be so bad if it werent such a frequent occurrence
the frustration from this is enough to deduce the fun factor by large marginsand some enemies really are tough particularly some of the games bosses that do an insane amount of damage
overall though most levels are designed for enemies to take advantage of knocking you in a pit
other levels are designed to frustrate you to get to the end
there are some levels where youll spend so much time redoing jumping exercises or falling back into areas youve already visited simply because the levels are terribly designed
its annoying and lets not even go into the frustration shared in the final battle with draculato the games credit though the music and graphics are top notch
the music is among some of the best on the super nintendo but thats certainly not enough to warrant the game a buy
the graphics are also really good looking
almost as good as s symphony of the night and for a d sidescroller made in  thats not bad at all
the look of the levels is grand as are the enemies and backgrounds
still the fact that the game is shiny just cant warrant it a buy
its by far one of the weakest castlevania games in the series and its due in large part to physics and level designs that will frustrate the gamer to no end
a huge disappointment for any castlevania fanbefore playing this game you should play the preceding title of the series the mark of kri which is a truly fantastic game
it introduces a beautiful atmospheric world unique controls great action and an interesting story
one of the best titles ive played for the psthat said i have a bone or two to pick with the sequel here
i really wanted to give this game a shining review but i have to be honest with you
for the record i found this game to be quite beautiful like mok and the controls were very much alike
i became accustomed to fighting alongside a computer controlled ally and learned to like it
i played as the new characters and came to like them toothe painful things about this game are the bugsglitches
ive played a lot of ps titles i can safely say that even among the worst titles ive played none of them had this many bugs
what happened sony
did you pull the plug on this one and rush it to store shelves
heres a list of bugs i have experienced commonly in this game in stealth mode half the time enemies somehow magically see you when youre completely concealed around a corner
floors disappear and stay gone during play and make you appear as if you are walking on air
sounds cool but it isnt
its sloppy
sometimes when you flip a switch and you computer ally attempts to flip it too door jam closed instead of opening for you
your character gets stuck in a wall sometimes permanently
when attempting to complete level challenges such as completing certain combos on enemies the correctly and successfully performed combos will go undetected after dozens of attempts
this one really irks me you computer controlled partner freezes in place
the entire game freezesits heartbreaking really
i love the series and the story but i cant help but get really frustrated at the sloppy programming behind this game
i expect more from sony especially since mok was such a wonderful game
try it at the very leasti used to like syphon filter so i got this game jus to trythe newerversion of it aand itwasnt myfeel anymore
a good game for syphon fans ifya still like it but not for methis would be a great game had konami already not released five six when the american idol one comes out better karaoke games for the ps
you would think that when releasing this game in  sony would look at its competition and make it equal or better
they did not
i apologize that so much of the review is comparing it to the karaoke revolution series but its a natural comparison and unfortunate for singstar rocks as sr is by far an inferior producti have a lot of the same complaints as others
there are no unlockables
even though krs strange costumes are seldom used in our household its nice to see things being unlocked as you sing more and better
singstar rocks does not do thisthe big thing is with the ps having two standard usb ports why they would utilize the mini to usb adapter
this renders the mics useless to the kr games
if theyre worried about being able to use an eyetoy simultaneously to two mics maybe they should have included a usb mini hub instead
it infuriates me that with all the decent usb mics on the market that sony again would go proprietary of sortsanother complaint is the lack of adjustments
in song kr dating back to the original allows you to adjust the vocals mic and music
singstar rocks has only a master volume that doesnt see to do muchits also unfortunate that sony stuck with only sony artists as they are missing out on a ton of others
the song selection is very random due to this and a couple are very strange selections to have on a sing along disc
there are multiple songs on here that do not make a lot of sense
of all the rolling stones catalog why would forty licks paint it black be the one to appear
lamein a vacuum the game is fun but its song selection lack of options and its proprietary options all make it fall extremely short to any of the other karaoke revolution
dont waste your time with this one
get any of the kr series over this oneat first this game is jawdropping
beautiful graphics a fast engine original ideas and a unique premise
after playing through a few games however one quickly comes to realize that every session is essentially the same
there is little variation from mission to mission in the actual gameplay and it rapidly becomes a very repetitive experiencethis game is an insult to the world of dungeon and dragonscome on even pool of radiance is better than thiswhat the heck is this going back to the old format of dnd games hello there gamer want perspective like diablo baldurs gatewhere you can see your charcter see in slash cast a spell not a permenant camera following you has if you were in a mazeextremely complicated for nothing thank good i have a geoforce asus  powered by nvidia or else is it back to store for a refund or an exchangei got nothing else to say that wasnt said from the other reviewers get warcraft and diablo or even pool of radiance icewindaleghostrider the spirit of vengeancethis game was not as good as everyone made it out to be
after playing this one i did not get any others of the seriesi hate writing negative reviews
i like writing positive reviews about things that have entertained or educated me but sometimes something gets me frustrated enough that i feel obligated to inform otherswhile i normally start with complaints i feel it necessary to start with the good things about arcanum
arcanum has the potential to be one of the coolest games ever made
it has an original story an immersive world with colorful characters and a variety of playing styles to suit anyones preferncesunfortunately all of these positive things are shrouded in one of the buggiest pieces of code that has ever come across my pc
characters and items either fail to appear or disapppear for no apparent reason making the main plot impossible to further
its one thing to get stuck in a little subplot but its another thing to get stuck in the middle of the story simply because of technical errorsi spent hours trying to figure out what i was doing wrong at times only to visit the game forum at the official site and find message after message complaining about quotbug thisquot and quotfix thatquot
the current patch has done nothing to help me
i think my bugs maybe a little worse than others but almost everyone has experienced at least minor bugs and glitchesif this were some impulse buy i would have just given up and moved on to something else but arcanum when working properly is a really great game
thats what makes it so frustrating the fact that hidden under all that bad programming a great concept is dying to come out
i expect more from the guys that created the fallout series which are some of the most entertaining games ever made
the guys over at troika should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this game as a finished producthopefully you wont experience as many showstopping bugs as i did but be warned they are out there
if you dont believe me just visit the official site boards and look for yourself
hopefully troika will make this game playable and if they do i will gladly come back here and edit my reviewkoudelka was a game that i really wanted to love
i picked it up during my old game store raids as a kid during the golden era of rpgs koudelka sat shining on a shelf at my locallyowned video game store
as a unique blend of role playing elements set to a gothic timeline i was immediately hooked
when i got home and popped the disc in i was so ready to dive into this unique worldunfortunately i never truly had the chance
the graphics were only decent for the time with even lesserknown titles showing much more polish
the music was very disappointing especially given hiroki kikutas wonderful tunes in the mana series
what really ruined the experience for me was the battle system
it was jagged slow and quite bland  the polar opposite of sacnoth games intentionsas a person who bought and beat almost all of the roleplaying games of the psx era this one stands out as a true letdown
out of my  rpgs for the original playstation this is the only one i did not beat
it stands among my otherwise proud collection a sad sign of good intentions scarred by poor executionboring and cutscene crazy
not much different than the original command n conquer
come on lets get original you guysafter the greatly successful n game mario golf camalot software decided to cook up a new sports title for the year
i had extremely high hopes for  mario tennis but in the end it was very disapointing
its too bad really  because it had all the potential to be an amazing game but fell flat on  its face
it took me a little over five hours to complete in its entirety  so that will give you a clue to just how bad this game isalright i may not be the biggest pokemon fan there is but i know a flop when i see one
i dont know about you but im sick of seeing those little japanese toys that you have to feed and take care of and if you leave it for a second it dies
i suggest pulling out one of those old tamagotchis it will save you some cashoverall i give hey you
pikachu  stars
the only reason i am giving it  stars is because even though this game is pointless that pikachu sure is cute
i would only recommend it to people whos kids are diehard pokemon fansthis is just about opinions and this is my opinion this game was just not fun
before you rate this review just read it because i got quite a few reasons while i dont like it
i really dont like the game because there is a certain amount of time you have to do for things and i can never seem to find the person i need to find and the game is just too hard to play
for the age i was at the time i got this    this game i found slow and unfun
then again i dont really like too many adventure games
here is my stack im sure all of you guys will disagree because as it seems most people like this gamegraphics 
for an n game these were very well done i believe they needed the advanced graphics thing you had to put into the systemsound 
the sound is great
the sounds in towns the voices the cutscenes everything about the sound is greatcontrol 
there are some times when controls can get confused and you can get a little angry at the game because you pressed the wrong button but they are overall easy to get used tofun 
even though i rated everything else high i really dislike this game
it is just not my type of game and like i said before its slow boring and too hard
 it was when i was  at least
i havent played it too recently
even though this game is rated e for everyone be warned this game is not very easy or fun
but im sure there are those people out there that enjoy these games
i would still reccomend the older zelda games the snes oneslet me ask you a question
when playing a link to the past and ocarina of time do you think kakariko village is the most important part of the game
do you think meeting everyone in town getting to know their personalities and figuring out their dilemmas is the most exciting part of the quest
then majoras mask is for you
me
i think meeting people in zelda games should only be one of several fun things a player can do
theres also exploring rich and colorful overworlds fighting enemies and bosses with specific weapons and strategies collecting exciting items that take advantage of the heroic zelda theme and exploring dangerous and challenging dungeons filled with traps and aggressive enemies around every corner
when you add up all these crucial features that ive grown to associate with the zelda series it officially makes a zelda adventure feel like a complete package
so what happens when you take away most of these trademark features of zelda
youre left with an incomplete unsatisfying boring game
proof that storytelling and character development can only provide entertainment for so long
this is why majoras mask isnt very goodmajoras mask does tell a remarkable story and has pretty decent characters
theres no ganon as the bad guy but i dont really mind
hes been used too many times anyway
many of the characters from ocarina of time even return for another appearance such as the music box guy the horse owner and the gorons
their specific theme songs from ocarina of time can be heard as well
the story is that link takes a walk into the woods after the events of ocarina of time and a mischievous imp named skull kid supporting two naive fairies turns evil upon wearing a mask
this imp is especially a big jerk not only does he want link to die he wants him to suffer as well
why
because hes wearing the majoras mask a mask with mysterious powers
this skull kid guy is now completely out of control and link is apparently the only one who can stop him
sound appealing to you
it is
too bad the gameplay is so onedimensional with all the errand running concerning the townspeople
oh but theres another aspect to the story the moon above is angry and if link isnt able to finish the quest in under  hours and stop skull kids madness the moon will crash into the planet and everyone will die
an enticing and noticeably darker theme for a zelda game
the moon totally reminds me of the angry sun from super mario bros   just look at his face hahainstead of kakariko village you have clock town
no its not a town dominated by clocks its a perfectly normal looking town with buildings and ordinary people running around many of which arent the least bit concerned that the world is coming to an end which is quite a peculiar reaction if i do say so
throughout this town you perform tedious tasks such as finding children in a hide and seek game and a needlessly generic rupee collecting mission that involves floating around on pink deku flowers and landing safely on generic platforms
clock town itself is divided into four basic areas
north south west and east
youll be constantly running back and forth between these four areas over and over again figuring out the mediocre tasks relating to the townspeople
the theme song that you hear in clock town is cute enough to make you puke
reminds me of the muppet babies seriouslyunfortunately the repulsive babylike and overdone ocarinaplaying segments are back one again where you have to play songs by way of pressing a sequence of buttons
this is comparable to a year old kid pressing buttons on a toy and believing hes making great music
i hate this aspect of the d zelda series so much
youll be playing the song of time hundreds of times since the idea is that you have to go back to a previous time whenever the moon above gets a little too close for comfort and youre in danger of running out of time
the good news is that going back to a previous time means you can recollect rupees and other things where you can repeatedly deposit rupees by way of a banker in west clock town allowing you to run around collecting a bunch of rupees and simply return to this same spot over and over as a way to keep them stored
the bad news
going back in time is often inconvenient since you just spent several minutes trying to advance the plot and probably desperately hoping the game offers something more than going around talking to people so this whole going back in time portion of the gameplay gets pretty annoying after a while
a link to the past allows link to transport to a dark mirror world and ocarina of time uses time travel these concepts are both a lot better than repeatedly going over the same areas and rooms and opening the same chests that only serve as a pitiful attempt to drag out the length of majoras maskeventually you leave clock town thank god and venture out to a smaller barren and plainlooking overworld with empty fields scarce and badly animated enemies and just a totally uninteresting and failed attempt at exploration
the game has an enormous amount of heart container pieces
way too many in fact
you get to wear a variety of masks some of them necessary to make progress other masks for entertainment value
either way putting on a variety of masks so you can complete tasks and errands hardly satisfies that urge to finish the game and due to the plethora of problems ive already mentioned this isnt enough to make me feel like im taking on a legitimate zelda adventure
i guess thats the point since technically majoras mask is a subplot anywaysoon you arrive to a swamp where a dumb but admittedly funny story pertaining to a tied up monkey accused of kidnapping a princess takes place
the story is the only good portion of this swampdeku palace im afraid
from here you have a boring stealth mission avoiding being caught boring lily pad jumps platform gliding by way of a deku flower item which is really childish and overall tacky combat so the storyline can take center stage
my god is it ever torturous killing enemies with bubbles yes thats right bubbles
in this one underground portion
you have to eliminate  enemies and collect the prize they leave behind gold skulltula tokens for the mask of truth or a giant wallet later onof course the second biggest problem with the game besides focusing on story and characters and nothing else is that the dungeons are limited to only four and half of them arent what id call particularly long or memorable either
the woodfall temple is surprisingly short and uninspiring
its all about torchlighting puzzles collecting stray fairies which is a mandatory mini quest i guess you can say probably used as a means to make the dungeons feel longer then they really are running across narrow wooden platforms floating around on your pink deku flower and by the way link looks horrific wearing the deku mask and an uncreative swordswinging boss fight at the end
this place falls short of being interesting
snowhead temple is one of the better dungeons
you have to roll punch or pound your way through the snow and ice wearing the goron mask which alters links moves completely
you have to collect more stray fairies and shoot patches of ice with fire arrows
the fastpaced boss fight is pretty fun at least but the wizzrobe mini battles are sort of annoying
he teleports all over the room and you have im afraid two battles with himgreat bay temple focuses around lighting torches pulling switchesplatform jumps swimming around or having the current push link and figuring out which room youre supposed to go through all the while being underwater
this is actually the best temple in the game
its challenging in a way that makes you think without being annoying which instantly makes it leagues better than ocarina of times horrendous water dungeon which was nothing more than a snoozefest
graphically it looks really good too
the mini boss is the same as the boss from the water dungeon in link to the past but in a d world of course
the fish boss fight is pretty difficult but fast and fun too
excellent dungeon overall
now the stone tower temple is a major disappointment in comparison
its all about statue and switch puzzles walking statue enemies underwater swimming with a commendable amount of enemies and threats in the water at least nowhere else and having to reflect light to open doors
the boss made of bats is original and awesome in appearance
the main boss fight is the same exact thing as lanmolas the sand wormssnakes from the desert palace in link to the past
this is pretty easy for a boss fight too
overall however stone tower is incredibly bland and a chore to go throughthe final showdown with the gigantic majoras mask is cool and ominous in appearance but lousy in strategy and execution
you basically spend your entire time dodging whips slapping around the room as well as fire attacks and basically the object is to use arrows and swords to bring him down
whichever incarnation youre facing a wellequipped link assures this battle simply isnt challenging enough
the ending is meaningless too
i cant remember ever finishing a game and feeling like i just wasted my time
the fairies are boring and dont really seem interested or grateful for anything youve done
neither does skull kid or anybody else
this just goes to show how unmemorable majoras mask is overall
interesting note the astral observatory opens with a couple notes that totally sounds like the intro to billy joels captain jack classic a song some of you may know
some of the mini games are really fun i admit
the targetbow and arrow games are fun especially the one where you actually shoot enemies
i really hate the fact big skulltula returns perhaps the most overrated enemy in the entire zelda seriesim not sure if this should be named the worst zelda game of alltime
zelda ii the adventure of link for the nes may in fact be worse due to an awkwardly implemented way of battling enemies in sidescroller fashion with bad play control and a really bland overworld
that game is probably worse than majoras mask but only by a tiny notch
other things that annoy me is the passworddemanding kid in clock town the lovey dovey man and woman in the mini game room and especially the marching rooster collecting game that obviously seems designed for little babies as evident by the nursery rhyme music that plays while performing this horrendous game
watching link march around to this music is just sad on so many levels
the twin dancers in clock town perfecting their moves to egyptian music resulting in link performing some rather hilarious and bizarre moves of his own is a nice moment of comedy
im not too crazy about the platform flowers that rise after you water them
a nifty way to get around perhaps but rather clumsy in design overall
pick up the other d zeldas instead of majoras mask and you probably will be happy you didim a huge zelda fan but this game was a complete dissapointment
first lets talk about the game play
you are sent on a  day trip to find a mask taken by a skull kid and you only get a limit of time which is like  hour whats up with that i mean just let use play with out worrieing about a time limit
also by saving you have to find an owl and its a complicated saves process and why cant it be like orcarina of time when you can save when you want
you cant even be adult link
when you beat the game you get to use the majoras mask but theres no point your done with the game
so there has to be one good thing about this game and it fits in a toaster
so go get orcorina of time and not thisi simply did not enjoy this game at all
as ocarina of time was a great game  this game was not a great sequel at all like everybody says it is 
i first played this game on zelda collectors edition after playing ocarina and i was immediately disappointed for several reasons the style of gameplay is different
its way too challenging even though i like a challenge
figuring out what you do first takes ages and ages
dungeons are nearly impossible to beat even with strategy
not many places to savewithout going back in time figuring out even getting to the next dungeon is a pain in the neck
main point only having three days to complete each dungeon is freaken annoyingoverall this game sucks
dont waste money on this game regardless
stick with ocarina of time or wind waker
all zelda fans please head this warningi loved zeldaocarina of time so i was ecstatic when this came out
the problem for me is i found this game to be more effort than fun
you battle time on top of the many tasks that lay before you
the game was ok at first but eventually i got frustrated because there was simply too much going on and it was too much effort and really not much fun
being a deku was cool and all but the novelty wore off and i eventually sold this game without completion
i never left deku stage
too much effort and no fun at alli would have to say that this game was really just thrown together probably to get more funds for future projects
it is unlike any other game you have played which is not always a good thing because the unique part about this game is you have  hours
there is no catch you have  hours however you do have the song of time to take you back to the starting time
then if you do that you must do everything all over again
it is a very tedious game
you must do the same tasks over and over again
also the game was so easy that i was able of beating it in two days upon first playing it
if you are looking for a long challenge get the other zelda
this game also requires the n expansion pack so make sure you have itthis game i dont think lived up to the legend of zelda standard
the gameplay was just as good maybe even better than ocarina of time but the plot was just too horrible
i can understand a mask that makes a guy evil and is now bent on causing chaos throughout the land but did they really need to make the moon fall
i think they should have had more like he was making new masks and brainwashing people with his powers then i would actually try finishing the game
and this game is way too short
they should have made it at least  as long as final fantasy x but they didnt so instead they make a bunch of cheesy sidequests to get everything you need
i did like the masks idea though
that and those funny little monkeys in woodfall
i could laugh at them for hours
but anyway ive had it almost three years now and im not even to the final temple yet
thats just about how boring it is
now i shall give it a final ratingentertainment  plot  difficulty  gameplay  sountrack  characters  replay value  overal rating  so thats just my opinion
and if you dont agree fine
and if you want to play a good zelda game play ocarina of time
and if youve already beaten ocarina of time then i guess you just out of luckbottom line  bad plot bad gamethis game right here is zeldas downfall
after playing all other zelda games and just completing ocarina of timewhich is a very good gamei heard about a new one coming out
i was very excited and couldent wait
once it did come out i rushed to the store bought it rushed back tore it out put it in the n turned it on and was expeting to be transfixed in a game that comes from the best series for a few hoursatleast
what did happen was once i started playing it my spirit started dropping lower and lower
i saw just how different this was then ocarina of time or any other zelda game
i was very annoyed by the time limit and how you had to play games to keep going and before i bought this game i was really happy about the thought of transforming into different creatures but when it did happen i was not stunned
about an hour or two into this game i just gave up
about every other day i played it but was still not happy
every time i started to play i got very unhappy just thinking about what was going to happen rather then the good happy determined feeling i got while playing ocarina of time or all the other zelda games
so after a week i sold it
there went six months of thoughts and saving up for what should of been the best game yet
so as i said before this game is the downfall of the zelda series and shows us a glimps of what zelda will be like from now on
i mean come on what next a zelda with cel shading
in case you didnt understand that was a joke about the new zelda game coming out for gamecube that is yes in cell shadingmost people imagined that after ocarina of time majoras mask would be all that and a bag of chips
or a bag of bombs take your pick
its nowhere near the level of ocarina of time and was much shorter
ocarina of time had  dungeaonsthats right if you count the bottom of the well ice cavern and ganons castle its  compared to majoras masks  dungeons
ill say  since all the other subdungeons could combine as one
the only reason i didnt give this game  star was because it had great graphics
absolutely spectacular images
if only the pudding thick storyline were as good as the graphics
i beat this game in under  hours of gameplay
definitely not worth  bucks
then there are the quotsidequestsquot that try to give you something to do when your stuck and wanna let off some steam
similar to the gold skulltullas in ocarina you must collect all  masks to see the quotperfect endingquot and get the secret ultra mighty mega supernova fierce dietys mask which can only be used against bosses joy
the new feel wears out fast since it feels like play a watered down version of ocarina of time
save your money and get a gamecube or feel depressed with a hole in your heart and a hole in your walletwhen evaluating video games i consider the legend of zelda ocarina of time to be the greatest adventure game i have ever played
as such i was absolutely ecstatic when its sequel came out and i could once again resume links quest
unfortunately that excitement lasted for roughly  minutesor until the gameplay actually startedi realize that there is a large contingent of people who consider this game to be one of the best ever produced but from the perspective of a casual gamer it is largely a disappointment for the following reasonsthe time element
one of the great things about ocarina is that the gameplay was almost completely left up to the discretion of the player
one could go from temple to temple in short order or you could wander around exploring a little bit trying out some minigames with no fears of falling behind
with the time aspect of majoras mask however you always feel pressured to complete certain tasks by a certain time
that sprawling epic feel of ocarina is completely gonesaving
as players of the old nes system learned decades ago there is nothing more frustrating than not being able to accurately save your progress within the gaming experience
some of us are not hardcore gamers and often life intercedes with an ability to find an owl statue or play an ocarina song
this is a major flaw in this game that renders it painfully frustrating at many occasions
if a game is to appeal to the masses it must have a straightforward saving mechanismtoo many sidequests
while ocarina struck the perfect balance between major quests and side quests majora is positively riddled with minigames to the point of absolute overload
again whereas ocarina was straightforward with room for adventuring in majora there are so many things going on that it produces a sensation of fear and overwhelmingoverall i feel as if majoras mask was made for the hardcore gamers instead of the casual fans of the series
whether that was a good or bad choice is up for debate of course but in my experience it completely turned me off from the whole experience
ive tried to get back into this game on multiple occasions but every time it just leaves me frustratedrent the game before you buy it
i know most people find the game funny and fun but in truth it is actually very disturbing
to me at least
and it is so sad to see a funny game have a sad endingmy problem with conker doesnt have as much to do with the idea so much as it does the followthrough
in all honesty i was thrilled to hear the company had recognized their own flaws and were attempting to reconcile for them by releasing a shockingly robust title that seemed to spit in the face of everything theyd done since the debates caused by the home release of the original mortal kombat
however i left my initial playing with the sense that the while idea itself was exactly what the company needed the execution was more than a tad lackingthe story plays out like a theatrical feature which is appropriate considering the number of situations the game eventually borrows from popular films
glass of milk or is it a white russian
in hand and a scowl plastered upon his face conker is immediately reminiscent of the kind of antihero popularized by bruce willis in die hard or samuel l jackson in pulp fiction
surrounded by his supposed friends and acquaintances this introductory scene was a great way to set the tone of the story and introduce a hardened slightly older version of the titles namesake
the moment the kings flashback begins is when the player begins to take control of the actiontheres a lot of hollywood inspiration in conkers tale
from the little nuances and cliches such as the opening scene to borrowed scenes or tips of the hat to films like the location of the kings throne at the end of the game to straightforward ripoffs of memorable scenes or films like the unquestionably matrix bank heist this cartridge is chock full of filmlore
and to its credit the vast majority of the games quirks nods and thefts are handled very well with just enough originality and additional humor thrown in to make it work within the broad confines of its storylinefor the most part the story is successful
its film parodies are spot on while its original threads tend to lag behind a bit and force a joke just for the sake of it
it feels like the game was rushed and rather than waiting for the inspiration to create something undeniably funny the writers instead went with whatever they came up with the fastest
in addition theres little if any direction as to what you should be doing at any point in the story
bad fur day is a big fan of putting you in the middle of an immense area with no visual clues as to where you should go from there then erecting giant invisible walls out of thin air and hoping that their placement will corral you into the exact area in which you should be
successful or not this method is employed over and over and over again from the games start until its finishwhile the storyline is competent for the most part the actual control and gameplay itself is nearly unforgivable
physically controlling conker is a complete nightmare
even the use of the ns welldesigned analog joystick cant save this horribly imprecise setup as the squirrel will occasionally veer left or right without explanation or mosey over the edge of a cliff moments after youve told him to stop moving entirely
conker does have a sort of doublejump feature in that through the use of his tail he can hover in the air for a couple additional seconds
he can also perform a high jump and a long jump by crouching or running for a few second before leaping accordingly
unfortunately these high jump and long jump options only seem to work when they feel like it
ive been running for upwards of a full minute jumped and watched conker perform a weak little sissy jump and fall to his doom
this game really feels like something that wasnt fully tested before its release the controls reek of incompletionadd onto that one of the most horrific cameras in the history of d rendering and youve already got a pissed off gamer
seriously youre given supposed control of these angles through the use of the c buttons similar to the way the camera is maneuvered in the legend of zelda the ocarina of time but as soon as you find a vantage point youre comfortable with and release the c button it just goes off on its own and returns to a completely unhelpful useless view
this camera cannot pass through walls so if your back is against one and youre trying to prepare for a complicated lengthy precise leap youve got to do it blind
better still once youve made up your mind and attempted said jump the camera will awkwardly spin as soon as its got room to get behind you effectively reversing your controls in midair and introducing a loss of direction to your lifethe audio is one of the few undeniable triumphs of this one
the voice acting is tremendous conkers voice suits him perfectly and the actors themselves seem to be having a lot of fun with the material
the music is the usual fare for rare platformers light and bouncy and serves as a constant joke considering the circumstances surrounding it
little tidbits like the main character mumbling to himself and retching when hes drunk or fighting back bile while rolling an enormous ball of poo really make a difference in the experience and are things i wish more games took the time to incorporatewhen push comes to shove theres really only one thing you can create with the ingredients provided by conkers bad fur day and thats disappointment
theres no question in my mind this game needed another couple months of production before it was ready to ship and looking back it should be regarded as the poster boy for the ns lifespan
this game wasnt created to entertain and enamor so much as it was to annoy frustrate and defeatthis game a foul  the long cut scenes are full of disgusting humor
those were the best bits
the actual game iteself seemed like cruel and unusual punishment
the puzzles wouldnt stump a four year old and the game play is tedious and repetitive
if i hadnt borrowed the game from a friend i would have put it down the garbage disposal by nowthe game suffers from many of the problems that nintendo games have
you have long and tedious jumping sequences in which the character will often fail to jump for no apparent reason causing you to have to repeat the sequence from the start over and over ad nauseam
the direction the character moves depends on the camera angle and as the camera will swing around unpredictable the character will suddenly start marching off in a totally different direction when you havent moved the joystick
as much of this game involves walking along narrow paths this is a real pisseri picked up the controller exactly three time with this game and each time i threw it down in disgust  minutes later
i guess im a slow learner
if they the game out and just left the cut scenes youd have something id probably pay  for but at least id think id gotten value for my moneythe game seems designed to irritate and annoy the player
dont buy it unless you really enjoy repeating the same boring stuff over and overlacks the polish of its predecessors but a great game in its own right
i originally bought this because people told me it was the same as super mario rpg legend of the seven stars for snes
it is not anything like that but it is another enjoyable series in which i look forward to the next incarnationtomb raider chronicles trc features the lovely lara croft in her many adventures from rome to a uboat to a hightech tower complex
the game has one of the most awkward controls and frustrating adjusting camera angles since danger girl thats a cheap game and one should buy it simply for the art inside and not for the game or gameplay
anyway one will keep on falling and fallingetc
and continously get blindsided by enemies for the most part
additionally lara still moves like a tank with feet instead of having fluid and sly movement
however the stealth in the latter levels in particular is a welcome addition being spoiled by the metal gear solid series
the puzzles arent too difficult but they are very physicaloriented as opposed to mentaloriented like eidos fear effect
the cinematics are okay but they are rather short
my two favorite levels on this game is the uboatrussian base level and the tower level  level
both of these are reminiscent of metal gear solid
otherwise this game is definitely for fans of tomb raider previously but for newbies definitely rent before you buyi got this game hoping with my writing skills i could create a masterpiece of an rpg game
but i was wrong
at first i had fun with storyline making dungeons characters and naming and making enemies items and all that
i titled it chose the opening theme and stuff
i test played it and found out how hard it was to make this game
a great game like final fantasy series xenogears chrono cross or breath of fire series must take ages to make because this is the most timeconsuming game i have ever playedthe graphics are very nesish and old but i liked them at the beginning
then i got very annoyed with them and how old they looked
it was like i was playing a classic zelda game or the great ps game tales of destiny
i quickly grew bored with this game
check out some other reviews one guy from chicago tells all that i cannot type for my hands are very tired
i had fun at first but it all gradually fell down on me and i gave it up
the anime maker is very difficult to use and scenario mode is even harder
a very very difficult game youll need a strategy guide for this but of course they dont make one
they include  instruction booklets in the cd case that are even difficult to understand
the magic system is horrible and it is all too confusing and hard
do not buy this game thinking youll make a masterpiece
i dont even know how some people do soyoull need a lot if your going to make a serious adventure
you have a simpler concept to use since it is mapped out for you in text windows
the game itself is simple too annoying to play
after seven hours i completed one halffinished village
imagine how long for the whole game
plus you need to use the playstation controller to write out anything that your characters will say
scripted events are near impossible to make bug testing is not fun and you will start to go insane at the point of  hourswhenever you hear someone say quoti could make a better game than thatquot shove this game in their face
it ought to put him or her in their place
only recommended for the extremely super patienta diamond in the rough covered with bugsgosh i so wanted to like this game
theres a lot to like
the gameworld is huge  you could spend hours exploring it
the story is immersive enough to keep you interested
the combat sequences can be kind of long but never get boring
plus you have a large number of partymember combinations which changes the direction of the story
i could go on but others have extolled about the virtues of the game better than i couldthe game feels kind of unfinished like a piece of coal that isnt quite a diamond
thq boasts a gameworld larger than both zeldas combined and this is certainly true
i spent about an hour trekking from the castle town to the first village  travelling takes a long time  and while the scenery changes alot from forest to lakes to snowcapped peaks theres not all that much to do
after the initial quotgee thats prettyquot factor traveling from town to town becomes an effort in patience
the towns also feel kind of empty
there are a couple of people walking around and about a dozen houses only a few with people in them
i know that the memory constraints are tight so they couldnt have included everything they would have liked but thats the sacrifice you make for such a huge gameworld
im not sure this is a good thing
a smaller detailed more interactive gameworld is always better than a huge sprawling empty one in my opinionaidyn chronicles is also im sorry to say a bug ridden mess
a few times my main character got stuck in scenery trees amp walls and i wasnt able to get him out
but the most unforgivable thing was the huge number of errors amp crashes i encountered
i played for an hour gathered amp equiped my party and set off on my quest only to talk to a villager and have the game give me an error message and die on me
i started over this time saving frequently
i reached a certain point and my saved game became corrupted forcing me to start over again
this time i kept a backup saved game
i reached a bit further only to have both saved games get corrupted
by this point i was so frustrated tiptoeing around the games bugs that i gave up and put the game up for auction on ebaythis is a major shame because the storyline was interesting enough to make me want to continue long treks and empty towns nonwithstanding
maybe if youve got more patience than me this is a game worth havingthis game is garbage because of the few modes you can play and limited wrestlers
sure it is good to get  wreslters into the ring at one time and it is kind of fun to fight in the parking lot near the street
but once you play it for a week or less you get really tired of it
i suggest selling your dreamcast and buying a ps or an xbox which both have better wrestling games
thats why dreamcast went broke
it had such good potential but the people did not put enough good games
most were too much arcade like games that you got tired of
the rest was all sports
well actually mostly all the games are better than dreamcast on the xbox and psthis is not a very good wrestling gameno mercy for the n was the bestget thatthis game is very dullthe controls are alright but a bit clunkyi though it was fun for about  hourvery bad dream cast gameand there only wrestling gamebut that doesnt really matter since dream cast has some of the best games ever madethis game just plain suckeddont buy itlateri got this game from blockbuster i did not buy it i was thinging o cool this is cool i got home played it this game was so so bad well not that bad but wm and no mecry is  better then this
its ture its turethats alli dont mind the barelybetterthanps look of the graphics
the graphics were good enough
i was getting into the story combat was interesting i liked the way characters leveled up the sidequests were often amusing looking forward to summoning all sorts of monsters untili couldnt even get past the first big city when one bug after another combined the make the game distasteful
im sure its possible to work around some of the bugs except at most this is just an average rpg and its not worth trouble to fight the bugs when there are dozens to hundreds of playable rpgs that arent so buggyi was impressed enough by what i did see in the game that im likely to give summoner ii a shot  very few bug complaints on that gamei love a good rpg
their is nothing like exploring a new world
taking on a new life
in short getting away from yourself for a while
a good rpg will do that
its too bad nobody told the people at thq about any of thatthis game could be summed up in one word
boring
nothing much happens
when it does you hardly notice
its story does nothing to draw you inthe graphics are ok at best
not the game to show off your ps that is for dang sure
popin is horrible and i am surprised how sony let this little gem slip by for the launch
not really a game that shows off what the system can dosome odd things make it into the game
the people for one thing
they are in a word ugly and so is the guy you control
i am not sure what the artists were thinking but  these are some ugly folk
i am not saying they are not well done they are
the problem is that they actually look ugly
very odd choicethe game play is so boring you may find that after about  min you just dont care anymore
the quests are boring
the locations are boring
even the story is hohum
nothing much is going on in this worldthe music and voice acting are quite good but the game just never gets any momentum going
it feels lifeless and your role in that world seems aimlessa good rpg is a work of art
a gentile balance of game and story line
if finalfantsty and zelda are like a pollock or a picasso then this game is paint by numbers portrait of a clown and some balloonsupon starting summoner for the ps i was immediately dismayed by the quotnow loadingquot screen thrust at me before anything even started
i waited for about ten seconds only to learn that the loading was simply to throw a quick thq logo onscreen
to add to that the loading for actual ingame play is much longer
you can actually walk to the kitchen and grab a drink come back and still see the loading screen
as for the gameplay the socalled quotcomboquot system is simply engaging in combat and pressing in one of four ways on the directional pad during combat
the combat is extremely stiff and aside from random grunts and moans nothing special
the overworld movement is not too bad however with the camera keeping up fairly well with the main character
graphically this game is a disaster
choppy framerates drawin that is downright laughable and a graininess that would of been criticized even on the psone
at one point you enter a harbor area and see the open skies ahead of you
however as you step forward you see a castle form not even  yards ahead of you causing a friend of mine to joke that they had a cloaking device
in terms of sound the music is quite nice really
the failure comes through in the aforementioned combat
with that exception i have no real gripes about the audio
the game itself would be very well had these flaws been dealt with
the storyline is intriguing and the characters are fairly well designed
the quests are enough to keep you occupied for some time and varied enough to avoid boring you
the dialogue is splendid as well
overall summoner is a potentially good game gone horribly bad
obviously rushed before the drawin combat and graphic errors could be corrected the mark was missed
hopefully this will be a lesson learned for thqhmmill start with whats good the game is fairly fun it has a reasonably cool skill system theres enough sidequests to keep you entertained much longer than the game actually takes to beat the characters have some amount of depth and differ rather greatly the graphics are fairly nice the music is quite good the voice actors fit very well with their characters its the best rpgish game on the ps which honestly isnt saying much at all and most importantly it has a great hidden movie press x in the creditsnow for the bad there are enough random side quests to make the most hardened player of bg cry and very few of them give you the option to not take them on
that means if you only want to do a few of them youll have to sort through the ones you dont want in your quest menu
also the character ai is the worst ive seen since warcraft  characters will run off on their own to initiate a battle across the battle map or will throw fireballs at enemies that are healed by fire while your other characters in the blast radius get hurt after the same attack on the same enemy has failed to have a positive effect the last  times its been tried
the sound cuts out all the time probably one out of five areasencounters has only the background music and footstep sounds and i have yet to hear the sound from the dragon summons
probably the most frustrating thing is the messed up experience system
i wont go into great detail here but after th level you need  times as much experience per level but still get it at the same rateand youre getting fewer skill pointsso why does this get such a low rating
the real reason is that while its on the playstation  it seems like it was given as much effort as the average super nintendo gamefrom graphics to sound to depth of game its an inferior game taking up the shelf space of a superior systemthis games graphics are awesome but the one thing i hate about it is the way the dialogue is
it is in light blue in a dark blue box and i cant see it for the life of me
i play in a bright room too
i havent gotten very far but the game hasnt inspired me to do it
a real disappointmentthe graphics on this game were very disapointing and the gameplay is not too great either
only reason i am giving  stars instead of  is because there is a storyline something many games are lacking nowadays
i would not have bought this game if i had taken a closer look at the graphicsdidnt lkeitafter playing the demo version of this game i was sure the complete game would be a blast
the demo offered clean graphics and quick gameplay  though it was hampered by an incredibly simplistic story
still it made  me want to play the gameafter renting quotthreads of fatequot  though i have to say that square has let me down again
though this ones  not nearly as bad as some of their other bombs quotlegend of manaquot  and quotsaga frontierquot quotthreads of fatequot is still a far  cry from a good gamethe major faults of quotthreads of fatequot  include the boring dialogue skimpy storyline bad camera angles and  awkward control
to put it simply  you have to get through a lot of  nonsense just to get to the gameplay but even that isnt so hotyoull  run into lots of annoying features in the battle mode such as zoomedin  shots that prevent you from navigating effectively and annoying jumps or  unclear exitsthere is some fun though  the battles themselves arent  too bad though they end up as hackandslash fests more than anything  else
having two characters to play is one of the games few saving  graces
its especially fun playing as rue and changing into the enemies  you just killedall in all square is starting to slip in my opinion  and games like this only prove my point
quotthreads of fatequot is  worth a rental but dont expect anything grandgraphics a gameplay  b music amp sound coverall bi bought this game used because i liked the movie and i thought what the hey the game will probably be good too
it does deliver on nostalgia but it is not a fun game to play
i wanted to like this game but it just has so many flawsfirst and foremost the movement system
pushing up on the arrow pad makes you go forward no matter which way youre facing
this took me forever to get used to and even then i never entirely got the hang of it
it makes fighting enemies slow and difficult
would it have been that hard to make the movement normal and use the analog stick
sighanother complaint is that the game is short the puzzles are irritating and boring and you never leave this one building
thats right the entire game takes place in the same castle
which inevitably means that much of the game is comprised of hideous backtracking over and over again to find a cardkey and open a doori dont know if im just biased because im used to playing turnbased rpgs but i found this game incredibly unenjoyable
its only redeeming quality is that vampire hunter d is its subject matter  so my advice is to only buy this if your a fan of vampire hunter d and if you think you can stand itlike the other reviewers i found the gameplay itself to be quite interesting
however the game has a number of technical problems that render it unplayable in its current form
namelycrashes frequently  not only does it crash often but it crashes reliably whenever you encounter certain events
one singularly annoying example is that it crashes every time you kill a particular monster
since you have to kill this monster to proceed with the main story line this effectively ends the gamevery slow  my computer is actually a bit faster than the requirements on the box and i find the game ponderously slow
restoring a saved game takes a whopping  minutes
also the game has to stop at various points to load new adventuring areas with similarly long pauses
lets just say that youll need to have a book handy to read while playing this game
one mysterious delay lies in the fact that that quitting the game without a save can sometimes take five minutes or more
in the same amount of time one can manually terminate the game using the escape key and restart it so i have no idea what the computer is doing during all this timethere is also a modest problem with game balance
virtually all of the monsters in the game are push overs
theyre so easy that you wont even bother to cast your enhancing spells theyre just not worth the trouble
then you finally encounter one of the big monsters and its completely overpowering
someone really should have paid some more attention game balance back in the design phasethat said its an interesting enough game and i might take another shot at it once they get around to putting a patch out
until they release a patch however i would strongly discourage anyone from buying this gamealot of people are going to say that two stars is unfair for a game that has such great graphics and playabilityi understand where youre coming from if you think that because this game looks great and is very fun
but it is way too graphically violent for me
i dont have anything against shooting games in general i love counter strike and igi and unreal tournament was good back in the day but wolfenstein ups the ante way beyond simple kill and be killed gameplay going to extremes like depictions of torture and mutilation
even though i can spend hours shooting enemies in the head while playing medal of honor and enjoy lopping off limbs in rune playing castle wolfenstein is for me completely demoralizing and dehumanzing
i dont play it because of that and any game i wont play cant get better than two starsby the way this game is banned in germany
but that might just be because of the antigerman sentiment as much as the violencemaybe the game had too much hype but after nearly completing the single player and playing the multiplayer for several weeks i am rather disappointed
the single player missions for the most part are boring and repetitive
im comparing it to halflife and it is nowhere even close to the quality of the single player
what is really shocking are the graphic defects present in the game  guns appearing through walls dead soldiers hovering a few feet above ground some cheesy ai but better than most
the multiplayer is much more enjoyable and uses many of the single player maps
ill be selling it and buying medal of honor when it comes outcontrary to popular belief this title is not part of the civilization series
this is activisions attempt at a civ clone
in some areas it succeeds but in most it fails
this game had no affiliation with sid meier creator of civi and ii the latter arguably the best pc strategy game everprosgood government selection
some new governments are included like fascism technocracy theocracy ecology corporate republic etcarmies and fleets
in civii a stack of units could be killed in what attack
this is not soautomated improvements
the government automatically does terrain improvementsdiplomacy and trade both are well planned and fairly extensiveconsdiplomacy and trade neither are used to their full extent and if you try other civilizations refuse
theres all types of stuff like trade embargoes etc but the ai never does themcivilizations over  civs to choose from but theres really no difference in between them
also whenever i play im always up against the same civs french british german irish scottish american and native americans
that gets boring very fastslow the interface is slow even on a mb ram p mhz machinescenarios only  of them and none are any goodno customization of units or civs in civ anyone could make their own units terrains technologies scenarios maps etc
you cant do any of this in ctpconclusion civ should be out in the us within  months its coming to mac and to europe
civ has sid meier working on it
civ has elaborate diplomacy and trade
civ has culture points great military leaders many unit animations civ specific units new paths to victory total customization of units civs techs maps etc has better graphics more realistic more units will ship with  scenarios and so much more
the bottom line save your cash for civ its just months awaystreet fighter always one of my favorite fighting games and one of the few d fighters left and that was ok because it was street fighter
but for some sick reason they decided to move it from lovingly done cartoonish d fighters to subtekken d
why
if you want a d fighter get tekken tag
if you want d beauty like goodold street fighters of the past sorryall of the street fighter ex games the ones in d have been pretty bad
this one is no different
while it easily has the best graphics in the series it should still look better for a bit game
capcom should have tweaked the controls but its obvious they rushed this one
try tekken tag tournamentttt was supposed to be the best fighting game ever well im here to tell you it isnt
the graphics are pretty good but not much else
its enivitibility that really kills ttt because inevitibly after a few weeks this game will get boring and will end up collecting dust on your shelf
ignore all the star reviews at  trust me ttt doesnt live up tothe hypei really see no reason to buy this game you can beat it within  minutes if you can even stand playing it that long
its only remotely fun when you play in  player mode
the characters add some spark but not enough to save this horrrible game
if you lik boxing you might like it but thats abouy it
youll get bored with this game very fast so i highly reccomend knockout kings instead of this
there are much better ps games out there so get out out and explore just esort to this as a rentwhen you start playing you start yawningthe problem with games with prerendered backgrounds is that it completely ruins the pacing of an action game
if you look at any action film these days the camera and the elements being filmed all movethis kind of cinematorgraphy goes back to the days of film before d w griffith
ie set the camera down and let the actor run around until he leaves the room
then set the camera down in a new location and repeatif you like games like resident evil or fear effect this game is for you
also if you like solving awkward puzzles this game is for you
any time one has to put an awkward puzzle into a game to mix up the game play means that one is totally out of ideas for the game
like still cameras awkward puzzles break the pacing of the gameill expected more but your playable and your graphics are no good
the history yes is very good but no the another things from this gamethis game has frustrating puzzles and the gameplay is exactly like devil may cry its not funny
the story is so cliched too
save the princess
also its not realistic
the st boss is so stupid a year old couldve made him
only good thing is the graphics but thats itthe only reason im going to give it  instead of one is bc of the quality of graphics but the game playing sucks  i dont know wat is lamer walking around repetively hacking slashing the same creatures over again or the  bosses who are just overgrown blowhards who take a couple of shots u need no real stradegy to beat them also i dont dig the storyline or want a storyline  i mean ur a japense ninja equiped with japense fine steel u would expect a great fighting game not some cinematic movie clipsthis game looked enticingbut i didnt realize from the cover that this is just a soupedup resident evil clone
granted that the graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is pretty fast but theres not much to the game beyond thatgo to the next area kill the monsters there without the resident evil saveyourammolikeyourlifedependsonit stratedgy which made res evil games so edgy get the item solve the obligatory puzzle repeat
the horror aspect of resident evil games is completely gone which makes this one a bit heavy on the cheesy and notsochallenging sideits also real shortgood graphics not so go voice overs not too compelling storyline save the princessgroan
i was disappointed but i guess i might be in the minorityafter playing games like knockout kings  and madden  i start to question whether ea sports developed this game or some newbies who threw stuff together
first of all quotreal timequot commentary forget it
the commentary in the game   when you go from track to track during the career mode youve got the same stupid commentator saying quotso and so really moved in the point standing after last weeks racequot they say this every time
how hard is it to record a few different statements
the graphics are okay and the physics engine is pretty good but not good enough to make up for the rest of the game
they should have added more to the career mode like getting offers from sponsers depending on how youre doing
hiring and firing crew chiefs and spending your earnings to keep you car running and to buy upgrades and stuff
when the  will game developers learn that they are leaving out most of the reality in these games
rent it beat it and buy something elseand one more thing if you rent it dont turn on the rear view mirror or the whole game is as choppy as the ocean during a hurricanei really was expecting the original ssx to be like tricky or number  disappointed
the controls are very awkward when i want to flipspin its impossible
the levels seemed too oddly designed for snowboarding
also the overall features are extremely limitedthe first foray of the cult evil dead horror movie series into video games began here with evil dead hail to the king
using the resident evil formula of prerendered backgrounds with d animated characters evil dead suffers from poor polygon designs clunky controls and the same find the key to open the door type gameplay weve seen in games like the resident evil series and alone in the dark
evil dead star bruce campbell lends his voice to ash and breathes some life into this otherwise dismal game but the terrible control layout and configuration really bring this game down
the dreamcast version was a bit better with improved graphic and sound quality but all in all evil dead hail to the king is worth checking out for fans of the evil dead series or survival horror games onlythe story is something like this after the army of darkness movie ash gets a new girlfriend
but he has nightmares and he decides to go back to the cabin which was destructed in evil dead ii to end this once and for all
the cabin is wellclean and everything wheres the connection with evil dead ii partners
but ashs girlfriend is kidnapped by bad ash more like evil dead iis then army of darkness
your objective is to find six necronomicon pages throughout the game a boring task i must say
and you also have to save your girlfriend
thats what you have to do while you move on you might notice that if youre a hard fan like myself the game is only fun while youre walking inside or around the cabin those familiar scenaries
all the rest is boring the graphics are ok for a psone game for all ive played trees move the fog moves no big deal but its ok the sound is good too bruce campbell does great voice acting as seen in other games too
but its not fun
and thats a big problem
deadites keep coming and coming some enemies are really tough and you dont feel like youve finnished a masterpiece when you beat this game it was a try but i wish thq can learn from its mistakes to make a cool sequel
in the educational point the game is not approved its matureclassified you see there is a little blood violence but no big things you can let your grownup children play itunless you are a hard evil dead fan and you want to have one more item for your collection dont buy this game
its my opinionsure this is an evil dead game but whos kidding
this game isnt that great
games based on movies usually suck but i gave this game a tryyes the dreamcast version of course and it wasnt all that gretthe graphics are ok i guess
the controlls suck
gameplay is dull otherwise if you love evil dead and want to try out the games steer clear away from this hunk of junk
its your choice but trust me its not worth the money
crappy gamei give this a  out of  starslatesi love the game when i get to the snowboarding parts but its way too much work getting to ride
the graphics are really sweet
i love the way snow gets kicked up into the camera when you land but i dont know if i can get over the glaringly annoying features of this game i feel like i am playing one of those barbie dressup games when i get to buy coats pants and goggles give me a break
new equipment such as boards and bindings make sense but jackets
 too much menu wrangling to get to the actual game play
if i lose a competition there is no retry button
you have to go back to the lodge and walk over to the cheesy box head guy and enter all over again
then at the end of the run you have to choose between replay and proceed with the default always being proceed
its just a major hassle
they should learn from tony hawk
they have it down too much loading especially in multiplayer session stuff
nobody likes spending more time loading than playing not enough thought put into the session competitions
for instance there is one race with rails and windy narrow lanes that have huge dropoffs on either side if you fall off either side you lose
it ends rather abrubtly this way right before either player can get into it
why not just send the rider back to the beginning of the courseno offense to oldschool shooters or their fans but this is a pretty weak excuse for a ps launch title
sonys quotultimate game machinequot or whatever tagline theyre using should be able to easily handle the first and second gradius installments along with these two on a single disc
where are they
i hate to say it but konami isnt giving us a whole lot of bang for our buck which is unusual for themsure the new intro is nice but what about the games themselves
i think father time has a way of exaggerating our sense of nostalgia especially where video games are concerned
some games simply do not age well
in the battle between pretty graphics and solid gameplay i stand firmly on the latter side but next to the best shooters of the post bit era such as einhander and g darius gradius iii and iv just arent much fun
the actual shooting is downplayed while too much emphasis is placed on memorizing the enemy patterns and maneuvering your ship so as to avoid becoming instant space junk
before too long it ceases to be challenging and just gets annyoing
get killed and you lose all your power ups
good luck beating a boss with just a speedup bonus
plus there are no continues in gradius iii
instead it uses a lame stage select modei know these were landmark shooters in their heyday but we should be playing more advanced games that learn and borrow from them not just recycling them for a new system
i fully support the continuation of d gaming in the d era but this is not the way to go about doing it
if you really want a traditional shooter for your ps try silpheed the lost planet instead
not as much of a challenge perhaps but much more enjoyableis this game fun
yes
it is fun
but it is not  fun
it is  fundoes this game belong on this platform
nothis is an embarassment for sony to touting these incredible hardware specs and then have a game like this released on this platform
but thats what happens when third party developers start trying too hard to push games out the doorim waiting for metal gear solid  you should toowhat happens when you take a successful arcade game and translate it to a console
success right
wrong in this case that is
this game was great in the arcade due to the inovative use of a rifle and scope
but when you take that away all you have is a very bad quotarea quotesque game
this game should have never been translated to any console and you will notice this quickly after playing for a minute or two
the controls are sluggish and just like any other shooting game that doesnt have a gun peripherial it gets boring fast
only get this game if it is the only game you can find when you are buying a psthis is the fourth installment in lucasarts monkey island series
producers of the game have stated in online interviews that there would indeed be a fifth installment but as of my writing its apparently not under productioni bought and played this one essentially on the strength of the third item in the series escape from monkey island which i adjudge to be far betterthey seemed to have a winning recipe in that installment  why did they completely overhaul the conceptwell okay not everything was overhauled
the voice actors atmosphere and quirky sense of humor are all intact but the game designers saw fit to completely revamp the way guybrush moves around the screen
and whether you set his movement to characterrelative or screenrelative it never seems to work rightnor do the gamemakers think anything of including a lot of puzzles that rely on a timer so youve got to manuever this difficult to control character around before a certain door closes etc
i dont think they had the right to do that so to speak while the character movement was so wonkybut the thing that really gets my goat is that they took the unique beautiful cartoony look of monkey island  and replaced it with cgi drawn characters which effectively robs this series of its central charm  superior visualsthe look of the islands the sky the clouds and even the characters in monkey  was so welldone and charming that i stuck with that game just to enjoy the games eyecandy
i thought it was the games greatest strength
and thats precisely what theyve monkeyed with  pardon the punin fact with the stunning visuals gone the character of the gameplay rises to the fore and the idiocy and frustration of many of the puzzles becomes unbdeniably apparentin fact i got so frustrated with monkey  that after getting about halfway through the game i just sat there with a walkthrough trying to get through the rest of it
even with the walkthrough though it was still a slog
the entire time i was cheating i kept thinking sheesh
im glad i didnt waste precious hours of my life agonizing over that puzzle
i would simply never have guessed the solution since the solution doesnt make any flippin sense
which means if youd like to go through this game straight youve basically got to try to pick up every object try every object you have on every other object in every possible screenif you find this kind of thing fun then knock yourself outi really hate to say that this game is thoroughly mediocre since it does have a few things going for it such as the gorgeous graphics and somewhat interesting storyline
however i cannot recommend mafia to anyone who has already played a truly great drivinggangster game such as grand theft auto  or who doesnt like attempting a single mission  times
overall the idea of letting you play a mafia don in the s is a good one however its just poorly implemented in this gamegameplay your character is a taxi driver who is forced into a career of crime
by completing missions driving killings vandalism more driving etc
 you rise in the ranks of the salieri crime family
much of the gameplay from the controls mouse keyboard and optionally a gamepad to mission design is easy to pick up and much like gta
nonetheless the big problem with mafia is that the gameplay is tedious and at some points down right boring
while the city you do your dirt in is very beautifully rendered its rather dead and does not have the bustle and liveliness of gtas liberty city or vice city
theres no reason to ever get out of your car as you are driving between missions since there are no ammo shops to visit minimissions to unlock or other things to do
you can literally spend  minutes driving from salieris bar to the next mission site and there is absolutely no feeling of accomplishment once you finally arriveon the good side the developers of the game have tried to make it realistic which is both the strength but also many of the weaknesses of the game
the cars look fantastic though they handle poorly
also unlike gta you cant commit outrageous traffic violations without drawing the police and you cant just jump in and steal any parked car
the animation of the character models look realistic and scenary feels authentic
also though it has the automatic save system that gta has mafia saves the game at more points so that you dont have to do too much backtracking if i mean when you fail a missionnow for the bad side
the cars are just a chore to drive
bad handling low horsepower slippery tires you name it
and given that there is so much driving required by the game the developers should have allowed you to skip some of the noneventful driving scenes
to make matters worse many of the missions are timed and the ingame map is useless
youll lose a number of missions just searching for the bridges that connect the city together no roads or bridges appear on the ingame map
it is hard to imagine why the developers of this game thought that beginning and ending missions with such annoyingly long and tedious driving sequences would be fun to playersand now for the ugly
yes the racing mission  is as awful as many people have said
even though i have the patched version of the game that includes a difficulty slider for the race it was still too hard on the very easy setting
the race is way too long the track has way too many sharp turns the race car is way to prone to spinouts and rollovers and the controls gamepad or keyboard just dont cut it for what is required
i tried this mission over  times and never won the race and thus never finished the game which is rare for me
the race was the worst instance of the frustrations of gameplay but there were plenty moregraphics the real shame is that mafia as tedious and poorly designed as it is is a beautiful game
the cutscenes though a bit too long sometimes are well done and even the lipsyncing is better than most games ive played
the cars are shiny and sleek and show damage when they are abused
the city itself is well rendered and driving in the countryside is just heavenly
its just too bad that some of the energy that was expended on creating such realistic graphics was not used to make a truly exciting gamesound everything is cool in this department
the voice acting is well done cars weapons and other things sound as they should and the music is finereplayvalue since i only paid  for this game its hard to feel cheated even though i was able to complete only  of the  missions
my disappointment is largely about what this game could have been with just a bit more effort and testing
if you are a very patient player and dont mind long stretches of repetitive gameplay such as all of the dull driving that youll be doing and can find a way to beat the racing mission then this might be worth your while
however if you are expecting a game with a lot of exciting car action very original missions and anything approaching gtas funny openended mayhem definitely look elsewheredont get me wrong
this game is fun however the frustration factor is about to make me go on my own killing spree
first of all theres no ingame save
the game saves after every level so if you screw up you have to start over and over and over and over  the vehicles are fun to drive however the control is difficult
i seem to slide on invisible patches of ice
why is it that when im chasing someone no matter how fast my vehicle is they get away
and why is it that when im being pursued no matter how fast my vehicle is theyre always riding my tail
i found the race to be most challenging and youll use a few colorful words before you win
i would have won sooner but again al i did was skid at after turn and spin out to end up facing the wrong direction
the storyline is entertaining but the game is just too frustrating for me to just sit here and play the same level over and over and over and over
two hours of the same level is not worth my time
i have a lifei was thoroughly disappointed in mafia
i hate to say this because i really wanted to like this game and for the first hour or so i really did
but as the game progressed so did my frustrationits true that mafia has it all  wonderful graphics engaging story interesting missions action even music
but there are a few pitfalls that turn it from a great game into a soso gamefirst even though i did not really mind all the driving most of it bears absolutely no purpose
the racing mission was absurd
if i wanted to race sports cars i wouldve bought a racing game
cmon people nobody liked that mission
what was the point of it
but i stuck with it forgiving them for the obviously annoying and pointless part yet it never really got better
if anything it got worsewhile i can see theyve tried to make many aspects of the game ultrarealistic its really anything but
here are some points about thatpoint  i understand that the vigilant cops and traffic violations were put into the game to make it seem more realistic
but how come that running people over or bumping into other cars leaves the cops indifferentpoint  the police cars are the fastest cars in the game
no matter what car youre driving even a race car they will catch up to you and arrest you
yet when later in the game you get to drive a police car the other police cars are still faster than you
makes any sense
to me neitherpoint  the game is happening in the s
how in the world would a cop measure your speed
how could a cop walking on the sidewalk know what the speed of your car is
yet they all stop you cops in cars and cops on the sidewalkpoint  the cops only seem to be after you
whenever you have to chase after someone in your car of course you have to speed if you want to catch up with them
yet if you do the cops will run you off the road and arrest you for speeding
never the other guy
same goes for the hide weapon feature
if the cops spot you carrying a gun they will arrest you yet there is one mission where you start with the gun in your hand
the sequence loads you dont even have a chance to hide your weapon and immediately the cops spot you
forget trying to get away
the only way to finish either mission is to pray there are no cops around when the mission startspoint  if you reload while your gun still has bullets in it you lose those bullets
only a fool would discard their halfused magazine in real life
in fact in the military they encourage you to reload as often as possible because this way theres less chance to run into an empty magazineanother thing that might not be a problem for other games but is a huge one for mafia is that its a very linear game
it gives you very little room for creativity
in one of the first missions you have to collect money from a gas station and then carchase and kill the guy that stole the money
before going into the gas station i shot the tires on the car just in case
but when the very nest sequence loaded the car was driving just fine
the game consistently points you in the right direction and there are no rewards for exploring on your own or deviating from the main plotline unlike in games like morrowind in which you can progress any which way you wantand of course the most frustrating aspect of the game is your inability to save games
honestly i cant comprehend why game developers do that
is it so difficult to put in a savegame feature
mafia is not simply a game where you cannot save its an extremely difficult game where you cant save
who wants to spend two hours going through the same mission over and over again
did i mention that the conversations written into the missions repeat as well and that you cannot skip them
after spending  hours on one of such missions only to get killed in the last two minutes of it and have to start all over again i finally gave up
sure i want a game thats challenge i play all my games on hard or realistic difficulty setting but i dont want a game thats a total frustration rollercoastermafia could have been a real gem
it could have easily been an epic classic of the gaming world if it wasnt for the aforementioned downsidespretty much everything has already been said and i think it just depends on the person but i got bored with this gameso bored that when i upgraded my system and the game stopped working with the new configuration i didnt really care even though i was only a fourth of the way finishedso if i have anything to say about this ill speak to that problemwithout getting into specifics basically when i upgraded my system from midlevel to highend the game stopped working
it will load and begin but then it just completely quit
i lowered the clock speed on my processor and selected the lowest graphics settings that got the game to work for about  minutes before it just crashed again
that was also after i installed the patch
none of this makes any sense to me and i fix and build computers for a livingat that point i was only playing because id spent good money on this game and was hoping there was going to be something other than pretty graphics and a good story to make it worth while
it takes up too much space on the hard drive imho and the game play is seriously lacking
theres no incentive to exploreits entirely too linearperhaps if i had a chance to really get into the free ride part id like it but since you have to play the regular part of the game before all of the free ride is unlockedand since the bloody game wont hardly work anymore even though all of my soft and hardware is supported i guess i will never knowim not at the point of asking for my money back but close
im very disappointed and i really wanted to like this game
i tried to like it
i like driving games and i like mafia and old chicago type of stories
i did not like this game thougheven when it was workingdownload the demo before you buy
if you do buy download the patch because youll be glad you did when you get to the race
its absurdly difficult without intermediate savesjust like my title states i may never even get to play this one way to many controls for this budget shooter horribly set up its quite boring so far and i may never go back to it dont pay more than  bucks and dont buy it unless you are extremly patientafter playing quotthe longest journeyquot sighi loved it i was getting edgy for something new
i wanted to see if there were any games out there like it
quotthe longest journeyquot is still my favorite game and i wanted something similar or better if possible
i read all the reviews of this game
half of the reviews seemed favorable and the other half hated it
what to doi contacted via email some of the reviewers to ask them if they think i would like the game
consensus showed i should get it
okay so here goesthe game began with little graphic and exciting scenes of what to expect and then boom
the actual game had horrible graphics
i mean real bad
its so pixilated you can barely make out the sphinx itself
i proceeded anyway because i was kind of feeling the indiana jones hype and went furtherto the first and obvious puzzle
it seemed hard at first but i quotunlockedquot the puzzle in  minutes
thats right
 minutes
okay i gave it one more chancei tried to find my way to the next step and the  degree turns and slow quotmystquot click and move steps got me so annoyed and lost it took me an hour just to figure out where i needed to go
i could never get to the spot i needed to because apparently i needed to download a patch to proceed
i found out after calling some game stores at the local mall that you need a few of these patches to improve the game
it is playable without them but extraordinarily difficult
i really wanted this game to succeed
i had done my homework giving it a fair chance and it failed
it really was like an egyptian quotmystquot minus the beautiful graphics intellectually challenging puzzles and lacking a great plot
i am still remaining open to new ideas from anybody
i have since returned quotthe riddle of the sphinxquot and am looking forward to suggestions from other game reviewers
if anybody has ideas for me please feel free to email
thank you
and to those of you who were so kind and helpfulim truly glad you liked the gamei guess it just wasnt for methis cable hardly has any improvement over the sony cable that comes with the psx and the ps
if not demagnatized it creates crazy interferance and sends things that look like vertical damper wires all over the screen
youre much better off with a sony svideo cable a monster gamelink svideo cable or interacts higher quality cable
i personally suggest interacts better one because it offers better quality at a lower cost than monsters
the cables themselves are thin and badly shielded thus the audio performance is also sub par
the only advantage is the ability to unjoin the cables so you can send the audio to your stereo and the video to your tv
but you can do that with interacts better cable you cant with monstersextremely cheap av cord here
it worked to replace our totally broken cord but it got damaged quickly
one of the sides of the part you insert into the playstation cracked and bent making the device very loose in the console
the other side quickly followed and soon after the sides of the plastic insert just broke off
this caused the device to fall out when the console was moved even a little
it also resulted in only one speaker side working because the device no longer fit into the console and it messed up the sound
we ended up having to prop up the device by inserting a video game case under iti rented the game and had high expectationsbut this is what i gotthe game has an excellent story linetoo bad they ruined it by getting off the point non clear directions and well whoever made this game needs help concentrating
well the graphics are oknot anything good but bearable although a few times i couldnt tell land from water and died
then there is the camera viewing is way too weird
i mean half the time i couldnt see where i was going
but the worst part of this game was the errors
this happened several other places also
and if you didnt save your game you lose everything
one other thing was some of the rides like the rollercoaster if you call it that will make you sick to your stomachon the rollercoaster all you are doing is spinning very very fast
and they set it up so it appears on the screen that you are sitting on the seat still get headaches from just the thought of it
if you want to try the game be sure to rent it first
and make sure you get pretty far in the game past the first mask because that is where the trouble startsbeware everyone this game is extremely addicting at one point in my life it was taking up almost all of my leisure time
i would have gave it one star because of its extreme ability to make people lose their lives over this game but its such a fun game i had to give it black and white is an incredible game
i was completely blown away
the game is based on brilliant and wonderfully executed ideas
it is a rich and engaging game with many different levels of play
the gameplay is so varied i sometimes feel like im playing five games in oneits addictive its fun it looks nice it has a great interface wonderful sound and im pretty sure people will be talking about this game for years to comebut it is also perhaps the most buggy piece of software ive ever personally encountered
several features that were supposed to be in the game at release are not even there at all
the game crashes constantly
a lot of things simply dont work right
many little issues with gameplay balance combined with countless bugs stack up to one big problem a barelyplayable gamei wish id returned it to the store at which i bought it before my thirty days were up
fans have been waiting for a patch for two months
and just learned they have another few weeks to wait on that patch
the game is absolutely not a final version its a beta
dont pay forty dollars for a beta really everyone who has bought the game so far should be compensated for finding the bugsmy advice get this game once the patch comes out and once youve heard about whether or not the patch worksafter reading all of the previews and ad information for this game i was convinced that it really was going to be a unique gaming experience
black amp white is unique uniquely frustrating uniquely cumbersome and uniquely overhypedi want to start by pointing out that if you have read the previews and even reviews for this game you are being misled
the professional reviewers of this game base most of their opinions on the quotstunning graphicsquot that can burden even the best video cards and the interesting godgame storyline
the graphics while well made are nothing unexpected and at the close in zooms show quite a bit of blockiness for such a supposedly quotrevolutionaryquot game engine
as for the godgame storyline this game differs little from your standard rts realtime strategy game
resource management and a semblance of a quottechtreequot in the form of captured village centers that offer different miracles lead you down the same path as any other game in the genre
adding in the creature makes the game a micromanagement nightmare
the creature starts off dumb and greedy and grows smart and aggressive even when you actively discourage that behaviorthe interface is an exercise in frustration
attempting to navigate the map is like trying to drive a car with one steering wheel for each tire
turning can lead to being stuck on the sides of mountains until you change your zoom to get around it
moving through confined areas like the mountain passes in the first map can take a significant amount of time zooming turning and tilting
all this adds together to completely prohibit quick movement on the map a major problem for any rts gamethe job of managing your villagers in their various villages means that you will spend the majority of your time tending to these lazy people
instead of just providing their resources you must begin construction on all of their structures
the will whine about everything and do nothing to fulfill their own needs
this means that you will spend most of your time watering fields that your farmer disciples do nothing with
making forester disciples means nothing unless the trees are right in front of these idiots
in fact the only disciples of the eight that you can create that do their jobs well are the breeder and missionaries
in the end you will have to do most things yourself and leave your followers to sit on their blocky behindsone last note if you are really intent on buying this game my recommendation is to get every help guide and walk through you can find
the manual provided is practically useless and the in game help is more comic relief than help
your best bet is to wait for this game to end up in the bargain basket and at least save yourself some moneyive had this game for a few months now
at first i loved it
learning about each individual element of the game eg the miracles the creature the villagers the islands the opposing gods was fun and promised for exciting gameplay
unfortunately knitting all of the elements together into a comprehensive whole is one area where black amp white needs work
for instance in order to accomplish anything you are forced to quotincrease your influencequotthat is you cannot interact directly with any area of the island that is not under your influence
to gain influence you have to demonstrate to the neighboring villagers that you are a powerful god by tossing rocks trees people fireballs whatever over their heads so they fear andor are amazed by you
this becomes very tedious
it takes ages to gain the influence you need and the process to gain it is not very funalas i wanted so much to love this game but its just too repetitive and slowblack and white is a very appropriate name for this game
some parts are really good then they become repetitive and boring and you soon realize that you just wasted your time
i usually dont rate games low so when i do it says something about the game
i am almost mad at gamespot and other review sites for once for giving a gamethat didnt deserve itsuch a high score
if you want to get a couple hours of fun out of a game then go ahead and buy this but i would advise you save your money and go buy a better gamethe gameplay for this game is fun for around  hours then you get to the rd  leveloh and just so you know there are only  levels in the entire gamethe game breaks down
they take away your pet who may i say is pretty stupid and just copies what you are doing albeit in a very inconsistent manner and half the time just ends up doing more harm than good
once your pet is taken away and you start with such a small village it is pitiful you then come to realize how much time of your life you just wasted
the villagers in this game are mindless they cant even make babies without you telling them to and when you do they always over breed
also it is almost impossible to be a good god in this game my people would always keep dying and they were too stupid to even farm right
the list of annoyances goes on this is a lame attempt at being an rts and it ends up falling flat on its facethe graphics for the time were good though the people in the game did look slightly odd
also i dont know if it was my computer or the game when you zoom into things like mountains they start to mold and change shape as you get closer a very ugly effect that i never got used to
other than that most of the spells worked fine and looked pretty good though nothing was spectacular it was solid nonethelessthe sound in this game is okay though the first time one of your villagers die and you hear the deeeaaatthhh voice it will take you a while to figure out what it is trying to tell you or whether it is another god speaking which would make it much more creepy
the sounds for the people are really annoying and i would rather have text than hear them talk wait till you hear or dont hear the fake irish accents they are a pain as is the rest of the voiceover
other than that the sound is solid with the different spells having nice sounds to them from the rain to the fireball that help differentiate one from the otheroverall this game will not give you any lasting value unless you find this sort of cheap imitation of the rts formulawith a tacked on pet simulatorenjoyable then you might have some fun
lionhead is a company that promises and doesnt deliver i hope in their next outings that they learn to make a great game then praise iti was all for this game
i was convinced that black and white was not going to be the next daikatana
no i didnt want to believe that
but it is true
black and white is an overhyped game
it was in development for about three years and gaming magazines and such labeled this game as something revolutionary
well black and white may be that but did ea have to make it so boringthe chance to play god should have been fun
in fact the opening moments of the game are the best
my two stars goes to the absolutley fantastic opening sequence of stunning visuals and graphics
and the music that plays really pumps me up for what i thought would be a special game
alas this was not to be
after i choose my creature the game really slows down the point of bordom
you make choices in the form of quotsilver scrollsquot
these are quests that happen on the little island your on
this is where the game lost meas for the controls i think the folks at ea made them a little to complicated than it needed to be
this to me was the most frustrating part of the whole black and white experiance
if you cant have good control using the mouse with a game then in my opinion that game just cannot be funyes this game is original but i think some people will be bored
if you want to play god i think the sims is a far superior game not to mention funthis game recieved a colossal amount of hype and from all the hyperbole was destined to be as large of a step forward in gaming as populous also created by peter molyneauxinstead we have an orangutan flinging feces while peasants starve at the temple because you forgot to dump grain every  secondsi am a huge fan of openarchitecture games
i am very excited about ai in gaming on a philosophical level
i was profoundly disappointedit is true my animal learned
and my animal seemed to think
but and this is the crux of it my animal was extremely boringcity maintenance was the essence of tedium
picking up trees one by one and placing them into the lumber depot  not fun
teaching my pet to do this for me  not fun
fighting other creatures  not funadditionally encountering the level that reverese all the training you have done to your creature  wiping it off my computer
i have heard that there was a patch to remedy that particular insult to injury but i do not care
my creature was already damaged goodsso
if you have a friend who wants to hand you a copy for free give it a shot
sometimes your pet will be interesting
some of the spells are pretty
but honestly this is not worth purchasingshort and simple folks  its a nice experiment a nice buncha folks tossing their creative effluvia into the gaming market but it just doesnt cut the mustard  far from being the ultimate quotgod gamequot its a standard rts paininthe arse with your good guys always wailing for stuff you cannot provide and quotbadguyquot vilages that you have to provide these same commidities to in order to impress and in turn make quotgood villagesquot
the documentation is almost comically inept and insufficient the system requirements for optimal play are absurd they say they created the game on  mhz comps but i seriously doubt it and in the end you cant help but feel let downits a great step in the right direction but there are better games out today that make use of the full d format and are far more entertaining and systemfriendlybuy it if you want a piece of gaming history a relic a laughable trinket that was left by the wayside during a pivotal epoch in game development
on the other hand if you want something fun there are dozens of titles that will fulfill your needs and not leave your system frozen and your mind numb with boredominnovation will only carry you so far peter m  ya gotta do something with itvery very interesting idea and one of the buggiest games ive ever played
the autosave feature is necessary because of all of the crashes but after youve been playing awhile the autosave can take up to several minutes per save which can be very annoying when you are right in the middle of something interesting and then bang autosave go take a nap and come back
after looking at lionheads site on this software and seeing some of their comments about quality assurance ie they basically seem to think that it wouldnt be necessary if ea didnt make them do it i know that i will not be paying full price for any more lionhead games until they fire whoever is in charge of qa and actually put in place a real qa process
the idea is very interesting and thats why they get some points for originality or at least an original spin on the populas model of games
but they really need a debugger
quite frankly id be happy to play a fun game with less then state of the art technology if it is stable and fun
bells and whistles are great but im looking to have fun not get frustrated
also the micromanagement required to keep your people alive is very excessive
it takes alot away from the fun of the game
buy the longest journey instead if you are looking for a great stable and visually appealing game at an excellent pricethis game takes a long time
a very long time
for example each time you start a new game you must go through a tutorial that if you speed through it will take you no less than  minutes
teaching your pet will take longer and your pet will at any given moment learn a trick that you had no intention of it learning
if you were to have two games one for a good pet and one for a bad one
it would take you two hours at least of straight playing to get to the nd level
i commend the advanced ai and the incredible graphics but the unbearably tedious gameplay makes this game not worth the money as soon as you decide that the time it takes to play the game is not worth the effortwhile black amp white contains some entertainment value it becomes tedious after awhile
it starts out fun but too much of your time is gradually wasted with micromanagement for your worshipers
the ai creatures are very cool however they really do learn and are able of performing some neat tricks
however again too much time is spent teaching them basic actions that should have been a lot easier  hours of potty training is not really fun
additionally the game is too short if you want it to be
you can blaze through the included scenarios fairly quickly if you put your mind to it
while playing with the creatures is indeed fun the game bogs down too much in micromanagement details that should have been dumped in favor of more fun gameplayenough has already been said of the creature avatars in this game
their ai is fantastic and they are truly fun to play with
once past that however one realizes that there isnt much else to this game
movement is awkward and difficult the cities are unmanageable the citizens whine constantly and irritatingly about things that they should be taking care of themselves and the missions are poorly designed
one mission simply requires you to follow a monk to his secret prayer spot by staying behind him as he walks
this is a mission that seems desinged to capitalize on the challenge presented by the horrifically innacurrate movement controls
in another mission some of your people are kidnapped by barbarians who demand animals as a ransom so they can start a circus 
and where does one find folk with the unmitigated gall to make ransom demands to a very visible deity and not expect to be smited for it
yet another mission has a pied piper figure leading away the village children
for some undisclosed reason you cant simply pick this problem person up and toss him far out to sea you have to have your creature capture him
great ideas poor execution
but did i mention that the creatures are funi enjoy animals and this game makes great use of themhowever i have found this game to be a bit lacking in the entertainment department and the creatures in the beginning are quite strange to say the least a cow
the controls are also very frustrating i wish they were more like the sims or zoo tycoon which are similar executionwise to this gamei want to like this but im sorry ea games i just cantblack amp white in theory sounds like a really fun game and for some i guess it is
i found the game so tedius repititious and devoid of fun that i never even bothered to finish the first level
the idea of the creature is interesting and the ai on it is impressive but that in itself could not hold the game together
the controls are awful
it is interesting that the developers spent so much time on the quotfeelquot of the game and making it so it was like no other that it seems that they didnt stop to think at the cumbersomeness an impracticality of the vast array of controls
another factor to this game is that if you are going to stick it out and play the entire thing you will definately need time for it takes for what seems an eternity to complete some of the tasks of the game
all in all this game was not for me but i could see the ultimate attraction and some people who are willing to stick it out might enjoy iti got to see peter molyneux demonstrate and explain black and white in person at mit in february of  i was intrigued by the concept and what i saw looked great so ive had nothing but positive vibes toward the game and snapped it up the day it came out
however ive got to be honest this game isnt for everybody
this is the first god or sim type game ive actually ever owned so perhaps if youre more inclined or experienced with this type of game you might enjoy it more than i did
however as an action and strategy gamer i thought i was going to collapse across my desk and cry tears of boredomgiving bampw its due you need only read the other reviews here
yes these graphics are amazing as good as anything out there
the ai is at a whole new level and there are things going on here that have never been seen before and it makes my head spin to think of how on earth they could have programmed them like the gesturerecognition interface or the intriguing learning ability of the creatures
this is no doubt an amazing piece of art and technologythat having been said is it any fun to actually play
for me im afraid not
the game very quickly degenerates into an endless cycle of repetitive actions like moving trees and villagers around all in the name of expanding your influence to encompass other villages at which point you have even more trees and villagers to move around
add to this your basic lack of story do this and this and this to defeat the bad guy
or characters and what you have is pretty much a colossal bore in the opinion of this gamer
its far less clash of the titans than it is competition of the woodstackers
the micromanagement that you have to perform and the complete lack of functions interface or information to make it any more reasonable is just out of control
literally
there are parts in the game where you cant even access the basic functions of saving and loading because those are in your temple and sometimes you dont have a temple yet
and this goes on for ever like hours and hours and hours
i read one forum post from an enthusiast who had spent he said about  hours of doing tasks like this to get through a level
and id have to say embarassingly my own experience is similar
he didnt spend  hours because he was a bad player he spent  hours because the game is really that slowthe whole tamagotchimeetskingkong aspect of the game the creature is an interesting idea but ultimately fails to deliver
the creature becomes yet another thing thats only partially under your control and which the game doesnt give you the tools to manage
classic example the creature eats one of your villagers
this is generally a bad thing because you need those villagers to increase your influence so youd want to punish the creature so that the behavior doesnt happen again
however the game never says quotyour creature just chewed up a villagerquot instead it says quotyour creature will eat that sort of thing more oftenquot oh really
what sort of thing
and unless you were ignoring the other twenty things that need doing and happened to be zoomed in close enough to actually identify what the creature was eating guess what
your creature goes on scarfing up villagers
you get labelled by the game as siding with evil and you suck and none of it was your fault
considering that there are only about ten possible things that the creature can eat including his own poop youd think that the game itself would be a little more informative or warn you before it was about to happenunfortunately the game is just full of deliberate yet bad design decisions like this
youre informed of things happening only after its too late to do anything about it
the concept that there is no interface just a hand sounds good on paper but is lousy in practice depriving you of control and information
its ridiculous that you have to move the camera for miles over to the correct place on the map and then hold the hand over the right building for a few seconds just to get the one piece of information that you want
couldnt we have put that on the screen
it seems like some of the fixes to make this such a better game are entirely obvious but were deliberately ignored
even the games manual is quite vague and seems to assume that the reader is already familiar with this kind of game and omits a great deal of information that youd have to be blind lucky to figure outadditionally any claims that the game is some kind of psychological tool or that your creature comes out as a reflection of your personality are just silly
the game basically makes its own call as to whats good and whats evil and your own intentions arent figured in at all
in some cases even your actions dont seem to be figured in to that judgment
theres some hype that this is a game of moral and ethical choices and that is just not so
this game may be a first step in that direction but this is simply a game of micromanagement in some senses its almost kind to call it a game periodto wrap up on the technical end i had no problems with this game on a ghz piii with mb ram and a mb geforce
it has crashed once while i was multitasking but other than that has been flawless with some frame drop in extreme camera moves but overall seems well above fpsanyway definitely put some thought in before diving in to black and white
its an interesting piece but its not for everybodyfor adults the james perkins review of black and white nails this game
read it then skip purchasing this game
i was very excited about getting it after readingbelieving the hype
the creature and its quotleashesquot drove me insane and detracted from the small amount of entertainment i had begun having from solving the puzzles in the game
maneuvering is imho counterintuitive especially which way the pov revolves based on the sliding of the mouse
and the forced tutorial is mindnumbing
the only worse quotforcedquot passage in a game is the part of nolf where you have to ask the fat industrialist all of those inane questionsthe game black and white has some good ideas such as being god and being able to control what was going on but it did not meet up to the expectations
i find it really difficult to get the hang of the mouse controls and at times it is extremely frustrating
i agree with one of the other comments made you are following a story
you never are really in control
i find this game disappointing and i suggest looking else where for a game in which you want controli purchased black and white on the advice of a friend and was told about the fun aspects of training a pet
after playing for several hours i can honestly say i was underwhelmedwhile the games graphics were good and i had fun for about an hour playing around with my pet and the world there was little to keep my interest
i quickly moved onto other games and forget that i had purchased black and white
for me there was little substance and little to get me hookedwhile i do not deny that there is a market for games like black and white i do believe that this market demands more challenging and compelling productsif you make it past an hour tasks become tedious lifeless and dullwhile the thought of playing a psychopathic twisted horror version of alice in wonderland appealed to me at first it quickly became tiresome
surely the original story is twisted and psychopathic enough and this version tries very hard to disturb players but its plot just goes nowherewhen i loaded up this game i expected some sort of stunning adventure only to be greeted by what seemed to be a firstperson action game such as thief or unrealbut noit wasnt that either
it was rd person in the style of tomb raideras i started meeting npcs i realized where ive seen this interface beforegames like banjo kazooie spyro the dragon zelda and other n and playstation platform adventure gameswhich is just what alice isa spooky platform gameplatform games being what they are they are obsessed with coming up the most difficult way for the player to jump from point a to point b so that you can then get on with the story
after the rd time of falling off the checkerboard you finally  make it and are allowed to proceed with the story
but what story
there isnt a very strong one
you are just lead by the nose and it isnt even very interesting
just lots of fighting cards and flying spectre thingsi must admit this game is indeed visually stunning
i absolutely love the cheshire cat
he floats in and ouut of the game quite eerily and his voice is perfect
the scenery and odd backgrounds of vortexes huge stacks of books and such are used to try and make the player a bit uncomfortable or spooked and yes they do their jobbut in the process though we are not given anything interesting or challenging to do except for jumping from point a to point b  timesi was very disappointed with the quotpuzzlesquot presented
nothing was really a challenge but merely an entrance to the next test of patienceto give the game credit the graphics are impeccable the gameplay running jumping etc is flawless and easy to pick up and the mechanics of the game flow very smoothly
its just a pity that the creator saved all the fun for himselfunrealized
excellent idea excellent graphics completely destroyed by endless physical puzzles unrelated to the game itself
could have been fantastic ended up frustratingits fair to make a direct comparison to live  and the conclusion is that live  is a much better game
live  suffers from a lack of smooth and intuitive gameplay that seemed to come so naturally with live  the cutaway shots are very realistic and awesome looking but the regular viewpoint of the gameplay looks a step below in my opinion of live  however easports easily still produces the best nba simulation on the market
while live  is a notch below   was one of the best sports games ever and would be hard to duplicate its success
so buy  for the roster updates but dont expect to be blown awaythe basic idea is cool the point being that you are freelancing for some criminal organization running contraband across the border while competing against cops and other organizations
its finally something new to the basic speedingcarracing genre i love so muchthe problem is that all the skills ive developed in other racing games are pointless hereyou start with a selection of two cars a big heavy suv that can take a little more damage and a cage buggy dragster type thing
well in one stage you have to show off your driving skills no pickups or dropoffs of contraband by beating the other crime orgs and i was unable to do it in the fast carso i used the slow heavy one and finally won
time and again the heavier car is as fast if not fasterthe cops always catch up to you too
im quite good at outbraking and handbreak cornering yet the cops in their chevy tahoes are able to keep up with me even while driving a dragsterthe inability to outdrive the competition coupled with a a fairly boring set of tasks makes this a great game to rent for the weekend but not to ownwhen i first got my ps  during its early weks of release  i got this game with it
the second i started playing it i wasnt taken away by the graphics much or the gameplay
i find the story hard and boring as well as the rest of the game
very boring and very stupid game right here
i still have it but it also has a few layers of dust on it
skip this oneif you are looking for a good racing game look somewhere else
this game has great graphics but the cars control like shopping carts
if you are looking for a game that is essentially the same thing but good go buy midtown madness  otherwise all you racing fans better wait for gran turismo this game is awful
i like racers but what the heck is this
this game has you racing against people that are either very stupid or superhuman you are not equally matched against anyone
ps
okay graphics are the only plusgraphic wise this game is better than goldeneye but when it comes to gameplay this game falls short
i thought it was cool that the characters now speak but still their mouths dont move
the biggest loss is that there are no more explosives or cool guns
where are the rcps and remote mines
if youre like me and love to fill your enemies with hot lead or blow things up you probobly wont enjoy this game as much as goldeneye
finally theres the multiplayer wich is good but very cheesythis game has got great graphics even better than the previous bond  goldeneye
i loved goldeneye that was a great game butthe very detailed graphics have slowed down the game
compaired to goldeneye this game runs very slow
the controls are also different
the game play in this new bond compaired to the older one goldeneye is just terribleif you have to choose between the new one and goldeneye buy goldeneye
if your looking for an awsome second bond for the nintendo  your going to have to wait
unless you like graphics over game control dont buy this gameif only rare made this game maybe it would of been better
i cant even compare this game to goldeneye or perfect dark
here are the reasons why i dont like this game when you start a level you have to wait   seconds for a level to load which is really annoying
you have to use a controller pack so without that the game is worthless i think ea really wants your money the game doesnt even have half of the levels goldeneye or pd has
you dont have any enegry and you get killed quick
you cant blow up anything like you can in goldeneyeso compared to goldeneye id skip this gamewell to start off the graphics are terrible
there so boxy and have no detail whatsover even when i run it on the highest resolution
the controls are nice but the gameplay sux
i want to just wanted to drive and mess around in the city but right when i push the gas the cop gets on me for no reason which gets really annoying after about seconds
and the street lights dont work correctly when the light turns green the cars dont always go
if you like games that are boring and full of many errors that could have been easily avoided then i guess you like this gamethis joystick was my last attempt at trying to buy a forcefeedback joystick
without getting too wordy there is just far too much deadspace in the joysticks center
even spending extensive amounts of time trying to calibrate with the joysticks calibration utility and manually adjusting the calibration with a directx calibrator it was still impossible to get a true centerunfortunately thats only the first problem one is likely to come across
the gyro motors used to center and move the joystick are very poor
i found that after as little as  month of sporadic use the twist function on the joystick failed to work properly
after dismantling the joystick i found that the joystick was just shoddily constructed of poor componentsi wouldnt recommend this joystick for even the most casual of gamers
force feedback really really isnt worth it
very few computer games are even programmed with force feedback in mind
i recommend going with a more reliable springbased joystick such as the saitek cyborg evoi usually like logitech products which is why im amazed they would actually put their name on this garbage
to start with  out of the  push buttons have intermittent faults while pressing down continuously
the  way directional hat has a hard time detecting presses to the right
the left joystick looses its calibration after about twenty to forty five minutes of game play
after that it simply will not go to the right
since it was decided that this stick was above mere calibration none was included
the only way to resolve the problem is to reboot the computer when this happens
a real mood killer while playing  any game
im a avid gamer and have other game pads wheels and sticks so no its not the computer or usb port
they all work fine i just thought this one would be better
next time ill think a little harder if it says logitech on iti believe this is not as good as compared to the sidewinder that microsoft makes
it is a very clumsy controller
it may look like a dual shock playstation controller but by no means does it perform up to the standards of the playstation controller
i got it forxand i sold it already for x 
i tried the sidewinder and thought it was a better controller and as the old saying goes  you get what you pay for stiff clicky small inset buttons
nothing like a pspsx pads nice buttons badly placed throttle
the shoulder buttons which are the clickiest of them all are big but if youre like me your pointer fingers tend to travel up while using the shoulder buttons
and that makes for a badly placed throttle above the right shoulder button sticks will eventually break off
i got a free replacement lwmrp but im afraid to use it because i know that one will break as well
i suggested to them that they use sturdy metal sticks if theyre going to insist on the skinny necks of the sticks but they havent modified it yet stiff dpadpov pad
and its hard to navigate with it as well since you cant feel the direction without looking down to see if youre pressing it right inset mode and rumble buttons hard to press in sometimestwo great things
the handles and rumble feature
very comfortable grips and very solid rumble featuresnot quite as good as i remembered playing it
the gameplay could use alot of work
nowhere near as good as the first gamenormally im all for explosive combat situations
i bought this game thinking to myself it would be an excellent addition to the ps i was expecting vigilante  just with tanks
excitement
its got to be hiding in there somewhere but i havent seen it yet
the graphics are ok but nothing mindnumbing
the gameplay is anything but fastpaced
the areas are dull the control is obnoxious
the only reason it earned two stars is that it is sorta fun in multiplayer mode if you dont mind the flatterrain and the dull weapons
rent it or better yet just play v on the n and forget this even existsthis game really does stink ive tried on easy and used the cheat menu and still lost
its confusing what to do and the graphics make it more confusing
if you want to get this game you better be a rocket scientest to figure out its graphics and the way of trade
you have to get in war to get land and hope the people will be happy with you by the time your finished controls stink dont use your mouse use your up down left right on the keyboard to move your people the mouse just skrews up everything
and even if you try everything you can either you lose or you have to use cheats and still your called worthless at the end a bad game to play
with its simple plan they could get the graphics at least good as the sims and they could have made the skills easier to understand its all confusing to megraphicsfungameplaysoundoveralli will give credit where its due this game does have good graphics and a lot of options
but thats about it
i was so dissapointed when i got this game home after having heard that it was quotthe greatest football game everquot and so on
this game is such a waste of time
if this is the best that the playstation has to offer then were in trouble
the ai is absurd to say the least
the dumbest plays happen and succede for no reason while simple passes often fly half way across the screen from where theyre supposed to
the computer constantly makes false calls that dont even have anything to do with the play
the play editor is complete garbage
if you dont believe me just make up a play and try it in the game
the commentary makes me want to listen to chalk grating against a board rather than the stupid things they keep saying over and over and over again
the dificulty setting is useless too
the game is the same difficulty no matter where you set it the only difference how many points you and the computer will score
i could go on for a long time talking about how poor this game is but im going to stop and actually go trade it in at eb now instead
maybe ill get a worthwhile game instead or maybe ill just sit around and watch the grass grow
that would probably be just as entertainingokay seriously there needs to be some straightening out herelet me get one thing out of the way first i love this series
the first game blew me away when i played it and i cant even play it now without remembering just about everything that happened in sequence
the second game had a nice narrative but fell far short from the original
i love it but it deserves the following spanking
allow me to explain
a few major spoilers ahead
battle system this is the one big fat pound gorilla in the elevator for this game
seriously are you people really so ecstatic that its realtime
parasite eve was an rpg and a damned good one at that this is an actionhorror survival game with some amount of rpg thrown in just enough to earn the genre title for most
its basically resident evil minus the zombies
thats it
the targeting is terrible at all times the camera angles make it nigh impossible to target the appropriate thing that you want dead and well its way too easy
once youve pointed at the thing you just shoot it
bam
dead
next one
i died maybe four times total two of those were near the end of the game and one was from that godsforsaken manfaced horse thing
in fact i wouldnt even call this an rpg its just a runofthemill survival horror with less horror and more survival  and even thats iffy because i was only truly afraid maybe once
story its your atypical big bad corporation makes things worse scenario thats been beaten to death before this game and has been beaten to death since
the only shining moments in this game are the boss battles which provide just a little more difficulty than the normal fights and if youre a total perv the shower scene admit it you whacked off to that too when you were that age
characters aya and eve are the only two that stand out in this game with aya winning the race by a mile
still i would love to see how eve turns out in the third birthday but i doubt theyll even add her in since she was sorta a sideeffect in this game as well
everyone else is for the lack of no better words forgettable
i dont even remember what the guntoting rednecks name was
kyle was wooden would only show up once in a while and barely did much of anything to advance the plot
overall this game was just plain forgettable
the combat only works when you beat it the story is pretty lame and the characters are boring
worst of all theres still no voiceacting two lines
they were freeze and hmm
thats not voice acting
 still very little background on aya beyond the she was in a car accident and got an implanted eye from her sister who was infected with the rage monkey virus or whatever and now she can use magical powers that are vaguely explained which were awakened during the events of the first game and someone still needs to give aya some more personalityokay
i think im done
now i need to go play the first game so i can remember what it was like
deep sighok  sure its a new year for eas hockey games but basically its the same game as last seasons effort
it plays the same looks similiar if not worse sounds the same even scoring goals on a regular basis is the samethe good
its hockey
it has some good options like the momentum meter big shot big check new nhl challenge to boost your created players attributes and my favorite the franchise mode for season playthe bad
just about everything else i didnt mention that was good
sounds silly right
well theres not really much of that quotinbetweenquot stuff to like or dislike in nhl   a lot of the new options are overhyped
take the momentum meter for example
sure its a great and realistic option but with the terrible gameplay it doesnt do much but make the crowd loudernot to mention the extremely annoying playbyplay guys talking about momentum oh how annoying it is
i mentioned bad game play
you bet
control is flimzy at best
at times ill stop my player and try to reverse my direction to only not be able to do just thatyou just cant go the opposite direction sometimeswhy
players dont move like you want them to
is it skating physics that are hampering the controls
no
its poor programming
if your players isnt in a straight line of the puck you cant get gain control of it without some major problems anyone whos chased an iced puck to only have the cpu get it first because of this knows exactly what im talking about
fighting looks silly in this gamenuff said about that
the other major flaw is the goalies
what the heck happened here
goalie animation is so slow it doesnt match the actual speed of the game
its so bad crossice onetimers from the red line will beat nearly any goalie
going in on a breakaway
lefthanded shooters just need to be slightly leftcenter to the goal to score before you reach the crease just tap the shotbutton when slightly left center to the opposing goaliereverse this if its a righthanded shooter
is it that simple
you bet
playing anything but  minute periods can result in a footballlike score
goalie animation need serious improvingjust watch a goalie make a sprawling save attempt
it takes so long for him to get back up a goal is sure to be scored quothes fallen and cant get upquotto me this game was more frustrating than fun
i like realismthis one has some but not enough
it has good options but not done correctly
it has the best sound by far than any hockey game out there but thats it
i think ea concentrated on the ps version of nhl  because this isnt really a new game from last yearjust a new title
check out my review of nhl faceoff  to compare this years hockey titles on the psdo you remember the sega genesis
do you remember how ea treated the final few iterations of its hallmark sports titles on the genesis
college football  and  were practically identical nhl    were practically identical nba live    were practically identical
welcome to the waning days of sonys playstation and we have the same situation
ea rehashing previous versions of games with a few pointless afterthoughts thrown in so people dont accuse them of outright larcenynhl  though probably the best psx hockey game was far from perfect
annoying goalie ai meant great shots were deflected yet offbalance blind backhand shots from the blue line went in
the game play was much too fast to be anywhere near realistic and the addition of the quotmug shotquot triangle button cross check was among the worst sportsgame decisions ever made making for constant ridiculous gooncentric gameplaywell guess what
its all back
a carboncopy with updated rosters and a simple binary number change  to 
so if shelling out  bones for what essentially equals a can of paint is your idea of money well spent then fire up the oneclick
otherwise send ea some nice hatemail and save your pennies for nhl  on the almighty playstation what a tragedy this is
it has almost everything going for it
medal of honor underground sports the best sounds in any game ive ever heard
the ambiant noise in the background is just spooky
sometimes i cant tell if those footsteps im hearing is just part of the track playing or if i have woken up a guard which means they have seamlessly instilled a sense of danger just by their background music
also i like the fact that you are using authentic weapons
none of this quotalien lazer gunquot crap
the graphics would be passable for the game but this is where we start running into problemsfor one thing you can wake up a guard halfway across the level run all the way back to the starting point and have him standing miles away from you emptying clip after clip of ammunition into the walls
and the worst part is a lot of these bullets due to the horrible clipping problems in this game pass right through said walls and hit you
not only this but you can expect to take a ton of hits in this game
true health packs are plentiful but doesnt that cut down on the realism
i want a game where my character is somewhat human
any real person could not take  or more bullets to put down
neither could their opponents
in fact those nazis must have undergone some kind of genetic splicing as they all are some of the best crackshots i have ever seen
i could be standing at one end of a  yard bridge as i have in one of the later levels waiting to pick someone off when all of a sudden bullets start whizzing out of the darkness right at my head
this is absolutely inexcusable
my enemies should have the same field of vision as me
and maybe if it isnt too much to ask some of their shots could miss their target once in a whileit saddens me that one of the greatest attempts at a realistic war game ends up being such a flop
i refuse to even look at the first game despite the rave reviews
this is the closest i have ever come to breaking my ps controller
back slowly away from this oneas a fan of wcw mayham i expected great things from its sequel wcw backstage assault but i was in for a different kind of game
first of this game doesnt have a wrestling ring and no i am not joking by the way either
instead all of the action in the squared circle doesnt take place in the ring at all it takes place in the backstage areas
hench the name backstage assault for this wcw game
i wonder why ea decided to remove the ring because without the ring it just a hardcore anything goes wrestling game
the graphics are pretty bad i mean wcw mayham had better graphics and the wrestler sprints were huge and detailed compared to this gamee were the character models like bad
you have a huge roster of wrestlers to choose from as well as hidden wrestlers
you get to go on a career mode where you can win the wcw heavyweight belt wcw hardcore and wcw united states belts onlyi think the wcw  tv belt isnt in the game
you only get to fight one on one so that just sucks because you cant have  people play with you since its only a two player game
it lacks game modes like wwf smackdown
series which is way better and funner
ea tried something different just failed with the game and should of really just stuck with wcw mayhams formula insteadi am a huge wcw fan and i am angry and sad because it doesnt come on any more
i love wcw mayhem by electronic arts and that was their first wrestling game and this is their second  but it is something that you dig out of a litter box
i dont like this game because there are only about four weapons laying around and when you use a weapon about three times it turns into dust and that makes it impossible to win a first blood match theyre nearly impossible to win with weapons anyways
also the backstage areas that you have to wrestle in are smaller than the wrestling ring itself
there are only about two moves that you can do besides punching and kicking and you have to win a match which is almost impossible to unlock a new move
it is also very confusing to even start a match on this game
the graphics would look better if you cracked the television screen with a hammer
wcw nitro is better than this game
any wrestling game even on atari if they have a wrestling game for it is better than wcw backstage assault
the only thing this game is good for is to keep a fire burning for a couple of extra minuteswhen purchasing the game i heard all the decent to horrible reviewes it received but i still purchased it
dont make the same mistake i did xsquad is a truly bad game which makes you second guess pss capabilities at least it did for meanother review to a average game
well i need to put my opinion to it
pretty good for a early ps game but then i didnt hear about ps until  this game came out  the charecters are godawful
they say affirimitive  times before doing something
the voice acting sounds like they are reading from cue cards
syphon filter  is a lot better than this game and its on ps
ea couldve done so much better
the ai
is pathetic
not much stealth ither
the graphics gameplay and choosing your weapons through points save this from a i consider myself an average video gamer no hardcore by any means
for some reason i found this game incredibly hard to play
the game itself is a very beautiful game
graphics are top notch
but like everyone else who commented on this game thats about it
in the first week that i played this first day just watching the history part i was rather confused that all i did was keep hitting the x button
i couldnt even tell if i actually won the battles or if i lost them
i even bought the matching guide for it but even the guide was confusingas an average gamer this is a purchase i regretif your a stratagy lover and have patience of steel perhaps you will like this game
it has alot of history to it if your looking for a social studies lessen and decent graphics but other than thatwellthats about it for this game theres not to much more i can say about itgraphically this is a nice game but the gameplay becomes repetitive and boring
the cutscenes while visually impressive become annoying very quickly
also winning battles is far too easy and there is little story line in the gamethis isnt really a fun game it is basically a look at how great the ps graphics are for one of the first games i think its ok but still thsi game isnt really worth the money get dynasty warriorsif it werent for the fact that you just dont get that much in return for the amount of time you spend setting the game up
the creator of the game spends a majority of the first  hours of quotgame playquot giving you an indepth look at japanese history and whereas this is interesting and all its not what i bought the game fori was looking for the old time fun of quotnobunagas ambitionquot sp
for the original nintendo
i used to spend hours tinkering with that game playing and replaying different scenarios
this game doesnt give you the option of deciding which battles to fight
it just takes you to the next one and assumes thats where you want to gothe animations are
good
not great certainly not above the standard ive been seeing in other ps games
the real drawback to the animations is that you get the same ones every time
if you fire a cannonade  times you sit throught the same animation  times and you cant stop it once it starts
if your cavalry charges  times you sit through the same animation  times
on the plus side  the whole game is attractive with more detail per character storywise than many ive seen
and you do get a massive  amount of history in the game like it or not not to mention a terrific glossary of terms and additional historical materials on the diskid have given this game  or even  stars if it had given more to me
unfortunately more money and effort was spent on the animations than the storyline and playability
dont get me wrong i love games that require a high degree of concentration but this just got boring after a short amount of time
anyone have a copy of nobunagas ambitioni went out and rented this after reading reviews saying that it has great visuals and i agree
it makes full use of its dvdformat
the cutscenes are great the gameplay however isnt
if youve done one level youve done them all
each one is the same thing get your army beat up this guy and your done
you get very few  choices concerning what kind of troops and it got very repetitive after the first level
i think it could really have been a great game if they hadnt spent so much time on the graphics
overall not a very good game i found the cutscenes to be better than the game itself
i really reccomend not buying this game id wait until they come out with more dvd format gamesthis game wouldnt play in my ps
i tried it on  different systems and it skipped on all of them
maybe it was the seller i dont know but i never got a chance to experience this gamei hope nba games get better because this is a disappointment
the game is just like ps counterpart with slightly better graphics
i bought this game because i wanted a basketball game and that out of all the ones coming out this is the better one
why couldnt ea do the same for bball like they did for football amp snowboardmo money waisted  mo money waisted mo money waisted mo money waisted  mo money waisted mo money waisted
for all old school nbalive heads you got what you wanted your old game back again with a slight facelift
for a system with a bits you would think that ea
could have improved the graphics a lot with all the time they had to work on it
game play has not change at all and this disappoints me the most about this game
the need for a quotdunkquot button is ridiculous
why cant you just go to the whole and score according to their skill
the only change thats noticed in the graphics is on the action replay
the only props im given for this game is the cross over dribble sega could have done better
over all the nbak is a much much better game
if youre able to put these  games nbalive amp nbak side by side you noticed right off that sega spent more time in the designed roomthe only reason why i purchased ps over the dreamcast is because ea sports only writes games for playstation
and i usually love ea sports games but this game is just horrible
i cannot believe that the same company that developed madden would associate their name with this productfirst the positives 
as usual the graphics are pretty good and 
the stadiums are customed to the team
the game play is challenging which could make for fun games
the oneonone mode is great and features many of the all time greatsnow the negatives  
i dont believe there is no franchise mode
that is just a terrible decision not to include the franchise option
the court is too small whenever you spin or do a cross over move you go out of bounds or nearly go out of bounds
and on that note the game play is not very realistic
as just stated the cross over and spin moves are too wide
also in the post you cant back anyone down they dont move and the post moves are not very good no drop step
the shooting is terrible although in the  version it was too easy to hit a shot in this version of the game it is way too difficult
jump shots from  feet nearly never go in
also it is too difficult to get a rebound
your player can be right next to the ball and not grab it while the computers men all converge on the ball
sometimes the game does not want to let you dunk when you have an open lane to the basket or on a fast break
you stop and take a short jump shot and half the time you miss
the menu operations are completely different than other ea sports games they need some uniformityi recommend that you do not purchase this game
ea sports should be ashamed of this game and should go back to the drawing boardthis is a terrible game not what i expected for a ps game made by one of the better known gaming companies ea sports
the graphics are ok sometimes some of the players look the  same not to realistic imho
the worst part of it is the gameplaythey seem unresponsive at times and takes awhile getting used to that is if you dont quit before that i gave nba k a   stars for dc but after playing nba live its a  
save your money and cross your fingers for next years release or if you have a dc pick up nba k
bottom line nba live is an air ball
grade d gamer is outi decided to rent this game upon discovering kiss would hardly be in itwell i must say with other dc shooters out there kiss psycho circus really doesnt give you a single reason to buy it above the restit has the basic search for key shoot a stupid looking enemy wheres a bigger gun element youd expect and cant pull it off that welli dont know why but i really wasnt feeling the level design of this gamewhy cant i run around in an abondoned carnival blasting carniesthat wouldve been coolin its defense it does have some pretty impressive visuals and some cool looking baddies for you to hack up but since the gameplay sort of fails so does this gametheres no internet multiplayer that didnt bother me at all reallybut what did was the fact that there is no multiplayer of any kindthats right no deathmatchas it stands this game warrants a rent if it looks attractive to you but theres better out therealone in the dark  the new nightmare is actually only rated so low because of how amazingly similar it is to capcoms classic resident evil   not just a slight similarity either but rather strikingly identical
lets see a man and woman both forced into a creepy location
check
they both discover unusual and unexplainable monsters
check
they both communicate through a radio
check
they both go around searching for clues to understand the oddness around them
check
preset camera angles that made the classic re series popular on the playstation
checkyou see this is basically a continuation of resident evil   maybe and this is perhaps a really big stretch this game would appeal to those who didnt think re was anything to write home about
however alone in the dark  the new nightmare is such a blatant imitation of what i consider the real thing that its hard for me to approach it with open arms and accept it knowing what resident evil  is a better accomplishmentas for the enemies the dogs look exactly like dobermans from the re series monsters that resemble the slowpaced movements of zombies from the re series that creep around hallway corners in a similar fashion and monsters that resemble drain deimos from you can probably guess by this point the re series
impossible to believe such a clear ripoff managed to make it to the store shelves
in a way the soundtrack resembles silent hill in the creepiness and even surpasses the resident evil series in the freakout department but otherwise just stick with resident evil  for the best survival horror experience
its like resident evil with way less action and more focus on the atmosphere and storylinei will admit that i had not played this format of a game before
however i find it extremely difficult and frustratingthe original alone in the dark game was truly innovative and set many technological landmarks for other pc games of the day
oh how far we have strayed
this game uses the nocturne engine and like every previous game that has used the nocturne engine the end result is washed out graphics horribly awkward camera angles bad movement control and the joy of having to fight offscreen creatures that you cant see unless you run to a different area
i can only imagine that the nocturne engine is inexpensive to licensejust a warning for those that arent familiar with the alone in the dark series that they may want to try the demo first
the reason being i tried the demo and have never been more unimpressed by a game hyped such as thisfans of the alone in the dark series might find the sequel entertaining but some of my gripes with the demo and keep in mind it was the demo so i cant give you an idea on the entire game but like i said the demo made me determined not to buy the game
 the perspective is constantly switched
in other words in one scene you are looking at the front of the character when he moves to another area zone that is downloaded you are looking at him from the side etc  each small area zone has to be downloaded and the viewing perspective constantly changes which is very annoying the mouse didnt work
at least on the demo
it was keyboard only great fx on the character but the scenery especially the pouring rain was terrible
it was a giant clash comparing this beautifully lifelike character with some aspects that looked like the old cga graphics the gameplay system was very cumbersome
it wasnt managed to give you a smooth flow when you are switching items etcwith lack of a better way to explain it the game reminded me of an s game
for instance the downloading of every small parcel of land zone as opposed to smooth flowing through the entire area like all games today
and as far as the horrorspooky theme it was very cheesy
i would recommend clive barkers undying as a game that is everything this one attempted to beam i the only fan of the first  games that doesnt like this one
cmon underneath the funny intro the vastly improved graphics and sound and the overall presentaition of the game is there really a game that lives up to the first 
i would have to say nothe graphics as good as they are are way too cartoony
the jokes aside from the intro are either not funny or are nonexistent
the puzzles are almost all really obscure
the plot is incredibly cliched save the governer  again
i cant help but feel that had this been released almost immediately after lechucks revenge with the same graphics and sound that it would be scorned apon compared to the other twogenerally i dont find this at all fun to play
adventure games are one of the few genres where older games are still good for the simple reason that they dont need superb graphics or the latest technology
they need good puzzles and a good plot
they need you to get engaged in the characters
just check out the first two games and ignore the lack of technology  they are much better
my favourite adventure game though would still have to be full throttle
now theres a gamei purchased this game after reading a recent article about the best games of the s
this may have been a great game then but it doesnt stand the test of time
it may be fun for those who played the game when it originally was released but it has little value for new gamersi picked this up in a bargain bin because i had heard great things about grim fandango now an admittedly older title
i had also played a demo of one of the monkey island games and found it hilarious
i greedily slapped down my ten bucks and looked forward to some funthe game is fun to listen to and watch
filled with yucks aplenty grim fandango is like participating directly in a wacky animated film
for this alone fandango earns high praise
as with the monkey island games the voice acting and humor is top notchsadly gameplay suffers
if you read through enough reviews here at amazon youll find that people like fandango simply for its humor and style most customers admit that they needed walkthroughts to get past the games frustrating puzzles
im a puzzle fan and i like a challenge but there were simply too many moments in fandango where the puzzles felt arbitrary
logic rarely led to a solution only trial and error did
for me this weighed heavilyand i mean heavilyagainst the game
humor and style huge plusses no doubt should still be secondary to gameplay or at least equal
with fandango gameplay seems to be a less important means towards creative and hilarious ends
youll need to decide if this is okay with you
for me it wasntfor music reviews visit nice game but i was expecting a lot more dont expect muchred faction is a futuristic first person shooter set in mars
you play parker a miner in mars who fight against his employers
the game loads data and runs great the graphics and sound are ok but the geomod technology is not as good as they said
the single player is very disappointing
it is a fairly long game but the gameplay is dull because of the poor level design dumb ai and nothing new
it is not very hard but the designers dont know where the player would run out of ammo or health
red faction is very disappointingproject igi is a cross between goldeneye metal gear solid and delta force
as an exsas ex joyrider called david llewelyn jones despite the name he doesnt appear to be welsh you run around a series of modern battlefields infiltrating installations avoiding cameras and shooting things
in very nice d with some huge landscapes that you can explore if you feel like it
like delta force its weighted towards action and although a few wellplaced shots finish off the bad guys you are slightly less mortal
nonetheless you can be stealthy and quite often its much easier to avoid tripping the alarms which you can turn off  best of all you can just shoot the cameras
the graphics are attractive if a little sparce
as in the song by the who you can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and some of the detail is superb  your weapons look and sound authentic the explosions and ricocheting bullets are alarming and you cant hide behind impenetrable cardboard boxes because they arent
after a while you notice that the graphics are sometimes quite spartan and although the textures are highquality the interiors are often extremely bland
as with delta force the bad guys seem to have built their bases from massproduced kits as individual buildings are copied and pasted verbatim from mission to mission with only the furniture moved around to differentiate
theres some excellent modern james bondesque music and the game itself is often extremely good fun  like delta force but done well
but not that well
the plot tries for a james bond ambience but even with only  missions our hero seems to spend a lot of time escaping being caught and escaping again
the voice acting is very bad too  our hero sounds like an enthusiastic primary school teacher whilst his lovely assistant anya has a california valleygirl accent that seems more playboy bunny than government employee
i kept expecting her to use the word doofus but she doesnt
meanwhile the supposedly eastern european guards shout hey you and stop in english
the morality seems a bit iffy too  youre basically a hired killer and the bad guys arent really bad guys theyre just guards in foreign but nonhostile military bases
its as if you were a french soldier set down in scotland shooting down scottish security guards
and yet these are minor things
there are three major points that bedevil it  you cant save during a mission at all the missions are highly linear and scripted in such a way that you absolutely have to play the mission several times over before you can complete it and its just not big enough
the decision not to include the ability to save a game is a brave one shared with aliens vs predator
the idea is to increase the tension by not allowing you to chicken out and hit f to quicksave as with most other firstperson shooters since doom its hard to remember nowadays but until doom action games rarely let you save
it doesnt really work in project igi  the size of some of the later missions coupled with the fact that death is sometimes instant and unexpected make it highly irritating
avp was eventually patched so that you could save a maximum of three times during a mission  a much better system
and the scripting is highly annoying
this is one of those games where you can explore an area and find it free of baddies but if you press a switch talk to somebody or step over an invisible boundary suddenly a truckfull of soldiers materialises from thin air
you can never really predict or guard against this and quite often the missions become memory tests
one mission in which you have to escort a russian businessman is particularly frustrating and more than once i felt like burning the cd and posting it back to eidos with a nasty letter
in general the bits where you have to escort people thankfully only twice does this horrible game element appear are dreadful  you have no way of knowing where they are and they usually just stand there waiting to be shot
and worst of all its too small
it has no fewer missions than hidden and dangerous but a handful of them are extremely easy and youll finish them in no time
there is absolutely no replay value either  the linear missions mean that once youve completed them theres nothing to see if you play them again
and theres no multiplayer option at all
fourteen missions and thats your lot
youll play it for two or three days get annoyed during the final immensely frustrating mission and never play it ever againthis game is different for a first person shooterquite a bit different concept that most games but is too difficult to controlalthough a decent fps it fails in comparison to the n titles that have dominated the console fps market goldeneye and perfect dark
dont expect too much and you wont be too disappointedthe control of this game is awful
graphics are average sound below average and did i mention the horrible contols
pass on this one and find a better fps there are several out theremaybe it is just me but i feel that wwf no mercy is the one that most appeals to a limited crowd
from what i see its either you enjoy wrestling and love this game or you hatecouldnt care less about wrestling and you dont
i happen to be in the latter category and so i feel that there is nothing about this game that i really enjoy
i really dont think there are anything in this game that would appeal to other nonwrestlingfans except for the fact that it is easy to pick up and play
being a nonwrestling fan i dont really understand what exactly the crowd meter thingy is for
you could be beating the life out of the opposing wrestler yet your relation with the crowd is relatively low
i highly doubt that any other nonwrestlingfans would know what it is eitherthat is not to say that there is nothing fun about this game
as i said the game is very easy to pick up and play
after a few rounds of button mashing you would be able to figure out that a is to grapple and do whatever other attacks you have and b is to just beat the living crud out of each and every one of your opponents
yet if you are not familiar with how to end a match then youll likely just attack for a while until your opponent gets seriously bloody
constantly pressing b just to turn your opponent into a bloody mess gets old if you keep on doing it for several minutes
and controlling characters on a semid environment just does not feel natural
sure i dont mind the fact that the game keeps you locked onto an opponent at all times but it is moving around that gets tediouswwf no mercy was probably the most realistic wrestling game back in  there are authentic entrances with authentic entrance music as well as authentic game modes
yet to be completely honest i dont really care
the graphics are more gritty and realistic than asmik ace and akis previous two wrestling games s wcwnwo revenge and s wwf wrestlemania  and the characters models dont look like faces painted on blobs like earler wrestling games
in other words they actually look like people this time around
however they still dont look very good
stephanie mcmahon looks like a zombie or somebody really ugly wearing a lot of makeup
crowds are no better than previous asmik aceaki wrestling games
they dont look like cardboard anymore but they are just really ugly really pixelated sprites instead
sound effects are a bit laughable
its just boom
kapam kapow
yeah
its not that i have anything against this game but i just dont find it that good
it still is the best of the asmik aceaki wrestling games
maybe i would appreciate it more if i actually watch wrestling
hey at least from the critical success it establishes the nintendo  as the premiere system for wrestling
that is something to be proud oflet me get to it  the wrestling engine player lineup and createawrestler are the most amazing things ive seen and are what make this game except for way or way because selecting which wrestler you are fightins is really annoying and those matches go foreverthe thing i dont get is whats with the career mode
it is simply the most infuriating thing ive ever seen
you have to sit through all the matches on your tv show or ppv of course you can skip them but that takes  minutes a pop just to skip
 and your wrestler isnt even always on
why do i have to sit through  matches that im not even playing in
sooooo boring
also the cut scenes are an embarassment
theres like  different ones and they take so long to load they are not even remotely worth it any shape or formhopefully smackdown  will solve these problems
if you have a bunch of friends and want to play this get it but if you want to entertain yourself id waitthis game is cool but couldve been better
its much better than wrestlemania  on n
however the gameplay is way too fast and the season mode takes way too long
buy smackdown on playstation thank goodness that i rented this game
this game is much better than the first smackdown game
the create a superstar feature in sd was a joke
the create a superstar in sd is bigger and more extensive
there are still major problems
 the color option graphs are difficult to use
you only see the colors change as you scroll through the graphs
then youll have to right down the number value for each color you chose for future use
 once youve chozen and saved certain features you can not change them
i made three characters
each one took about  minutes to make including moves
after a few hours of gameplay i wanted to change the characters names andor entrances
this can not be done
the only way is to completely remake the wrestler all over again
if you didnt wright your information down it will be another  minutes out of your life
as far as the wrestling matches smackdown  offers many fun options
table casket ladder hell in the cell
however the big draw of sd and sd is supposed to be the career modes
the career mode in sd is actually worse than the first
i cant understand why a player has to sit through wrestling dates that dont feature the player on the card
you can skip the matches but this takes time
you will have to watch the all too brief cut scenes
after  dates of inactivity i used a cheat process to make myself number  contender for the light heavyweight title
i finally got to play
i nor my other creations were ever asked a question by a wwf superstar
they werent part of the story lines
in the five days that i rented the game i only saw  of my guys in one cut scene
this is ridiculous
a personal grief i have over sd is the inability of female wrestlers other than chyna to go for wwf titles other than the womans championship
i dont know if this was a decision by thq or the wwf or both
i feel ladies should be able to at least compete for the tag and lh belts
there is only one major flaw with gameplay
in matches where there is more than one opponent the player has to manually change the focus of which wrestler he wants to attack
this can get very confusing
a player can wind up punching in the wrong direction or attack his own tag partner
thats my review
i enjoyed my rental time but i wouldnt pay money to own this game
if you dont already have it and you dont mind the old talent line up i recommend buying quotwwf attitudequot  if you have an n i recommend quotwwf wrestmania quot over quotwwf no mercyquot  read those reviews to learn whycompared to wwf no mercy or even wcw nwo revenge thq have gone a big step down for these playstation versionsfirst off the controls are stupid on the n they are easy and you know what you are doing on the playstation they are confusing and plays more like an arcade beat em up then a wrestling match
and i really hate the way you do specials in this gamethe create a wrestler was the first thing i tried out its ok but too confusing the lists are too long and numbered instead of telling you what it is
i couldnt even find a dx shirt to put on
the music is pointless as it only shows about  seconds of the titantron before it cuts to the next bit i couldnt even find half of my fave
moves yet there in the game somewhere and you cant even pick a height you just have tall or short instead of the actual statbut what really bugged me about this game is season mode
its confusing to even start one but it is frustrating to have to have to go through every match of the show either watching it or simulating it i try to skip them all to the match im in but it takes too long with annoying music and then takes longer to load a pointless scene saying whoever had entered the building  big deal why did they do this
why not just do what has been done with the other  games and just go from your matches next to next instead of wasting your time having to simulate every other match with no way to skip all events till your match or have you spend about  minutes simulating through a show that youre character is not even participating inthis game hit rock bottom and laid the smackdown on nothing but itself
play the n versions cause these games are not down with it and thats the bottom line cause i said sowhile the lastest and greatest wrestling game for playstation is much improved it may be just a little too advanced for playstation as it seems all you do is look at pictures of your favorite wrestlers while the graphics are constantly loading
once you actually get into the matches though the game play is pretty fun with all the special moves of each wrestler
there is a need for commentary from the real announcers to give this game a more realistic feel
overall a game that i cant wait to see on playstation because all the loading time wont be there anymorebefore bungie made halo the most overrated game of all time aside from grand theft auto vice city they proved that they most definitely were not the greatest developers of all time as any ignorant xbox fanboy will tell you with this littleknown blunder of a thirdpersonshooterfighter
little known for a good reason it seemsthis is one of the most aggravating games ive played in a long time
not the good type of aggravating that you get from playing a game like contra where its fun as hell even if you die and which results in that ultimate feeling of awesome when you finally do beat it
oni is the type of aggravating where  of the frustration and difficulty comes from the game itself not because you arent good at itgames like oni are why i have very little respect for most american developers
hey guys i have an idea
lets forget about making a game thats actually fun lets concentrate instead on making a game as realistic as possible
so realistic in fact that it greatly hinders the gameplay and defeats the main purpose of playing a video game
oh sure some people may say its boring but who cares
theyll be too blown away by the fact that the game is just like real life
that forumla does not work at all in making a good game
lets list the reasons whythe movement controls are designed to be like a first person shooter with the left stick for movement and the right stick for turning
that would be cool if this was a first person shooter
but in a third person game with much faster action not to mention jumping and fighting game moves too this just becomes ridiculous
people with less than  hands will find this games controls poorly designed and nearly impossible to masteryou can only carry one weapon at a time
how lame is that
some may say this makes it more strategic but take a look at halflife you can carry as many weapons as you want and its still full of strategyhypo sprays the games way of recovering your health dont have an immediate effect
instead of having your health meter instantly rise to full it sloooooooooowly works its way up to the top of the meter
if you get attacked while youre recovering youve lost it all
bye byetheres no block button
blocking attacks supposedly occurs when you face the enemy and dont press anything but  out of  times this wont save your assthe game goes waaaaay overboard with weapon limitations
the mecury bow for instance has a  second recharge time and fires a whopping rounds before its out of ammo
even though it kills most enemies in one hit it still isnt enough to justifysomething like thatyou can only jump from about  feet off the ground before you take damage from falling
once again this is just going way overboardyou have to press a button to pick up items on the ground instead of just walking into the item and getting it
need i say moretheres a huge gun in the game which one of the bosses weilds
once you beat him you can use this weapon for yourself
the problem is you literally
can only run about  mile an hour while youre wielding this thing
it makes getting from one end of a hall to the other feel like a drive across the countrythere are some good things about oni like the good voice acting the stylish celshaded graphics and the comic book feel of the game but its overshadowed by all the horribly annoying gameplay flaws
not worth itgraphics are terrible the controls are clunky as hell but it does have an anime opening
that being said thats like the only good thing about it
not to mention that the plot is a blatant ripoff of ghost in the shellthe good nice anime cut scenes lots of levels smooth combat animationsthe bad clumsy and cumbersome controls boring levels lame objectives no midlevel save unfair checkpoint placement flat ugly texturesoni was a very hyped anime style game back in the day
this game was made by rockstar before getting into the d grand theft autos and other games
this game has a lot of potential but is flawed in a lot of ways that make the game more boring and frustrating than bad
with that said the only redeeming quality are the goodlooking combat animations and challengeright out of the gate you will notice that the controls are completely upside and backwards
all the combat moves are on the shoulder buttons
why in the world they thought of this is beyond me
you actually dont really use the face buttons all that much
this make jumping fighting and shooting clumsy and cumbersome and you cant change the controls to something more natural
these are just some of the worst actionadventure controls i have ever used
the actual combat is fine but executing these moves is a pain
i felt like i was stumbling over myself because i had to think about the controls
these just arent natural
jumping with r l and l are kick and punch and you pick up items with r
what
i felt like i was trying to solve a rubix cube not play a gamesecondly is the exploration factor
the levels are boring
they all look pretty much the same with flat boring textures and the design is confusing and labyrinthine in some levels
theres no direction and your compass is useless
the bar gets smaller as you get near an objective but if you are two flights down it will act like youre standing right next to it
enemies are stupid and clumsy boss fights are frustrating and the game just cant compensate its own design with the clumsy controls
i cant tell you how tired i got after just three levels of finding this colored console to open same colored door over and over againthe story isnt really worth sticking around the  levels either
the anime cut scenes are nice but you probably wont even get through this slog of a game
i tried really hard to keep going but there was never a change in pace
it didnt help that there is no midlevel saving and the checkpoint placement is unfair
if you quit in the middle of a level you have to start all over
there are just a lot of annoying things with this game but even if it was flawless you still have the fact that the game is just boring and not very funwhen it is all said and done only the hardest core of anime fans will stick around until the end
you really had to have played this when it first came out then come back for nostalgic purposes
the game is just clumsy and boring but has so much potential if only the developers spent more time on the game
as is stand i really cant recommend this to anyonei only just got the game from the playstation store and holy crap do i regret wasting  bucks on it its so difficult  it makes ninja gaiden on nes and battletoads on nes look easy by comparison
the graphics are decent for a ps era game but the voice acting in generally is really bad
if only this game was easier it might be fun buts its not easy or much fun either
nows when the ability to get refunds for digitally downloaded games would come  in handy even if your a persona fan like iam your better off avoiding this game
i might do a better review of persona  eternal punishment if i ever get farther then  battles without dying like i did really fastthe problem with the d shooter genre is that its very easy for developers to turn out weak uninspired drek that will still sell well to a niche market shooters arent nearly as popular as they used to be and fans will snatch up the new ones with little hesitation
sadly i was one of themgunbird  plays looks and plays almost exactly like strikers  on the sony playstation and believe you me that is not a good thing
the graphics look horribly datedi know a great game does not require eyemelting visuals but come on
systems less powerful than the dreamcast consistenly produced games that looked far more impressive than this
capcoms insertion of characters from their more wellknown games does nothing to increase gunbird s appeal
theres precious little depth to the gameplay as well
the stages are very short and you get from one end to the other simply by using your special attacks at every opportunity and continuing as many times as you need to
there comes a point where continuing will send you back to the beginning of the stage but instead of making you more determined to beat the game it just annoys youit seems that most shooters are really good or really bad
theres einhander theres g darius and then theresthis
life is too short to waste playing bad shooterslet me begin this review by telling you that if you are going to start this game prepare yourself to finish it
put on some nachos or grab a large drink because there are no save points
the game follows the classic re storyline but adds a twist
this is a nice game to obtain if you are not digging the new plotdeviation of re  and  also good to complete your collection in the same vein as umbrella conspiracies
so on to the game itselfthe game will take you anywhere between  and  hours to complete
any longer and you should be checking your pulse
i was getting tired of not being able to save mainly out of boredom but i toughed it out anyways
my first time through i played lazily and ended up with a b ranking and  something
i have no intentions of improving on my rank as the only interesting part is starting the game over with all the weapons you acquired in the previous runthrough
a quick read through or followalong with this guide    will help you get through the game very fast
its so short that you can print it on one pagemy pros  firstperson shooter perspective adds a whole new element to the series and actually is very scary
i yipped more than once when the dogs jumped up at me or the hunters were lunging at my face
 the game follows classic re style but with a twist in the story line that somehow still folds togethermy cons  voice acting is bad
i mean original re bad
maybe even worse
its just gross
 graphics are a suckfest
blocky ugly sketchyredc re and re all look better on my tv
 zero replay value
like renting a movie you only watch once
i heard there was a rocket launcher to obtain but thats too easy
give me an alternate character or alternate story line instead
 disgusting side story
why the developers thought they needed to concoct a story that involves abducting preteen children and cutting open their skulls for extraction of pituitary brain matter for tyrant growth is beyond my comprehension
disturbing at best distasteful at worstget this game if you are really a diehard
otherwise youll be better of skipping this one  and believe me you wont miss muchlet me start off by stating that i got this game with the strategy guide and i have yet to see what any of the pages look like
this game is painfully easy and unadvancedin japan the gamers were able to play this much more like quothouse of the deadquot games rather than in the us where it seems that capcom wants to cash in on the american lust for firstperson shooters
the light gun is just something you can get for the psx but it isnt what you might call quotstandard issuequot for the conventional hardcore gamer
a light gun additive being required or at least allowed im not sure if it is a gun costs sometimes  and i have a few freinds who had problems playing this with it would have made this so much better
also give us rapid fire for the gunsalso while i have seen much worse the graphics can use a serious polishing
also the animation is distorted by the fully d world and the first person view destroys all fear techniques used so well beforethe sound is terrible
to start off there is really no decent music like in res amp the music in here is really both bland and pathetic
also the voice acting is pretty bad but im sure that it would sound a whole lot better if it didnt sound like you were listening to them underwater
however while the sound it awful its nowhere near as completely worthless as much as the sound in the first re titlemainly the beyond dismal music and voice actingnow the story well actually its not so bad
it does have a really good setup and a few good plot twists and also the main character was told to investigate by his freind leon s kennedy the hero of re who could with one finger kick chris redfeilds 
also the areas that are only accessible through replay have some excellent files that rival the best of res amp  however the decent although terribly short storyline is destroyed by all lack of realism in the gameplay
i mean face it you fight a tyrant only  minutes into the game the puzzles solve themselves enemies cant hit you when they are directly behind you and even if they could you have so much health and you generally start off in the same basic location when you start with your next quotlifequotall in all this game is far from worthless but even further from being able to hold onto the quotresident evilquot title it holds
i liked the first one i was blown away by the second the third one rocked my world and nowthis
im now just waiting for code veronica for the ps while playing something elsein resident evil survivor you play an amnesia stricken man wandering around a zombie infested town looking for clues to his past
the first thing youll notice about the game is its first person perspective and that the game was clearly meant to use a light gun prepheral but does not yet its japanese counterpart does
that major drawback combined with the choppy animation muddy sound poor controls and near none replayability make resident evil survivor one big disappointment of a game
its worth playing if your a longtime fan of the resident evil series but dont expect much out of it other than an intriguing side story to the saga
capcom has once again made another first person light gun aimed resident evil game called resident evil dead aim for the ps and that game is quite an improvement over this piece of crudactually if it werent for the zombies i proabably wouldnt know that it was a resident evil game
this game gives re a bad name
first of all its short
short as in an hour and a half of gameplay for you first time playing it
next is it has an awful story line
you a dude who lost his memory and thinks hes vincient who is bad and latter recovers his memory
bosses im not sure if there are anyyou run into mrx a few times but thats all besides the final tyrantvery easy
i just stood there while he ran in circles around me and jumbed over me and shot at him
graphicshmmmm not good not good
another thing is if your gonna play it and have a short ammout of time and think you can just play itget a little ways in and save your wrong
no savesnope none
have i already said this game is easy
first time playing my ranking was an a what about ammowill you ever run out
not in this game because you have unlimited ammo with the hand gun
pluse you find ammo like crazy for the other guns
if you like playing bad games or are a huge resident evil fan get this game
if not forget it and play dino crisis or resident evil codeveronicawell what can i say
this game doesnt really suck but isnt that good
the idea of a first person view was a good idea but this game lacked in several areas
the plot wasnt very good at all
it seemed as if the game was just thrown together to just put something on the market
im a huge fan of the resident evil series but this game was a real dissapointment
my advice is to definatly rent the game first it isnt very hard
i beat it in one day
if your a fan of the series then its definatly worth playing but i wouldnt pay for itthe graphics are rehashed from the other games mostly re  only they look crappier
the items are floating spinning defiances of physics and common sense
the motion capture is terrible the enemys that are gifted with the ability to jump a skill denied to the player
the enemys seem to slow down in mid flight
the zombies shuffling motion seem to be all the more drunken puppet show than usual
everything looks like crapthe voice acting is terrible these people did not care about their job
it was like they were all bored
they all sound completly detached from reality
they have no emotion in their voices
except the sewer dwelling homless balding hobbit
it sounded like they had a grand total of  voice actors for the entire gamethe weapons are completly random you have the glock  and sig saur and a berreta in the same group as a nambu which is just confusing
and to furthor confuse you you get a m grenade launcher which is almost useless
then a spas  and a sw model  revolver
and you dont get enough sg bullets like their the rarest ammo to find
the  children in the game are stupid lilly apparently survived only because she apparently is so brain dead the zombies either except her as one of their own or fear her because she could make them dumber
and lott has the most anoying voice evergame play is boring there is just massive dead zones with nothing there
for no reason except to take up game space
the targeting is just annoying the dogs are like crack head fast and will fuse with your legs after a period of time because you cant look down
and while they are down there humping your legs
they absolutly refuse to do damage to you
the zombies are just there they are no real threat
they are really more of a minor annoyance or target practice
the hunters and lickes are just epic failures due to their decreased intelgence attack and hp
it is the only re that i know of that you can shoot a hunter point blank with the mm pistol while standing still and not only live but get away with fine health  times
health items are way to sparse competing with sg ammo in frequencythe translations the phone hang up that is the line that says it all
i cant remember is stated at least four times like a rapid fire machingun of i cant remember caliber
is just blazing away
this is one game that i wish i could havebeen hit by one of those bullets and forgotten about itin  conclusion it is not as bad as the playable failure known as big rigs
its still pretty bad
but at least the enemy has ai
and there is some concept of physics and there is background music
but it doesnt play like an re game
there is just one thing i cant get over it seems to be so laggy and slowthe attemt to make the game exciting by putting a lot of stupid puzzles makes this game a not very fun game at all
the battle system is alright and i like the anime sequences that take place
its rather annoying when you get trhough little puzzles maze like areas that take you ages to figure out
im used to the experience points and equiping weapons you bought or forged since its in most other rpgs that ive played
also the fact that you cant skip movies makes it annoying when you die after watching a long movie because you have to watch it againthis is one of those games that was all hype and nothing to back it up
the previews looked amazing but the aftermath is that orphen has ver dissapointing gameplay
the only good thing about this game was the battles
the battle system was very innovative and fun to learn however this game will dissapoint even the most hardcore fans of the animei love role playing games and the playstation  graphics were incredible on some of the other games weve played
when i popped orphen into the cd player i was really expecting something spectacular
unfortunately the game didnt quite live up to the promiseyou play a male orphen in his late teens who is a loner with an attitude
he has a brothersister pair with him cleo and magnus who spend the entire time sniping at each other and at him
shut up he snarls at them
well duh
the girl cries out in response to something else
when water breaks in her panic cry was not of the danger they were in but my favorite clothes
their two bodyguards arent much better  with their bickering i actually cheered when a monster crab grabbed one and threw him into the water
i kept hoping that one would grab the annoying siblings as well and get rid of them
come to think of it even the main character needed a good swat in the headthe magic orphen uses is intriguing
his weapons have names like bite of lightning sword of the fallen devil and hand of pyro
you dont have to remember their names  he cries them out quite often enough
thats when youre lucky enough to be in combat  a lot of the time the game simply freezes when youre moving going into a preset series of actions that mostly involve the main characters yelling at or picking on each otherif you could only skip through them it might be playable
but you cantthe graphics are reasonably good the monsters you meet are interesting but there isnt anything to move you along through the game except for the desperate hope that something will come along and knock some sense into the characters
unfortunately for everyone involved this never happensif youre looking for a great rpg id wholeheartedly recommend final fantasy ix over this game
if you already have ffix then you might rent this one to understand just how good the ffix team really isthis game is whats wrong with so called rpgs today or any game as a matter of fact
in an rpg i thought that it was role playing not some kind of comic book
you just dont play most of this game you just watch
the battle system is just plain stupid who just stand there and the enemys come towards you
the save points are at the most random spots of the game and the cut scenes are just horrible the voice acting to the dubing
and they are boring if you die you have to watch them all over again and you cant skip them
dont buy this game watch the anime it is basicly the same thingok i bought this game  hour ago and im already thinking of excusses to take it back
this game has nice graphics but it feels like im flying in an air ballon
do all the planes blow up with one hit
i prefere they fly around alittle more with some smoke and then die
im playing it tonight for a couple of hours but in the morning im going back to the storefrom the first bof down to this one the quality has gradually declined
sure it looks prettier than it used to but with few weapons fewer spells and less variety with each passing episode the series is looking more than a little threadbarethe combat system is good though it hasnt changed hardly at all since the last time
the spells and skills are copied more or less directly from number iii including such goodies as flare jump and other lowcost useful abilities
the multielemental spell thing was cool but made less useful by the inclusion of a variety of useless or nearuseless combinations
some of the highpower spells require the combination of elements bosslevel monsters are immune to and do an overwhelming amount of damage to regular monsters they simply arent necessarythe monsters are just slighter higher resolutions of old beasties from the last three games and the dragon spells while nice to look at just arent all that useful or interesting
i used them once and then stopped using them alltogetherthe fairies are about the only thing thats improved over the last installation with multiple uses for fairies and the opportunity to build a significant and powerful attack force with the fairy spellsthe movie clips were a nice touch but they arent as good as some other rpg movie clips
check out the new chrono triggerffiii disc and youll see what i meanon the whole it just wasnt all that great
still ive now defeated all four games several times over
when bof v comes out ill check it out before buying it thoughgraphics   the colour shading is nice when youre playing outside but for the rest of the time this looks pretty effortless and droopy
its also hard to see where a passage leadssound   the usual cartoon racing score hangs in the background while the cars dont do anything too dramatic with their enginesvalue   most racing games are worth the money because theyre entertaining but to make a long story short this one isnt really worth paying for unless youre a really big fan of the muppetsoverall   this is the sort of game you play in the game or record store while your waiting for mum to finish her grocery shopping
in a game where you can hardly see where youre going is it worth even playing
yes but only if mum takes a couple of hours to find a broccoli stickthis game is very difficult and the racers are hard to control
i got this for my daughter as a christmas gift in  and she was  at that time
she tried to play it several times and has found it very difficult and frustrating to play
ive tried playing it myself and found it very difficult to control
it definately is not a crash team racing which was easier to playunless you can get this game at a substantially reduced price or for free i wouldnt waste the money on it as it is a difficult game to play amp controlok ill get straight to the point so i can keep this one short guysdont take this the wrong way as i used to be a ps one purist but there is not a single reason to buy this dated system nownot onei mean cmon why would you want to buy a  bit system what with the  bit sega dreamcast going down to a hundred bucks as welli have both of the systems and i can tell you that this thing just isnt that fun to play at all anymoreit has had some good games but sony is still pushing the software without a dcent price dropanother problem are peripheralsif you have more than one friend you will have to buy a multitap adaptor to play games a pointless adition considering most all systemseven the  come on guys the have controller ports built into the systemthe hardware is old and pales in comparison to a more superrior system like a dreamcast and the prices are exactly the same no differentso all in all this system isnt going anywhere the games and hardware are sorely dated and there  is no internet or third party backing iti let a friend quotborrowquotminethis machine is no match for the new consoles
so say byebye to itthe only game harder than this is the ridiculously difficult quotaliens vs pedatorquot thats right hardcore gamers play it on the quotextra hardquot setting
ss is too freakin hard for its own good
not to brag but i am very good at games like this but cmon already
quotits so creepyquot  yeah especially when enemies appear from nowhere and smoke you quicker than a lightning bolt
quotbut you have guns and stuffquot  that break  seconds after you use them and try finding ammo when you need it
health packs  finding them is one thing having time to use them is another
quotwow what great level desiquot bang crunch
oops i got killed again
sightseeing is not a good idea in this gamehowever the game does come with an ample supply of cheat codes but you have to use them at the right time
dont start typing in the code for extra health or ammo when trouble is about to start its too late at that point
i managed to get through the game by stocking up on health ammo and abilities at every opportunity
by quotopportunityquot i mean when i was crouched behind a steel storage box while an automated gun was blasting away in my direction
get the picturethis game has many positive aspects as detailed by other reviewers but was just too violent for me
i found the images of severed heads and limbs disturbing
while the game does have some good strategy elements and character development in the end it is a first person shooter and your main activity is killing
the plot was very good and kept my going long enough to finish the game
i guess i should stick with lucas arts titlesi never cared about multiplay for this game i dont mind the difficulty in fact i enjoyed it and i thought the graphics were fine especially for when it was released
having been a huge system shock  fan i was first in line pretty much literally too to buy this sequel when it was released and for the most part i absolutely loved itnow let me qualify for the most part
that means everything until about three major levels before the end at which point the game completely buried itself
to this day i even remember the specific point at which i realized it had passed the point of nonredemption where you found several very tall columns sliding up and down that were supposed to be ahem teeth and you had to jump across them a la s sidescroller
the ending of this game along with the couple of levels immediately preceding it was so incredibly godawful that i have to ding not  not  but  stars
it it just that badan ending this bad that ruins what was a masterpiece of a game leading up to it is nothing new in computer games
in fact one of the highestprofile examples of it is quite similar to ss and that is halflife
now if youre the type thats able to overlook a games ending and enjoy just portions of the journey for their own sake then youll likely enjoy this game more than  stars worth
however if youre like me and can think of few game design sins worse than a horrible ending than my rating stands
ss started out as one of the best sequels id ever played and ultimately ended as one of the most disappointingi have played through both the original system shock and system shock  to completion
having done so i have to say that ss is one of the most overrated games in history and every time it shows up on some game magazines overlooked works of genius page or the like i want to screamfirst let me get it out of the way yes the story is very good and i was particularly struck by the plot twist that introduces your ultimate enemy
yes the sound design is good
yes the atmosphere is great very spooky very isolatingbut its one thing to feel that your enemies hate you and another entirely to feel that the game hates youthere are a dozen little ways this comes off like that you can hurt yourself by running into things and make it worse by increasing your agility stat and thus your speed
i do believe thats a first for firstpersonshooters and please for the love of god let it be the last
theres the fact that you can be shot a dozen times by an enemy and when you finally kill him mysteriously discover the weapon he was firing on you was not only devoid of ammunition but broken to boot
theres that the games system explicitly expects you to die repeatedly if you have enough money you get restored to life at a sort of savepoint more on that later
theres a sequence that has you running back and forth trying to find a series of numbers for a passcode one number per location and all the while the monsters keep up their infinite respawn while youre about your busywork
what would have been the problem with your socalled benefactor putting the entire code in one location
but ultimately it comes down to economics
the designers were so terribly afraid that the player would at some time have an excess of something that they overcompensated the other waythe money of the game is called nanites and ultimately theyre used for everything
die and get restored to life
cough up some nanites
want to open a locked box
cough up some nanites oh and by the way all that box contains is slightly fewer nanites than it cost you to try
why did someone put a security lock on the equivalent of a nickel
one of those great mysteries i guess
out of ammo
go to the vending machine and cough up some more nanites
or you could hack the machine for yet more nanites and then it would give you lower pricesi dont know about you but when i hack something like a vending machine i expect to get something for free
i guess im silly that wayand even if you have ammo your gun might just break given the uniquely corrosive qualities of the atmosphere on the ship
but dont worry you can buy a repair tool for a few nanites
though repairing a weapon degrades its quality and makes it more likely to break down in the future
thanks guyspoisoned
your fate is sealed unless you buy an antidote
more nanites
or you can buy a recycling tool and discover that what it gives you for recycling most items wouldnt buy you a lousy soft drinkmaybe youre a psionic using the awesome infinite powers of the human mind as your weapon
great but restoring your psychic energies means buying a psirestoring potion
more nanites
for all the talk in the manual about making psionics more than just another gun this particular aspect succeeds in making them exactly that and a gun much like the others that is going to fire twice and then need to be switched out for something that still has ammoand isnt brokenand you have the skill to useafter a few rounds of bang bang click click ltswitch bang bang bang click ltswitch zap zap zap click click ltswitch you realize that whats making the hairs on the back of your neck stand up isnt terror its irritationa simple equation infinite respawing enemies  finite resources  game that hates you
is it really so much to ask that a foe thats been shooting you have ammunition on them
especially if youre going to have to face an unlimited supply of themtheres a moment in most games of both the rpg and fps genre near the end where you feel that you are ready
youre bad
youve got the best weapons a full stock of ammunition the best spells or whatever youve learned the tactics you need to take on foes over many hours of play and you know that whats coming up is going to be hard and its going to take ingenuity and everything youve got
but its going to be fun and you have what you need to make it possible and youre readyin system shock  that moment never comes
the designers were too afraid of the player having an excess and as a result you never have enough
not even at the end
youve been nickeled and dimed through the whole game by poison by the unending tide of zombies by busywork by hacking or lockpicking things that turned out not to be worth the sacrifices by taking damage in places you didnt expect by reloading and repairing weapons that break down at a fantastic rate and ultimately thats not scary
its frustrating
its irritating
its wearying
but its not scaryand yes i finished the game
no i felt no compulsion to play through it again as a different type of charactertheres other little things like that they replaced the ungainly but interesting pseudovr hacking of the original system shock with a guessing game somewhere in complexity between tictactoe and minesweeper
or that the only thing your character actually says for the entire game deflates the tension of a climactic moment for the sake of a dumb joke
or that the bad guys seem to offer you the opportunity to ally with them but the designers never considered making that opportunity a real oneive said more than enough
pick up the original deus ex if you like games of the genre let this sleeper hit continue sleepingps
at least two of the positive reviewers have blithely stated something along the lines of well yes its so hard you have to use cheat codes to complete it but  do you guys really expect so little of game designers that youre willing to forgive this kind of grotesque misdesign in pacing and difficulty
are you so desperate for games with an actual storyline that youre willing to ignore enormous flawsif youre looking as i was for a counterstrike substitute keep looking
ultimately what kills this game is playability
the game play is not engaging
graphics are lacking a bitlook at the way that everything looks like a flat surface with a texture layed on it
ultimately thats not a big complaint though it looks passable
its just not that funa strange little game which starts very ambitiously and really gets lost along the way somewhere
there are a number of borderline offensive features  such as the sex dream sequence the subtext that satans not such a bad guy after all and the uncle tomlike black character in overalls  but the thing that really turned me off was the bad writing bad animation and bad acting
or maybe its just a bad translation
all in all not really worth the botherin the early part of the th century a man named theodore more built an amusement park called dreamland
the park was inhabited by various societal misfitsa pair of siamese twins an animal trainer with parental issues a fat lady etcall of whom had some dealings of an infernal nature with a gentleman named mephisto
now theres some dissension in the upper realms as to whether all these people deserved what they got and an everymanmarcellus faustis sent to explore the past and sort things outfaust seven games of the soul is a game that players seem either to love or hate
the ones who love it cite its adult themes great soundtrack decent graphics and freedeom of exploration
its detractors refer to illogical puzzles technical problems random action triggers and lack of a truly coherent story
all these things both the good and the bad are part and parcel of this game
taking all into account i fully expected to be one of the profaust camp
i wasntin the first place as another reviewer has pointed out this game really doesnt run very well on xp
you can get it to run if you use a compatability mode and turn your sound acceleration all the way down
but sound in the cutscenes is still extremely choppy and there are numerous things in the game that dont work
half the features on the main menu simply dont function
some of these features are supposed to be helpful in gameplay detailed notes on each character for example that just arent there
some are things that have led others to give faust high ratings no matter what i could only access one song from the soundtrackso their lack really had an impact
within the game there are numerous glitches as wellhotspots that dont appear or appear far from where theyre supposed to cutscenes that dont play things that dont work
just for that i found attempting to play faust a frustrating experiencebut its when you get to the story that things really fall apart
in seven episodes each devoted to one of the parks denizens youre supposed to unveil a greater mystery
and you do kind of
but the episodes themselves are too short and lack detail and only a few of them contribute to the greater story
otherwise youre exploring territory thats infuriatingly random
some of these people had relationships with each other
some didnt
whats the point and who cares
by the end i didntthe puzzles were a mixed bag mostly inventorybased with a few combination locksnot enough variety to excite me im afraid
and here too the randomness showed
there was too much inventory that you picked up that had no purpose other than to trigger a cutscene
there was other inventory that you picked up that had no purpose at all and later disappeared what was that baseball bat for
there were puzzles that were so obtuse that there was no possibility that one could solve them without at least a nudge and puzzles that gave no indication they had been solved so i still had to consult a walkthrough to see what was going on
there were puzzles with so many possible solutionsputting a number of words into order in a sentence for example when those words would make sense in a hundred different ordersthat solving them would take days
i generally play without hints or a walkthrough so having to exit the game and consult one about five times an episode just to follow the gameplay was truly annoying
also towards the end of every episode youre suddenly thrust into a totally different location where you have to complete some action unrelated to anything else to move on
the whole experience was like being shunted back and forth along a series of badly running bumper carsafter everything else the revelation of the true story and the final decision were a letdown and the two endings good and bad were frankly abrupt meaningless and had the feeling of being slapped oni completed faust in under  hours
it would have been shorter if id known what was going on
i have to say for all the disappointments it is a haunting game and i do keep thinking about it
i think if i had an older computer on which to play older games id play it again  maybe id like it better
but on modern machines by the standards of todays games it just doesnt measure upwhere is the quality from the last game final fantasy viiii mean the game doesnt interest me at all in the beginning it is too manga and comic relief inspired and has no real seriousness about it
this makes this a less quothardcorequot experience than the final fantasy i miss the depth in the characters and i also miss the complex story that was so evident in  and  bad game
i just hope they increase the dark feel of the next game because this one was too goodie goodie for my tastefinal fantasy ix starts out as being a completely different experience
however it is soon apparent that square was not thinking correctly when doing this storyline
the monsters almost all bear names that have appeared in previous titles the black mage though cool and the dragon knight wicked but enough is enough resurface quickly and linger throughout the game
at first its fun to see these popular themes resurface but it has gone way too far
the only plus sides to this game that i can think of are the great graphics and animation and the music uematsu has done it again
plus the rpg is too short if you can get an item by beating the game in less than  hours it is too short ok

there is no way this game could be an dubbed as a final fantasy i mean seriously come on
this game was one of the easiest games i have ever played and i think it was a simple challenge
i didnt even  hours straight i passed way more quickly than any other final fantasy
if you want to check it out thats up to you but take my advice its not worth itff is absolutely brilliant so get that
ff is ok but it isnt even as good as  never mind  the characters is one of the things that lets this down
i cant wait for this game started out fun enough
it was only my second racing game the first being moto gp and i thought i was missing something
it turns out that it was the game that was missing something
the earlier tracks are easy enough but as you go up they become increasingly difficult until there is little more involved then sheer luck and even that doesnt work
cars crash and this is about the only way you can move up in the posistions
there are only a few songs and they rapidly become annoying
the effects are nothing special and the cars fly apart in large chunks all in all its not very thrilling
the hidden bonus cars are fairly ridiculious and a few even make it difficult to drive because you cant see the track as they are so big theres actually a car in the shape of a big spider legs and all
this was a pretty disappointing gamemidway has taken an ultra precise and often boring form of racingindy cartand turned it inside outreal physics are out the windowthe cars powerslidelaunch airborneand in general behave like those in daytona usasounds like a blast rightwekkit is and it isntif youre simply looking for the home version of cart fury youre in luckbyt beyond that simple orderthings slow down a littlethe additional sim mode gives you adjustment optionswing angletire pressureetc
and a few other real racing featuresbut tweak as you might its still an arcade raceritseems like the absence of the speed burst is the only real difference from the standard gamethe mini games are equally sosochallenges like follow the line block your opponent and last man standing are only a few degrees different than an actual raceon the other handlock on lets you shoot missiles at rival carsthats a step in the right direction at leastin generalcart fury is a decent game but doesnt quite turn the corner to greatnessmaybe if the tracks were more dynamic with hills and valleys come on its arcadey anywayand featured more interesting shortcuts or if there were more turbo boost powerupsone thing is for suredespite the landslide of loading screens two player is the way to playits fast the ai cars still race along and most importantly its competitivestilltry this one before you plunk down the big bucksi had ccbridge too far and loved it
i bought this with hopes of more maps and more weapons
my issue is i have a new intel pc and it runs everything else fine but ccin takes about  seconds sometimes more before my ltclick has a reaction ie
selection conformation placement etc
with such simple graphics and gameplay it should be instantif anyone knows how to fix this i will update my review but at this point the game is unplayablethis is one of the most average games ive seen in a long timeafter i downloaded the patches and changed my virtual memory settings most of my problems were solved
the storyline could use some workthere are few side quests and the main plot gets lost when youre hacking and slashing your way through the dungeonsi havent used a lot of the magical spells
fireball and lightning bolt even after my mages advanced in skill level are still the ones i use the mostbut they arent as effective once youre surrounded then chain lightning is the only way to go unless you want all of your party members killed off by friendly firethere isnt a lot of need for the other ones
there are far too many lowlevel monsters in the dungeons until you reach the catacombs
beating up on orcs and skeletons gets kind of dull after a while
there just arent enough rewards for gaining experience it seems
i played table top adampd in college nd edition and i remember levelling a lot more ofteni liked the music and the graphics
i havent seen any better graphics in pc computer games lately
but the rd edition rules definitely need to be updated if they havent been alreadyalso the maps need work
i have played other games where after you find a location you can click on it and walk there automatically
wandering through dungeons because you not your characters cant recall where an exit or room is wastes time that could be spent doing other things in the gameif you truly are hard up for cash then dont waste your money on this game
its expensive for what you actually getin the past few years an annoying trend has emerged in the home computer video game world
game developers presumably tortured into submission by their publishers have been releasing outlandishly buggy games
por is another in a long list of casualtiesonline roleplaying games such as ultima online and everquest were barely functional at release
black and white crashed constantly
anarchy online was a complete joke
even max payne had a couple problems at first in this case the patch was out within a couple daysthis quotrelease and then patchquot method of rushing a game out the door has got to stop
often the problems arent fixed for weeks
in the case of por a few people actually had parts of windows removed due to a bug with the uninstaller
the other problems people have reported are too numerous to list
add to this some gameplay balance mistakes or possibly bugs and youve got an army of angry computer rpg fans flooding the official por forums with vitriolic hate lettersthe saddest thing in the end is that all of these problems are with a game that turns out to not even be that good
its a notch above mediocre a somewhat pleasant and totally mindless diversion
theres no real depth excitement or roleplaying to speak ofwait for the bargain bin on this one
itll be there soonnot superb
graphically superior than its predecessor baldurs gate pool of radiance lacks the game play that bg held
ive always said i would take a game that lacks in graphics if it makes up for it in game play and bg did that this game is mediocre at best
it is stable on my computer i have yet to have it crash knock on woodso ill give it point for that having a game for near two weeks with no crashes is pretty good
ill give it a point for graphics as mentioned earlier they are great
ill give it a point for allowing you to create up  members of your party
where does it lack game play as mentioned is poor interface is tiresome i guess the hardcore table top player geeks like it but i cant stand the turn based combat i turned it off
with baldurs gate infinity engine it was customizable players could make their favorite sword from whatever book they read and through it into the game to be bought of found one group even made a whole new add on for it but i dont see that this is as customisable there for not very player friendly so minus a point
if you are a bg fan dont buy it thinking you will get something like it you wont
it doesnt hold the interaction of bg i like that if i like running around hacking things up with little to no problem solving i would play diablo ii
i guess ssi created a concept that had a following already with the original pool of radiance game made a graphically great game so they could hype it up and then threw it at usi have always had a soft spot in my heart for the first pool of radiance series
it was the first computer game to bring a great pc version of a popular rpg to fruition
i also played the black islebioware versions of the adampd series baldurs gate amp icewind dale and loved those games
but this one
i think my review would be censored if i told you what i thought of this gamefirst of all the game crashed on installation
blizzard may be the only software company that releases relatively bugfree pc games these days but how can a software company justify a game with bugs in the installation process
ive heard that i have it lucky
some people have had their operation systems wiped out in the installation processafter getting the game to run i was unimpressed
the graphics are decent but it doesnt have the same atmosphere as the other recent dungeons amp dragons products
its a quothack and slashquot only game and things such as quests great storylines and character interaction which made so many of the dungeons amp dragons games enjoyable are nonexistent in this product
the instruction manual is also a poor substitute for an introduction to the new rd edition dungeons and dragons rulesim afraid that the more i play this game the more technical errors im going to find
there are already many bugs such as the game crashing when you save it during certain conditions
i can live with a bugged game if it promises to offer great gameplay when it is fixed with patches but this game is a pitiful attempt to live up to some of the great successes the dungeons and dragons series has seen with pc gamesdont waste your money
if youre an avid dampd fan wait until the game price drops and then try it out but id recommend baldurs gate ii as a much better alternative if anyone desires a great rpg game for the pcwhy is it called fast food tycoon when all i can make is pizza
hmmm anyway on with the reviewpositives humorous cartoony graphics make the game visually stimulating colorful and interactive menus help streamline choicesnegatives abyssmal soundtrack and sound effects help menus and context slow and annoying game concepts are fuzzy and nigh impossible to master even on easy modes the computer knows all the tricks terrible and uninformative tutorialsoverall fast food tycoon is a good idea with neat visuals but the implementation of the game is amateurish
it might be worth a few bucks but there are better tycoon games out there performance is fine  as long as your pc matches the recommended configuration youll be good to go
disable any virus software or other background services if  you have problemsthese things cost like  bucks and they only hold  games
that is very cheap
if you are ever going to get a memory card for your psone get the colored cheap ones that come in a  pack for  bucks
thats what i got and now i can hold  games for less the price
can you believe that
 bucks for  games or  bucks for  games
you choosei didnt much enjoy this game though i must admit that the graphics were terrific
i suppose this is a great game if you youre into as the young man at the game shop put it quotbutton mashersquot
a button masher it seems is a game in which the primary goal is to mash the attack button before the enemy hits you over the head with a mallet or some other unfriendlinessthe crux of the game is that youre one of the heros outlined in the opening credits
each has a different weapon that they use in a different way from the next et cetera et cetera
yadda yadda
you have to win a series of battles that are a bit confusing to begin with and claim various prizes
now on to how to play the game much like the title of this review quotrun around whack buttons repeat until you are dead or victoriousquot
taa daa youve just mastered dynasty warriors  congrats
the only real strategy ive been able to discern from watching  people aside from myself play the game is quotdont get hitquotsorry to have been less than overjoyed with the gameplay but ive seen really good games and ive seen really bad games i own  ps games and  ps games
and this one is simply too close to marginal to get all hot and bothered about
rent it before you buy it
if you cant stand the idea of returning it to the rental store buy your own
on the up side id give it  stars if that were an optionevergrace first and formost was born to late it may have been special if it was released  years ago but it was not so here we have a ps game with ps graphics its a sure recipe for failure then we have the sound by the way its not really sound its vernacular sound distortionthis not for a gamer maybe for a  year old kid who have never played any rpgs its no zelda or final fantasyhowever i kinda enjoyed this game so forget the bad review you can certianly give it a try you may like its barbie appeal well laterz folks and gamersevery once in a while you just go ahead and buy a game without knowing anything about it and you are sorry you did
i have had this happen to me once before with a bad game called deathtrap dungeon
well i referred to this game as deathtrap dungeon  because its another mistake on my partand believe me i am not all that hard on games
i want to like games and i want to have fun but there isnt much good about this game
first off as the other review noted there is no story
you start the game off right in battle and you expect the story to pick up after that right
wrong
think a story is going to show itself at the beginning
wrong
i have yet to see any story
the only story you will get is from reading the bookthe game kind of reminds me of a diabalolegacy of kain blood omen except both of those games were good and dark angel is not
if they would have just thrown in some good voice acting like in legacy of kain then the game would be so much better but they didntthe graphics are definately subpar
the menu screen looks like something that could have easily been done on the ps
actually the whole game looks like it could have been on the ps
the only part that seems above par is the sounds and music
but there is only so many times you can hear a monster grunt or one say quotyoull regret thatquot after you wax him before that gets oldthey say this game is an adventurerpg
i dont see much rpg about it
there really isnt much freedom to wonder around
guess my idea of a rpg is phantasy star summoner or final fantasy
on dark angel you point a silver cursor to one of the areas on the map then it shows brown dots go to that location
there is no getting attacked on your way to anything
then all you do is crawl around level after level of some dungeon killing lots of monsters picking up weapons or stuff hitting switches and sometimes killing some monster that gives you some item to fullfill a quest you got from one of the towns
then you take the item back to the town and they give you some money
you also can collect items to take to these shrine things in the towns and they can raise your strength or one of your other attributesthe towns are pretty bad too
there is very few people in each town and probably only two of them are of any use to you
meaning there are probably only two of them that you can get a quest from and buy and sell itemsi see nothing original or good about the game besides the sound
and unless you really like just mind numbing dungeon crawling then i cant really recommend this game to anyone
i can see this game coming down in price real quick because once some people get the word out about how bad it is people probably wont be buying it too muchplease rent this game if you really feel the need to play it
then decide whether or not to buy it i have a feeling that after a few hours of playing it you wont want to waste your money on itbelieve me i wanted to like this game
i really wanted it to be good but it just isnt
please dont make the mistake i did and buy this game because you think its going to be good it just isntthis game is not exactly top notch hell its lower than bottom notch
i must say that armorines is just as fun as this game and thats not good in any humanly possible waygraphics the graphics ar pretty bad anna does random and stupid stuff in the inventory but the backgrounds are done fairly nice
its a  overhead view so you cant see much detail on anything but the sheer number of monsters that can appear onscreen at once is amazing
but with a little down scale on monster  appearance and background textures and a little downtweaking on character smoothness this could have been done on the ps and it would have been betterreplay if you have the gut to play through this for an hour or more your a brave man who desreves thousands of dollars and a memorial all to himself
if you can pick up the game play it for  mminutes and see that it wreaks then your a human being
if you play through the game once all the way your godlystory what kinda game has no story
this one is a good example you immediately strat off in a fight ina  village the game will pick up after that right umm no
if you hate story i suggest getting this gamecontrol if you can tfigure out the controls you should be shot and dumped in the hoover damn after that your remains shall be picked clean by seagullsfun sometimes of your bored beyond humanly possible reason you might play this for a quick burst of enjoyment while you hack up endless streams of invincible monsters for about  minutes before you need to go puke for every minute of gameplay
also you might wanna hit your head so you dont remember ever playing the gme as it will shatter your humanitymix the item finding and collecting of diablo no uniques though with the endless hack and slash of the first gauntlet arcade game and you have this
great monster and item variety
if you know what to expect then you can have a lot of mindless fun with the game engineprobably the best part of the game is defending the villages with the villagers fighting along side you
i thought that part was inspired as far as hack and slash games goon the flipside the game was rushed into fancy packaging without being complete
the story is minimal
its apparent im not an excellent coder that twelve hours one work day
of touchups on the story have the villagers say different things each month and a bestiary like castlevania curse of darkness would have improved the experience
i didnt like the game because the slapdash programming was so obviousthis also reminded of the original legend of zelda for the nes and gateway to apshai for colecovision
you can really get into the exploring aspect of the randomly generated dungeons
i thought the music was pretty bad i mean rock and roll in a dark ages type adventure game
didnt do it for meso you who are reading this review ask yourself this  have you played throughbaldurs gate dark alliance baldurs gate dark alliance ii may be expensivechampions of norrathorchampions return to armsnorrath one and two are essentially the same gamecastlevania curse of darkness and the computer version of diablo one and two
if the answer is yes and you liked them youll like this if you dont expect a story
if the answer is no buy one of the better games mentioned youll like it morei bought ut for the pc and played that game to death
when i bought my ps since i like fps i decided to rent unreal tournament for the ps
let me say this whenever pc games move over to consoles they fail  of the time and this is no exceptionthe graphics are horrendous for a ps game unlike the pc version these graphics seem muddy and unclear
the other falling points of this game are the lack of levels and characters and no online play is the final nail in the coffin
buy timesplitters or the pc unreal save yourself from this turkeyterrible terrible terrible very very dissapointed with sony
i actually bought this game for ps even tho i had it for the pc
the graphics r terrible the controls r demented and it is no fun without playing it with atleast  people in the same map with people all over the world which is a very lacking point of this game dont waste your money and time buying this game get it for the computer it is cheaper than this one its still played and is a great game the pc game is a classic the ps one is no more worth a pecans droppingswhen you think unreal tournament you should think of a pc and not a console system
while fps games have a chance on the console just think about  for the n its difficult to make a winner on the console experience
unfortunately ut does not make it into winner modeplay control isnt bad
there are a fixed number of preset ways you can configure the controller and not everyone will find one thats acceptable
i prefer setting j which makes it almost identical oni style controls and seems to me to be the emerging standard control for firstperson gamesthe multiplayer mode has too many problems to make this game enough fun
the levels are all pretty small and pretty simple
theres no network play though you can hook two pss together with an ilink for  player fun so youll pretty much max out at  people on a split screen forced to use the controllersif youre looking for a good multiplayer fps id save your money
its only a matter of time before some company makes one
it takes a little patiencecompared to its pc brethren this title is sorely lackingno online play  no fun without multitap and  extra dual shock sugly graphics compared to pc or even fellow ps first person shooter timesplittersslowdown
lots of it
especially in multiplayer
do not play with more than one other person or you will experience some serious slowdown
its not so bad that you cannot play it but it is very frustrating considering how powerful ps is
you shouldnt have to put up with slowdown with this kind of machine
if youve played perfect dark the slowdown is comparable to that game in  player modehorrendous controls
the game gives me a migraine every time i play it because for some reason the controls arent fully customizableunreal tournament may have done well on the pc but for ps it seems dull and uninteresting
although you can confiugure the controls to slightly resemble any other ps fps game they do not have the configuribility i think i just made that word up  that timesplitters has and with my backwards lefthandedness now i am pretty sure you wont find that one in the dictionary controller configurability is an esential
once you get used to what the controls do you still have to deal with the speed of the game
i know that it is more realistic to have people die when you shoot them but one shot virtually decimating your health just means that you are going to spend half of the game trying to get weapons because someone shot you in the face when you were looking for a weapon because you died when you were looking for weapons
sound a bit repetitive
well this game is repetitiveanother feature this game is missing that i much enjoy is the ability to choose bots not just four or five different skill levels but really being able to pick who they are and their individual skill levelsif you are unlike me and dont happen to mind a limited control over your game maybe you will like this game but may i also point out that several of the positive reviews for this game are for the pc version
something is apparently lacking from the ps version and since i have never played the pc version i am unable to tell you what the certain something isit is a good game overall however if you want a good creat of boxer this is not what you want
i for one would like to have a decent creat a boxer
this one doesnt even beat the greatest heavywieghts creat a boxer
they had to scan in people which to me was a total bad ideai hope ea sports makes  major improvements on  versionalot better creat of boxer
maby a creat of managertrainercut man
creat female boxers
larger line up
 all star boxers my 
get back to the basics and allow a  rank heavywieght league maby  so  other people can be on at the same time and if they wanna pass you there gonna have to beat yah
and  allow defending the championship beltthese are what keep knockout kings from becoming the greatest boxing game evermost have claimed it works on ps but this one does not for any of my ps games
meh mehhell you need it to play games and that is the only reason you need one of these third party controllers are better and not as flimsy but most wont work with your ps so your stuck with the duel shock  my main problems with this thing is how breakable it you cant squeeze it to hard accidently drop it because it will break it has bappened to me many times you must be really careful with it or you will be stuck payin the outrageous price twenty bucks which is too much for how breakable it is
other than it worksthe playstation controller is nice
however the nintendo  user would remember that the n controller was just a snazzy maybe even more so
the xbox controller is like a brick when compared to both
the ps delivered on a vibrating dual shock controller as standard with the unit
this controller feels great with the thumb pads  thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement
suddenly in  four years after the ps was released games like metal gear solid iii snake eater and god of war improve on this thumb pad function with the new minigames feature
the controller has been given new life because of thisthe big negative is the problem that sony ps controllers are extremely poor quality
this controller for all its design will give you a dual shock
first of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break
drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the l l or r r wing buttons
even if you dont drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming
the next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw
adding up the cost of each controller i could easily have bought myself another ps and then some more
the cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink
i have never seen one that managed to remain straight
also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you dont need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of itfor all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust
i have used a very similar logitech cordless rumblepad  for the pc that is the same design as the ps controller and that is a proper robust model
just comparing the two side by side makes the ps controller look like it was developed in the ussr in the early s or something
the fact that sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic ps controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the ps unit
it is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust
i hope sony get it right with the ps next time
make these controllers more robust please
the ps controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the ps down badlyto all that purchase preowned products
please make sure you know the item works so you do not have to return it
this memory card that i just bought does not even work
i just had to go buy another one that actually does
i would advise that you purchase through a amazon fulfilled vendor and not anyone else
my kid was so upset at the fact that this item didnt workdont bother with this one
this game is no way near as polished as madden   i think the only people who will enjoy this game are those who are diehard fans of the game day series
the gameplay presentation and style is actually very similar to the previous generation game days but the game just goes downhill in terms of presentation and graphics
for the first time there simply is no comparison between madden and gameday
madden   hands downive been buying football games since the nes days
as the gaming revolution brought us more and more graphics the difference between todays games evolves around gameplay
gameday  is an average game at best
in the two times that ive played this game i notices several errors
first my st louis rams roster is a complete mess
they had my defensive ends lined up in the defensive tackle position and vice versa
they have the wrong personel returning kickoffs phroel and punts bruce
the qb when he steps back and throws the ball to the right his arm slings left
it seems clear to me that  rushed to finish the game and they over looked many of the small details that are important to the quothardcorequot gamers like myselfnfl gameday  bad graphics playstation  graphics on the playstation system ok
gameplaymadden  the best graphics yet for anything even computer has to be the best gameplay of any football game yeti saw a review of nfl gameday  in a playstation magazineand it showed a picture of a quarterback throwing the football the football as it left the quarterbacks hands traveled righthis hand was throwing to the left
whats wrong with this picture
i dont like putting games down but buy madden  first then rent gameday  aftercompare then write a review for boththis game in one word is quotbadquot it just doesnt have enough going for it to get over  stars
it is a button smasher and should not appeal to any real gamers who have any respect for their skills
if you have no skills and cant do anything besides button mashing i recommend this game to you you loser with no reaction time and no idea how to play a game
but here ill explain the generous  stars ive given this game  its beautful
the graphics are beautiful and so are some of the characters g but that doesnt and never should
make up for the awful gameplay
firstoff theres the awful slow control characteristic of fighting games
then theres the button mashing
being a gamer who relies on speed i brought me fast moves and strategy to bear on my younger sister  and i was demolished for it
she literally set her controller on the ground and began to smack it and she beat my arse
my recommendation is against this game no matter how sexy the girls and how good the graphicsim primarily a d fighting fan that decided to try this for cheap
i put it in for  season plays  just didnt like it
maybe ill get around to it again someday  reviese my review but for now ive got a neogeo battle colliseum tourney to finish  king of fighters  lined up after that so its not a priority at allfollowing the trend of gundam games in america battle assault is terrible
there are though two ways to look at it as a gundam product and as a fightin gameas a gundam product the game is terrible because bandai should be pushing the gundam wing series further seeing as its the only series televised
their last minute replacement of the rx with the wing gundam which by the way plays identically to the zeta gundam shows their desire to market the game in america to the toonami show audience
the poor kids wanting to see deathscythe face off against tallgeese will be confused when they can choose from several mecha never seen in americaas a fighting game this product is just plain awful
all of the gundams have identical moves with identical button input and it appears that most of the damage dealing system is based on luck
poor area recognition is a problem as is poor control
bandais attempt at realism with slowmoving mechs only serves to make the game worse
the ammo system for the projectile weapons is futile and ultimately needlessly limiting
the plotline isok i wont start on the plot
the hidden characters are uninspired and not very useful or fun to play
the regular characters are horribly unbalanced with several characters obviously stronger and more effective than other ones
the multiplayer is uninspired
the graphics are lacking sorely
the music is terriblein short this game would be good if it a had gone into development  years earlier and been released  years ago b featured more characters music and themes from the wing series c been fine tuned and playtested before release and d been cheaper
this game isnt worth  much less i recall playing this game years agoalmost a decade
this game featured a cool cast of characters but thats itfor gundam fans it may have been somewhat of a treat simply because of the cast of characters and the gundam title slapped on however this gundam game is more like a slap across the face
the story is drab the gameplay is a little uninspired and generic almost a copy of the older d dragon ball z fighting gameswhich were also pretty poor as wellreplaced with gundam characters the game is horribly unbalanced and the voice acting was subpar
this was the first in a line of three gundam fighting games to be horrible and the trilogy goes downhill with each sequelprosfun for gundam fanslots of gundamsconsgeneric fighteranother game using a known name and attaching to a bad gameunbalancedi highly only recommend this game to hardcore gundam fansand even then i warn you to rent the game first if you must try it outwhy is it when developers unleash a franchise game they tend to get lazy and contemptuous with their design
for years ive been waiting for a good gundam game so it was with great excitement that i launched into this game
what bandai delivered is a game that has great visuals and a wonderful cast of characters from past and present gundam series but a fighting game that is lukewarm at best absolutely horrendous at worstbadly balanced characters is the worst aspect of this game
ive finished the game with every character by now but every time i have to fight quotpsycho gundam mkiiquot its still one of the most unpleasantly illbalanced fights ive ever come across
i know some gamers equate difficulty with fun and unfairness with challenge but fighting a computer character whose every hit takes off about eight times more energy than you do isnt exactly my idea of fun and im not talking about a psycho crusherstyle onetimeonly super move either
even among the usable characters zeong possibly my favourite gundam character ever and quin mantha are quite weak but theo is lopsidedly powerfulthere arent that many playing options either  the vs mode doesnt offer that many more characters to choose from the story mode has laughable generic japanese anime cliche dialogue quotim as tough as they comequot quotill destroy youquot etc
 and the ending is so flimsy i wouldve rather not had any ending at allbeing a huge gundam fan i still give this game an extra star
based on gameplay alone this is a real stinker
the only point of recommendation is really for the characters
sure its fun to play as sazabi or zaku ii but does that make up for a very bad fighting engine dirtpoor response and careless design
not for meive had  pss so far and none of the blue discs seem to play in them
the first ps i had i tried to play tribes that didnt work
then my second ps i tried to play ico
the graphics were good ill give you that but my ps has a hard time loading everything up
ill give this game  stars overall because of the graphis in the cutscenes that i did see
as far as gameplay goes couldnt tell you the thing wouldnt work
i recommend renting this game first to make sure your ps is capable of reading the blue discsi wanted to like this gamereally i did
i love fantasybooksgamesmovies etc
and the concept for ico is a good one
but man this game is painfully boringand slow
its one of the most boring games i have ever played
for hardcore puzzle lovers onlythis game was a very fast easy boring game
it wasnt fun because most of the game was clips from the star wars movies
the only reason i gave it two stars was because it would show some excitment to young begining playersi bought one when they came out and they were better than the gameboy and gameboy color but not gameboy advancethe gba has a sharper screen much better graphics and soundit is smaller and more comfortable takes less batteries and lasts longer on those batteries
also i dont know of any game gear games that are  and  player capable so you couldnt and certianly never will in the future play awesome multiplayer games like mario kart mario advance advance wars doom and the new zelda game with  player support i forgot the name of it
it really makes no sense why anyone would want one of these nowadays unless your really poor and ghettothis game is very strange
ive never seen such strong elements in an overall pretty lousy game
with the quotstrong elementsquot i mean the fights
these fights cause a huge adrenalinerush
there are a lot of moves and it looks and plays very good
but there are a lot of bad things about this gamefor example the overall gameplay is very bad
 levels long youll have to pull a switch go through an opened door whack some baddies and pull a switch again and go through a door again and you get my pointthis game has also got one of the worst saveoptions ever known to mankind
the game saves automatically at certain points but youll have to complete the level because if you restart the game the savepoints are gone
this is only done because if you could save yourself youll finish it in about  hours
but theres something even worse after completing  levels i took a break and when i came back i accidentally pressed quotnew gamequot
no problem i thought just load my old game again but the ampamp game erased my saves
the whole city trembled of the scream that left my mouth hmmm maybe only the neighbourhood the graphics are not bad but very boring
the levels are completely noninteractiveits a shame that bungie put such a beautiful fightingsystem in such a lousy game
so dont buy this gameoni should have a lot of appeal its got a pseudoanime look welldone d characters a great handtohand fighting system
unfortunately its got a horrible aiming system for many of the guns an idiotic save game system and wildly varying difficulty
and the character design for konoko in the anime opening is  ugly  varies within the movie itself and  looks nothing like the character as drawn either on the box or the d polygonal konoko
most of all this game has none of the gameplay magic found in bungies other games particularly myth and myth iia little explanation of the problems
the save game system is easy enough you dont know when its going to save there are relatively few save points and the save points frequently dont tie into the game world so youll be stuck fighting some difficult point over again if you die
the aiming system for guns varies with the gun but for the pistols and submachine guns its virtually impossible to hit anyone thankfully thats true of the enemies too
theres also almost no ammo to be found in the game world
its easier to lure enemies around a corner and go handtohand
more fun too
the difficulty level is annoying at first its pathetically easy later on you start facing three or four enemies some of whom appear out of nowhere while youre fightingfrankly bungie bungled this game
coulda been great came out poori am an avid mystrivenmystiii fan
i bought realmyst to see the advanced graphics added to itie daynightrainsunand special effects
the game is really choppy
i even advanced my system but it didnt help
i believe you shouldnt have to go any kind of frustration when playing a game and this one had a lot of choppiness and delayed reactions even after i upgraded my system
too frustratingdont get me wrong i consider myself to be a pretty diehard myst fan and i love all of my fellow reviewers with as much of my soul as i can muster but i feel the need to issue a complaint about this wretched piece of junk that calls itself a gamewhen i first saw myst i thought it was the most amazing thing i had ever laid eyes on i was reminded of la jetee the old chris marker film in which we are given thirty minutes of still photographs telling a love story across time space death and reality
the film as well as the game opened the door for a whole new kind of narrative one that was not reliant on the spectacle of motion
so when i saw and purchased this game i was weary of its potential offense
my weariness was not in vain as i asked myselfdoes it need to move
just because a picture is worth a thousand words does not at all mean that fifteen or more pictures a second sixty seconds a minute sixty minutes an hour nine hours a typical playing session does not mean that the game is worth up to and including  million words
frankly i can only think of two pure drivelanyone ever hear of the kuleshov effect
the homeric exposition
the triptych manifest
the neurological function of visual closurenowell basically they all refer to your brains ability to put two and two together to make four
you see one image immediately followed by another without viewing any of the action that exists between them just like when in a movie our pov changes from one character facing right to another character faving left
this make sense to us because by our brains ability to fill in gaps in the action we assume that these two characters are looking at each otherwhat you cant tell what has happened between two images of a library in which one image shows the libraryas well as its surroundingsas appearing closer to you in the frame than in the previous image
youve moved forward okay perhaps im being a little too cruel but it just annoys me to no end that there are those out there who feel that making still images move rather than simply appreciate the beauty they present to you in stillness somehow enhances the visual awe of art
maybe if you have only a passing interest in the myst mythos and you enjoy solving puzzles far more than viewing such fine specimens of computer aesthetics perhaps you will enjoy this game otherwise stick with the original and its sequelsim sorry i was angry its just that as a filmmaker looking to altnerative moldbreaking techniques of entertainment i felt the need to uphold the integrity of the miller brothers and the good sir markergreat concept but if you dont mind the game play slowing you down because the playstation cant keep up oh and by the way the person you are chasing doesnt slow down then its a great game the will just frustrate the hell out of youthe frame rate is realy bad and the pop up is pure death
auto destruct was a good game it came out in  but it didnt have this much damn pop up
the first driver felt like it was based in th s but this felt like it was based in the s but with s cars
its just ugly
ill sell it if i can find anyone who wants itlittle phrases describe this game better than quotwaste of timequot
once players get past the needlessly lengthy and unskippable  minutes of opening cinematics theyre treated to some of the worst gameplay realism and overall fun on the otherwise fantastic playstation console
each level is filled with unnecessarily difficult quirks ranging from invincible opponents to hidden obstacles
a picket fence now has to power to halt a speeding automobile dead in its tracks as does a small dumpster
one level asks you to highjack a truck getting to mention that this  ton hauler can outaccellerate and handle your ton sports car
adding to the quotfun factorquot is the unwavering needlessly impervious opponent that starts directly behind you pushing you out of control almost instantly
as a sort of cherry on top youre given a time limit
what fun
i enjoyed the original driver and found myself hoping for something similar here
alas no such luck
dont make the same mistake i did youd be better off spending your money elsewheredriver  is one of my all time favorite games so of course i went out and bought driver  as soon as it came out
when i played it i couldnt believe that this was made by the same company that made the first outstanding game
the graphics are hardly impressive the control is loose the speed is sluggish and its just not a user friendly game
at some points you end up hating the game because you have to restart so much each time you fail a mission
they made this game extremely hard
my friend is a gaming fanatic
he plays games all day everyday
hes an expert at them
but even he couldnt get past the first disc of this game
weve both given up
now if im going to play driver  its just for the free drives around the cities
im looking forward to a driver  on playstation  but i hope infogrames will fix all the problems this sequel haddriver  was a good game when it came out
however now that playstation  and grand theft auto  have been released there is literally no reason to bother with this game
the graphics look bad even for ps
the frame rate is choppy and the missions are so ridiculous that you will find yourself doing them over and over again
there are many annoying glitches as well like falling through the street for no reason game over and cops that smash your car over or through walls and buildings trapping your vehicle in them
also the vehicles seem to drive very slowly on the streets
pedestrians run from your car to avoid being hit and if your car does hit them they pass through the vehicle as if through thin airi will give some credit to this game the quottake a ridequot feature allows you to drive freely through very realistic renderings of chicago havana las vegas and rio
the cops however will chase you for no reason and smash your car until it is destroyed that is unless you can outrun thembefore the game was released everytime the name quotdark cloudquot was mentioned youre bound to see the name quotzelda killerquot in there too
well im sorry but its not
zelda has a better story and better gameplay
ture the quotgeoramaquot  feature is cool you get to build your own towns and place anything whereever you want but its just not enough
most of the game youre going through dungines looking for the pieces to build the towns
this could have been tolerable it the dungines had different looking rooms
they dont
they graphics arent what you would call a second generation
they would have been more impresive if this game came out when the ps first came out
zelda is so much better because zelda had so much more to do than just dungine crawling
it had a bunch of secret things and mini games and it had a big world for you to explore
dark cloud has none of that
there isnt even an overworld or whatever you call it
you just go straight to the towns
and in each town you have to find the stupid pieces and rebuild the towns then repeat the process
now for the combat
its totally like zelda except you constantly have to go and buy repair powder because guess what your weapons have a ceratain amount of hits before the break and disappear
also you constantly have to go and drink water because you get thristy
sure its realistc but we get games to escape to a fantasy to do things we cant do and to have fun
you want thrist
go run  miles nonstop
the characters dont look unique at all
the main character looks like link except for the hat
and the flying god looks like the flying dog from the neverending story if youve ever seen that movie
this game was interesting for the first  minutes but when i saw what you basically have to do for the rest of the game it got old pretty quickly
i suggest you rent the game before you see if you can look past all these consive played dozens of games in the this genre and while this might have been great in its day every mechanic in dark cloud is done better by another title ive enjoyed more
compared against other mystery dungeon runners on ps the nightmare of druaga is much better and baroque just blows this game out of the water on style points
if you are an adult gamer who likes scifi and wants a unique mystery dungeon experience buy baroque ps instead
repetitive is the games theme
graphics arent varied  only tunnels and the same rooms with no secret tunnelsareas that make the genre surprising and enjoyable
azure dreams on ps does this so much better  the lock on makes the camera go crazy and crazy cameras give me a headache
so because this function was useless i was forced into clumsily seeking after enemies who often got easy hits on me and that experience quickly bored and annoyed me because i fighting the controls not the monsters
i only played for a few hours before i decided there were randomized mystery dungeon games i enjoy more with similar themes
this is no zelda heck its not even as fun as dark legion vampire apocalypse or chocobos dungeon
dont buy this onewell level  had to start somewhere
so they gave us this a blend of a roguelike dungeon crawler and soul blazer town rejuvenating
this game has its charms and in the beginning is actually kind of fun
crafting your own weapons and designing the town layouts are the strongest highlights
however about midway through the charm wears off and the formula becomes all too tedious
basically level  took what should be a  hour game and used time wasting methods to stretch that out to  hours
to see things through to the end youll need a mountain of patience and a bit of a masochistic streak especially for the last boss
supposedly dark cloud  aka dark chronicle fixes all the problems this game has
so i would suggest skipping this one and going straight to its sequel insteadi give the graphics a good grade
the story an f this game needed more dialog
i did like how it was a lot like soulblazer or actraiser building the city
the music gets repetitive
i dont really understand why this game got good reviews
its mediocre at bestdark cloud is a zeldaactraiser hybrid that seems to try too hard to be perfect on the town buidling part and neglects some things in the dungeon battles
for one having to throw powder on your weapon to keep it from breaking is stupid
what idiot thought that idea up
plus the weapon building system is long and complex and not really explained well enough
they should just have better weapons lying in treasure chests as you go alongone general word of advice
whenever you see a game that says quotrandomly generated dungeonsquotrun
a few high profile failures have tried this anarchy online anyone
the problem with random dungeons is just thatthe whole game seems random
there is no sense of fighting thru the underlings to get to the quotbossquot
yes there is a boss at the end of every dungeon but there is no progression thats immersivethe graphics are also very quotcutesyquot
this is a good game for children under  or so would be a nice first quotrpgquot for someone but for serious gamers it becomes very boring very quicklyby far the most quotfunquot to be had in this game is goofing around arranging the towns you have to put back together
unfortunately most of your time is spent in random dungeons fighting random mobs and it all begins to look the same very quicklyrental onlyi dont really understand why this game got so much hype really
its nothing special
there really isnt anything great about this gamegrand turismo is the best racing game on earth
the cars are exactly like the real thing
the reflections onto the car are very realistic as if you were driving it for real
the creators of the game made the speed handling acceleration and braking exactly as it would be in real life
they have millions of cars in the game like my pesonal favorite the viper gts
like the first one the drivers test part is complicated
this time there is a line for the drivers test part that tells you what to do with the diferent coloring of the line
they have these new tracks for of road races
the tracks are somewhat complicated yet fun
so if youre a racing game freak then youll love this gamethe graphics are stupendous
the images are great
the detail is fantastic
but it isnt any fun to playthe reason for this is gts overburdensome menu system
you spend so much time tweaking your cars and going through the tremendous amount of menus and sub menus in order to qualify or enter a race that the whole process kills the fun of the game
gt is basically gt with superior graphics
the courses are the samejust better lookingqualifiying for licenses is also a big chore
while it was fun during the first two gts this third one is just another step that removes you from the action of racing
the experience is frustratingi had high hopes for gt but it fell way short of being entertaining
if a racing game prevents you from racing then what is the point
the game is beautiful graphically
there is no doubt about this
however the game is pure frustration because you do more menu navigating then actual racing
if racing is your interest check out wipeout fusion as an alternativeif you like advertisements at every turn on every vehicle in allmost every song played and know how to for real really race a car down a buteiful looping course with cutt out cardboard fans
then for all means purchase this game ill use it for charcol to barbaque some nicely portion pieces of slaughtered cowi think this game has gotten good reviews
i dont see the appeal
it is just a castle defense game
nothing really special about itthis game is regarded as a minor classic
it put its thenyoung designer on the map and became one of the bestselling adventure titles of its era
it certainly has great production values an epic story plenty of conversation and plenty to do
other reviewers do a great job heaping praise on it so ill just skip to the bad partthe three basic elements that arguably make an adventure game tick are story characters and atmosphere
so lets see a rundownstory the thirteenth floor and the matrix two films with a similar basic idea both came out about a year before the game was released but the parallel universes premise was already considered ageold in the s labyrinth ultima  etc
this game turns out to be yet another variation on the theme
nothing groundbreakingcharacters and dialogs this is a biggie
in terms of classic adventure games it apparently takes a ron gilbert or a jane jensen to dream up memorable heroes and supporting players and this game simply doesnt have what it takes
the characters and their dialogs are either lifeless or even worse
in fact april ryan of the longest journey may well be the single most irritating protagonist in a major adventure game ever
for me anyway
the author clearly made a grave mistake by turning her both  and a bland partygirl
her incessant cries and whines of duh
or that is so
uncool
along with her overemphasized hipster attitude were probably designed to appeal to well fellow hipsters i guess
monkey island  or gabriel knight did not resort to similar gimmicks and still drew in quite a fanbase
guybrush threepwood in particular was  without being annoying
gabriel knight was a brooding charmer
zak mckracken was something of a lonely young bachelor
my point is that if you cant grow attached to the protagonist in an adventure game your experience goes downhill quick
thats what happened to me here
april ryan is the kind of vapidgirlintightpants that i wouldnt want as a steady girlfriend  and even less so as a heroine in an epic adventure game i intend to play through to the end
she does write a diary throughout the story but the things she writes in it read like bits of throwaway chitchat from some high school party
the diary feature adds no layer of muchneeded depth to the proceedings because april has no layer of depth
in turn none of her friends or associates are fleshed out either we get two runofthemill best friends who have nothing substantial to say or contribute at allatmosphere starts great goes downhill once i realized the earlier points
in other words the combined lack of a tight original story and that of fullblooded endearing characters result an inevitable lack of a strong atmosphereto sum up i wanted to like this game as fans of elaborate and seriousminded oldschool adventure games are not exactly spoiled since the late s to mid s boom of those great lucasarts sierra and legend titles
i think the longest journey was a nice try but i couldnt warm up to its semirecycled story and especially to its blaseacute hipster heroine
so its purely up to personal taste
your mileage may vary especially if you regard yourself a hipster i suppose
deck tassel cronkitethis quotgamequot hardly felt like a game
its more like a walkthrough movie
check that
its more like a mediocre walkthrough novel replete with unentrhalling dialogue and silly ridiculous puzzlesthe storyline is inventive and interesting and it could have been a masterpiece but the script writing and voice acting are so dreadful that it is very difficult to even care whats going to happen at the end
when i say that the voice acting is bad i dont mean its the ordinary quotbadquot for a computer game i mean that its pitiful even for a computer game
the main character speaks all of her lines like a six year old child from sesame street
this looks extra absurd with all of the profanity in the game who wrote this script  eddie murphy
i cant believe how much profanity there was in this game
it doesnt fit in at all
imagine the teletubbies saying the quotfquot word to each other constantly and you will have a feel for what the dialog of this game is likemore than half of the puzzles have no logic whatsoever to them
this is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the game
some of the solutions are terribly obvious and others make no sense whatsoever
this game suffers pretty badly from the quotyou cant solve puzzle a until you have talked to person b about problem cquot disease that strikes bad puzzle games
it also has a lot of puzzles where you only have to keep clicking on the  items in your inventory until you guess the right one
good puzzles are the key to a good puzzle game
this one has very fewas far as graphics and sound go
sound is very good and so is the music
the graphics and animation are very mediocre and i think that i am being complementary
i cant believe all of the reviews that are saying what great graphics this game has
give me a break
on almost every screen you are a small figure in a big environment with only about two or three little things to look at or interact with
it might have been good three or four years ago but it is subpar compared to the superb environments created in games nowadays like thief and deus exquotthe longest journeyquot should have been a novel
it was a disappointment as a gamethis is not a game
it is a soap opera with dialogue taking up all of the game play time
granted it is very well done but i am at chapter  wondering if i have the patience to continue with the overly repetitve nature of the quottalking threadsquot needed to proceed to the next scene
this is really a movie with the pretense of being an interactive game
granted it is a well done computer mouse click movie but why pretend it is a gameto be fair i am male so nonstop chatting about everyting i see is not something that entertains me
i guess this is a chick flick sort of gameif you love to hear people blather on and on and on and on and on and on and on ad nauseum with nothing happening in between this is for youi feel like giving this one star due to the absolutely ridiculous amount of dialogue one must plod through fully  of the pretend game play but i will be generous and give it  extra star for at least being creative
but i still insist this is not really a game but a movienintendo in my words have gone downhill since the mid to late s and now theyre mostly gone from the gaming industry
i have to admit though in the s they were huge
the nintendo entertainment system nes you can never diss
i liked the nes so much and even when the super nes came out i still played with my old buddy
i do like sega sony and microsoft but now i really have to interest with nintendo
the nintendo  was an okay system
it used cartridges and i wish nintendo would have realized that now you can have disks
psone was a bit system while the nintendo  was a bit system
i really do not see the big difference with the graphics and i like psones graphics better than the nintendo
nintendo  has all the classic games as seen in the s
arcade games and mario games are so old and i think nintendo should go more to adults now
for children the nintendo  and the gamecube are very good systems because there is no violent games or anything
when you get to be a teenager you start wanting violent games grand theft auto
all around the nintendo  with the wierd controller hasnt satisified me but if you like it thats your opinionthis game is so great it doesnt have  player thats how awesome it is
i hate mario games
mario  to me at least is the best one
where peach can hover an luigi jumps all highthe wormlight sounds good doesnt it
quotyou can play your game boy color in the dark
isnt that coolquot yes my friends it is cool
that is if it didnt use your gbas batteries
no big deal you say
what would your impression be if a drunk came up to your door and freeloaded off you for the rest of your life
there
now that we share the same point of view do not buy this light
it will destroy your batteries life and trust me you dont want thati bought this memory card yesterday
i took it home and popped it init did not work it was broken
took it back and got another one and it was brokenso i got the sony one and it works fine
i mean dont get me wrong the shipment could have been knocked around but  out of  broken
my friend has one and a sony one
it seems that the sony one loads twice as fast as this one and its easier to get out of the playstation
this one is a little tight in the console
so just because its  dollars less dont think it is just as good
if you ask me i would spend the extra five bucks and get a memory card that will work when you need it tothanx alot and happy gameing outherethe most important question concerning this product is does it work
the answer is yes and nowhen i first got it and connected it to my cable modem the setup disk work perfectly and i was on in minutes
sweetthen i tried to set it with my router
i used the linksys befsr router probably the most ubiquitous router in the home market
due to its monopoly i was also using the largest broadband provider  comcast oh i how i hate them
so in terms of home networking its the most standard setup around
anyway i setup the router to work and tested it with my windows  machine
thats right the router and cable modem worked with  year old technology
yet the setup disk for this brand new network adapter did not recognize the connection
its a simple dhcp connection that really should not pose any problems but it doesi searched the web for a little while but i could not find the right settings
the sony website is absolutely useless
to get my ps online im now forced to move my cable modem to my living room and i cannot have my computer and ps connected at the same time
sony should have tested it betterthis game is not my particular interest
more involved than i would like to have it
and easier less thought provking game is what i was looking forwhy spend money on something that does nothing for you except possibly make your ps look better
the ps is in no danger of falling over when it in horizontal so whats the point of putting it verticle now you controller ports detract from the look even more than having it horizontal
spend this money towards a new gamei was going to buy this way back when but i decided to rent it first
beat the game in less than an hour
not worth the cash
at least the xbox version has online playas a huge fan of parts   amp  i had high expectations
granted game play is with much the same physics model amp powerups
there are plenty of new cars available with a smattering of the good old cars too
curiously absent is die anna and her car
you must play as the character max damagebut the sticking point for me is the peds in part   theyre hostile
no bikini girls amp grandmas here
more like crazed green mutants wielding lengths of pipe wholl attack en masse and pound you on the fender until youre toastjust try stopping your vehicle in the midst of a group of crazed leadpipe hooligans youll seetdr was coded in australia and theres an quotozziequot level where you can run down roos in quotmadquot max rakatanskis mvp interceptor or humongouss custom ride from road warrior
theres a thunderdome of sorts and a bartertown as well
zztop seem to be driving one monster truck
these little touches are nice but the lack of innocent peds screaming amp pleading in terror as in parts   amp  is too great to overcome
the peds in tdr hurl epithets about your mamas sexual history along with their molotovs
bring back the grannies with walkers as a longtime fan of the carmageddon series i have been and remain quite disappointed with this third incarnation no matter how hard i try to like it
carmageddon has always been about running amuck on city streets in construction zones and through mountain communities running over cows and men and grannies with stretchers and pulverizing your opponents
carmageddon is all about racing challenging missions and frustration
if you try to play the game as it is apparently designed to be played you cannot possibly have any fun
you start out with a limited time and have to struggle to add any bonus time before your experience is aborted way too early
the map feature which was quite good in carmageddon  is cartoonish and aggravating
the powerups and surprise bonuses along the way arent very impressive or extensive although the designers unfortunately felt compelled to leave the silly bouncy bouncy feature in the game
the racing environments are nowhere near as extensive as i was used to which is a further criticism i have of this game
the only new touch i really liked is the tendency of pedestrians to jump around on one leg after you put the other one out of commission overall though running over pedestrians here is just not as much fun as it should bethe fatal flaw here is the emphasis on objective missions
it takes so long to figure out the challenge race and somehow miraculously complete it that your disgust with the whole business overweighs any excitement you may have about finally getting a chance to race on a new track
it is hard enough to figure out what you are supposed to do let alone do it in the minimal time allotted
once you think you have it another extra requirement pops up to dash your hopes if you could save a race or challenge during the action it would do much to help alleviate the problem
this game really betrays the wonderfully fun carmageddon tradition and makes this a game quite unable to offer enough positives to outweigh the many negatives
the result is the death of a great gaming serieshonestly the cables that come with the system are fine
i wasted money on this onei bought this cable to hook up my playstation  with a promedia dd digital decoder
the problem is that the cable i bought didnt produce  dolby digital or dts just stereo
read the reviews for the xbox lightwave  cable they are the same cable except for the color
some people maybe havent figured it out yet because they dont use a digital decoder but all they are hearing is stereo sound
im pretty upset because i sent my digital decoder back to klipsch thinking that was the problem but it was actually the cable
by the way the customer service at klipsch is simply the best they produced high quality equipment not like over at monster cable
so beware
if you are paying big  for a cable shouldnt it at least work or do what it say it doesmaybe im just a rock but how are you supposed to connect your system to both a tv and a audio recieverdecoder
there is not enough play in the end to allow the video cable to go to the tv and the audio cables to go to my sound system
so after trying to slice the individual cables apart with my kbar i finally gave up and just used regular av cablesthe cable does offer superior picture and sound quality as the product claims
there is a flaw with the cable however
for almost money you would expect a better connector from the cable to the ps system
the monster cable connector is not quite a tight enough fit which causes it to make a bad contact
the symptoms you might get are flickering on the screen and slight loss in sound or sound quality before the connection is lost without warning while playing
not only is this annoying but it is also frustrating when you hit a tense spot in a game and then have to pause it to correct the problem
i would have expected a lot more for my money
i should mention that my ps is always stationary and is not moving at all when the connection is lost
this situation while aggrivating is not all that bad but i would recommend a different cable for anyone who has all of their av equipment jammed in a cabinet and cannot get to the connectors easilywho said this was scary
mustve been a real whoosie the game is awkward in its controls and its annoying trying to recharge
the graphics are good but scary
cmon if you think this is scary you mustve led a sheltered life i love exciting games and this one bored me i wouldnt reccommend it to anyone who has a short attention spantake a look at the date of my review because as of this date many magazines and websites have claimed that anarchy online has fixed most of its problems
however i just joined the game and am unable to play for longer than  minutes without getting kicked off
yet i still play
and i still get kicked off
over and overit is a shame that a game this much fun is so difficult to play
i will tell you that i witnessed many other players who didnt seem to have any difficulties at all playing so maybe you might not either  but it is still a gamblebugs aside this game is brilliant
brilliant in a thousand little ways that only a massive online rpg can be
i know because ive played the other games before and i can see how ao has reduced the repedativeness and boredom of some of these other games
custom missions give players their own private dungeons so they can play without competition for loot
apartment buildings give every player their own space right off the bat
various transportation networks give different professions different abilities to travel and  major factions have split the world apart such that one character will never be able to see everything
add to this little things like built in scripts macros reduced healing time blah blah blah if you dont know what im talking about just take my word for it ao is the best online game there is if it only werent hampered by its bugs
veteran players most of the requests ive seen for other mmorpgs are in ao in some form or another
check it out but at your own riskanarchy online invaded my life for several months unfortunately
it was my first mmorpg so this game took me by storm at first and exploring the beautiful world of rubika was a long venture in and of itselfthe skill system is great combat is genuinely suspenseful and fun for the most part and the people ingame were helpful and mature most of the timebut ultimately ao became nothing more than some idle chat with others and running on the leveling treadmill
i would go to a mission booth run to mission cave finish it go to shop wash rinse and repeat
it can take a couple of hours early on to level up and as it goes on it can take several hours at a time
i felt like i was getting nowhere and the missions were incredibly repetitive and dull
all of them looked the same and behaved the same and you always fought the same handful of creatures or peopleto add to the frustration funcom constantly tinkered with the games balance almost literally ruining the game with one patch it created so many new bugs and problems people jumped ship big timei joined a guild which was nothing more than a private shopping chat channel and team matchmaker
pvp action is filled with nolifers who quottweakquot their characters with the help of higher level players and quotimplantsquot and funcom has let this go on since the beginningthe game is repetitive frustrating buggy still and has the worst lag of any online game ive ever played that alone was enough to make me quit
i wanted to like the game and make it a longterm habit but the game wouldnt let meand judging from the new quotideasquot being considered for the game this summer i dont see any hope for this game at allwhile anarchy online is an exciting new concept in online gaming that could replace the standard swords and sorcerors in the current quotbig quot online games asherons call ultima online everquest this game is not ready to go onlineanarchy online is another online game that was rumored to have been released before it was ready to help the cashstretched company obtain quick income
i played the beta version up until the week before the games release and while i was impressed with the scifi theme and new online concepts such as everyone owning a house for their possessions even with the smaller number of users in the beta stage the servers could not take the strains of running the gamein other words if you purchase this game right now you can expect huge lags this is the game pausing because the internet connections arent working properly
 resolution problems and other frustrating dilemmas
these difficulties are even more frustrating when you consider that youre paying a monthly fee
during the games initial release the company did not start charging accounts because of the problems but as i write this review the company has decided to start charging accounts which has many current owners of the game angry as they have yet to experience a quotworkingquot gameit looks like a great concept for an online game but the best bet would be to wait awhile and explore internet sources to find out the current state of the gamein theory combining capcoms and snks characters into one fighting game would be an awesome idea
both companies are held in high regard when it comes to the fighting genre but capcom vs snk suffers from too many gameplay and animation problems
first off the gameplay favors snk heavily
capcoms characters are watered down to only  attack buttons because of this and that alone is enough to disappoint me
the snk characters remain intact for the most part though save for a few missing special moves
plus the whole quotratioquot thing being able to choose how many characters you can play as based on their rank is just a confusing mess
the animation is also cut tremendously and the whole game is set at a low resolution so that each character looks pixelated
i believe the bottom line is that if you are a devoted capcom fan you will most likely be let down by capcom vs snk
if you like the snk games however such as king of fighters and fatal fury you may want to check this game outafter reading a lot of the reviews here it convinced me that this next version of rouge sqaudren was just as good or even better then rouguewell ive played rougue squadren many many times again and again over the years and i just recently bought this game expecting a game thats just as good but i have been let down dramaticlyfirst off
you need to know passwords to access things to help you to get through a lot of the levels its too hard without them
the game play is sluggish at times but a lot of the feel of rs is lost in this version
there is no veiw from inside the cockpit in this one eithersecondly there is hardly any ships you can use
even when you unlock all the crafts there is only the naboo fighter which is in rouge squadren if you use the code to unlock it and its just the same as an xwing
there is a naboo bomber
which is just like the bombers in rs only its a four engine naboo plane very slow hard to monover and almost useless at times
there is a naboo police fighter or something that is just a blue naboo fighter with less capabilities you can also unlock the sith fighter which is probably the best one to use on mission thats you can use it in
on other levels there is ones where you use speeders theres  speeder roughly the same with diffrent speeds and guns but all handle about the same plus you can unlock an att tank which is fun but not helpfull in some areas
and there is a boat sort of thing you use on a couple of water levels
this game lacks fun with the ships because most of them are the same with different speeds at least rs you knew which ship was best for what and could use them on most missions this one has a few levels where you can use ships but without codes you can only use  per level and when you get the medals you can have about  to choose a level or  if you have codesgaining medals in this one blows because in rs you needed the infinitie lives code to win but in this one you still have to have  lives left to achieve it because even tho you wont get a game over the end stats still say you crashed or died  times which makes it annoying to stay alive and not commit suicide to get your rockets or missles back to hom ein on enemys for a much easier and quicker winwhen reading things here i thought when they said you could change ships during a mission meant during the game at any time but thats not the case at all
in a couple of the missions you start off with a ground patrol or a flight patrol and find your way to a hanger and then you select what craft you want to continue the mission with
that idea is ok i guess but doesnt make this game better then rsits very hard to see vice droids when your shooting at them
they blend in with the back ground color and there not easy to target for some reason untill your up close to themthe  bonus missions arnt much the most fun i had on one of the missions was the last one the battle above naboo
you have to take out the sheilds and radars of that ship aniken blows up from the inside
its short but not too badthere are a few changes from rs but this one is a downfall compared to it
its not as much fun there not enough crafts it would have been nice for codes to enable the falcon or tie fighter or xwings or something its imposible to get the medals above the gold rankthis game lacks the fun and adventture the last one hadwell the answer is in this game
the racing itself as a sport is nothing that makes the player happy but this game ruins any chances for atv racing
its hard to turn and all the cars stink
in freestyle mode the lamest tricks are only successful when you land it just right
the reason why i did not give it a one is because the graphics are above average and the vast  freestyle levels are nice and a little more interesting than the actual racing which will tire out after ten minutes
if you want a racing game or offroad game wait and rent something like x evo or just buy gran turismo i have no doubt that this is a totally accurate simulation of riding a  wheeler
unfortunatly the game is not fun at all
its totally slowpaced the play modes and tracks are all very similar the trickbased game is a complete letdown and the game is very difficult
after spending a week trying to get past the third track in pro mode i gave up on this game
yeah maybe inot good at video games but ssx was a billion times more fun
i struggled on some courses and eventually got through
same experience with tony hawk
this however is just not a fun gamenow this game has gotten great reviews
a lot of my freinds have it and love it
but i just dont understand why
wiping out is cool and a lot of fun on the stunt mode and thats why i gave it the  stars
racing is boring
i tjought atvs would of worked but i guess they didntbetter just stick to cars and motorcycleskeep in mind that it is an older game and that newer games have spoiled me a bitthe graphics are ok at best even when comparing it to other games which are about  years old
the story is lacking and the game is very linear when it comes to optionsi probably would not purchase it again
not really worth the timei really should not write a review but i am because this game did not in its description that is is not for windows i wouldnt pay  yet thats exactly what i feel like i bought after playing through squaresofts first foray into the land of the ps
yes this game has incredible graphics and wonderful sound as any movie should
what it lacks however is any sort of creativity
i mean i felt like i was playing final fight or double dragon again
square has raised the bar so much with their sparkling rpgs and it is a shame that this product managed to creep out of the warehouse
lets hope that square does better the next time as i know they willdont get me wrong  i love squares quotfinal fantasyquot rpgs and was one of the few loyal defenders of the square  dream factory fighter quotehrgeizquot
so im strongly inclined to like this rpgish slugfestbut oh my gosh is this awfulthe gameplay here is a variation on oldschool beatemups use simple fighting moves to dispatch hordes of drones move forward through a level fight a boss yada yada yada
the controls are similar to ehrgeiz and the tobal games full d movement highmiddlelow attack buttons a simple block button
but there are few combos the fighting and movement feels slow and theres some genuine cheapness to the bosses blechthe graphics both ingame and cinematics are wonderful  in fact the visuals created by the game engine are often as good as the prerendered stuff
and the story for what it is scifi action fodder is perfectly agreeable
but you cant help but think that the presentation is where all the development time went  busy as they were with all the visuals somone forgot to make sure the thing was fun to playthe core of the game is a storymode billed on the package as quotplay the action moviequot
more like watch some stuff play a little watch more play a little
whats really painful is when you die in a particularly hard battle you have to go back to the title screen reload your game from the memory card and watch or skip however many moviescenes transpired between that savepoint and the fight you want to restart youll also suffer the loadingscreen between these skipped movie scenes
you can literally play for  seconds die and spend  minutes getting back to where you werebeyond the storymode theres a person slugfest and a survival mode neither as engaging as similar modes in real fighting games like quotdoaquotdespite the awesome presentation this isnt even as good as quotdynasty warriors quot koeis far less ambitious ps beatemup
at least that game could keep the action going for longer than two minutes without becoming boring or stopping for a loading screenid love it if squares quotfinal fantasy xquot had the production values of quotthe bouncerquot but i hope it has the gameplay of quotchrono crossquot instead of this ambitous trainwrecki thought bouncer might be the perfect game in which i could sit back between the action and watch hours of beautiful square full motion video
sadly the game part of the bouncer is pretty darn boring
you fight bad guys in an old school double dragons sort of way wave after wave of them but it just isnt that much fun
no challenge no great skill required except that you must be prepared for pain from your thumb mashing the buttons for  hoursthe graphics are beautiful no beyond beautiful
these graphics are the reason i bought a ps in the first place
the story switches back and forth between rendered fmv and movies the ps generates itself and at times i cant tell what kind im watching
it doesnt matter the graphics are the best ive ever seen
however the story they tell isnt all that interesting and i always skipped a movie if i have seen it before
ultimately the weak story poor gameplay and the terrible pace from the combination of the two pretty much make the graphics uninteresting
pretty but not worth buyingdont buy this gamei will start off by saying short
 hrs max
the concept of building up your characters is nice but not worth playing through  times to max them out
also the story lines for each character arent worth playing them through either
when youve seen one youve pretty much seen them all except for a few scenes and different phrases
the graphics are nice which they should be
expected more from square but wait i usually doand they usually dontideally this is a game you would buy with  other friends each chipping in about  bucks
ideally each of you could play one of the  characters as you advance through the story
ideally this game  which is really quite eyecatching and fun to play  would last you a few weeks
unfortunately the latter  are not true and youre definitely better off splitting this game with some buddies rather than plunking down all of the cash for this yourself
i beat the game sitting down with it one night
it is an incredibly short gamethats not to say it isnt fun
i ended up playing it over and over again to buff up my characters you really have to run through the game a few times to get each of the bouncers pumped up to enjoy it
still i couldnt help but feel cheated that a game that is as expensive as this one is should have lasted longer
when i played ps games like jedi power battles the resident evil series etc they would take me  weeks at least to finish
sadly most of the quotfirst wavequot of ps games are quotwham bam thank you sonyquotlike any of the first year games this one is good for the combined fighting tactics you and the computer use to beat the bad guys
it pains me that you could not get that nd joystick to work and have a buddy at least partner up with you
if jedi power battles can do that why couldnt this game
my expectations were set for a quotteam upquot game  and this game allows up to  people to play but only in the quotmatchquot modeas with any of the new ps games the story here less coherent than a goddard film but it is fun nonetheless
some of the combat and movie sequences are really cool ill nominate dominques quotcoming out of the closetquot scene as my favoritealthough i just got done rating quotx squadquot with a  and id give quotwarlordsquot a  stars this one sadly deserves only   i would buy it used or buy it with a friend so that after the adreniline high of the game is gone and only  hours have passed youre feel that it was worth itoh this one truly has some of the most absurd quotmoviequot moments youre likely to see in a videogame
i would swear that videogame scripts and plots have a weird aestethic up there with the films of roger corman and ed wood  dialogue and plot connections so bizarre and painful that they are funnythe story begins at a bar as a bouncer named sion is beginning his shift for the day
a quiet morning is abruptly interrupted when a breakin occurs and the intruders manage to kidnap sions friend dominque
this begins a dangerous rescue mission as sion and his fellow bouncers travel far and wide in search of dominiques kidnappersthis is the setup to one of the sweetest looking games to come out in a long time
thats right bouncer produces some of the most astonsing visiuls ever
the graphics are topnotch and all the cinamas happen in real timecool stuffwhile the graphics are good the major flaw comes with the gameplay
its mindless button massing nothing more
the game could be beat by press one button the entire time
this causes the game to get boring and repetive thus making you want to turn off the gameif the gameplay was good i wouldnt have mind playing it for its  hour playtime
yep  hours and thats it
the game is way to short witch could be good or bad depending on how you look at it
good side you dont have to play this bad game that long to beat it and you could also beat it in the time you rent it
bad side its only  hours longnot worth the money at allso in the end you could rent it and beat it just to see the graphics but other than that you could advoid it all togetheri have never been a fan of this series but not because i have some bias towards ea
i like madden and other cool ea gameswanting a good baseball game for my overrated ps system i gave this game a shot
first of all the one good thing the graphics
i think it has the best graphics out of the three ps baseball gamesnow the bad if you want a p game this game may suit your need if you just want to smash homeruns after another
but for a p experience dont ever buy this thing
the batterpitcher interface has a major flaw which essentially tips the hitter of the pitch location
the end result games in the  runs are not uncommon
this is not baseballafter playing the outstanding madden  and the fast paced nhl and nba  triple play baseball for the ps is a major disappointment
first the fielding in the game is awkward and slow
it was a major mistake of ea sprots to drop the automatic fielding option in the game from previous years
second there are no historical players like in triple play   i always thought it was fun to be able to get babe ruth off the free agent market
my advice stick to last years version
the improved grphics dont make the game more funive been playing triple play baseball since the  edition
each year as baseball season rolls around ive been duped yes duped into buying the latest edition of triple play baseballnever againnow let me say this if youre not a true diehard fan of the national pastime if you dont get goosebumps at the conclusion of the of the star spangled banner if the thought of a dog and a beer and the pastoral pleasures of a  pitchers duel dont appeal to you then this game may be for youin short if youre looking for a baseball game with all the trimmings of an arcade game on steroids then you will enjoy this game
on the other hand if youre looking for a true baseball sim then youll want to stay away from this gamethere are no injuries
there are very few extra base hits
the pitcherbatter interface is simply remedial
you know exactly where the ball is going to be pitched before its thrown all you have to do is make sure your cursor is lined up right and gauge the speed
you dont have to warm up the relief pitchers
its impossible to strike out the cpu
to the other extreme on all star baseball i had  ks with greg maddux who is not a strikeout pitcher
there are no walksin addition there is no franchise mode
will we ever see a game that combines great graphics actual baseball simulation great gameplay and a franchise modeon the positive side the graphics are terrific and the controls are better than those on all star baseballsimply put all thats missing is the keg
afterall playing this game is no better than playing in an industrial league softball tournamentif youre a casual baseball fan this games for you
however if youre a baseball purist this game is not for you
unfortunately theres not a single baseball game currently out for the ps thats worth the we have to wait until this game is classified as an rpg right
well where is the rpg in it
ill i see is a shootem up game
i was eager to play this game due to the fact the previous phantasy stars were really good
if i wanted a shootem up game i would have bought quake  arena
it is an absolute disgrace to call this an rpg
if you are a die hard rpg which i am dont bought this game
sell youre dreamcast and get psx and buy final fantasy  instead
the only cool thing about this game is that you can set your characters weight height and features
that is about it
so bottom line is that sega flopped this one just like they do everything else
ill stick with my psx and final fantasy  thank you very muchi bought phantasy star online after sega shut their servers down and never experienced the online play but from what i read it was the only way to play this gamethe graphics are good and the story could pass but the gameplay sucks if you have to play alone
i dont know why sega put  controller ports on the dreamcast if i gotta be online to experience the multiplayer aspecta huge disappoitment avoid like stale toast with rotten eggswhat quotfinal fantasy tacitcsquot was to the final fantasy series
they both didnt have a lot to do with the series they were based off of
yet they are both so addictive and fun you just dont care
quotphantasy star onlinequot is one of dreamcasts best game and its a no brainer as to why it was
first of all it was made by sonic team which is lead by video game master yugi naka
 who has a record of making games based on how fun they are games like quotsonic adventurequot quotsamba de amigoquot and quotchu chu rocketquot to name a few
 and not on how good they look although they do look good too
the main idea is to log online with up to four friends and chat with them as you kill monsters unlock doors find rare weapons and blow up boxs
although this sounds like it would get boring fast it actually keeps you entertained with the chating part as you and your teammates can make jokes flirt with each other cuss out the bad guysalthough there is a cencor that blocks cussing
sorry but kids could be playing
 creat your own charicter and blow up boxes
sound fun yet
well if this doesnt sound fun to you yet make sure you still have a pulse you may be dead
although i do admitt that unless your online this stuff will be more than boring after  minutes
and since the story is so nonexistent playing this game for the story doesnt make much sense either
basicly unless you plan on playing this online you wont get your moneys worth if you play it offline
but sonic team has proved one thing  they sure do make some darn good gamesthis was one of the more expensive expansion packs ive ever seen but sadly it was also one of the shortest
though the story of the game is okay there is really not much new for this other then the graphical enhancements made in baldurs gate  that they back ported to iwd
the new monsters actually new not old ones with a new skin can be counted on one hand and other then one of them   the final boss they are kind of boring
unless you have money to burn this game should be passed onthats pretty much all i can saythis quotgamequot is simply a point at the monster and click and click until he is dead
i custom created the characters but played the actual game for all but  minutes and yawned and went to bed
bor ing
the voices were stupid and not funny at a all
i personally think they should have been left out
they completely ruined the game for me
dwarves dont sound like teenagers and thats what the voices were just like might and magic vi
get some serious actors in there or dont even bother putting voices in at allas for the interface it was tedious and could only be controlled with the mouse no hotkeys
you click on an envelope and out comes a smiling face saying quotlets get dangerousquot or quotim yer worst nightmarequot something equally stupid
you then deside wheather you want to attack with sword gun or magic then click on the monster
what a teenage concept i think ill stick with the classic games
dark savant bane ectat first i was very excited about this game
the graphics combat system and character development system are well made
i quickly found the battles to be timeconsuming and boring
i would sit there while my party battled group after group of wandering monsters when all i wanted to do is go somewhere nearby
the monsters automatically get stronger as you gain levels
this is a jterrinle feature i think
rpgs should get easier as you gain levels not more difficult it made me not want to raise levels because the battles only get harder
another annoyance is the way your party is interrupted every time its your turn to walk or run during combati dont think that anyone could figure out the many clues and quests without the hint book
i certainly could not and am not about to waste ten or twenty bucks to explore every nook and cranny of this game
the game world itself is small when compaired to simular games
after a week i have been just about everywhere i can go and thats only after playing about two hours a daynothing could have prepared me or any other true mega man x fan for how much they messed this game up
apparently there was a staff shakeup before it came out something that would not surprise me one bit
it seems that these new people wrote up a list entitled ways to make the players hate us
heres why why did they mess up the armor system
i was surprised and disillusioned to see you start off with the x armor
wasnt a lot of the fun in the first  games starting off with nothing and finding stuff as you went along
it also does not help that they ruined the plasma gun from x and no longer let you shoot through walls
sure there are capsules in x but now its eight instead of four for two sets of armor
that may sound cool but acquiring them is more annoying than fun
you cant even use an upgrade when you get the capsule
you have to wait until you get all four pieces to the same armor before you can use any part you get
of course it doesnt help either that both the armors suck
neither of them looks appropriate for a general armor that would come to mind if you think mega man x
when you think about the first game you can think of the completed armor he had in it
in x both the armors look too specialized and thats exactly what they are
the gaea armor has kind of a cool gun that of course breaks certain blocks but it is no fun to use because you can only move very slowly in it and you cant even midair dash or use weapons in it
the falcon armor lets you fly for a period of roughly five to ten seconds but when i first saw the poweredup gun for the falcon armor i wasnt sure if i was kidding myself or not by what i saw
it is the worst gun x has ever had
mega mans mega buster from mega man  back on nes would blow it off the face of the planet even the universe
how they could make a gun this pathetic is beyond me
simply put one armors all gun and no movement and the others all movement and no gun
wheres the balance here
a good armor would have at least some balance for those who havent played x you will be stopped frozen at least five times a stage forced to read annoying text messages transmitted to you from some stupid new ally named alia who youll just want to kill more than anything else
think of navi or the owl from legend of zelda ocarina of time except  times worse
no theres no way to skip or shut off alia unless youre revisiting the stage and already listened to it with the same character
if the text messages were interesting and useful it may have been pardonable but no
instead were babysat with lectures like dont jump on the spikes
youll die
get off the train
its exploding
i dont ever recall playing a mega man or x game to be babysat
the new staff must have thought that all of us mega man veterans out there never progressed beyond  years of age
they obviously never did so its quite possible
alia is shown with her with her mouth wide open wearing some sort of earphone device in the mission report screen in between stages a part that has the some of the worst mega man or mega man x music ever created
id love so much to stick a piece of dynamite in her wide open mouth and never have to listen to her again
id love to do even worse to the morons who made this game
where did alia signas douglas and all these other dorks come from anyway
even at x its a mystery there is absolutely no creativity or set of new ideas in this game
this is quite obvious considering that they brought back the rock monster for the boss of the first sigma stage the eye boss from the first game for the second sigma stage a time stopper weapon the quick man laser beams the mega man x capsule music for capsules bubble crabs music for duff mcwhalens stage and much more
yes you read correctly
there is a boss called duff mcwhalen
this brings the review to the bosses
its hard to contemplate how much they must have thought about different ways to make the bosses suck
just look at their names
izzy glow
the above mentioned duff mcwhalen
dark dizzy
the skiver
axle the red
are these supposed to be cool boss names
the bosses in battle are not exactly inspiring either
most of them are just so ridiculously slow
how long does the fat bear boss float through the air with his arms shaped as if he wanted to give you a hug
ive lost count  how long does the bat boss just slowly fly around the room and shoot nothing at you
it can vary but either way its awfully long
and did they even know that the firefly boss izzy glow looks like hes defecating when he does his laser attacks
did they know that the fight with the horse boss of the sky stage is on an airplane much like storm eagles from x
did they know this boss even does some of the exact same attacks as storm eagle
if i wanted to i could find something bad to say about every stage boss and weapon of which xs none are cool or original in the game but ill let players deduce that for themselves
the only good thing i can say about the bosses is that i wish the squid boss were in another game because hes the only one close to cool but not the weapon he gives xi have never heard worse boss music before x
you can disagree with me if you want but i really thought the boss music in x was exceptional at least for mega man x boss music
it was energetic and put you in a fighting mode
xs goes to sounding like some awful messed up version of some dumb pop song
i really wonder if they tested this game at all
they obviously didnt test their own intelligence or capability x is simply almost no fun to play
x is just horrible
his attacks and weapons suck and he does practically no damage to bosses even with the right weapon
youll be fighting bosses for ten minutes in the later stages with x unless you use the restrictive gaea armor or pick up the ultimate armor
having x and zero available the whole game instead of choosing to play the whole game as one or the other may seem like a good idea at first but it ended up being more frustrating than beneficial
you have to figure out how to divide up the heart tanks and zero cant even get some of them
you also have to revisit nearly every stage if you want to get everything taking away from the players any motivation to form their own strategy order or way of playing in general
there were absolutely no new ideas or stage creativity or at any point in the game
some of the stages could just be cruised through with the falcon armor in under a minute
stage brevity has always in my view been a problem of these games but x is the only instance in which i would not complain
wonder whythe whole time limit thing was also retarded
all it did was prompt more annoying speech from alia such as you dont need to be here if you picked a stage that didnt have a part for whatever you needed at the timethere are not a whole lot of good things about this game at all
zeros crescent saber from the bear boss is cool but thats about it
this game is a miserable excuse for an addition to the mega man x series
i wish i could have flown over to japan and fired every single capcom staff member who had anything to do with this game
x is not a good game on any terms
people who write reviews saying its good or just another mega man game do not know what they are talking about
my guess is that the makers probably thought about innovation a word i have grown to hate
innovation in the modern sense of the word does not have a place in the formula with the mega man x games
the innovation in these games should come in the stage design and background boss ideas and weapon ideas
it should not include messing up a whole foundation
they put all this garbage in x and expect players to be happy because of a new ability to duck
sorry ill take no ducking any day
as the result of this failed attempt at innovation x was the beginning of a period of disappointment that would last for the next few games
ill admit that i own the game being a fan though by now possibly a former fan but even now i still want some form of brutal vengeance against capcom for this bitter disappointmenti suppose i felt gracious that capcom felt the need to bring the x series back after so many months and years in between  and  but this isnt what i had in mind
x was such a mindblower that i was worried that any successive x titles wouldnt be able to hold a candle to it and dammit if i wasnt right
thanks to the efforts of capcom production studio  therere just too many things wrong with this title namely a few too many changes in the formula that were both beneficial the ability to duck and problematic not being able to shoot through walls
fail
 and some of the worst boss designs and weapons made for the x series up to this point i also wasnt too pleased with every boss being named after members of guns and rosesi hate that band
then again the level designs were pretty good the switching between x and zero between levels was a nice entry the visual effects werent bad both armor types had their definitive uses and the plot was nicely done but the influx of new characters all those changes and the whole sense of finality made this the worst game in the x series and thus kept me from enjoying this as fully as idve liked inafune wanted to end the series on  thus all the attempts at tying up the loose ends plotwise
i was actually quite glad in the end for the introduction of x as i wouldntve wanted the x series to end with such a flopthis expansion pack is really bad
the livin large one was great but this one has nothing more than music and food
the dancers u can higher dont take off none of their clothes and u cant higher more than one entertainer at a time
the things that are good in this game are a birthday cakepunkin and the campfireand also the all girl and all boy bathroom
once u buy the birthday cake you are already starting a birthday party u can choose whos birthday it is that day
this expansion pack doesnt come with the vibromatic heart bed either
when u get the sims house party you will feel like you are playing the original simswhats new
you can screw up your sims lives inject some romance or have them partying like wild dogs other than that whats new
sadly nothing
nothing at allthe sims expansion house party is basically an addon pack that focus on the social interaction of your sims
new party items such as costumes toys and an quotimprovedquot way to call your sim friends are in this packagethis is what i liked about this package
the new items such as those electrifying cages the timesaving pre ordered mealsthe groovy disco floor tiles and the mechanical rodeo that somehow really add a punch to the whole quotpartyquot package but that is all i find interesting about the expansion pack
to tell the truth i kind of regretted buying it here is what i hate about this package
unlike the previous expansion pack the sims livin it large  which i enjoyed tremendously this expansion pack doesnt have new neighbourhoods to build new sim homes for
sadly most of the quotnewitemsquot in the sims expansion house party doesnt seem to be a big help to throw parties at all
and lets not talk about the party crasher
instead of adding fun to the game hey it is fun to see your sims screw up you know this guy adds frustrationthe gameplay is still basically the same
click to have your sim do this or that
take care of their needs or forget about it to mess up their lives
yawn
intially half the fun of playing the sims comes from the humorous ways your sims acts
unfortunately the game actually gets boring after playing it for a long timethe sims expansion house party could have been a great expansion pack to buy if it actually had some new features hey ea
why not make the sims fly
same old boring game with same old boring conceptdont get this game unless you are a diehard sims fan
save your money for something elsethis game is the worst in its genre
after the nd quake which was also bad came something even worse quake  arena
after playing the pc then renting the game for ps i realized that both were bad
terrible controls you cant win on normal diffuculty since the guys kill you easily and the arenas are small and are terriblelooking graphics
dont buy this game it is a waste of time and moneyfortunately i bought this game at halfpriced books used
mind you im an actionadventure gamer so you folks who love these kind of games might find it fantastic
to me its absolutely and painstakingly slow
i thought something was wrong with my mouse because it took forever for me to turn around in a room
nope
i checked it out and the mouse is fine
so its something to do with the game
its one of those games you cant interact with
you have to find the clues and sometimes when you aim the cursor at the clue it doesnt highlight so you miss it completely
not good for this type of game
i have to say im just starting the game and using a walkthrough
still even with the walkthrough the clues arent showing up and it takes forever to get them to show up and work
the graphics are pretty good
ill give it that
but holy perogies how do you people enjoy these types of games
its so damned boring
i like games where you can interact with the environment where you feel like you are part of the game
so far this doesnt cut the mustard whatever that means
ill probably try a little more tomorrow and the next day before i finally get tired of wasting so much time just trying to move around
click here and wait dum dee dumm ok finally
now click here and wait dum dee dumm thanks but no thanks
ill stick to my action games where i can at least move the character at will
i had to give it two stars because the graphics were good and the atmosphere was spookey
but in my opinion dont buy this game new
unless of course youre the type who enjoys these tedious slow poorly controlled games
i can usually tell within a few minutes whether i like a game or not and i dont like this one
nope
no questions about itmy goodness all these five star reviews really awe me ive been a strong dreamcast player even years after it fizzled out early in the previous console wars
sonic adventure one was very fun game to play but like most other dreamcast titles it was flawed
those flaws were strongly outweighed with the many upsides of that title
i didnt give sonic adventure  a  star review because many peopleincluding my own brother enjoyed this game
it also had a decent followingon a personal level however i feel they kept all the flaws from the original game took out all the previous positive changes and slapped a title on it
i was very disappointed
if you own the dreamcast id recommend getting the original before this oneif you already own part one like i have  then dont expect to be blown away by part  the arena is a similar quotcityquot setting with no time differential
youre still driving during daylight
you can not drive at night
so the only difference is the fact that your car can jumpmy biggest complaint is about the mini games
in order to unlock the hidden stages and scecret characters from part one you are forced to play the mini games which are veryveryvery
difficult to beatwhy didnt the progamers include easy button entry codes like they do with other games
i like challenges but why should i spend  hours trying to get my car to jump from one rooftop to anotheri just bought this game because i needed a baseball game for ps and im a big guerrero fan
oh how i was disappointed
the game play is actually pretty good
i like the fact that theres no cursor for batting
it really feels like it takes some baseball knowledge to play as you have to guess kind of pitch and location which i actually got pretty good at after playing about  games
however this doesnt overshadow the many cons of the gamethere are a laundry list of problems with the game
the scenes where the players walk to the plate is choppy
the dugouts are empty
sometimes when you hit a homerun it looks like the guy is running across the plate from the first base side
the pitcher is choppy when throwing a pitch and after throwing a pitch he goes straight back to his original stance so hell go instantly from crouching forward in front of the rubber after a pitch to standing on the rubber with no transition
the batter goes from the end of his swinging motion right back to his original stance pretty much the same as the complaint about the pitcher
the umpires spin around as the quotcameraquot spins around them which looks stupid but not as stupid as the fact that they have faces on both sides of their head
if the camera is rotating and you are pressing forward your player runs in circles because the controls are in relation to the view on the screen
i know theres more but i dont have all daythe problems seemed insignificant at first but they pile up quickly and become very irritating
the game play is good i dont know why do had to cheap out when it came to touching up all the graphics parts of the game
the most irritating part is that the problems would have been easily fixable with a little bit of work
its not like they were major bugs in the game
neglecting these problems just looks like laziness on the part of do and it is that fact that will lead me to buy allstar baseball when the  baseball games come outi rented all star baseball  by acclaim as everything ive read thus far puts it ahead of the other two baseball sims available on the market but lets hope the reviews ive read were wrong because theres not much here that i liked about the gamei will note that im writing this review after playing it for an hour and a half against my roommate
to be fair and also to get my moneys worth from renting the game ill dive into the game again tomorrow morning but initially i was pretty appalled at the product that acclaim has released hereas soon as we finished playing i sat down and wrote up the good and the bad about this game and found i had trouble finding much good in this gameone thing that i liked a lot and my roommate liked very little was the batting and pitching
the batting is a lot different than triple play was on the psx
ive yet to play triple play for the ps but think thatll be one of my next reviews
while other games tend to make hitting overly easy this sways a little too much in the other direction but i think its a good thing
rather than swing high mid or low you have total control in two axis and you get an idea via the pitching cursor where the ball is starting out and then as it approaches the plate
i applaud acclaim for this interface and i think with a little practice this control scheme would be my interface of choice for my baseball simsthat being said the rest of the game is garbage
the controls are lame
partially blockbusters fault we didnt have a manual but the base throwing is different and it seems its different simply to be different
every baseball game out there psx pc nes whatever used the control pad and a button to throw  down and x to throw home left and a to throw to third or something similar
asb  uses x triangle o and square as the base throwing
after being trained since back in the bit days to use the control pad using the buttons seems unnatural
had using the buttons given some advantage or speed increase acclaim would be revolutionary but just to be different to be different is lameeventually one could get used to their control scheme for that but there are more controlling woes
another unwritten rule is the fact that triangle is used to back out of menus
this is true for  of american games out there
acclaim uses o to back out of menus which is more the standard in japanese games but acclaim this is the united states
again this is a little thing but its just another annoyancemy real lament here is the game doesnt feel like the ps
i pulled up triple play  for the psx and yeah textures characters and shadows are headandshoulders above the psx stuff but ive seen madden and ssx
the ps can do more than what asb  is doingthe animations in the game felt very amateurish
a fly ball to the warning track had my roommate settling under the ball
it looked decent but he had no control
ive got to vote for total control over pretty animations
also in terms of the outfield there was some noticeable blurjittertype distortion when the fielder threw back to the infield  unacceptable in anything but a beta version of a gameadditionally a grounder to second and then the routine throw to first never looked routine
every time the second baseman wound up to throw he faced toward home making me fear i had accidentally told him to throw home
magically the ball would throw to first though
theres no excuse for animation like that with presentday technologyanother thing that should be long forgotten in presentday gaming systems is crappy commentary
the commentary was reminiscent of hardball  back in the day for the pc
theres no color or any real chatter
a lot of the sentences sounded pieced together and i cant remember hearing anything that bad since back in the days of  computersoverall this game is lame
once i play it more and also check out triple play for the ps i will consider revising my opinions but based on my first play i dont think ill be getting a playstation  baseball sim until at least next seasontheres good news and bad news with zoe
the good news is that mgs will be the greatest game ever
heck the extremely short demo packed with zoe
is currently the greatest game ever
the control is a dream the graphics are poetry in motion and the replaybility is unheard of
when metal gear solid  sons of liberty rolls around the ps will be the place to be
thats the good newsthe bad news is that zoe
is none of the things mgs is
the story is melodramatic the voice acting is horrendus and leo is the most unlikeable hero in video gaming history
the graphics are good and there is a great attention to detail but there is no variety
every level has leos bot simply destroying the same three enemy bots and the occasional boss
the control is excellent but this game is ultimately just no fun
the selection of weapons is substandard and fighting through level after level of the same old thing is down right boring
finally for a game with a rating of quotmquot zoe
should have had a more mature storyline
the main characters are preteens with incredibly annoying horribly high voices
zoe
is like a bad episode of digimon or power rangers
dont let the good graphics fool you this is a horrible disappointment of a game
buy it for the excellent mgs demo or save your money or a video game thats fun because zoe
is notthis game was too ambitious
by including so many ages it spread itself to thin to greatly capture the essense of any particular age
the economy design is a stripped down version of age of empires and it remains the same throughout every age
this game will be fun for kids but the build build build attack attack attack game has gotten really old with memy rating may be biased because i prefer turn based strategy games
i just found this game to be kinda boringempire earth isnt the easiest game to learn
it actually has a high learning curve
and it doesnt look that great
but theres something about it
all these different epochs you can play in
it is worth checking out now if you can find it in a bargain binperhaps im just not enough of quothard corequot gamer but i foudn this game too difficult to be enjoyable
while i enjoyed building and advancing my civilization theres just no way to avoid doing battle and play a simply economic game
so about the time i get a wonder built or a couple started the ai kicks in and stomps the bejeezus out of me
ive had the game for a year  even bought the strategy guide  and ive yet to play complete a scenario succesfully and this is while playing on the easiest setting
perhaps im more used to simulationcitybuilding games than rts games but it seems to me that for the game to be enjoyable the average use ought to have at least a reasonable chance at successtechnically graphically its a great game
no complaints there but the level of difficulty makes me unlikely to want to continue playingthis game actually came to me cracked so i had my money refunded
stuff happens sometimes
it has good games on it but wheres the sega genesis classic pac man adventures game
does anyone remember that game besides me
wed like to play that againthis might have been a great game if it had been released about six years ago
this game is a myst clone that came out about five years too late
clone is a bit too much of a compliment
 is a slightly better phrase because this game falls short of the excellent series that it aspires to bethe graphics for the game are simply awful
the screen looks like a drenched comic book that just got pulled out of the gutter
perhaps it is because the game is fixed at x resolution when most computers can go way higher
it looks like some effort was put into the artwork for the game but it is spoiled by the smearedout grainy look that occupies every screen
riven is much older and looks better
so does grim fandango
the voice acting is abominable and so is the acting for the games ingame movies
i thought that we got rid of those years ago when everyone realized how cheesy they wereif the game had a good premise then the poor production values wouldnt matter very much but it doesnt
its another abandoned world full of weird machines game
this time its an alien world
a good puzzle game has to have puzzles that fit into the virtual world
unfortunately schizm has lots of contrived puzzles that dont make sense
want to walk across a bridge
figure out how to push a series of  buttons in the right order
dont expect to just push one button
apparently aliens are extremely bored geniuses who have nothing better to do than build complicated contraptions that confuse earthling scientists
i wonder if aliens have to push a series of colorcoded buttons in a special order to operate a toothbrushill give the game props for having good music and yes the puzzles are very difficult
if you are up for a challenge they will definitely do that
its hard to get interested in them though since the game always constrains you along a tight path instead of letting you explore a d world
thats another big fault that this game has when you compare it to other adventure games
heres a tip  skip this one unless you have played all other adventure games that you want to play first
i played myst riven sanitarium and the syberia demo and they are all better than schizmif einstein is on you cellphones quotfriendquot list then you will have fun with this game
quotschizmquot has a quoti think i heard this one beforequot story plot
alas
i do recall
remember quotaliensquot the movie where the colony is mysteriously empty the one where we send people to look for them and they disappear too
so what do we do
send more
yup except for the excitement of aliens you basically have the premise of quotschizmsquot storyline
an empty planetnobody around
quotschizmquot is beautiful
remember when quotmystquot came out and following its success every company released their own version of the game
well this is the latest
at least in quotmystsquot defense the puzzzles were wellthought through made sense and you got that great feeling in your tummy when you solved a major task
forget it with this game
only original concept you actually play with two playerseach landed at a different destination in the beginning storyline
you can switch back and forth between them
in order to solve many of the puzzles you have to use the knowledge between the two players to complete each puzzle
if you are armed with a degree in math and engineering you will work your way to the lousy ending
not so fortunate
join the other  percent of schizms players who admit they needed a walkthrough or a website with hints
pass on this unless you feel good about yourself incessantly cheating and feeling no reward for accomplishing a difficult game
i promise there are better ones out there
a great anonymous quote i read online quotafter playing this game even the word quotschizmquot gave me irritable goosebumpsquot  to be fair if i could i would give it  stars
i know there are people out there who love the ultimate challengeif you are one of those people who never gets bored with impossible countless and meaningless puzzlesthis could be the one for youwow
the title of the review is pretty much the sum of the parts
excessivecompulsive cd swapping
two characters so you can play the same game twice
puzzles that you simply didnt know existed
einstein couldnt solve the puzzles on schizm the quote is true
but what the previous reviewer failed to point out iswhy would einstein even botherschizm is lacking in so many areas that adventure games are expected to have it is a shock that i continued to play this game for the sheer beauty of the landshowever shocking it may be schizm starts off suprisingly strong
the puzzles are difficult but fair
youll be pleasently suprised if you choose to play the first two lands
all i saw was a four star rating from this point in timebut thenthe game continues
and as it continues the game proceeds to lack a plot an experience and a grip of logicthe puzzles fail at this point because the player is always lead to believe he or she is doing something entirely different than what is intended
and there will be no hintsone puzzle involves changing a scattered code of arglirian numbers into a different set
never does this game even hint to the fact that this code is not an access key
looking at the strategy guide i can tell you i was appalled to see the steps i would have to take in order to continueand have a geometrycalculus book handy as well
does the game give you hints to lead you on the geometric triangle puzzle
i think notlast but not least there are double character puzzles
this means you must traverse the same grounds to get to the same location with both characters
and they have to go all the way back
and then one of the characters will have to go to the other side of that land and so forth i was in shock the game creators actually thought this could be funall that negativity being shed however i liked the puzzles in schizm the first two lands
they were made for the experienced adventure gamer and any adult can appreciate that as games like syberia and the longest journey hold your hand all the way through the gamebut frankly an adventure game cannot be fueled without a good plot and the only chance youll get at that will be the endthe best part of the gameit is so cheesy
i had no desire to wrap up the puzzles and thats a shame because im sure this company is well aware prima strategy guides are upwards  dollarstwo stars says you should just steer clear
this game turns into a chore and steals any chance of redemptionschizm is a beautiful game but not without its problems
first of all its navigation is cumbersome
unlike other adventuregames of today it does not allow  degrees movement wich is a bit of a let down
the movement by mouse is tricky and often irritating  you cant stop the movement in time
freezing is frequent saving every two minutes imperative
the storyline reminds to say the least a lot of other games in this genre especially the journeyman project  by presto
i would say its almost identical
and then theres the graphics wich at least on cdrom are not quite the quality ive come to expect having played exile and riven
the puzzles defy logic
i would say there undoable without hints nudges and pushes or even een detailed walkthrough in times
that said schizm has a beautiful atmosphere great music and superb sounds
the different worlds are stunning although again a lot has been borrowed if not copied from either rivenexile or real life gaudis architecture for example
is it worth the money
yes well maybe
but be ready for some major irritations and resorting to walkthroughsi bought this game from the bargain bin not realizing that there was a dvd version of the game  in the long run it probably would not have made a difference
with the cdrom details are fuzzy
im sure this game is beautiful with the dvd version since there are some spectacular colors even on the cdrom
in any case this does not take away from the fact that i loathed this gamein schizm there are two characters  sam and hannah
at times you play sam other times hannah
one of the difficulties is knowing who to play when
as we all know there is a lot of running around in adventure games
thats just the nature of the genre and true to form theres a lot of back and forth to various locations
thats ok but sometimes you have to do this with both characters  the exact same locations essentially repeating all that running around
but that wasnt what did me inwhat did me in were the puzzles
im not big on puzzles that dont seem to have any relation to the story
in other words finding clues putting them together and solving the puzzle
no  some of these were random puzzles
just keep on plugging in numbers over and over again until you come up with the right combination
the puzzle that truly tried my sanity was a mazetype puzzle  basically finding a route from one place to another while the game blocks your moves eventually cutting you off from reaching the end
the puzzle is random so its a new route everytime
its not as easy as it sounds
i probably attempted this puzzle  times until i got it right
but guess whatyou dont have to do this one time but twice and you have to get it right two times in a row
one walkthrough i had to use three different ones stated that if you kept track of your moves on the first successful attempt all you had to do was repeat the results on the second try  nope
oh but guess what
once you are successful with this puzzle you get to go to another location and do the exact same puzzle again
sorry  not me
thats when i quit
i was able to finished  of this horrible game but i just couldnt go oni would only recommend this game if you are some kind of masochisti have been waiting months for this game to come out and the day the local software store got it in i rushed out and bought it right away
i was so excited i couldnt wait to play
thank god this store has a great return policy on open softwarei am a huge fan of high heat but this year took a step backwards
the graphics while improved in some aspects and worsened in others are alright
the animations seem too fast i liked the quottightquot feel of  i also dont like the new blue statscore boxes ingame
they look blocky and the font is badthe sound has really not improved
all of the sounds from  have been carried over to  with the exception of new announcer voices
the main menu and options screens now have varying musical themes following a rocktechno theme what they have to do with baseball is beyond memy main problem is the differences with the difficulty settings
if you play on quotrookiequot level you are pretty much going to win no matter what
bump it up to quottriple aquot and its pretty much the same i have had  run innings many times i even won a game 
so go up one more notch to quotproquot and all of the sudden the computer is pitching onehitters and nailing every pitch you throw to him no matter how much you switch it up
and whats even more bothersome is that there is  more difficulty levels above that
better balance with the levels would have been a nice touchmore minor problems include your baserunners with a mind of their own even when you specifically state in the options that you want full control
announcers saying things at the wrong times or audio being cut off half way through their sentence
i even had the game dump to my desktop right as i hit a game winning homerun beforeim not saying that this game is absolutely terrible i just dont think it was an improvement over  which i belive is one of the best games i have ever played
high heat  never made me pound on my keyboard or swear at my monitor in frustrationevery single game of  did
word of note for anyone who is having a problem with their graphics when a ball is hit into the outfiled
there is a box in the quotpreferencesquot screen right underneath your video card selction with a check mark in it
you need to uncheck it every time you go into the preferences screen because for some reason it likes to automatically recheck itself every time you enter preferencesthis game has so much potential but it is filled with fatal bugs and no patches have yet been announced to fix them
it constantly seizes and freezes forcing you to reboot your whole system each time so saving often is key
however in one hour of gaming it froze  times on me making it hardly an enjoyable experience
it is a shame that it does this for it looks like it will be better than aok
nevertheless the constant reboots are infuriating and will make me question ever buying a game from this company until i see the patches are outfor those who wonder i have a  mhz athlon with the latest dfx and  mgs of ram
it is less than year old and is able to easily handle such games as baldurs gate ii deus ex and mech warrior   hence  i can only blame the gamewhen i first got this game i thought it would be just like a precolonial version of age of empires  one brutal defeat after another told me one thing that this game was not nearly as good as aoe
i consider myself a very good aoe player i can beat  hard enemys in less than  hours but this is simply an hard
the main reason is that its simply unrealistic
i build a whole army of soldiers and they get gunned down before they get half way to the enemy town
at the beginning this game can be fun building and gathering
some of the missions are good also including combat ones
but like another reviewer said quotthis isnt strategy its a racequot and i couldnt agree moreafter the excellent command amp conquer id hoped westwood would come out with something just as good as the original
as usual i was wrong
while the story and fmvs are as good as ever and there are plenty of units to choose from including welcome sea and air units
theres just one problem to the game its a tank rush
prepare to test your quotstrategyquot by seeing who can get more resources to fund medium tank production because nothing else is worth building for the first  minutes
unless you and your buddy are at the same skill level or youre playing a premade mission where the computer starts out with enough defenses to trash basic tanks all youll see is hordes and hordes of them
if youre not going to play this online and just want to try out cool missions go ahead and buy red alert
otherwise get something worthwhile like total annihilationand i dont mean it on a mature content present way
actually quite the oppposite
this is a game aimed towards children i would say younger than  not a very good or entertaining game for anyone older
the psp camera on itself is very good quality but the game is simply shallow
i came here expecting a good pokemon ripoff and leave dissapointed
theres a lot of wasted potential on invizimalsi would suggest against purchasing it the psp games that are a lot better than this
i only give it  stars because it comes with the camera otherwise it would be  star for surethe only reason i play this game is because its pretty addictive however it has many flaws  the music is extremely annoying the sound effects arent at all notable you hardly get any points for clearing viruses you get no points for just matching  regular pieces and the graphics on this game are no different from the regular nintendo
come on this is supposed to be a newer and better game system
they made super mario  look a lot different and better from the original so why couldnt they have improved this gamewhat a shame
i had high hopes for pga  unfortunately ea spent a lot of time and money motion capturing tiger and not enough time recreating courses
surely something with the potential that the ps has could have handled more than  courses at the very least give me some variety
tpc at sawgrass anyone
i really did like the use of the analog sticks to swing thats one of the nice aspects of this game
however i expected a lot more depth from the company that released madden  no season no stats no money
its ironic that the muchmaligned quotswing away golfquot has more detail amp depth than a pga licensed product
rent it or buy mine when i take it to the used video game storethree hours after i bought this game i had beaten every stage
i like to focus on the positive so i will say the colors and graphics though cartoonish are eyecatching
other than that its not much more positive about it
i believe if it cost maybe  or less i would feel better about it
i believe if you spend  on this when you play it you are going to be upset
unless you have  bucks to throw away
nice simple fighting game yes
worth  dollars not even closelets be honest here i have been playing fighting games since street fighter was released in the arcades and i am talking about the first one in the mid s
then of course the titanic street fighter  came out and changed the face of fighting games forever in around  well anyways it introduced a system of special moves that required fancy joystick movements and a series of button presses to pull off
the fighting genre was nothing but punches and kicks until sf came out
well after the success of sf capcom made darkstalkers vampire savior in japan which fused those special moves with over the top monsters from hollywood films like the wolfman mummy etc
with that special capcom styling
it is an awesome series and in some ways i like it much better than sf
but herein lies the problem with the psp treatment as much as i try to love this game for the rare gem it is i cant
the control system was not tweeked enough back at capcom to make it function properly with the psp digital pad directional pad and thus we are left with essentially a button mashing mess
i am sure some will be unable to see past this flaw but when you are talking abut taking out the very foundation of a game series in this case special moves then you are left with a shell of what could have been the best d fighter ever released on a handheld system
it pains me to say that but it is true and i think if your honest with yourself you will appreciate that i hate it that this game didnt turn out well because of something so fundamental
capcom please be wary next timei think i bought this purely out of some nostalgic sense of duty as the professional review id read of it was unflattering
i should have listened to the pros on this one
this game presents nothing new to anyone whos played a darkstalkers game in the past the graphics definitely dont come close to other titles available for the psp which tells me the developers dont even care about this product and some of the button combos that you are required to punch through are near impossible to accomplish
all in all the only challenge i got from playing this game was to get the characters to do their more advanced moves but even without them i could still win through and beat the game
total waste of hard earned moneyi dont like frogger
never have
this version was received to me as a christmas gift gee i seem to say that in every one of my reviews
and i hate how difficult it is
yes the difficulty lies in maneuvering but its really hard
even the very first level the street level is pretty tough
finally reaching and failing the cloud level over and over again is when i finally said no more
and pulled the game from the computer
this was  years ago and im still happy about the decisionif you like a simple game of monopoly then you would probably like this  to me the graphic looked old and i just like the newer stuff like here and now monopoly for pc its like a newer generation designcastlevania is an impossiblyhard overrated classic nes game
i admit i never played it back then in the s because it didnt seem to be all that interesting
i pick the game up tonight and manage to beat it
no joke
ive beaten contra without losing a life mission impossible bart simpson vs space mutants mighty bomb jack friday the th etc
without using the game genie
back to castlevania its a pretty boring game that relies a lot mostly on memorization and sheer luck
its a repeat of everything that ive messed up and tried to correct my mistakes before i can progress further
overall my time is greatly wasted overall after i manage to finish the dracula off not once but twice
damntoo long
the finish isnt worth my frustration
the sheer difficulty of the game is pretty incredible and needless
it doesnt help matters any if the controls are absolutely sy as hell
there is no password after a completion of each level which makes the fun of the game practically nonexistentby the way the grim reaper is a joke of a challenge
basically go to the left block in the middle
then two seconds later go to the nd block to the right
wait until the sickles start to appear
move to the leftmost block and start firing boomerangs as many as you can
when you get knocked off the ledge wait until the very last boomerang makes a full round trip to eliminate whatever sickles are there left
then get back to the ledge and keep throwing more boomerangs
eventually the match will be over as long as you are nimble enough to spot the easy escapes by moving to the right a bit and then coming back to the left
sometimes the grim reaper will jump upon you which is one of the five or six random patterns offered in this particular battle
when that happens move immediately to the rightmost block and copy the same strategy as if you are on the leftmost block
a bit over time you can start moving back to the leftmost block to finish the grim reaper offi got this for my collection of nes  snes games but this is awful
the graphics are terrible yes i know this is  nes game simon has no face
the first few stages were fun until i got to the first boss an ugly bat who was impossible to attack with your whip
after a week of practice i defeated it and moved on to part  this is where the bad controls start to ruin it
every time an enemy hit me simon would bounce backwards to his doom
i gave up after thatim a racing fan and star wars fan so i rented this
i did not like it but i played it a few years ago so i have no memories on this game
i do remember that the levels were filled with junk and the sense of speed was fast so all you did was hit stuff
i did not like itluckily i rented this before deciding whether or not to buy
and boy am i lucky that i tried it before dropping  for itwell everyone knows about the concept and cool graphics and all
the game suffered no slow down even with multitap on
but after playing for a short time i realized how bad this game is
the controls are difficult the powerups are useless in a race you need to use shortcuts to win
and worse the carts move way too slow
the fun of any cart racing ala mario kart or even rumble racing  is that its fast
this game felt like i was moving at snail pacei wish that they would put mario kart on ps though never happen or someone come up with a true kart game
the closest out right now is rumble racing which is definitely worth the look if youre looking for cart racing type gamesuper mario kart tended to dominate the n as the best multiplayer game
so ive been waiting and watching the kart racing games for the ps hoping to find one that will give the same level of fun
unfortunately super bombad racer falls shortremember that kartracing games are suppose to be fun and childish so the cartoonish characters with large heads and silly taunts are up the right alley
the large number of special items forward weapons backward weapons boosts shields etc
adds a good level of playability to the game unfortunately with a bunch of racers everyone is shooting everyone all the time and theres no real strategy involvedthe controls for the game are also very loose
it takes a lot of getting used to as you bounce all over the place and cant make the tight turns youd like to
the levels are relatively simple and theres not a lot you can do to improve your racing ability on themyoull probably play through all  nine of the levels in about an hour and then wonder what youre suppose to do
the game quickly looses its enjoyment in single player mode
luckily theres multiplayer mode to come to the rescue and this game is good fun with a bunch of people
still ive found after running through the levels a couple times with friends theres just not a lot of joy to iteven battle mode has issues
with so many hityoufromacrossthescreenautomatically weapons there isnt much skill required
you just need to know where on the level the good weapons can be found and hope your opponents dont
and on some levels yodawho can damage everyone with his special itemcan just sit out of the way and slowly take everyone outoverall this is a fun game for a little while but is likely to sit on your shelf except when you have friends over
its probably better to save your money and wait for that great kartracing game to come out for the psthis is a game that will have a huge following with some gamers but most with hate it just for its genre and not give it a chance
there are many great things about this game but to me there are just too many bad thingsin the good catagory monkey island has great graphics
to me it kinda looks like toy story or such
cool cgi animation
there is a lot of humor as you control the sometimes very ignorant hero on his many adventure or complacated trips for his wife
there is also a ton of exploring to do and at every turn there is another puzzle to keep the story moving and to me this is one of the main problems with this gamethe puzzles are sometimes things you would never think of
some of his escapes from various traps etc
are very much like mcgyver and took me a long time to piece them together but that may just be me
for most people including me a guide may be a needed not option thing
im far from stupid but some of the puzzles just arent at all obvious
the controls at times can also be a problem it takes alot of time to move around many areas and can be a real pain running back and forth
the almost constant loading times are also a problem whenever dialogue is going on the game is jerky same with movies and sometimes the smallest little scene needs a load timeto me this game shows why this genre of games will never be as popular as the gran turismos and resident evils
if you have alot of patience and a lot of time this game may be for you but for me ill stick to gt  for now
at least rent before you buythe first arcade version of crazy taxi with its instantly recognizable music and appearance was an amazingly popular game
its concept was simple yet irresistible  to create a driving game where you dont have to worry about crashes and where your goal shifts all the time so that its the equivalent of   racing courses
i was a devotee of this game and had spent hours on itthis playstation  version lost most of the magic in the translation
for one thing inevitably the controls are just not the same without the steering wheel pedals and the allimportant gear shift without which and without knowing the quotboostquot move you could never hope to pick up more than five six passengers before your time runs out
the ps version grievously sped up the game clock so much that the game just blitzes by
it took me a long time to figure out how fast you have to execute the boost to make it work and even then finesse of control flew right out the window
so the game became what it always threatened to become a frantic overly speedy experience fit to give you a heart attack so fast that theres very little fun factor just rushing to meet all the times without getting to enjoy anythingso many games these days are about quotbeating the clockquot probably reflective of our addinfested culture
street fighter became another flashy graphicsridden button masher syphon filter now forces you to run through levels ignoring enemies just to meet their insane quotpar timesquot and crazy taxi requires the reflexes of a cockroach
maybe im from an older game culture where you dont have to be on speed to compete
at any rate this game was a sore disappointment
but i know ill jump onto the next classic crazy taxi on my next trip to the arcades and hope its still thereagain another failed attempt at a racing game
crazy taxi gets boring really quickly and then you really have no where else to go and you end up bringing this one to your local funcoland or game stop and trade it in for something elsethe graphics are excellent and for the  minutes that it lasts the game is fun but as soon as that  minutes is up i wouldnt count on anything else to expect in this gamewhen will they come out with a racing game similar to road rash
atleast in road rash theres a lot more competition and you actually have to deal with the elements and environment around you
i can recall several times where i just drove across a park to get where i needed to go
again not very fun and an unfortunate thumbs downid idolized crazy taxi in its arcade form so when i saw several copies available at the video store i greedily nabbed one for myself
ultimately this is the sad story of a game with huge potential but a mediocre payoffits a visually interesting and fastpaced driving game with great physics and entertaining extras passenger and driver comments can be quite funny but theres no point after about a halfhour
after youve made  trips to the heliport the ball park the church and the kfc you just cant take that stretch of road anymore
if youre not interested in getting tips or scoring points which is mostly pointless anyway since there are no additional levels to advance to you can drive anywhere in the town which includes in some cases to the tops of buildings and through parking garages
the go anywhere option is fun but after youve explored the last of the long looping train track tunnels however there just isnt much more to do
glad my wifes got the rentbeforeyoubuy ruleif you loved the arcade its worth a rental if only to get it out of your system
imagine what crazy taxi could have been if you had the potential to advance your character say by starting out in omaha and working your way up through chicago to new york city
maybe theyll add that for crazy taxi  or so
though the graphics arent as flashy as crazy taxi i highly recommend the simpsons road rage as an alternative
its a game with a nearly identical concept but has a much higher replay valuethis game is a good bet for kids under the age of  and it is a good fastpaced scramble for passengers and money
the annoying bits are that there is no damage to your taxi when you hit solid objects you cannot mow people down on the street the missions are all timed the street surface glitch is extremely annoying sometimes the street will completely disappear looking like glass and the wannabee wolfman jack should look for another means of employment
the side missions exp
the long jump are really badnow i myself personally love me some super mario
if you checked my reviews youll see that ive givensuper mario advance  super mario bros super mario world super mario advanceall high ratings
when i purchased those two games ive noticed that nintendo made some changes with those games since the last time ive owned them on super nintendo
so here i am with super mario advance which is super mario  on game boy advance and i have to say that ive not impressed at all with this one
i understand that video games evolve over time and creaters try to make them better but there is a difference between making the game better than the origonal and making it complicated than the origonal
nintendo did the latter with this gamechanges for the good are nice for me
on this one you can pick you character each time you die actually you could do that since thesuper mario allstarsgame and i didnt know you couldnt do that on the origonal nes game until i was playing my cousins wii a few days ago
also it tells you each characters power under them on the select screen
another helpful change is when you collect the star which makes you become invincible for a few seconds
back then when you collect a certain amount of cherries a star would just randomly float from the bottom of the screen
on here youll hear some kind of tone which warns you the star is commingnot so good changes are very visible
first of all what got me was during the beginning of the game there is a long drop before you reach the bottom and start
they changed that too which sucks
also on the origonal game you started off big the status you are when you have at least two hearts on the left side of the screen
here youre small with one heart on the left side which really isnt a problem because you can find hearts anywhere to make you grow
back then if you kill enough enemies a heart will float from the ground and you gain more life
here hearts are inside the plants you pick up from the ground and sitting idle in high places on levels
and what really ticks me off is the red shell that you can pick up from the ground
back then you threw the red shell at an enemie and it would have hit the wall and dissapeared
here if you throw a shell it will bounce off the wall and keep going and if it hits you you loose a heart or die come on now
and whats the deal with those huge shy guys and turnip plants
and like every mario game the characters speak peach doesnt know when to shut up
hell even birdo speaks that purple dinosaur that shoot out eggs and half the time i dont even knows what she is sayingthere you have it with super mario  on game boy advance
what i believed happened was that nintendo received feedback since  when this game was reissued on snes on how difficult the game was and tried their best to make it easier and more fun for new and younger nintendo gamers because i played the origonal on the wii and it was the exact version on the nes and it was way harder
older guys like me will definately find this game flawed if youve had it in different formats
nintendo has made some great reissues with great modifications but they shot a brick with this one big time
peaceps the arcade game appears on all super mario advance gamesthis game is a big disappointment from nintendo
first off the original game wasnt all that great to begin with due to its tiny worlds nonexistant powerups and simple boss characters
however  what makes this game a real loser is that its worse than the the snes remake on the super mario allstars game and even the original nes gamethe game does have some advantages over previous versions the graphics are taken from super mario allstars and therefore are an improvement over the original the mindnumbingly boring slot machine scene after each tiny world have been made more tolerable since you can now bet a group of coins instead of making individual bets for each and every coin you have like allstars you can pick a different character after each tiny level instead of waiting until an entire world was clearedwhat makes this game worse than allstars the horrible scrolling engine
smb had a unique scrolling style on vertical levels which remains but the horizontal levels are torture too
you can literally tap your character one direction or the other and the entire screen will scroll so that your character is near either the left or right edge
the scrolling engine alone makes this game unplayable
what is it with nintendo and its policy of using lousy camera work for its mario games
i thought that was just for their d mario games the annoying vocal work from the d games has been added here to make the experience as unpleasant as possible
do we really need to hear lucky after collecting a cherry
battle scenes with birdo have some sort of annoying speech that i havent made out quite yet and it freezes the action while the dialog is being spoken weird tackedon stuff the game has a lot of little new things that just feel totally out of place
anyone familiar with the real version of the game is familiar with the inital drop that happens when you start world   the new version is totally different and this new little vertical area is littered with everything that will annoy you about this gamemy recommendation
do not buynintendo needs to know that terrible ports like this are totally unacceptable
i recommend waiting for the nintendo revolution aka the poorly named wii and obtain the nes original or the superior snes super mario allstars version on the virtual console insteadmario is known all over the world by his famous super jump which smashes enemies into the ground
unfortunelty this game has no super jumps
you have to throw vegetables to kill your enemies
this is the worst idea for a mario game
the good thing is that you get to choose from four diffrent characters mario luigi peach and toad and it includes the amazing link it up which allows four players to play from the same gamepack note you will need the link cablei just dont like it because they killed the mario classics
buy it if you enjoy wasting your money
in other words dont buy ityes when i first got it it was fun and cool and in two days of playing i almost finshed the whole game the only thing i really didnt do was get the last vessel
i dont think you should get  this game instead get mario kart but if you really want this game get it used
trust me after playing this game for about a week you wont want it
got out and get mario kart insteadi give it a two only because i had fun with it for a few days but now im sick of itthis is almost a perfect port of the snes version of this game that surfaced in the late s as a launch title for the snessuper famicomit gets old quick and tracks all begin to look the same
the ability to do player link off a single cart is the best feature this offersmario kart advance also a snes title represents a rd generation snes title and was more advanced than fzero in its day as a result its port for the gba also a perfect port is  much better than fzero so if you want a game like this i would recommend mario kart advanceelite force is my favorite first person quotshooterquot the story and graphics are all top notch and it was a lot of fun to play
when i heard that there was going to be an expansion pack i got myself ready for another engrossing adventurewell i have to say that i was disappointed
it starts out good though
you get to walk around voyager without a time limit which is very cool for trek fans
you can read up on past missions read personal logs and even use a replicator
this is nice but i wanted to make my way to the holodeck to try the new missionsso i tried the captain proton episode
first of all the black and white graphics are beautiful but thats where the fun ends
you cant save the game during the single player missions but after completing the proton adventure within  minutes without dying i realized that you dont need to save it
there isnt much challenge to it
plus the graphics slowed way down in may spots for an unknown reason is a patch needed
and i had to walk backwards for a while to remedy the problem
when i finally found quotsatans robotquot and the quotgirlquot it was over before i knew itthe other single player missions are uninspired and dull
a malfunctioned holodeck shooting range and a klingon base are all you get and the maps are quite smallhowever the additional maps for the holomatches are really good
they are much larger and even more graphically detailed
you also get a wider selection of opponents including janeway borg and captain proton
try out the quotsingularityquot mapall in all the virtual voyager is nice but there isnt much too it
if you want a good single player mode try searching the net for mods
there are some good ones out there
the new holomatches save this from being a total disasteri am bias i must confess i have been a simpsons fan since i was four years old so i have grown up watching this family and as much as i truly love this show
the conversion of the simpsons to a wrestling game went horribly wrong somewhere along the developement lines
i rented this game and i did enjoy the wisecracks and taunts made by the wrestlers in the game and believe me they were worth getting a kick out of
but the problem is you start out with few characters and the graphics are not that great
in most fighting games you now play you have to know how to pull of certain moves and combos to achieve victory but all i can describe about the control for this game is pure button smashing
that is the only way to win i tried using particular moves but gave up and resorted to pushing misc
buttons after about fifteen minutes
i believe that this would have been a much better conversion onto the playstation  if anything
that would have impressed all those simpsons fans out there
but sadly this game disappoints those true fans to the show
the only reason i gave this a  star rating sadly was out of my sympathy for the simpsons
this truly was a great concept gone horribly wrongi rented this game from blockbuster because i knew it could have been either great or terrible
it was near the terrible line
the graphics werent great and overall it just wasnt good enough to be a good gamewho doesnt love the simpsons
i certainly do
i watch all their episodes new and old
and whats not to love about them
theyre silly funny and witty
i cant say im a big simpsons fan but i am a fan none the less so when i saw they had a wrestling game for playstation i said i had to get this game
well like some of the simpsons episodes this game was disappointing
it wasnt all that interesting and the wrestling moves i thought were limited
and its a very easy game to beat but then again some of you might like that
in any case it was still fun for an unchanllenging game
it was only fun for about  minutesi wouldnt recommend this game at all unless you like simple fighting games
and if you are a simpsons fan youll get it anyway regardless whether the game isnt all thatdont blink
by the time you open your eyes the game will be over
i was so excited by this new halflife release that i placed an advance order and i am really dissapointedif you are familiar with the halflife series you know what to expect
great graphics great story line and of course great fun
however i think that the guys over at sierra have a lot of nerve considering the length of this gamei am not someone who sits for hours and hours playing nevertheless i finished this game with in two days
if you dont care about the short ride than i suggest you spend the money
on the other hand if you are like me and expect to get what you pay for than hold on to your money and get a game thats worth the money such as deus exthis game is almost exactly like the original half life but ten hours shorter
the game starts out in a tramsound familiar and then all hell breaks loose down at black mesa for an unkown cause
im sorry but i do not think that the original half life is even that good so when this expansion pack came out i was not that excited for it
though i wasnt that enthusiastic i picked it up and once i started playing i officially lost my taste for all half life games
even a novice gamer could finish this game in a matter of  hours of casual playing
no complex puzzles terrible sound terrible graphics even with the new high definition pack and way to much of the slide effect when walking
overall this game is short and leaves gamers unfulfilled though it does contain opposing force i still feel the  dollar price tag is way to much for a game with uncountable faultsthis review is for halflife blue shift hlbs and the high definition pack hd if you want information about hl or halflife opposing force youll need to go elsewhereto wit this game caught me by surprise
one week my usual foolish salesperson was ranting and raving about the soon to be released hlbs and next week i see it in stores
i admit that i bought every single halflife hl i could get my hands on from the original hl and the promo cd that came with ati rage cards to the poorly done gunman chronicles gc
ive downloaded and installed nearly every quothotquot mod that was flung out onto the web
so naturally i snatched this up when i saw it in the storesthe hd pack offers very little other than enhanced characters and weapons
what i mean by enhanced is that the weapons are supposed to look more realistic that is all
the levels look exactly the same
the ai
did not improve any
its really not worth the extra stress that the graphics would place on the hardware
lets face it the hd pack is not worth the price that any one wants for it
it should have been available for free much like the team fortress classic
i suppose it may be i havent checked to tell the truth
so how is the game
some of the most disappointing work ive seen
true the level of detail and the devious level design are truly ingenious
i spent as much as thirty minutes on some levels trying to find my way about only to be thwarted by a well hidden tunnel or a well placed jumping pad
but despite the great levels there arent enough of them
the game is so short that i would have been better off playing gc which up till now was the shortest hl based game
the game ends so abruptly that its like a car hitting a brick wall
i sincerely thought that i was going to see some awesome programming prowess with a car i could actually drive
when it ends its  bam
just like that
i mean where were all the extra stuff that i saw when i was riding the train
oh 
i walked right by it i suppose
wheres the quotoldquot black mesa base
oh wait
im walking around it now
thats a train yard
im not a train buff but those train cars are impossible look at where the doors are placed on the cars
arent i supposed to be in the same base as gordon freeman
oh wait i guess i am
oh wellquotokquot i thought quotthe games over ill try it onlinequot guess what
there isnt any online gaming via hlbs
i checked with my original version of hl there is no online gaming if you just install hlbs
im guessing that the player can play online if they install hlo but thats just junk
the box clearly states that there is multiplayer and it implies it in two different sections
one part for hlo and another for hlbs
whats the deal
so i read the manual the box says it has multiplayer support the manual clearly states that there is a third pack in quotgamequot called opfor on line
what
it also clearly states that multiplayer is only available in hlo page 
what a joke
more hard drive space gobbled up unnecessarilyif you like hl and you dont have the o pack then by all means buy this game
otherwise avoid it until you see it in the bargain bin
none of the quotextrasquot are worth the incredibly short game and they really add nothing new by way of quotnewquot
i had to give it two stars since i gave gc three and i consider this game a step down from gc
sorry folks its just not worth it unless i see it in the bargain binthat was my expression as i beat teh gameno end boss no new weapons this game just doesnt feel like opposing force or teh original half life at  bucks id suggest buying it if only for the high res pack and a quick run through the levels but the game itself isnt that good its not much combat mostly puzzles until the last  levelsmy advice stands as buy it if only for the high res pack packaged in but dont expect much from teh gamethere is no doubt that final fantasy legend saga in japan billed as final fantasy in the united states to boost sales was a highly advanced game for its time 
however it offers nothing that its sequel doesnt offer and the game is shall we say very poor
not having the advantage of color that its contemporaries dragon warrior final fantasy had the graphics are so poor that they were actually bad in  which says a lot
the story is about as simplistic as they come and you should be able to beat this game in a few hours no problem
considering its limited availability now i doubt anyone will really want to play this game  trust me you arent missing anything
my fellow quotold schoolquot rpg players will call me a heretic but this game has nothing memorable to offer
skip ithaving bought an import gba i was grabbing at any chance i had to get a new game for it
it was too expensive to buy many import games so i had to wait like anyone else for a new game
so when majescos titles hit the sales floor i grabbed this one looking to be the most exciting of the bunch having already played the highly mediocre pitfall remake and beating earthworm jim
little did i know i was falling for one of the oldest tricks in the books
people will be lining up for new gba games even before the system comes out so if your game is first on the shelf it will probably sell
majesco knew it had some mediocre titles so they put them out extremely early to help guarantee sales and it showsfirst the good things
i heard that it had incredible scaling effects but i never expected this
it is gorgeous at first
it will knock your socks off
then you start to notice how repetitive the game is
each level is unique in the flight zone but never changes
and from lack of anything better it has a password functionand on to the bad
this game is no fun to play
it is extremely difficult and aggrivating
the powerups are nonexistant and hardly add any power to your ship
and there is hardly any reward for knocking out fighters because they still tend to hit you so all you do is avoid getting hit  of the time
there is no fun to it and is too frustrating to be played often killing the replay valueso my opinion is to only get this one as a showoff of the insanely good graphics of the system but dont let the person play more than  minutes or theyll get the wrong impression of this great new handheld
just sit back and wait the wekk until castlevania and fzero come out and catch this one in the clearance racks in a monththis game has great graphics
thats about the only great thing about it
i just dont like the game i guess
the graphics are awesome though
a typical japanese animated game with the best explosions you will see
as it claims it is d for the most part
of the  games i bought this is the least interesting but has the best graphics
the music is also ok as it energizes and quotpumps upquot the audienceone thing that i definitly did not like is that you have to beat the game on one life
that means that on  levels you cannot lose a life
each time you beat a level it will give you a password but if you lose four lives on the first level you will have one for the rest of the game
i am not too good at these kind of action games so i didnt get past the rd levelthe game play is poor overall
maybe im being to hard on it but it is just horrible
when there is an object right in front of you your ship blocks your vision making you shoot blindly
throughout the  levels it is just the same horrible gameplayanother ok thing about this game is that it can stand a large number of ships moving on the screen without a single bit of slowdownthe graphics and sound brought this game up from one star but  is still not muchthe first time i laid eyes on iridion for the gba my mouth watered when i saw the gorgous graphics and surprisingly realistic explosions
when i played it though the experience became quite a different one
there are a lot of times when your ship blocks your view of what your shooting and even when you can see what your shooting at you cant judge the distance and with so much on screen action at once you will suffer a lot of cheap deaths
the control is awkward as well and there are times when the game is just plain unforgiving
but like i said the graphics are beautiful so if you like games with gorgous graphics and real shallow gameplay this is for youthis game gets lost in what it wants to be
strategy or puzzler
sadly it does not do either well
fortress becomes dull very quick
the different quotstagesquot are cosmetic and provide no real game play value
it is over way to fast
rent it first but i do not see this game high on many peoples lists
my standards for a pocket game are pretty low
all i expect is something to kill time on a trip or just sitting around
fortress feels like forced labor in which you never get anything donethis was a shock to me
for one thing this game was raved all across the internet
for another thing im familiar with the series as far back as the first three nes games to the snes one and symphony of the night so i thought this would like those
well the gameplay mechanics are here it seems but everything elselets figure this out piece by piece
first the graphics were okay
even though theyre dark and even though theyre a bit lacking in animation only three frame to show the main character running
 the style was okay and it added to the environmentsthe sound was nice and the music was great but everything here just seemed like it could be done much better the music sounds a bit midiish but the melodies are goodthe controls heres where everything really goes down hill
im no stranger to the castlevania control scheme having playing the first four games
however for reasons i cannot fathom this game has by far the worst control setup of all of them which says alot because ive replayed the first three games recently and they havent aged that well
first controling your character is much like controling a big wooden stick
while the same could be said for the first four games in the series this game takes it to far worse extremes especially when considering the enemies move so much better in other words theyre attacks seem more suited to a game that has you moving your character as franticly as a mega man x or mega man zero game
also the option to have the whip spin by itself became rather annoying
unlike castlevania  which allowed you to move the whip around by holding the attack button down this one only makes it spin on its own which is somehow amazingly counterproductive
some of the abilities are nice high jump wall jump etc but they dont alieviate this problem much and actually require overutilization in some areas trust me you would never survive the final battle without high jumpnow the gameplay
ive played other games that used the metroidvania style free exploration found in symphony of the night and aria of sorrow as far as the ones ive played
somehow this one takes that system and just makes you lost
seriously this castle was not as fun to explore as all of the others
the boss battles mostly refering to the last  were super cheap requiring me to overuse the dss system to the most extreme which was a far cry from the more down to earth battles from castlevania  and aria of sorrow
much as i enjoy difficulty i cant stand not being able to have a clear shot at a target with my whip due to the enemy being oversized or too quick to dodgethis is by far one of my most hated castlevania games
if you even think about buying this game since a lot of other people liked it i recommend you find a way to rent it first
otherwise you may get yourself into a snag like i did
lucky for me this was only  at kmart which is about as low as gba games geti expected something like ssxs trick system on a basketball court i mean how could you go wrong with that formula
obviously ea sports big did
this game is a good rental tops
buying it is suicide because i beat it in two days and unlocked all the characters including the gigantic chinese guy and all the courtswhat makes this game so lackluster is no four player support which is a must for any sports game downright awful playbyplay announcing and repetitive gameplay
i played it with a friend for a while but we agreed it lost its appeal quickly
nba jam is still the best hoops game off all time while nba street is only a memoryi played the original firepro wrestling on the sega saturn
it was released in japan only and i needed a translation in english to do anything
my friends and i played this game over and over
in fact we still to this day say critical
which is one of the few english words we could understand
when your wrestler was totally defeated he would be criticaled
the wrestler creation capabilities were and still are the very best offering from any wrestling game
it was  dimensional then and is still d on the gba
if you are like me and dont care about graphics you may still enjoy this game
i bought it on amazon and played it for about  minutes before checking out the wrestler creation
i was shocked to find the format had changed but the tools for creation are still the same as they ever were
however my gaming tastes have changed a lot since  and  dimensional graphics are just too hard to go back to
i can acknowledge the greatness of this game without actually enjoying it but if it didnt cost me only  bucks i would be wrighting a way worse review
if you still pick up mario bros now and again or if you run out to by every new namco or midway or capcom classics game
you may enjoy this game way more than i do now
you might actually get as much enjoyment out of it as my friends and i did  years ago
if you are either under  years old or are currently playing xbox  or xbox live games like halo steer clear of this one
 rating  out of 
  out of i bought this game with high expectations because of all the great reviews on amazon in magazines etc  plus the fact that i have been a fan of music all my life especially dj type stuff which mtvmg claims to provide
but if you really want to make some good music i would advise against it
first off every single vocalriff is terrible and almost hurts to listen to them
the vocalriffs all sound pop meaning you hear some annoying little  year old singing ohhhhh yeeeaaahh baaaby
most of the riffs other than vocals are pretty chill but if you want to actually put together your own songs and not lift from other artists it is hard to make a solid rythem
the reason for this is because in riffedit mode you can only point to one key at a time which is a real   in all honesty this game just inst very good
if you really want to make some good music then take your money elswarethis game is just weak no strong quality that u would hope forpros lots of dbz caracters fun for few secscons waste of money it needs a adventure mode  you will get tierd of itpros portable with the gbacons horrible graphics horrible soundtrack very boring have other gba games that are very much funer and have better graphics ps version is mcuh better mini games arent even worth playingoverall if you mistaked to buy this just playing if you have absolutely nothing else do to
to other people who are going to purchase this dont its not as good as you thinkthis game is frustrating and will make you want to bust your tv if not your playstation
say what the only way to advance is to get first place
okay after time and time again once you know the courese and can probably race it blind folded you can get it
you ever play driver
remeber the very last level when you drive the president and these black cars are constantly ramming you
think of how that made you feel
you will get that same feeling when you place this gamei love racing games
my first experience with a killer racing game was rage racer on ps
i loved r gran turismo and gran turismo  and wipout  on the ps
the pss pure racers have been more sparse for me
i loved gt but short of that i consider the best car game on the system to be gta and gtavc
now to the subject at handautomodellista breaks the one big rule of racing games
it has horrible physics
rent it first please
watch one of your replays
yes you can come to a full stop just turning and im not talking powersliding to a stop you just stop when you turn
also ive hit a wall and watched my car with its center of gravity fixed rotate
the tires arent the source of propulsion in this game as they are in gta and gtmoneyrage racer and the gran turismo series add fun because you have to buy the cars and buy the upgrades
there is no concept of money in am
you want a viper sure have one
you want another to paint different sure have another
any car you got it
im talking before you race one racehowever the graphics are stunning but who caresrent it so you know dont just trust meauto modelista is a huge let down as far as racing sims go with only one saving grace
the thing that matters the most in a videogame is the core gameplay length and replay value and auto modelista falls flat on its face in all three categoriesfirst of all the core gameplay
the game has very short unmemorable tracks which is really a shame because the graphics are excellent
the cars drive terribly powerslide around every turn
as for the car selection the game consists mostly of uninspired import cars and the occasional viper or corvetteas for the length of this game it took me roughly  hours to beat which is laughable compared to the  hours i have on final fantasy  and im still nto even close to done
the longest race is  or  laps long across a tin race course really the load times took more than the race time most of the timeas for the replay value once you beat the game your done might as well use this game for kindling in your fire place
yes it does feature online game play but  it is terribly uninspired and just as boring and brief as the offline expierienceso what is the one saving grace of this game
the pretty graphics of course
through all of the flaws the light of graphics does gleam through on this not so shiny gem
customizing your car is extremely entertaining and finding all the perfect tones of paint for your car
there is also a wide array of stickers and a custom sticker maker
the down side of the sticker maker is that it is no where near user friendly and a tutorial would have been very helpfulin conclusion your money is much better spent elsewhere
this is the kind of title that comes out terrible then the sequel unexpectedly blows you away so lets just keep our fingers crossed that if there is an aut modelista  they completely overhaul the terrible controls and make the races much longeri liked the premise of the game but this game was unnecessarily tedious
i believe puzzles and boss fights should be hard but fun not hard and tedious
there is no internal logic to the game which means the game is very limiting in its structures
what you can use in regular gameplay is different from what you can do during boss fightsother things that inhibit the game play is the camera angles
you dont know where your monster is coming from so it could suddenly appear on your side
it seems stupid to see alyssa run directly into the arms of your killer just because the camera doesnt allow you to spin around
and it doesnt help the alyssa is slow takes about  seconds to get to her feet and is prone to panic attacksi liked the gore and creepiness of the game
it was emotionally pulling although some of the dialogue needed rewriting
the premise is not all the original but still enjoyable but all this is inhibited by the gameplayi dont know if theyre making a clock tower  but if they are the developers should really study the classic horror games out there and see why those worki have played xenogears for exactly  hours and  minutes now and i have fought a wopping  random battles that arent worth my time and have had about  minutes actually playing the game
the other  hours and some odd minutes are freaking cut scenes that arent even good enough to get my attention
the game is not bad though but definitely not a final fantasty or high level rpg
its just a plain run of the mill rpg so dont expect anythingill write this review at the risk of unfounded backlash
i mainly focus on the story aspects of rpgs so ill start with thative heard this game has the best story in any rpg
ive played maybe  hours and the main character frustrated me so much that i stopped after the realization came to me that she would not wise up
i dont want to wait another  hours before the story gets greatthis game is well as many games are for kids
the female main character is brash foolish and screws over the rest of the characters more than once and harvests no sympathy from me
the male character who wants to score a date with her is weakly portrayed and serves as comic relief for a younger audiencemany of the other characters are cute at first from their image to their personalities and their backgrounds are deadly serious
yet much of it is melodrama and becomes unengagingthe reason ive listed two stars is because the graphics and sound are anything youd expect from a squaresoft founded title even if its been taken over by namcoas for this game being a socalled game its functionality is repetetive and boring from the unengaging battle sequences to the endless upgrades you must make for your characters attacks that serve to keep the player busy rather than entertainedthis game is even more disappointing than the dreaded ffx and ffx
 i expected so much more for squaresoftxenosaga is not a true rpg nor is pretty much any console game out there
saga to me however doesnt really even qualify as a game considering you do roughly half as much watching as you do playing which is extrememly ridiculous
believe me i have patience but when it comes to watching dozens of  minute cutscenes you can count me outif xenosaga is to get credit it is for its plotline
while it is interesting and thought provoking it also doesnt bother to explain anything
yes this is episode  of a  part series but who cares this is a game it has a  dollar price tag and i damn sure dont want to pay that much for a game that pretty much rips you offon one hand the cutscenes are well made almost on the lines of mgs
on the other hand the first half of the game features mostly extrememly tedious and boring cutscenes
it is only in the next half of the game where things get interesting but a lot of people will stop forcing themselves to play by then
yes i said forcing because the gameplay is utterly boringgif theres one word that i would use to describe sagas gameplay its linearity
stick with me here you watch a  minute cutscene you run down a hall take a few turns fight some random battles watch another cutscene run down a hall fight some battles watch another cutscene play through a long tedious dungeon watch another cutscene
you get the picture now
you see the problem here is the gameplay and story feel completely seperate
its almost as if your watching an anime movie except there are a few playable parts
the big problem is that the few playable parts are extrememly boring
sure the battle system isnt that bad by any means but by the th battle youll be wondering why the hell your even playingand thats what i asked myself while playing the game why the hell am i forcing myself to go on
just so i can watch another  minute cutscene
from what i remember games are suppost to be played and are suppost to be fun
xenosaga is not an rpg
you want a real rpg
play morrowind or neverwinter nights on multiplayer
dont get me wrong here saga isnt a failure its just that the gameplay feels like a poor excuse to keep watching more cut scenes
i sure as hell am never going to play this game again
i am a huge xenogears fanatic and i really hope that episode  doesnt turn out like this one
xenosaga ep is easily the biggest dissapointment for me in a long long time considering i have waited for this game for years
thumbs downi just started playing this game so i cant write a great review on it
what i can tell you is that there is a good reason why just starting might end up being the only thing i do in this gamefirst off the game has some faults to begin with the graphics are a bit dull if you ask me
the characters are kind of on the blockish side they walk around as if they have spoons up their behinds
this might pass on the psx but its not acceptable on a console like the ps
the characters and visuals seem pretty stale when compared to the sheer romantic artistry and beauty that goes beyond explanation of final fantasy x but of course what doesnt
thats why final fantasy is final fantasy and xenosaga is well xenosagathe xenosaga plot seems pretty interesting so far but again this is an rpg and interesting might not be enough
when i first started final fantasy x i will admit i wasnt too trilled but then something happened
i cant pin point the exact moment but it was pretty early in the game when it just grabbed me and never let go
cant say the same for ffx however
moving on i have a feeling xenosaga has a super great plot but unfortunately i may not get to experience it because the gameplay has one huge flaw that i dont think i can handlei was interested in xenosage because it was supposed to be an epic rpg
i play rpgs for the involvement in an epic storyline i dont play rpgs for gameplay
i feel sorry for anyone who plays rpgs for the menu selections if you want gameplay there are better genres out there
i always scratch my head when people complain about too many cutscenes in an rpg or that the game doesnt have enough exploration
if you want gameplay and exploration go play something else
thats the problem with xenosaga its not just an rpg its also an adventure platformer and not a very good one at that
the platformer part of xenosaga is suppose to be the second hand focus of the game and the quality of it shows that but there seems to be too much of it
there are too many enemies to be avoided by actually using your skill with the controller
there are too many keys to find too many doors to unlock and all sorts of rooms that will get you lost
its not like its there just incase you want to look around
nope you find out you need to go somewhere but the map doesnt show you where you have to search for it yourself
this is just not what i look for in an rpg
if this doesnt change in xenosaga soon im afraid ill have to can itmy husband said he thought i would love this since i absolutely love final fantasy games
i didnt care for this game and turned around and sold it within a week of purchasing itmany have already written on this game so ill try to avoid repeating what theyve said but ultimately this game starts out strong and entertaining enough but settles into a middleground groove thats neither bad nor great but not all too aweinspiring as the game goes onthe voice actor for indiana jones is passable but not too convincing  you can tell its not harrison fordand unsurprisingly it dusts off the longlived stereotype of the dragon lady and at the end indiana gets the asian ie
chinese girl even though theres no plausible reason for her to have any sort of feelings for him  shes little more than a toy doll for him to have his way withthe ending is dull  both the final boss battle and the ending cinematic are little reward for having ran swung punched and kicked your way through level after level trap after trapgood if youre an indiana jones fan but others should either rent or stay away altogetherthis game does not hold up the voice acting is horrid
the graphics are crap 
and the story is just not interistting
good for a good cheap thrill nothing elsethis game is terrible
i went and got it the day it came out and played it for about a half hour and hated it
this is coming from a gamer who is only into mature titles mostly war games such as edited the reasons this game sucks is too many to list but be warnedwait for editedi enjoy many racing games 
gt burnout rallisport 
but this one is horrible
handling is fine graphics are beautiful replay fun but everything else doesnt live up to the hype
sound you cannot hear the cars the cheering washes out the cars and no way to adjust what sound is at what level
tracks are odd and irregular
and ai seem to cheat a bit 
but that is in every game to a degreethe first game we played on gamecube was spongebob battle for bikini bottom
we absolutely loved it and my daughter plays it over and over
thinking shrek  would be similar we rented it
its very hard to control the cstick and it kept zooming in and out and wouldnt rotate the camera except for certain times
the charactors were very distant and even if we used the cstick to zoom in it still wasnt close enough
its the same feeling as needing to put eyeglasses on to see something more clearly
another aspect we didnt like was the four charactors are always together and you would lose track of which one was the main charactor
maybe were spoiled because the cstick on spongebob allowed you to rotate in every direction to see what was around you and the graphics were so good you could see facial expressions
its surprising all the reviews are so good because our impression was completely oppositethis game suffers from an unusual problem that most sequels dont it seems the developers listened to the gaming community
the first spiderman the movie game was a lot of fun but it had its limitations it was too linear there was no room for exploration and your activities were limited to the skies and rooftops and a few indoor areas
spideyfans and gamers alike wanted more room to swing and more opportunities to use their great powers with great responsibility but less linearitysm bucks that trend
in a nod to grand theft auto style gaming the city is now yours to explore
there are huge skyscrapers dark alleyways and bustling streets
you can either choose to follow along with the linear plot seek out minimissions that net you points you can use to purchase upgrades or hunt down hidden items for no apparent reason than a higher overall scorewhile great in concept the implementation is sorely lacking
there are only a handful of randomlygenerated minimission types car chases robberies airlandandsea rescues which forces you to replay the same tired action sequences over and over and over
fun for a bit but not for hours and hours of filler
the way the game is structured you have to purchase upgrades to progress so you are forced to take hundreds of these minimissions to follow the games main plotswinging around the city is lots of fun and you get a bunch of different upgrades web zip line and slingshot for example that arent really functionally necessary but still add to your enjoyment
in addition you can pull off weird midair tony hawklike stunts also purchasablefor no apparent reason other than that they are marginally enjoyable as wellthe main plot is well done
it diverges from the movie and adds in some nifty comic book characters such as rhino and the black cat but the generally outline defeat octavius and win back mary jane remains the samethe fighting system has apparent depth but most combat against nonbosses can be resolved with button mashing
it can be fun at times tossing bad guys left and right but after awhile pounding thugs into the pavement or hanging them off lampposts looses all semblance of a challenge
sm is also the  game to feature a matrix bullettime mode
yawnso much could have been done with this game that i cant help but suspect that we were given an unfinished product set to be released concurrently with the movie
it is truly a shamenot worth the full purchase price
rent or buy used unless youre a spiderman fanatic
if so find a good salethey say if it aint broke then dont fix it
i loved the first spiderman game
the graphics were crisp and detailed the story was deep and involving and the controls were precise and tight
then grand theft auto vice city came out which completely rewrote the video game genre
games like true crime and the getaway were released that practically copied the gta formula free roaming cities minimissions mayhem and violence etc
add spiderman  to the list with mediocre resultsi admit that i was initially excited when i heard that spiderman could now swing freely through the city and bust bad guys on the streets below
though the former is exhilirating and excellently implemented the latter is dull and repititious
like gta there is a minimap of the city in the upper right hand corner of the screen
whenever there is trouble a green icon will appear in the location where a crime is taking place
unfortunately there is a lack of variety in these missions
you will either have to prevent a robber from getting away take an injured civilian to the hospital catch a civilian from falling to his or her death or save people from a sinking boat
after a few of these youll begin wishing that the game would just get on with the story
solving these missions contribute to your hero points which allow you to purchase moves and combos from a spidey store
since when did spidey have to buy his own moves and combos
strangeunfortunately due to the heavy reliance on memory and processing power to produce the massive scope of the game the graphics are the first to suffer
in most instances the game resembled a playstation  game
spidey generally looks good but the other characters in the game look like spraypainted cardboard boxes
i would have preferred a much scaleddown city in order to boost the quality of the graphics because quite frankly spiderman  is an ugly gamefans of the first game will most likely be disappointed with the sequel
though the ability to explore the city by swinging from building to building is a treat the gameplay and graphics truly suffer
this one is definately a rentali purchased this game on june  and popped it in immediately getting all revved up for the enjoyable experiance of being everyones favorite friendly neighborhood spidermanthen the load screen happened and i gaspedthe colours only use a  wheel spectrum for the most part dating back to the origianl spider man comic book game on the ps
the characters mouths dont move the hands are mittens and the colours when you get up close arent that great eithernow the game play
the swing machanics even on extreme are simplistic and do what the game tells them to as for roaming around the city its not enjoyable or fun
you have maybe  variety of missions which you must do before getting on with this story
none of them are fun or creativethis game does deserve two stars though for voice acting its tremedously good and corny
what youd expect from a spiderman era gamemuseum games are more of a lesson in classic gaming than an experiencenamcos gameboy advance release of the namco museum follow the same path the williams has taken in their several greatest hits releases
this current installment of the namco museum includes a roster of five games
these games are ms pacman  galaxian  galaga  dig dug  and pole position 
these games have been fully restored on a single gba cart for your portable convenience
granted it is nice to have five different games on one cartridge but i would hardly call this a worth while titlei can not site any performance issues nor can i compare the namco museum to any of the current games out there
my reasoning behind this is because namco fully restored atari classics and packaged them for a modern system
though i personally am not keen on this idea i will admit it is nice to remember the simple times
each game is configured to interface with the dpad and the face buttons whereas the shoulder buttons have no function in this package leaving the  controls as simple as the games themselvesto my disappointment both galaxian and galaga are virtually the same game
this means that you are paying for four games when they advertise five
the slight difference between galasxian and galaga is the entrance of the enemies
in galaga enemies fly into view and bombard you as they enter
in galaxian the enemies are just lined up at the top of the screen waiting for you to shoot them
all namco needs to do at this point is throw in space invaders and advertise six games but  you will still only have four unique gamesthe bottom line is the namco museum is more of a history lesson than a worth while game
i rated this a  stars because ms pacman and dig dug are still fun titles but the other three just dont have a lasting replay value
i would pass this title up unless it was on the discount rack for less than five dollarsnamco museum lets you play old atari classics on your gameboy advance
these include galaga galactica dig dug pole position and ms pacmanthis is of course a great idea in theory  i love some of these games
but while the games might be really fun to play on a bigscreen console they are really tough on the tiny screen
for example ms pacman comes in two modes  a full screen mode and one that scrolls up and down showing you a partial screen at a time
the full screen mode has really really tiny ghosts and characters you can barely time your movements and often get stuck on walls
the scrolling mode is better in the sense that the characters are larger but now you can easily scroll down into an enemy and the same character control issues occuron pole position its all about sliding left and right as your racecar goes around curves
with the arrowcontrol of the gba its one light tap to make a hard turn
if you accidentially press too hard on the arrow you smash into the side signs or nearby cars
it makes driving very difficultdig dug is a great game where you burrow in the ground and try to drop rocks on the heads of dragons
is this revenge of smaug
again i love the game but the controls make it difficult
you can be planning a careful tunnel to a rock and end up off by a bit making the tunnel uselessgalaga and galaxian are both classic spaceshooting games
galaxian is a quotsecret bonusquot in that its not mentioned on the box but is provided on the cartridge
i really love both of them but the controls are just as sluggish and imprecise here
with galaxian having the penalty of quotonly one shot on the screen at a timequot those missed shots make a huge difference in playabilityif you have a regular console id recommend these games on a differnet system
i love the games themselves
but the gba version is rather awkward
everyone i had try this out got frustrated very quicklythis game has  great titles of classic games
they are ms pac man galaga galaxian dig dug and pole postion
this sounds pretty decent but really no fun is coming out of this
heres the reviews on the gamesms
pac man i love ms pac man but its impossible to play on this
you play tiny or huge kinda like that one world in sm
when you play tiny its too dificult to see where the ghosts are and such
the huge screen is useful untill your scrolling down and run into a ghost you couldnt seegalaga its fine but its boring
no value is brought to you when your playinggalaxian its the same with galaga no replay value at all
i dont know why thats happening but something dosnt feel right playing galaga or galaxian on the gbadig dug this is very fun on this one of the only games i play im gonna sell this game soon
but the controls can be funkypole postion oh my god what happend here
when the womens suppose to say prepare to be qualified all i hear is mmmmmmmmmeeemmmm
it like mumbles
when your turning on this you are complety messed up dosnt work at alloverall if your an absoulte dig dug fan get this if your not dont bother thinking about itthis is just a dumb game like mk  was
almost all versions of this game was stupid except for the sega saturn version
but none of the home versions were better than the original aracde version
this is not a good game
the graphics are very inferior like those of the regular mortal kombat  for this system and the controls are bad
if you ever will find it and you still have its system get the sega saturn version only
unfortunately there never was a playstation version for this game
the last mk game that was released for super nintendo before the system was discontinued for the nintendo the sega genesis version of this game is no where near as good as the arcade
in fact i would say that it doesnt even come close
there are stages missing sheeva has been removed from the game  voices have also been removed
the animalities that are in the arcade version have also been removed
the music also sounds nothing like the arcade game
scorpions fatality has been changed
so has strykers friendship
the only good thing about this game is that the hidden characters are instantly unlocked
if you are expecting alot from getting this title on the genesis you will be severely disappointed
if you have to have it as part of a collection make sure that its cheaply pricedthis game is basically just an upgrade to mortal kombat it brings back some old characters that were not in mksuch as scorpionreptilekitanajadeas well as a few new ones such as rain and ermacthe sega genesis port and the snes ports were kinda blandits been awhile since i played this gamebut from what i can rememberthere were some missing elements to thisi think sheeva was missinganimalalities were taken outand a few backgrounds were gone tooalso with this genesis versionyou will also need a six button pad to play itlike with mkunless you wanna put yourself through the torcher of using a three button controllermy best advice would be to just leave umk alone and pick up mortal kombat trilogy for another system insteadits got everything this game has and moreonly buy thisif you are a die hard genesis collectoror if you dont own a playstationnintendo  or a sega saturni am appalled at the fact that this game is so repetitive and developers cant seem to make a good godzilla gameive seen the reviews
seriously is it really that difficult
this game is incredibly boring and repetitive and is not fun
all you do is direct godzilla where to go and during that process he destroys the same buildings over and over again relentlessly with no purpose in doing so
he may destroy a tank or fight a boss here or there but it is incredibly boring and i really dont see how these other amateur critics gave this game four stars
avoid this game people its too repetitive and boring for anyone except idiots
so just wait for the day a good godzilla game comes out because this one is just badthis version of mortal kombat  sucks
the characters are boring here the graphics are bad the music is bad and the fatalities arent as good in this version
this is not really a good version of mk  to buy
but mk  wasnt really that good of a game to begin with
if you want this game i suggest you look for the playstation version and leave all the other versions of this game alone
this was one of the last  mk games that came out on the super nintendo before it was discontinued for the nintendo product was advertised with original book of codes and didnt come with it kinda necessary if its use is to be of valuedand the only books available are twice what the genie costsdont expect any realism in this game
after all the reviews i thought this was the best thing to ever happen to video game basket ball
its alot like the old nba jam games for super nintendoexcept instead of two on two its three on three
you do pretty much the same tricks over and over again on each possesion and then dunk the ball
sure the dunks look cool and nothing is better than throwing the ball off your friends head but after a while its all the same
there is no goal tending so the best thing is to have a  footer like shaq just guarding the basket
since its first to  pts normal shot pt long range  pts during a regular game you can get at least  blocks most likely  or  in addition to the score of the game you get pts for doing scoring
there isnt a good was to explain this except give an example
after doing a couple tricks then dunking you would get about  pts
for just shooting the ball no dunk you get around  pts
three pointer will give you  pts
these pts add up and at the end of each individual game you get reward pts
reward pts can be used at the store to unlock hidden features
the only thing a team needs to be excellent is to have a person who handles well  so during tricks the ball doesnt get knocked loose and a big man
during game play you fill your game braker meter by doing tricks
fill it once to do a level one game breaker
if you choose not to use it you can pocket it and fill it again to do a level  gamebreaker
level one game breakers add  pt to your score and take away a pt from the opponent for a shot from inside the three pt line
you can shoot a three and get two pts and have one pt taken away from the opponent
the downside of just shooting threes is that you get a lot higher score for dunks if you do a level two gamebreaker after a couple tricks and dunk it could get as much as  pts
one really nice feature is the be a legend mode where you create a player and pick up a few teammates and take them to the street for pick up games as opposed to the regular nba mode if you finish the nba mode first you can build a better begining player to play with but for more of a challenge you can start out fresh
you go to courts and play the best the city has to offer
it has alot of games to play before you finish so itll take around  hrs to play
a major flaw to me is that players cant be traded
western conference teams made alot of moves during the offseason and we cant play with the new teams
that means lakers dont play with payton and malone timberwolves wont have sprewell or cassell robinson is still on the spurs and so on
the game is a good game to play with friends but after a while its just boringthe daredevil movie was good but this game has little to do with it other than the picture on the box
forget the storyline or the repetitive gameplay or the boss battles and even the radar sensewheres the save function on here
there is none
thats right
instead of being able to save your game you have to write down the quotpasscodequot they give you to get you back to your place in the game
not since the wonderful days of the snes have we resulted to such an idiotic method of saving games
and dont tell me the capability isnt there because they have it in virtually every other gba game out there
the sound effects are fine the graphics are pretty good and the response is ok if youre just a huge fan of dd grab a pen and paper to remember your save code and go for it
not recommendedabout the only thing the dd gba game has going for it is the fact that it doesnt star ben afleck and in a game this bad its a good thing
the man without fear deserves better than this braindead sidescroller that takes players on a listless jaunt throught hells kitchen to beat up people using feeble martial arts and acrobatics
yawninducingly generic level design and lousy graphics might have been forgivable had they implemented this neat little invetion called collision detection that games use today although using dds radar sense to detect hidden items and boss weaknesses is kind of cool
still see the movie before you play this game so youll get some thrill out of itlet me get one thing straight
i love the tony hawk franchise
everytime a new tony hawk game comes out it consumes my life for at least a month
my entire world becomes a huge skatepark as i start looking for a good skating line everywhere i go
however the reason tony hawk has become such a popular game is because it is a skating game that is actually easy to control that just about anybody can pick up and play without any trouble where you can do insane inhuman tricks that most people would never think of attempting in real life
unfortunately the game boy advance version of tony hawks pro skater  is very hard to control
the game needs to be d not d like this game is
you will find yourself constantly turning the wrong direction because of this
in addition the awkward placement of the buttons on the game boy advance can be very frustrating
if you are used to playing on the playstation or n it will take quite some time to get used to hitting the r and l buttons for the moves the a button to ollie and the b button to grind
i constantly found myself hitting the wrong buttonswhen it comes down to it you will be playing the same tony hawk as you played on your playstation but with fewer levels
because of the aforementioned control problems you will not be able to pull off the insane stunts and scores that you could on your playstion version
even if you could your character is so small that it would not look nearly as cool as it did on your tv at home
why bothertony hawk is a great game but if you are good at thps espescially thps this is not a game for you
not
while its fun for a while it gets really easy to beat
after a while  days i was able to beat the game with any character in  minutes
however if you dont intend to play this game all the time maybe only on roadtrips or during a plane flight then its great
good graphics good sound nice cheats but the controls are somewhat lacking
gameplay is downright bad
dont think im some jerk though i loved this game at first
its just too dang easy and repetetive
get advance warsim going to get straight to the point on this one
if you already own ghost recon i highly suggest you dont waste your money on operation flashpoint
you are going to end up so disapointed youll probably quit buying computer games for a month
heres whythe graphics are pretty impressive
however you just dont get the same feel as you do in ghost recon
its more video game graphics than realism
its almost a glorified super mario brothers type graphics
get the ideathe sound is another issue
it just doesnt make you feel like your actually out on the battle field
the radio transmissions will give you a headache and confuse the heck out of you before you can actually understand them
ever turn on the tv when the cables out
you know the white snow noise
imagine playing a military game and  percent of the time thats all you hearthe gun fights are boring
you get shot at by little dots that look like soldiers about  meters away
you dont actually feel like they are on top of you like in ghost reconthe bottom line is thisif you want a realistic military infantry game go with ghost recon
its got the graphics and the sound that you expect from a great military game
if you dont beleive me play both of them and youll quickly see what im talking about
take your money and go with ghost recon youll be very happy you didtake care
updatei currently put this on my new system ghz p geforce  ti  etc to see if it was any better and same result
decent game but not up to par with whats out there
its getting cheaper and the price is getting closer to what its worthfirst off i am not one of these people who get easily discouraged however with that said i could not even fishn the game cause it was no fun
this game suffers from realism at the expense of fun
first off lets get the basics downthe graphics stink and compare to the same games od that year it should have been betterthe controls are ok but the vehicle mission control are awefulthe weapons are plenty bet there accuracy leaves much to be desiredthe levels are vast and you can do alot in them i will give it thatthe story is not all that revealing and the characters feel fake rather than realthis game if for anyone who values realism over fun that aint me i play games to enjoy the experience
however there might be people who like realism more than fun and if so this is your gameim going to forego my usual indepth reviews for this game
we all know what twisted metal is and this is nothing more than a rehash of those same games
heres whyprosexcellent graphicscool minimoviesendurance  challenge levels are interestinggood to pass time withconsshort game with small levelsrepetitious gameplayboring endings to each charactersame old rehash of earlier tm gamesnot enough totaldestruction of buildings and such for this type of gameif you want to be burnedout by a game i recommend burnout test drive and twisted metal black
not worth the money
a renatal at bestthis game is a bit short
it has a few alternate routes where you are allowed you to choose to go left or right at certain checkpoints
but these alternate routes are very short and do not make a big impact on the fun of the game or the story of the game
so there is not enough replay value for you to go back to choose one of the alternate routeshouse of the dead is more interesting in that the story moves along differently depending on which rooms you go intoconfidential mission may appear like a copycat of virtual cop but i own both virtual cop games for saturn and they are a lot more fun than confidential missioni am not faint of heart nor am i unschooled in playing pc games  there was a time when i played civ ii so much i could barely get to work the next day
this incarnation of the game looked and sounded fun so i bought it based on the raves i heard  the graphics are fun its nice to have everything in d but that is about the only upside to this gamethe things that i was looking forward to the most new trade and diplomacy options are a bust
trade is easier now but you just really cannot get anything useful out of it
trade does not function well
you have to have a sea route or a land route to an ai country to trade with it
once there is a sea route you and the ai need harbors
but the ais dont build harbors for centuries even when they can
for a land route you have to build a road
you can expect that the closest ai will also always be your enemy so good luck trading with them or though them you can but you lose the route when you go to war with your neighbor
all the ais almost always demand more than the trade is worth
then they are very happy to drop trading with you and trade amongst themselves cutting the human player out totallytrade and diplomacy are inextricably linked now
this gets to the biggest disappointment  diplomacy worked much better in civ   diplomacy is a misnomer in this game
ais demand you basically have to give in
you ask and maybe can get what you want by giving up everything you have only to have the ai become annoyed or furious with you anyway
this is not because i do not know how to negotiate  i do it for a living you just cannot get anything but a bad deal in this gameso that leaves just waging war mostly
here the game has picked up one of the more unfortunatel traits of civ   the ais do not have to build any city improvements but you do to keep your people happy
the upshot is that they have the time and the money to spend building armies that you must devote to building other things
a few good tactical victories during the inevitable war usually gets the ai to the peace table but you have to start rebuilding everything destroyed from scratch wasting more time and money
the ai just goes back to building wonders and military units and then blitzes you with dozens of units the next time around
it becomes dull and repetitousi would have been happier if they had just taken civ  and improved the graphics   that would have been enough
instead they ruined the game
now i am mostly just bored by civ after about a week of playing im getting more and more upset with civ   here are some of my latest gripes the culture effect seems to have problems
in one game even though id built  out of  great wonders and  out of  small wonder and my culture at over  was almost  times that of any other player according to the histograph i no longer took over cities right next to me
plus in a war i kept losing cities that id taken over even though they were filled with my troops all rebels had been eliminated i was running under a democracy thus immune to propaganda and all the people were happy w some as entertainers
plus when those cities deposed my governor my own national military units just disappeared
this is very upsetting the inability or more precisely poor ability to make actual armies is horrible
first you cant produce leaders they just appear if youre lucky
secondly once you have a leader you can only stack  units with him
so for the majority of the time youre stuck building individual units and just sending them in a stream to wherever you need to fight
combined arms is totally missing corruption makes an empirebuilding game impossible
i took over another continent
i was ruling under a diplomacy from the manual  quotone of democracys greatest advantages is its ability to squelch corruption and waste
both are minimal in your citiesquot
i had courthouses in every city its the second thing i build right after the temple
id built the forbidden palace which is supposed to lower corruption though my capitol was still on my first continent
upon checking one of my new cities i found that corruption was eating up  out of the  shields the city produced
thats a  corruption rate
with that kind of corruption theres no point in ever owning more than a dozen cities units from previous eras can still damage more modern units
i cant count the number of times a single enemy spearman has killed my tanks
this is totally unacceptable diplomacy seems to be brain dead
my opponents dont seem to pay any attention to my past behavior in determining what theyre going to do to me
i spend the whole game sharing technology resources luxuries maps etc with these people and all of a sudden out of the blue they declare war on me
im not sure how to phrase this
but they act without any moral feeling just like computers i suppose g resource distribution is horrible
in one game only one player in the entire world had rubber
plus because trade has been quotsimplifiedquot to the point of disappearance theres no real insight into how much youve got or when it will dry up
so far it doesnt even look like the amount you have has anything to do with production
if you have it it seems you can make as much of something as you want at a time until the resource dries up
in a game i just finished i was the only one in the entire world to have saltpeter iron and aluminum and the iron didnt show up until late in the game
also even though i could see rubber oil and coal on the map in other nations none of these showed up for trade until late in the game
all of those resources appeared linked via roads to cities on the coast
is the ai so braindead that it doesnt ever build itself some harbors for trade the times when resources show up need to be modified
in my last game apparently i was one or two ages ahead of everyone else
i needed things like aluminum rubber and oil but they were nowhere to be found
in a frustrating episode i had aluminum long enough to complete all but three parts for my alpha centauri ship
but while i was researching my last advance my aluminum quotminequot dried up
there was no aluminum anywhere on the planet
i finally figured out that if i gifted a nation with all the technology it needed to advance one or two ages up to and including the rocketry advance the would finally see aluminum and put it on the market i ended up giving that nation  to  technologies
this is dumb
there needs to be some mechanism to allow me to tell some relatively primitive society that ill buy that shiney rock from it
of course the best way would be to just show all resources all the time espionage is way too expensive
doing anything worthwhile correctly usually costs thousands of dollars
i rarely have more than  available
also it doesnt make sense
i tried finding a mole in one of my cities
i failed and a nation declared war on me
why should my trying to clean up my ranks bother anyone else
plus why should i have to specifically say to do this and pay for it
once i build the spy agency this should be standard operating procedureive got another  words or so of complaints
but im out of spaceciv iii is much anticipated and i would say quite disapointing
civ ii had a number of unballanced aspects howitzers that won ever engagement and railroads that allowed instant transport to name a few
however it was a good simulation of cultural development
civ iii lacks many of the key technological improvements of civ ii no rail so you always use the same roads that you built in  bc and no improvments in agriculture that makes the game less fun
they should have made the game more ballanced but still kept the flow of history that made it great beforeget sid meiers alpha centauri the true heir to civ  insteadits a game which trumphs this one in all respects except the trivial oneslike graphicspros tons of fun at the higher ages requires good strategy and logical thinking skills lets you rebuild historycons takes a very long time to get to a higher age imbalanced combat
example my military advisor told me to get archers because theyre better than warriors then when my archer engaged in combat with a warrior he was easily defeated by the warrior half of the time youre going to be hitting spacebar to skip your turn no onlinemultiplay capabilites unless you waste your money on an expansion cant choose a starting age no campaignstory mode can sometimes take way too long to finally finish a gamefinal verdictthe cons outnumber the pros and even though this game can be quite fun at times it has way too many major issues and if you want them fixed then youll need to pay extra money for expansion packsi bought this thinking id find a new game with new units with some interesting changes from the previous two versionsinstead i got civilization that was released in the early s with new graphicsthere is nothing new that i would justify this being called a sequal
this is simply a remake of a great game
its not worth the investment in the high price they are asking for this itemthis game does not draw you in
it is somehow less enticing than civ ii
it is cold distant and impersonal and feels like the rival call to power
i hate to admit it but call to power is better than this version of civ because call to power has neat stuff such as underwater and space colonies
i did not find any cool units in this game nor any cool concepts
quotculturequot is a trick
it does not enrich the game and often makes the conquest of cities frustrating because citizens rebel and overthrow yougive me a break
what this game calls quotculturequot is an empty word
apparently you have to build temples in all your cities and feverishly construct quotwonders of the worldquot to gain culture
slow and uninspring this game lacks any new imagination
there has been no progress made since civ ii in terms of spicing the game up and making it more interestingthis gba game is quite challenging but thats not my problem with it
the problem is the graphics is lowquality and the levels very repetitive
theres very little to do other than shooting your way around and all the soldier enemies look the same
the tiny dots that make up the enemies make it difficult to aim and shoot so the challenge frequently turns into frustration
all this is not helped by rather poor sound effects
i do not recommend this fps at least not for purchase at the current high price
i hate myself for falling for the james bond license and wasting just a warning for any buyers that the server for this game has had huge problems and has crashed numerous times
apparently the server was never tested with the amount of people that would be playing online
right now the company is putting a hold on free onemonth trial accounts as most people have yet to play the game onlinei would wait a few months before purchasing this title
in the age of internet financial disasters this is another title that was rumored to have been rushed into production because of limited income
in other words the game wasnt tested enough to make sure it would work right
the game looks fun and exciting if it works but i would check out internet bulletin boards or news sources before purchasing this game and the monthly online payments to make sure everything is satisfactoryi waited for this game since the very early planning stages about four years ago participated in the developer chats muddled through the website updates was very active in the forum and community and made several good friends which i still keep in touch to this day even though we never played the game together
why didnt we
cornered rat software crs promised the world and failed horriblyi could write a fivepage essay on why this game deserves such a low rating but since that will ust pile on the not helpful reviews i will keep it to a couple paragraphsthe game will never be complete
crs has chosen to do map updates which erase everything that happened every so often which leaves neither side unable to win and this is not a big fun fps it is nothing more then capture the flag on a large scalethe graphics and sound are abysmal to state it very plainly
it looks like this could be played on a playstation or nintendo  but wait there is more
in spite of the terrible graphics and cartidrigequality sound you need a monster system to play this on mb ram will let you fly planes
i understand that in a mmolg you need to make sacrifices but not on a scale like thisill stop now there have been constant updates and patches and i have tried so hard to like this game but it is nothing that was orignally promised
the sinister backstory behind its release is another review upon itself
all i can say is stay away for a year and although everything will be severly out f date by that time this game might just be what they orignally promised it wouldthe only reason i gave it we must wait and see what happens in a year or so but i am not keeping my fingers crossed and am having a blast with ghost recon onlinecreators need to lay off that funny tasing water not tastingevidently in my view they decided to try to made this look good for some greeni bet im not making any senseto the pointthis game is way to shorti finished it in just  days times during the weekendthe campaign can also be very boring and it get very tiring intercepting mostly light mechs and it gets hard to get heavy mechs except the ones that become available about every  missionstoo many new mechs and not many of the old onesdont know how they could leave out the nova catneeds a little work yetunlike other games such as force commander and ages of empire and mechcommander now when theres a lag spike and u click somwhere when that lag spike is over it doesnt count your clickthe light mechs need more room for more weapons i know they are light mechs but they need more than only like  lasers and  lrm
to the good thingsover all the game completely blows in single playerhoweverthe multiplayer allows very active play and all mechs more availabilitys more mapsmostly all the good there isvery good d graphics and the artillary is ok toofew more bad thingsi would be so much happier if this game had a instant actionthis is one of those games that are made for instant action but this has nonekinda untalentedalmost all the games from the mech warrior series have had a instant actionreally strange that this one doesntthe end im off to play mechcommander and mechwarrior and mwfar away from the good rating of a must buydont buyltbrwhat a disappointment
after  years of waiting i finally get to play it expecting another masterpiece from chris taylor
instead i get this pretty dungeon hack
boo
even diablo  had a story in there somewherei bought this in a moment of weakness when there were no new first person dd type games out there
i had been burned by other rd person games but decided to see what someone else besides the baldurs gate people could do with thingsthe game was very linear and to me very annoying to play
i had problems with the party ai and did not like that i could not veer off the path to any extent
i got maybe halfway through it and quit
not my cup of teanot only is this game linear dumbdowned and boring but its graphics leave something to be desiredi dld the demo just to check it out and was highly disappointedi recomend neverwinter nights for the fan of any rpg of high meritonly two things separate this game from the pack really  the score
the music in this game really adds to the immersion of the game
this i suppose doesnt mean all that much since the immersion is not very compelling but without the music it would be abysmal  graphics
ds is head and shoulders above diablo  and baldurs gate the two games it is most frequently compared toanother review on this site says something to the effect of quotthis game plays itselfquot  i agree
honestly the only enjoyment i have gotten from it is listening to the music as my beautifully rendered character walks around a beautifully rendered landscapetrust me though that gets old quick even with graphics and music as engaging as dssmy advice  wait for nwn or morrowindthis game is really annoying and can remind you of not the cool fantasy with adventure but the little pink fairy magic that you see in the forest
gosh why do people like this game so muchim not even giving a review because if you get it youll cancel the subscription the next month like i did
look at screenshots and itll tell youthe pictures lie its a trick dont listen to them
if you want adventure like that youll have to be playing till your an old man
get final fantasy xi or dark age of camelot or somethingyeah this game is fun
sure its fun when you start out
you think its a whole new world ahead of youbut its not
i cancelled the subscription to this game after about a month
you can have up to  characters and they can be any class and race you wish
there are ogres humans elves etc
and their classes are things like wizards warriors rogues and that
it will really remind you of mythology because of their spells and stuffits what people always do they train and gain a few levels and get some cash from their enemy
then they go buy some new weaponsarmourpotions
they train till a certain level so they know they will be good enough to go out far through the everquest world
sure they are strong enough but they expected more
tons of cool abilities andor spells and items that makes it look cool like you see on trailers
but they dont get it
they train and train and accomplish nothing just like some other people are saying
thats why i got rid of itif you want a good fun actionadventure online rpg that is way more fun then id suggest  dark age of camelot   i have that game and it is what i expected
its what i call fun to the aussie who was a little bit rude if the game isnt out yet how can you say its gonna be good if the game isnt out yet
if a game like focom was a lemon and it has all the big anticipation like gbg why should i write good things about a game similar to focom 
focom has a problem with compatibility with videosounds cards it has nothing to do with the specs of any pc thats why everybody hated focom
try to understand first and then criticize about spelling mateto the others yes i havent played the game but is sad that a great company like lucasarts cannot come up with something better than aoe perhaps when the game arrives then all reviews would be valid or notwe shall seeall i have to say bout this game is that it is fun for a couple hours once you get your lightsaber
there are some fun levels and special effects are great but  now the con no real replayability once i finished it which didnt take too long i didnt want to play it again and the multiplayer isnt much better than the first jedi game i recommend waiting for knights of the old republic to come out if you really want to lightsaber duel
also star wars galaxies is coming out in january and will be a great online rpg with space wars and light saber battlesi guess the first thing ill say is that i got jedi academy before i got this game
i was hugely dissaponted
i really liked jedi academy but this game is not that great
i have cheat codes so i can have all wepons and all amo and i can be undying
there are partes in this game that are insainly tought
there are way to many puzzles  i dont mind puzzles but there are simply way to many
and some on them are insainly hard
i would recomend you to get jedi knight jedi academy  way better the puzzles arent insain and you get to choose what you look like andwell i could go on but ill leave it there
if you aredy have jedi academy and you want another star wars game that is  then you sould get battlefront thats anoter great game
just dont get this gamethis game started off quite well
but it has flaws that just detracts from the game so much
a serious lack in the ease of finding the plot
after a while it can be tricky to have any idea what the character is meant to be doing
alot of rpgs spoon feed the plot
this ones becomes so hidden that you are left wondering what is the point
the graphics are ok but the repetative use of graphics makes the game not only harder to navigate but also visually dull
it just lacks deapth and interest
interesting characters like rummy just are not in it enough
there are better rpgs out there and there will be better ones for the ps comingwhy is it that every time a new game system comes out in this case the mighty ps companies flood the market with poor games sometimes with graphics which would be a letdown on an older machine sometimes with gameplay that will put a razor to your wrist and sometimes games that just out and out suck on all frontswhile ephemeral fantasia may not be the worst game ever made it is certainly a disappointment especially when one considers the fact that it was released by konami
i tried i mean i really tried to get into this game but it is just horrible
yeah the minigames are fun hey i gave it  stars but please please steer clear of this travesty of an rpg
i want my money backmy head is poundingcould the plucktastic sound track composed by zamfir and his mighty flutepeckers be the cause
or might it be the tepid time traveling plot that is causing my neck muscles to contort in vulcan death grip stylei think it might be the horrid translation that is not only lacking strength and integritybut is also filled with grammatical pitfalls carl lewis couldnt jumpwheres my aspirinthe mini games and such are nice distractions from the rudimentary battle systemand some incorporate the use of konamis guitar freaks controlleronly available as an importbut the scale of the town maps and the repetitive graphics make navigating around the map a laborious choreand wait til you get into fisticuffs with the enemyit looks like they spent about seven polygons on the whole worksmaking ef look like a high res aidyn chroniclesthe best thing about the game is the triangle button which throws the game into fast forwardits light hearted farewhich is a relief from the usual d and d but this is not a very good rpgwhen i looked at the cover i was convinced that this is a good game
indeed this game delivered a solid rpg gameplay
however as i compared it to ffx this game was lacking
it has no characters vocal no point of destination and the game repeated for several timesthe graphics was not so good which made me lost my interest in playing this game until the end
the monsters were not as unique as other rpg gamesits really fun to play a musical instrument a guitar
i get hooked by the mini games
although it has a variety of songs it only based on one song
the last song that mouse should performed to xelpherpolis was so difficult
the rhytm was so fastseriously this game needed some modifications before it was released to the market
i hoped konami will remake this gameoplease rent this game before you buy it
if youre satisfied then purchased it laterthis has to be the most important review for this system because it will help you decide if the ps is right for you
i brought mine back in november   it started malfunctioning in january
only after  months
now im not sure it its my fault or sonys human error
on their part the diagnonsis function does not work  in my opinion i found it to have no function
what i did was buy the already upgraded gameshark  on an auction website  it started messing up after that
besides that gamesharkcom aka interact accs
tells up to use only their codes in which i did i havent used any codes out side gamesharkcomsome of their codes do not work but they selfrightously claim that their codes work 
i even told them that i triple check codes for validity
with my  version ps gameshark brought in march   upgraded to  in november  my  playstation  lasted for  years until july  before i got the  version which lasted for another  years
until august  i think that this is sonys fk up as they built the playstation  to resist the gameshark
let me just say that as long as there are video game systems that there will also be gamesharks but there should not be intentional malfuntions to snatch more  from the average consumer
oh but wait
currently my playstation  still does play the regular blue disks but not the silver dvd roms or dvd moviesthis has been many dollars for my thoughts not including the other games that i brought  do not work
sony should just drop the price of the console already because the original price was not worth iti have to say since i have a hih version ps my gameshark works well all the time but hears the main flaw i have a gameshark  and codes for the games i want only work on gameshark 
games like splinter cellwhich i really need codes for badly xenosagaso i can play it again and have no trouble and a lot of other games
this is major bs
i brought this in december now its like a useless piece of garbage
why cant i upgrade this or something
well one things for sure im not spending another  bux for another gameshark just to play my new games
id rather beat it on my own
if you dont have a gameshark and need one get version but then theyll screw you over in the future when version  comes out
interact is just too greedy for their own good
well their not getting their grubby hands on my money for a long time or maybe neveri havnt had much problems but on the side that you have a  chance of it not working wait there is a word for that its called a scamyou cant enter your own codes for the ps disc you have to buy a stupid upgrade disc that doesnt even have the codes you wantfor example i have a code for spyro the dragon to fly instead of glide now i cant get that on my ps now can i
because i cant enter it in or get it on the upgrade discsave your ps gs it is  times betterfinal fantasy iv works fine and the load times arent a problem
however the load times for chrono trigger are unacceptable
it takes like  seconds to open the menu and start a battle once engaged
this game was made solely to make money and you can see that in the quality of chrono trigger
they rushed the game and didnt even bother to check and make sure the game worked properly before sending it out
the load times made chrono trigger virtually unplayable
i ended up playing it on an snes instead
if i dread battles and avoid opening the menu because the load times are super long then the experience is ruined
the same problem though not as severe happened with final fantasy anthology
ff had terrible load times
square didnt take the time to work out the kinks
even though its been many years since the release of this game
i think square should offer refunds for anyone who bought itif you like this game you stand alone i was angered  with this game for a few reasons
first they kill the story of phantasy star and it does not have the enjoyment feel of the older ones
secondly it just isnt fun you flay the same levels over and over again
eat the same food over and over again and eventually you cant take it anymore
thats how it made me feeli have to be honest i hate childish gamesthey are so annoying and sometimes too cute for me
but this game is some what fun there is nothing really to unlock just to play the game and finish iti only play it because i am just so damn bored
this game is only good for girls or boys that are below the age of  well that is what i think i really dont care if you buy it or not i am just saying think twice before u waste your money you might regret it later on
its an alright gamewasnt compatible with my tv so i sent it back and got a svideo
not sure what the problem is
seems to work well for others  not sure  i cant offer a good review on this one  sorryi purchased this cable to replace my standard rgb hookup for my ps
at first i simply noticed no significant picture improvement yes i did switch my ps settings from rgb to component as others have indicated
even so i wasnt willing to waste time returning it and going back to rgbafter several days however i expirienced a disturbing tendency for my picture to black out for a few seconds every time my hvac unit started or stopped
i was able to consistantly reproduce the video loss by toggling my ac on and offafter losing more than one game due to loss of video i ordered the slightly more expensive component cable manufactured by sony for psps
after installing the sonymanufactured cables ive noticed a significant improvement in picture quality and no longer get video cutout when my ac kicks onbottom line while many may not experience any issues depending on where their ps is located in relation to their appliances this product is a gamble
also since the purchase price is low in relation to the shipping cost there is little reason to return it for a refund unless the seller offers to pay refund shippingi got this item because the cable for my ps was loose and would not stay in
now to its credit the sound was great
however of the five plugs did not work properly
the video cable only put out black and white
no color
two of the sound cables did not work at all
the two sound cables that did work sounded greatso basically it was a waste of money
to make matters worse  and this has nothing to do with the product the seller refused to respond to my repeated attempts at contactnot happy at all with this productmario kart super circuit for game boy advance is best compared to the super nintendo entertainment system snes counterpart
if you began liking mario kart with the nintendo  version then the gba version will not live up to your expectations
however i have friends who prefer the snes version so if you are one of those consider the gba version an upgrade from the snes versionin the gba version the graphics are rather decent as compared to the snes version
the gba system is bit and compared to the snes bit there are more capabilitiesyour perspective is behind the racer and the graphics flow smoothly all around your driver with a great dlike perspective
the levels are quite nice and the drivers and graphics are welldetailedthe gameplay is a lot like the snes version where hopping doesnt help you very much it helps a lot in mk
 but it surely upgrades the item usage
that is you can line your shells up much better and negotiating turns is much easierthe action involved in the game is complimented with the gran prix mode where you can win tournaments
linking up with others in my opinion is the best feature of the game hands downso if you like portability and you appreciate the snes version of mario kart this game will suit you nicely
also if you like to play mario kart by yourself this game can burn some time for you
but if you started your mario kart career off with the n version like i did then you will be slightly disappointed with some of the general gameplay capabilities
the gba game plays nothing like the  versioni was a bit upset that the seller said that the label was clean and intact but in reality it was worn out and torn
the game worked but it wasnt in the condition i hoped it to be
it feels like someone had this in the basement somewhere and thought they could sell it to someone for a cheap deal
they succededafter playing mario kart  on the nintendo  i was very disappointed to see quotmario kart super circuitquot basically represent a step backwards in technology
of course i should have assumed this since the gbas bit processor is only half as powerful as the nintendo sthis version of mario kart is really more similar to the super nes game quotsuper mario kartquot which i never liked  and i cant say i like this version much more
youre back to the old mission of collecting coins as you race and the coins have something to do with your speed andor resistance to crashes
i never really saw any major difference on how many coins you havein any event if you like mario kart  or the gamecubes mario kart double dash this game could let you down
its not quottrulyquot a d game
because the gba screen is so small the action moves so fast and the quotfake d perspectivequot is mediocre its hard to anticipate upcoming turns and obstacles
ive always thought the turning controls were way too touchy on this and the snes versioni also think the computer characters cheat no matter how much of a good lead you can build at the beginning of a race or how many speed mushrooms you use the computer players always catch upall i have heard are good things about this game but that is not what i thought
if you really like war this will probably be one of your favorites but if not it will get really repetitious
all you do is fight war after war after war
it got very boring very quick for me
the good point is that you can build your own maps to fight wars on but you can only store up to threei am a fan of the survivor series but this game doesnt do it justice though its not as bad as advertised
you have your choice of which tribe you want to be and which tribe you want to play against
you can either play as one of the survivors from the tv show or you can make your own custom character
when the game starts you see some pretty good shots that are from the tv show and you see the real characters when they go fo mail and stuff like that
but then the game gets a little tough too swallow
you have around   to  minutes to quottalkquot to the other characters
its basically the same questions over and over
then you have the reward challenge
some of the challenges are ok but most are just stupid
after that then you go back to quottalkingquot again
then you do the immunity challenge
if you lose you vote someone off
there is no way to speed up any of these processes
you have to suffer through some very tedious and boring aspects of this game
the graphics of the characters and of the landscape around you arent very good and the ai artificial intelligence in the game is horrible
i had  people in my tribe that i gave weak emotional energy to and talked bad about them and they still thought we had an alliance
a tribe member will say that you should watch yourself and you ask what have you heard and they say not much
thats it
and during the challenges you cant even see what the other tribe scored or how close to winning they are in most of them
and the internet play you might as well forget it
i thought it would be fun to play over the internet but because the game doesnt have anyone supporting it its nearly impossible find anyone playing it
now this game isnt a total waste as it was amusing for a short time and the price is respectable but they shouldve put this game together alot better than they did
im dissapointed but at least it amused me for a few hours you cant start alliances they never listen
they just randomly vote and say stuff
the graphics are sooooooooooo poor
its laughable
oh and if you get voted off after the merge you dont get to be in the jury
you even play the same challenge ver and over againyoue ven dont build shelter
heres what you do walk around and talk to people who randomly say stuff next reward challenge that doesnt matter then immunity then tribal council
in tribal council you just vote
they dont dramatize it jeff doesnt ask you anything the cpu randomly votei gave it a  because its so pathetic its funnyi would reccomend this to canibalistic clouns party going monkeys and foolslike many i am a huge survivor fan and was very excited to get this game but i was disappointed in the actual game play there is too much repetition in the mini games dialogue etc
it is nice to revisit old fan favorites and play along using characters you already knowbut be warned this software has a bug that makes installtion hard and keeps kicking me out and onto the desk toptake my advice and vote this game out of the tribe
immediatelysurvivor has been one of my favorite television shows since it debuted nearly two years ago
the combination of physical survival and societal survival really appealed to me and thought a computer game could be potentially awesome not this onewhen you start playing youre given the option to choose which edition of survivor to play but the only one available is australian outback
then you choose how long of a game you want and who you want to be
then you begin the survival period
youre supposed to hurry to pick which task you want to do but the computer does them all so theres really no point to this at all
instead the point of survival period is to chat with your fellow survivors
nevermind that the dialogue is derivative stupid repetitive and sometimes downright full of nonsequiters
this is how you build alliances and get people voted offunfortunately you have no way to influence your allies
one second theyll tell you colleen has got to go and the next second theyll vote rudy off
you can tell them to please vote for jenna but theyll vote for bb
regardless
this really limits the fun factor when youre just hoping they dont feel like voting you offthen after a minute survival period you do a reward challenge
these will be dumb games like shooting arrows at boring targets answering repetitive questions about the outback which reappear way too quickly and stupid races where you click arrows to indicate effort and then click them down once your player begins to get fatigued
this is about the level of a  arcade game if thatthen whoever wins gets a physical and mental boost which makes you better in later reward challenges yay and more points to allocate toward other survivors
its here that you choose who you like and dislike
nevermind that your ratings dont have to match with someone elses at allafter another survival period its at this point youll begin to realize all of the dialogue can be whipped through in two minutes and youre going to keep hearing i think i should take a breather for another  episodes you finally vote people off
after a long boring and dull video sequence you finally vote whoever you want off
of course chances are half of the other people will vote someone else out of the tribe
then you get to do it all over again
sound like fun
no
if youre a fan of survivor wait until its in the bargain bin amt and if youre not a fan avoid this game like the plaguelet me say i love the survivor tv show
so infogrames or whatever the heck they call themselves released this game i eagerly bought it
too bad i didnt realize the game was fun for about five minutes
the computer is inconsistent pathetic dumb and downright boring to talk to
the quotchallengesquot are easy boring and quite bland
even the screenshots are misleading
you see a screen with everyone sitting around the campfire
i never once saw that in the game and i got to after the merge
what bs
the advertisements are misleading stay away from this game
sorry infogrames you blew itits all over in a matter of minutes seriously
the game involves spidey going out to buy maryjane a fishbowl but he gets caught up in rumble downtown as several of his enemies run riot
its up to him to sort them outin  very short levels the game is over
and youll be left with your jaw hanging open that a game can be so easy
the beatemup aspect of the game is pretty lame all the bad guys look the same the music is often bland the level design is dated and the gameplay even less engaging than spiderman vs the kingpin on the sega genesis  years previousif you see this game on sale for a matter of pennies then go for it
otherwise avoidgraphics csound cgameplay clasting appeal dof all the video games over the years that have ever graced the xmen license only a few have ever been anything above average
activision which has done great things in video games with the spiderman license attempts to make a great xmen game for the gba but the results are just below lackluster
you get to play as wolverine cyclops storm and rogue and you go through each level taking out hordes of generic looking enemies
first off youll notice the fantastic looking graphics which are so fluidly animated they look like they were taken out of the comic but longtime fans of anything xmen will wonder why the developers decided to have cyclops storm and rogue prance around in their older and lets face it lamer costumes while those same fans will wonder why cable is an enemy
other bosses include sabretooth blob and eventually apocalypse most of the bosses move around the same and you can use pretty much the same strategy to beat them
the controls are ok but the formulatic quotrun from one side to the other while knocking out hordes of the same enemies without anything else to doquot theme of the game will get more and more boring every time you play it
instead of this game i would have loved to see konamis old xmen arcade beat em upit had wolverine cyclops dazzler colossus and a few others and was actually fun brought to the gba
all in all this is worth a play or two if your a fan of anything xmen but other than that this game is rather shallowive only played a few gundam games in my life but this is definitely the worst
ill start with the positives
the story is true to the anime and the missions almost mirror the battles perfectly
the graphics are fairly decent for its time and are good enough
the features are pretty good and the difficulty level is tough but not impossiblenow for the bad parts
the game has a fake difficulty by this i mean the controls are horrible and you will miss far more than you will hit anything unless your timing is perfect and youve mastered the claw controller grip
playing on a regular dualshock  is enough to cramp your wrist after an hour
the ai is also horrendous and your allies will do next to nothing besides run in circles taking potshots at flying enemies and they might have an accuracy rating of  at bestthe sad thing is that yours will be no better than  unless you are very talented at video games and beyond that of your average online shooter playerimagine yourself in the middle of a war and your given a gun that is fingerprint locked with  safeties and has to prime itself for a few seconds after every single shot and takes  shots to kill anything
then add enemies that fly in wide patterns and will rarely miss you they also travel three times as fast as you to top it offyour basically a dyslexic turtle being attacked by batsi did manage to beat the game eventually but it certainly took more tries than id care to admit
the first mission is the easiest thing ever but by the second youll be yelling at the screencode veronica is hands down the most frustrating paininthebutt resident evil game in the entire series
the formula is the same but the game is horribly imbalanced
if you dont play through it in a very specific way it is possible to reach a point where it literally becomes unplayable because you will run out of ammo
that alone is bad enough but there are other elements in the gameplay design that were simply not well thoughtout and cause the player a supreme amount of frustration
for example bats that will not leave you alone unless you have the lighter
if you make a certain decision at a certain point in the game claire gives up the lighter leaving you with no defense against the bats
then throw in the bandersnatches who have a completely unavoidable long range attack
you end up standing there trying to fire your weapon as they pound on you
youre simply trading blows with them and thats not good gameplay design
the puzzles too are more convoluted than in previous games so you often end up wasting precious resources like ammo and herbs as you run from area to area trying to figure out what to do next
in code veronica zombies regenerate after youve left an area something which didnt happen in previous re games
so the more you run around the more ammo youre wasting and the more your chances of being able to continue in the game dwindle
ive enjoyed all of the resident evil games except this one
its the stinker of the bunch
buyers bewarenot sure if it was this one or the other one order for my son only had one disc was suppoed to have  he rented from the library and it had a good story line and beautiful computer generated sequences can go a long way to making a game a winner but horrible controls and bad camera angles can also go a long way towards making it a loser
resident evil code veronica x balances out somewhere in the middle and capcom needs to cleanup the problems before it continues to go on to make another one in this series
theres not much new from the previous games besides a storylineon its good notes the game does have a strong storyline with impressive cut scenes
it does a superb job of creating a creepy environment for you to play in
i usually play games late at night in the dark but i honestly had to keep the lights on while playing this one to help tone down the spookiness of it
entering rooms and hearing the moan of zombies that cant be scene ate away at my sanityunfortunately this is one of the few games i didnt play through to the end
i rented it for a week and have no intent to buy it or rent it again
the action was very slow paced throughout the game and needed to be because of the horrible controls
up walks forward and right and left turn
thats fine if the camera is behind your character but when the camera angle switches you need to do some quick mental gymnastics to figure out which way left or right isshooting zombies is fun but theres no intelligent or tricky combat
youd have to rotate all the way around theres a hotkey for it push forward and pray there are no obstacles or camera angle switches
the controls are just too hard to handle when attempting to do anything fast paced
the static camera angles are very bad
the moan of zombies lets you know theyre in the room but you often cannot see them because of the poorly positioned camera
you either have to fire at offscreen enemies or wander closer hoping the camera will switchdont forget to respect the glass
while guns can make zombies meet their end they cant break windows or mirrors
you have a limited number of bullets and should guard them carefully
this is especially annoying with rooms where enemies will magically come back to unlife when you walk out and back in because you have to waste more bullets rekilling themif youre a fan of the series or enjoy slower paced games with strong stories and good graphics this game is for you
if youre an action junky this game doesnt deliver and you should take a look at onimusha or devil may cryive tried several times to play this game and i can hardly get through it at all
im a big fan of the re series i own almost every game theyve ever made and ive played through most of them several times
this is obviously the exception
im not giving up on it yet its just so ridiculous
the graphics are beyond bad and the game itself is insanely difficult
i did find it terrifying which is part of the point so kudos on that one capcomthis review may go against the grain and many readers will hate me but here goesi really wanted to love silent hill  as i thought the first game was fantastic but when i got it and started playing it it soon struck me that what i had was a highres polishedup retread of the first game only less frightening
the game does indeed look gorgeous and the characters and locations are superbly rendered but it just isnt different enough
instead of the spooky school amusement park motel and hospital this time you get an apartment block prison hotel and err hospitalwhat again
yes blood stained beds grimy basements zombie nurses its all a repeat of the first version which seriously disappointed me
whats more the monsters are all real pushovers and can easily be avoided theres no threat like the leaping dogs or flying creatures from before
and the bosses may look the business but they too are disappointingly easy even the final onebottom line is all the scary innovations from sh are merely repeated here to less effect
the game is short and uninvolving you can run around for hours without getting a scratch on you as theres far too much ammo and health to pick up  and i played on the normal setting so youll never feel in any danger
another thing is that the heightened sense of realism means that some of the restrictions put upon what you can do are nonsensical
if james comes to street that is blocked off by just a lousy piece of police tape he is unable to pass through
search a room in the hotel but access to certain areas is denied because of strategically placed pieces of furniture like a small chair that could be kicked aside by a child what a shame that the series could not go any further than this for although it will impress newcomers to the genre it is nowhere near as impressive as the first game was when it hit the shelves those few years agook it is eerie and creepy but you spend literally  minutes walking without ever finding anything
yes there is eerie mist over everything and the soundtract is creepsville but the game will put you to sleep before anything actually happensthe first minute of bond agent under fire contains more excitement than the first  hour of this game
and your character cant stop moaning about how miserable he is since his wife diesget over it i might actually feel something if the game contained any excitementrent it and you will  spend the first  hour of gameplay walking around not lost mind you before you actually find a monster
to walk from teh beginning to the town takes  minutes and there is only one thing in between and this is a cheesy cimematic scene
maybe i should give this  starbut once it gets going it has the usual resident evil stuff gross and gory and spooky but too drawn out and boring
after each thing you have to walk across the entire town for the next
why
nothing happens
i wonder if this is just so the manufacturer can say that the game has hours of gameplay they just dont tell you it is all walking in circlesi have been a fan of the lufia games since the first one was released on the snes here in america
when i heard the game boy color was receiving an estopolis game i was immediately emailing natsume
quotwill you guys be releasing it in america as lufia quotits finally here
i plug it in
all indicationspretty graphics fun dialog wonderful battle system great play mechanics good storyline even great music the best on the game boy colorcause me to smile and giggle and thank the heavens
im enthused to say the leastthen i figure it out
every dungeon is completely random
but i keep playing
and playing
and i try so hard to like it
so hard
the storyline is keeping me going the combat is wonderfulevery dungeon may be random but they are all exactly the same
wander around hitting walls and things until youve explored the level the go to the next
 or so levels later you have a boss fight and a story sequencerepeatrepeatmy heart is absolutely broken
how can this happen
the heart of the estopolis games has always been the wonderful dungeons now replaced by this absolute drudgerytry before you buy and make sure you have tissues to dry your tears
i am praying that the game boy advance estopolis is released here and that the dungeons while they will still be random will be more sensical and have nonrandom segmentsthis game had everything going for it and one major flaw destroys it
why oh whyi was not fortunate enough to have played the snes game but i thought this game was a major snore
i really hate random dungeons
actually im not thrilled with dungeons at all but these were longer and more tedious than any i had ever dealt with before
the story was bland and the characters were not well defined
its also full of spelling and grammatical errors that should have been caught if theyd spent more time on it
altogether this game struck me as a rushed job by people who dont really care about it
the save system stinks too
i hate only being able to save my game at certain times i cant guarantee ill have several uninterrupted hours to play and i like to be able to stop when i need to
also the story sequences take way too longwhen i heard of a ps version of clive barkers undying i began to drool
after a few days i was given the bad news that it was caned
bad pc edition sells they say too bad i think
i am a fps maniac you know
even if this great game was murdered we still have redfaction which i own timesplitters whish i dont the coming up deusex medal of honor frontline a rumored return to castle wolfenstein and halflife
so i go to the store and shell  dollars on halflife without ever knowing how the pc game originally wasboy was i slapped
i know this game got many game of the year awards and other similar honors but the problem is that i cannot see how or why
yes i know that fps arent the most amazing of games when it comes down to story line with cvs undying and deusex as exceptions and the plots are rather generic
experiment gone wrong etc but this one had nothing to offer imo
i heard somewhere that red faction is a lame copy of this game but i find myself preferring it over halflife any day of the week
the weapons are uninspiring and the enemies arent that amazing at all
with the sole exception of the marines and those facehugger like things i must confess though that the missions are good but this is not enough to hold my attention for longthis is merely and opinion but you sure as hell need to rent it first before you buy itman i thought this game would be a whole lot more exciting
through most of the game you fight stupid flukeswithlegs that you can pick off from across the room with no repercusions
the enemy ai is simply not smart enough to be called an ai
the controls remind me of tomb raider i  while that was a great game back in the day weve suppossedly made great leaps in game controls since then
the story is kinda neato
i just wish there was at least some kind of multiplayer thing to do or some other game modes or something
quite a disappointmentmutant marinesvirus spitting takpoles and aliens interior decor all serve to tingle gamers spines in ezterminationbut the real terror literally lies right under ones nosedemon controlsthese heinous torture tools will enrage gahndi patient gamerstry shooting down multi attacking bloodsuckers in third person with the behind the back camera viewget used to getting mauled while being forced to stand still th shootand expect to kill mucho gaming sessions not infectoids with a completely ineffect oik auto aimstillthe controls are atleast good for one thingrunning something you will be doing a lot of to survivetreadmill simulator anyonenot a very good game even for the ps
the voice acting is laughable and the graphics are pretty weak
i wouldnt recommend wasting your money
spend your money on the thing instead psive been a fan of the survivalhorror games since the first resident evil and im a big fan of the series
extermination clearly doesnt cut it compaired to re
or silent hill   i found the ingame menus annoying and the enemies bothersome at best
the graphics were fine although nothing spectacular
i didnt play enough of it to say how well the plot develops but it seemed pretty cliched to begin with
if youre looking for a good survivalhorror game for the ps go with re
 code veronica or silent hill  if you really want to be scared
if youve already tried those youll just have to wait for quotthe thingquot which might prove to be the most innovative survivalhorror game since the original rechad steingraberparadigminfogrameslevel designergame designerd artist on the terminator dawn of fatesorry but this game was not any fun at all
i bought this game because of the previews and all the hype thinking it was going to be incredible
i played it once for about  minutes was so completely bored out of my mind i shut it off
about two weeks later i played it againhoping that my last try was just because i wasnt in the mood for it
this time i played again for about an hour  i traded it in for jax and daxter the next dayat least i learned a good lesson from it  dont buy it unless i know i like it what a waste the only reason its getting  stars instead of  from me is because of the graphics
it looks awesome it just plays like crap
apologies to the diehard gamers out there i just couldnt stand itthe graphics and everything in this game are great
but the cutscenes ruin everything it is so boring with them and it takes several minutes to press the square button with the cutscene stopped
i fell asleep during those boring cutscenes bottom line the game would be great if the company made an option at the beggining of no cutscenes
 those of u who r fans of metal gear i personnaly recommend not to buy this gameps
everyone who wrote a good review about this game knows how boring the game gets because of the cutscenesblah
i know ill end up with a  helpful ranking but i just have to comment
im sorry but i dont understand why this game wasis such a hit
sure it has great graphics and music which is why it gets the extra star but other than thatthe storyline is very complex
apparently you have to get some metal gear pictures before the russians come or something
these cutscenes as stated in previous reviews take forever
half the time you dont even know what theyre talking about and you dont want to skip over it for fear you might miss something important
then when its finally time to actually play the game bam
horrid camera angle
oh and believe me you dont get too far before you end up with another cutscene
and so goes the gameim sorry i really wanted to like this game but i just cant get into it
if i wanted a spy movie i wouldve rented one
if you want real action stick with vice cityall right
i know the game got a lot of hype because of its great graphics and it was the sequel to one of the greatest games of all time but come on this game flat out stinks
the gameplay is fun when youre actually playing
 of the game is actually movie sequences
i played it through once watching all of them and it took about  hours
i played it through again and skipped them and it took maybe about  hours if that tells you something
overall a very disappointing game but it does have a pretty good story so it got two starsmetal gear solid appeared on the playstation back in  nextgen gameplay a deep storyline and topnotch visuals and sound made it a breakthrough for the industry
not only was it a revolutionary title for its time that pushed the console to its limits but it was supposedly a good sign of things to come
that outcome would ultimately be its sequel sons of liberty one of the most anticipated of all games
the return of hero solid snake gave gamers another chance to experience espionage action once again but given its reputation for its movie qualities over gameplay when does a game stop being a game
sons of liberty answers this and much moreeveryone was relieved to know solid snake made a comeback
with his newly formed team with otacon their mission objective was to discover the circumstances surrounding the new metal gear and make it known to the public
it started out great drawing you in with the plot slowly unfolding and the continuation of snakes story
suddenly as a unexpected shock to everyone gamers are soon placed in the perspective of a new character jack aka
raiden
we are now playing as a whiny snobbish and clueless rookie who gets in annoying conversations with his girlfriend rose
why the developers chose to use the names jack and rose from the movie titanic is beyond anyones comprehension
also with film music composer harry gregsonwilliams handling composition duties it hints that konami was more intent on creating a movie than making a gameraiden is without a doubt the star here yet kojima did an excellent job of hiding it not to mention tricking and deceiving the whole world into thinking snake was the only playable character
nowhere in the previews or even on the packaging was raiden spoken of
the game has also somewhat lost the gritty military nature of its predecessors becoming more of a scifi fantasy drama
the convoluted storyline that no one wants to figure out and the uninteresting cast of characters which includes a bisexual vampire and a rollerblading fat guy dont do the gameplay much justice which has you mostly defusing explosives as well as babysitting little sisters in between boss battles
since the entire incident was a shadow moses simulation a majority of the gameplay structure and plot elements are simple rehashes from the first metal gear solidthe cutscenes and dialogue which were more tolerable in the first mgs are lengthy and often downright unbearable
many games such as nintendos ocarina of time and squaresofts vagrant story do a great job of balancing gameplay and cinemas
sons of liberty however does not seem to understand the difference between the two
the movies can be skipped over with ease but doing so means missing out on vital information on the plot
if gamers want to know more of the story they will have to sit through the movies amounting to overly long periods of time
watching the cinemas will make the game long and boring while skipping them will make the game incredibly short
its unrewarding either way you govisually sons of liberty is one of the betterlooking ps titles even today
the ingame and demo music sound effects and voiceacting will be some of the best you will ever hear in a console game
the inclusion of the firstperson viewpoint is also a welcome addition to the franchise
the story is definitely difficult to fully comprehend but most players will give up trying to even care anyway
these standout aspects still cannot save sons of liberty from falling into the category of games that emphasize cinematics over gaming substance
the game tries hard to give its life message in which we are treated to a welldeserved ending
but what someone has to endure to see that ending is just not worth it
not even solid snakes tanker chapter helps heighten the replay value and fun factor
for those who do value gameplay as the dominant characteristic of games metal gear solid  sons of liberty will simply pass as a title that is disappointing
with the twin snakes and snake eater joining the series sons of liberty should be easily forgotten or at least remembered for its unforgiving experiencemetal gear solid  is the most dissapointing melodramatic unexciting game ive bought in the last few years
after seeing videos from e two years ago i was anticipating this game like none other and bought a playstation  when it was releasedthere are some real problems with this game
first of all it tries to be something that its not
i shaked my head in disgust during the opening sequence as the developers names appeared like out of a movie even pretentiously displaying the cliche of any resemeblance to real life is entirely coincidentalhideo kojima the director of metal gear solid  is so high on himself he goes so far as to refer to it as a hideo kojima game
after viewing this initial display of fake hollywood gloss i was presented with the actual game which is tedious and ridiculousim not the first one to complain about it but for only two hours you play as snake
the beginning of the game is intriguing bringing back memories of the ps classic the action and stealth are top notch the suspense kept high with some riveting encounters and the fantastic new graphics
once you finish with snake the game becomes a train wreck
the rest of the game you play as a different character raiden who is a sniveling petulant cowardly herothe story is an absolute disaster and since the games focus is more on that than actual gameplay the overall value is spoiled
it involves tenuous diaglogue and double crosses with endless cutscenes spliced between playing
the actual gameplay is monotonous it consists of raiden running around the big shell peforming mundane tasks such as diffusing c and searching for the president
originality in its finestthe developers saw how successful they were with the original metal gear solid and suddenly thought they were movie directors
initially metal gear solid  looked like it was going to be an action packed exciting game
instead its a pretentious diversion as it spirals downward after the first  hours flooded with endless dialogue and boring action wanting to be more like a movie that an interactive gaming experienceif you are like others then when you are getting a video game you actually want to play it not watch it
so thats why this quotvideo gamequot cannot be classified as one
you are going to be watching the cutscenes for the most part in metal gear solid  so dont expect to experience any intensity or adrenaline while you quotplayquot this game
the gameplay itself isnt that great to hide that flaw
while the graphics are very goodi have seen a lot better visuals in other action games it is not a lot of fun to watch a movie made with an ingame engine where the developers include a gimmick that allows you to rotate the camera and zoom in while you watchoverall mgs is a lackofgameplay kind of game
sure the graphics are nice when you have those tight little rooms to play in that is why konami could raise the bar in the graphics because there are no wideopen spaces that could limit the quality of the graphics
places where the game is set have a very quotlockedquot feel to them with small rooms tight corridors and very limited outdoor environments
there is a lot of detail though high quality weather effects nice facial expressions rain bouncing off the barrel of your firearm fluid and smooth animation reallooking smoke firenothing that you would not find in other games of  there is nothing special in mgs
the audio on the other hand is pretty much like the first metal gear  the audio is great the voice acting is superb and the sound is very well done unlike in other games that have good graphics but lack good sound it is very common these days metal gear solid  is an exception with outstanding sound voiceacting and soundtrackthe actual gameplay is based on stealth
the ai in the game is smart and the enemies will not shoot you as soon as they see you unlike in other games they will try to avoid shooting you upon the encounter unless they really need to it is the same thing the cops would do to the bad guy if there is no threat of them being killed
they will try to disarm you and knock you out and that kind of stuff  all of it is pretty cool
the interaction between snake and the npcs nonplayer characters is astounding
snake can sneeze all of a sudden and give himself up or if he is careless guards can locate him by following his footprints
he also can distract guards in all kinds of ways for example he can drop something on the floor when nobody is watching wait for a guard to come by this item will draw the guards attention and eventually will lead him to either being killed or incapacitated
snake can also hide the bodies of the fallen enemies from other guards so they will not become alert
this is what you will see in hitmanin conclusion mgs is not for a hardcore gamer
the part where you play the game is short the story is easy to get lost in and guards will come back to life  very annoying and the fact that the best cover is a cardboard box is pathetic
the main weakness to most people but some think it is a strong point is that a big portion of the game is cutscenes and an overwhelming and extremely complex story
on the plus side you have those quotbrilliantquotquotgorgeousquotquotbreathtakingquot or whateveryoucallit graphics which are no big deal to me
what also is great
 gotta be the sound
what i would say
 if you like stealth so much get this game if you are a big fan of solid snakemetal gear you probably already have it some of you are disappointed some of you are glad the way this game was done but for me a true video game enthusiast this game is no biggie could have been a whole lot better if it was more like the first onethis game has more potential packed into it than any other game that has ever been made
but unfortunately falls short of a being a great game
first off the graphics the overall look of the game is really nice but it stops there
the characters are ugly with terrible motion captured animation poorly designed bosses and trite uninspired level design
where are the huge military bases where you sneak around and use all your skill to dodge guards
apparently not in this game
gameplay is basically the same as the first solid title with some new and cool additions but on the other and a frustratingly impossible to aim with firstperson mode
sound is pretty much dead on with a good score to boot
overall replay value uherrthere isnt any
one time through and its over  hours long or rather  minus those cuts scenes
going back though to collect all the dog tags does not count for replay
where are the vr missions
they sure as hell droned on about them in this monstrosity but they are not in this game and would really have upped the value of this game
i had my hopes up for this one but i can only recommend you rent it or wait  weeks for people to figure out they did not really care for this game and pick it up used for amount lessi just didnt enjoy the game
i prefer games with more interactive gameplay than cinematics
it seems like mgs is heavy on story timei am not a fan of metal gear solid or its sequel for the ps
often times great game creators are not great story writers and that is clearly the case here
the story in metal gear solid  makes absolutely no sense and becomes a chore to sift and sit through
the game quotfeaturesquot hours of cut scenes and cinema that i would much rather do without
if you skip cut scenes whenever possible the game is relatively short and remains unexcitingmetal gear solid features gameplay built on the assumption that trial and error is fun
there are parts of the game where this gameplay mechanic is very successful and sneaking around areas can be very enjoyable
there are also sections of mgs that feel like they were included only to increase the total time it would take someone to finish the game
overall the gameplay approaches brilliance at times but the negatives often outweigh the positivesthis game has one huge positive going for it it is absolutely beautiful to look at
i do not own an xbox but mgs features the best graphics i have ever seen especially when it comes to ingame action
the attention to detail in the visual presentation is an amazing achievement and i applaud mr  kojima and konami for thatoverall mgs features brilliant graphics occasionally fun gameplay and an absolutely horrid story that makes no sense whatsoever
my vote i know someone is going to try and bite me for saying this seeing as how every person ive ever talked to that has played the metal gear solid games absolutely loved them but i didntive got the demo for mgs and played the first game and if you are one of those rare people who didnt like the first game this one is more of the same sure the graphics are tremendously better but the gameplay is no differentwhen the first armada came out i was hooked
i played all summer over and over again
the ai challenged me and the game never seemed dullwhen armada ii came out i jumped up and got it and the second i started playing it i turned it off
the storyline is old and reused  yet another borg threat
the graphics are subpar to the original in my opinion and the game itself suffers from unrealistic timingwhile any rts needs to produce units fast the speed which sovereign class vessels are built is utterly ridiculous
the balance is way off allowing you to build two or three  ship fleets of your top class and utterly wipe everything out easily
instead the game should focus on making small tough armies using multiple tactics to force your way through like warcraft iii
the idea would be maybe  akiras with  galaxys  sovereigns  sabers and  intrepids  each with their own strategies and special weapons
then you can use each class to its fullestworst is the resources  the cost of ships is so low you never truly have to worry  honestly
i never worried
all i concentrated on was building up enough sovereigns to wipe everyone outthe ai is the worst  the ai never does anything other than try to take all the resources and then just launch constant strikes  thats it
even worse instant action games fail to work most of the time
the ai builds a resource base then simply never work anything again  no ships no defenses nothing
its pitifuli recommend buying the game even with its flaws
it can still be fun sometimes and there are a wealth of mod sites that improve balance and playability such as armadafilescomwhen i first saw this game i was really looking forward to playing it me being the oldschool sonic fan that i am
anyway i picked it up after reading several things on it
and i must say i was really disappointed in what the game had
in my opinion it shouldnt qualify as a sonic game
the two player mode is really lacking something
the music doesnt even compare to the awesome compositions in sonic  and  yes i know they included a few songs and stuff from the first game but thats about itthe first thing i noticed was the character choices
if you play sonic  or  you have a choice of playing as sonic tails or both
this game didnt have that and that was a sorry thing to see
amy rose is one of my favorite characters but i really think that the game wouldnt lack anything if she wasnt a character in the game
the levels and their titles werent all that spectacular
sure they had a lot more boxes than the first games and what really made me mad was the invincibility
i know they kept the same music but the invincibility thats a sonic trademark is the sparkles that surround the character
this game takes it from sonic adventure  and that made me upset because its just notsonic
the moves were hard to get used to and im sorry that im going too indepth with this stuff but all of the characters shouldnt have attacks like in sonic adventure
another thing that really disappointed me was that the levels were just too easy
there didnt seem to be enough badniks and there werent enough turns and cool stuff like thati think that people who arent diehard sonic fans would like this game and its pretty simple
but i warn those who love sonic like i dothis game is not like traditional sonicmy reccomendation
avoid this game especially if you are a big sonic fanamy rosei ordered multiple times through fulfillment through amazon and every single one was the diablo  bundle that doesnt include the original game
had to order through ebay to get what i wanted
since its so old i dont blame amazon for mislabeling them on the shelves
just be aware when purchasing through their prime servicei thought the concept of a downtown area for my sims and newly created sims that come with the downtown atmosphere would be cool
they could mingle hangout and makeout
unless you have a guide book expert help and advice online and enormous capabilities for patienceyoull be very bored with this game
it is nearly impossible to get to first base with your sims
i was so shocked at how hard just getting along was as compared to the original versionit literally can take days just to find two sims who will date each other muchless kiss or get funky
i have however greatly enjoyed trashing the downtown area that comes with the game and rebuilding my own
great fun in that department
the new downtown objects people building supplies and options are outrageously creative and newno budget to worry aboutyou just build to your hearts content
the game can be funas long as you are patient
very patient
i am a bit annoyed with the game right now but as all gamers knowsomeone will eventually post a tips and help site and then i can imagine this game being a little more fun
until then it feels much like extracredit homework in your favorite classfrustrating but fun
hot date has potentiali would love to hear from anyone who has mastered the lovin skillsdo emailupdate i have owned the game for a while now
at first the game crashed a few annoying times now i can barely play it
the makers of this game know there are problems with it
i have spoken to them personally on the phone
they have patches to try and fix it
but they dont work
i have now viewed dozens of websites with others literally hundreds of peoplefrustrated and having the same problem
i urge all people to wait before purchasing this game now
check websites and wait to see if there is a functioning patch so you can play this game with easei hope this will help keep some of you from wasting your money
i promise to update again when things changei have been a big fan of the sims and when i heard of another expansion well excited doesnt cover itso i max out a charge card and ordered it from one of greatest stores onlineamazoncomin short the objects are outstanding but you have to tell your sims where to go and what to do the free will play is gone no more sitting back and watchingif your a control freak then this expansion is for youi cant believe that ea changed their great nhl  into what is now nhl  no matter how much people deny it hockey is a defensive sport and no that doesnt mean full of checking
electronic arts is placing the emphasis on the completely wrong side of the game
they make the shooters much better than the goalies because they think that the people who buy the game want hockey games with scores like  that is not a hockey game thats not even baseballchecking is made out to be a form of physical punishment toward another player in the game
this is completely untrue and will most likely turn off many of the true hockey fans from this game
a check is any physical contact made in an attempt to knock an opponent off the puck not to punish another player
it glorifies the big hits way too much and by default is set to replay a big hit during gameplay
do you know how annoying that isthe only plus that i found was the level of the graphics
they are better than nhl  but not by much
the graphics are the only thing that saved this from a star rating from mei was really disappointed with ccs newest release
although i am not one of those fanatical cc fans i do love first person shooters fps
the ai is the most horrible ive ever seen in a fps and ive played a lot of games
the characters look like boxes havocs personality is a cardboard cutout the script and story line is hilariously bad and havocs lines are corny
most of all both the single player and multiplayer are desperately below par
the single player was much too short the bosses are too easy to kill and the scenery is atrocious
the multiplayer is just as bad since the base defences are much too difficult to bypass and you can only carry one weapon at a time
westwood truly disappointed me with this game i thought they were capable of a more thought out and prepared game
if you are going to spend  on a game spend in on max payne or return to castle wolfenstein
unless youre a diehard cc fan this one probably isnt for youi love harry potter
the books at least
whats more i love computer games
however my compassion ends there
these two loves do not mix hereharry potter and the sorcerers stone which still vexes me its an alchemists stone burn you
is one of the more mediocre games it has been my misfortune to come across
the reasons are as legion as the bowling ball sized beans that lie strewn across the hall
the first complaint is the sheer ridiculousness of the school
hogwarts the programmers imagine is not a pleasant place full of massive holes in the floor where death awaits those who wanted to go to class and teachers will send you off to risk life and limb after teaching you one seemingly useless and completely random spell
how is lumos supposed to protect me against the dark arts professor quirrilthis is hardly the only flaw in the game
another is the almost complete disregard for any sort of plot
in the introduction presented in stills stolen from a harry potter day calendar id been given you are told that as harry put on the sorting hat he hoped he would not be put into slytherin instead of griffindor
why
no explanation is given for what the houses represent
worse still harry seems to have turned into lenny from memento ron actually comes up to him and says something along the lines of im ron weasley remember me
other characters are similarly introduced although harry should by now know who they are at times it comes across as if they really are assuming you to be a compete fool telling you peoples names over and over
except when the characters themselves are incompetent although harry makes no decisions or discoveries he is the one that actually does everything
what plot remains would leave anyone who hadnt read the books or at least seen the film lost those that know how the plot should resolve itself just chuckle as voldemorte hoarsely coughs die potter in the unsatisfying yet difficult final level
the only redeeming thing about the whole ordeal is a good john cleese impersonator
at least i pray to god he wasnt actually the voice in this game
hes worth more then thatthe real problem with the game though is not that its bad but that people will want it regardless
its harry potter after all
had it been a good game then people might buy other games and the industry as a whole gains
instead the game is mediocre and the people who could have gotten hooked dont
dont bother buying it gamer or fan
either way its a wastethis game is sooooo fun but sooo easy and short i beat this game in  days dont get me wrong this game is fun
but it gives only  hours of gameplay no strategy guides the game gta gives about  hours of gameplay
thats the difference
every level is wicked easy accept for the one where u sneak down from the tower and the last level where u fight that ugly person
again i say u should rent this game for ps or ps blockbuster gives u a week of rental with ur games freedom pass
rent this game for a week and beat it in a dayi think this game is pretty bad
there are too many problems that i am going to list herenot enough save pointshard to move your wand around to cast the spell at the enemieseverything is an adventure they never let u relaxin quidditch it is kinda hard to catch the stupid snitchsometimes the game will go really slow with older systemsalso you cant explore and this game isnt that good anywayive read all the good reviews on this game and just cant bring myself to jump on board the bandwagon
im a pretty experienced gamer who just doesnt see any big deal about this fpsthe pros good graphics decent sound sometimes immersive gameplay
on some levels you ride vehicles for a change of pace
lots of levelsthe cons cliched missions heavily scripted ai constant savingreloading during certain missions average weapon selection below average multiplayer experience
difficulty curve increases dramatically after the first few missionsmy biggest complaint with the single player game is some very obvious cheap ai and corresponding cheap graphics programminglevel design
the game starts out very promising with a gradual difficulty curve but eventually becomes an extremely tedious trialanderror saveload game process in the later levelsthe omaha beach level might seem at first to be an exciting panicked charge up the beach to storm the bunkers but after a few tries you realize its nothing more than a timing maze puzzle as you run from barrier to barrier to prevent yourself from getting hit by unstoppable machine gun firethe snipercity level is incredibly frustrating as you must literally inch from spot to spot and pixelhunt every angle and every shadow in the drab grey backgrounds for equally grey enemy snipers most of which are perfectly accurate and completely immobile and sniping you from spots you cannot reach yourself
though proponents of the game might argue this to be a realistic simulation of city warfare the rest of the game is not paced this way and realism isnt a factor anywhere else
it also might sound challenging at first but in the end its a continual loadsave trial and error process that grows tiresome after the first  or  tries
you dont even get a muzzle flash to determine the direction the hits come from and a handful of snipers seemingly hit you through walls or after you find them and then retrace your steps at angles you realize you could have never seen them
its an artificial way to increase the length of this otherwise boring levellater levels combine each frustrating part of the previous levels and add extra lame touches such as fog disguised as a snowstorm that you must slowly inch through to prevent being ambushed from machine gun nests and the scripted enemy positionstheres a vehiclebased level where you get to drive a big tank around and it starts out promising
sadly it is also artificially made longer than it should be due to the fact that you have to shell every building you see  and it takes time for you to reload your gun after each shotregardless of any openlooking level design theres only one path through each level with things such as a low fence or small pile of rubble impeding your ability to sneak up behind enemiesthe programmers should have spent more time improving the chargethensquat ai routines instead of making each level artificially difficult by blending the soldiers into the background or adding dense fog to prevent you from strategically plotting your next move
soliders may hit alarms if you wound them but dont notice when you blow away the guy  feet from them with your thompson
there are a few missions where stealth is suggested but theres little need for itif youre looking for a more action related ww based fps grab return to castle wolfenstein
for a much better ww multiplayer fps grab bf grab this one when it shows up in the bargain bin at your local game storeok i admit flight simulator is a great program
i have bought flight sim   pro and now  pro
each program is better than the last but only slightly
i find the atc feature sort of cheezy
i expect they will fix this in a hurry though by the next versionthe frame rate has increased with the new version which is a delightful surprise
the scenery appears pretty much the same with the exception of randomly appearing and disappearing buildingsthe packaging is   all i got was a box pamphlet program and cd envelope not even a jewel case
the quality is no longer there as with previous microsoft products
if you have or ever purchased microsoft train simulator youll know what i meanif you do not own a microsoft flight simulator i recommend buying it
i dont however believe it is is worth it simply as an upgrade
stick with flight sim  or  until they develope an upgrade worth paying forwell you gotta give the game some credit for its orginality at least
ive never seen a game like this before with a sim city view as you rescue innocent victims or chase down criminals
now for the negatives
the game has terrible sound
the same music plays repeatedly over and over again throughout every single mission and that accident voice gets really annoying ud know if you played the game
next on to graphics
yuck
cmon the city looks like a mess of jagged lines
what a terrible sim
then the controls hard
dont think youll ever get passed the first mission
overall a good rental but nothing moreif you are used to ssx and smugglers run type of graphics thisis not you game
the stly of gameplay seems slow and not very interesting it also is a unpleasent reminder of september th putting out fires in burning buildings will not get my liking or intrest for a few yearsthis game is very short you can finish it in a few hours
one player missions are fun but two player is flat out boringenjoyed it for  hoursfound my self thinking that they developed a few levels then quit before they had a full blown game
 you should get at least  days of play time instead of  hoursim surprised this got an editors choice ill be a bit more wary of that label nowif youre looking for anything like the original frogger this is not itim about  done and the only reason i continue to play is to finish and shelf the cartridge
the game play is repetitive and dull
after playing the first level youve pretty much seen all it has to offera big disappointmentfrogger is practicly impossible to control the graphics are grainy i never get headaches from playing a video game but this one will give you a migrain
the extreme jerky movements and the way the view gets thrown off from the slightest odd jump will make you want to smash this game
not to mention the story all it is once upon a time there was a frog who rescued a princess from some goblins and when she kissed him he turned into a prince so unoriginal
also there is only  hours of game play
and most of this is running around trying to find out what on earth you are supposed to do
but the worst turn off is the errors
this is what i mean by they didnt finish it
you will often find your self stuck in some invisible wall usually the sounds go bonkers or you wait there until some enemy finishes you off
another one is enemies getting stuck in wood rock or something so you cant kill them and again the sound goes bonkers
but the worst of all is when the game totally freezes
then you have to restart your ps and of course the gamei gave it  stars only because it had some ok game play but it deserves i rented this because frogger was my wifes favoriate game on ps
we were excited to play this
after about an hour it was back in the case
this is nothing like the ps model it is a direct ripoff of mario brothers in d but its not even as good as mario
its just a frog running around trying to get as many coins as possibleif you like mario brothers youll like this
its a good choice if ps is your only systemif youre looking for what frogger is known for youll have to wait until the next onei generally have high hopes for any d platform game that features toadstools and fireflies
we know that a fairly detailed and colorful d world can be created on a ps  or  and games like the three spyro games did just that with smooth gameplay and beautiful backgrounds
this game however does none of those things
although his is a playstation two game the graphics are rather flat and lifeless especially in the early levels which is where you want to capture players interests
the potential for vivid colorful detail on the ps is far beyond what this game accomplishes  this looks more like an early ps gamethe most frustrating part of this game has got to be its tendency to freeze up get stuck or block your view
very sloppy programming
within five minutes of starting the game froggers head was stuck in a boat while he was swimming underwater forcing me to retart from the beginning
then once again about five minutes in he got stuck in midair and i had to start over again
meanwhile the incredibly choppy movement does not feel smooth or natural at all
i spent most of my time accidentally jumping into the water because the quotjumpquot is fairly difficult to control
the storyline and dialogue are rather lifeless as well and i find myself turning the volume down so i dont have to hear the same two or three lines like quoti know frogfuquot over and over againi imagine that a child playing this game would be as irritated as i am by having to start over again and again when it inevitably gets quotstuckquotand kids who have played other ps platformers like jak and daxter will probably be disappointed by the dull gameplay
younger kids or those who have not played the better platformers would probably still find it enjoyable
exploring the d environments and picking up colorful gems and jewels always has a certain amount of appeal but this is definitely a renter and i lost interest long before my five days were upi first got into harvest moon when looking any vampire snes games for my emulator and saw the title harvest moon now in vampire mind met i thought something compleatly differnt
it turned out to be one of the dumest games i ever played but chould not stop
it became a lot of fun for me
the back to natuer added  more fun more real able to make sprites do slave work and the girls to woo are interasting
and then the  after save the home land wonderfull life as i much prefer the ps  version added realism to it very compleax and magical melody is just pure fun
out of all  this is the only one i refuse to own and i will tell you why
only have a year to save the stupied town
have to repeat the same year over and over again to unlock every thing
cant really wu the girls
no point to farm actualy farming is almost pointless in the game except for extra money you can actualy just get by with chickensthe title explains it you save the home land or it will turn into a theam park and you lose
you have  year to get one of the  endings it is not that hard just do what you do to wu a girl in the others and you already unlocked a few endings already
the only thing i think was a  interasting featuer is sell your goods to the stores your self instead of dumping into a bin and get paied the next day
just get rid of the middle guy and deliver it your self something that could have stayed in the futer games
other then that it is a compleat dump out of the harvestmoon games maybe if i was not expecting more out of it and it was titled something else that was not harvst moon it would have been better for mebut it is not a compleat wast just a dissapointment there are a few good things
some of the endings are nice and does have a good story plot
when u start the year over again all ur updates crops money and enhancements stay so if u had the best watering can well you keep it all  times u start over againbut downside people do not know you so you have to reintroduce your self again and again and again gets anoying cause of no skipim being a bit hard on this game because i was so disappointed
the other harvest moon games were much better as far as game play goes
the graphics were great  the characters looked very cute and childlike adding to the charm of harvest moon
but it was a complete letdown to find that as soon as you save the homeland the year starts over back in spring no matter what day of year it is and no one in town seems to remember who you are
if you had a love interest forget it
you have to introduce yourself to her all over again
so the idea of family life is squashed
each time you save the town you get a new icon displayed on your saved game page
i have  and yet i still havent made it to see a winter yet
you can only make a handful of recipes and they are too simple and boring
nothing like the complex recipes that came with back to nature
you dont get to decide where your crops and grass grow either
its already decided for you where your pasture will be and your plots of soil are very uniformed and evenly set
i think this game will appeal more to younger children but for the older fans of harvest moon it just doesnt stack upok i dont think im an action junkie
i like the sims  i dont play halo   but this game is sloooooooooooow
after a few minutes i was sick of it
also no real tutorial to tell you what to do
you just wake up in a room with a cow milker in your inventory
oh yay i can go milk a cow
that right there is the pinnacle of gaming entertainment my friends sarcasm
i liked the old sega genesis harvest moon better where you have a nice full screen no annoying d cameras
you know you can water harvest your crops deal with your cows go into town etc
simpler faster and more fun
also this game has japanesetype graphics im sorry but there are a million anime titles out there did they have to turn harvest moon into one
and annoying townspeople that i hate
i wish i had bought harvest moon back to nature for ps back in the day
now it costs  online but it looks like it has that sega genesis harvest moon style that i like
definitely skip this onei own this game and it doesnt come close to the first harvest moon harvest moon 
in this game there are no sheep no festivals you cant get married no babies the game ends after  year and you dont have a lot of fields to plant crops in
the only good thing about this game is that the graphics are i must say the best i have ever seen
but i dont think the graphics are worth all that money for the game
so dont spend your money on it
it stinksthis game has a great concept lots of things to do and a cute look
why the low score
well the ingame time system is in a word wack
i would barely get outside and get my bearings and it would be midafternoon already
then one time i got lost trying to find a path in the morning and by the time i found it a few realworld minutes later it was night
how am i ever supposed to build a farm and save the homeland if all the stores are closed by the time i get to them
this game could have been animalcrossing caliber but instead its just confusing and weird
too bad
i was really looking forward to itif you want to get an hm game get back to nature or a wonderful life
this has best or second best graphics but not much else
the girls are pretty interesting but you cant marry or date them
it doesnt have holidays it only has  crops few animals and its just not nearly as good as any of the other games
rent it if you feel you must try itif you have played with the previous harvest moon games you can expect a similar experience in this versionthe storyline is very simple you have to save the town farm from being turned into a theme parkthis game has not onenot twonot even threebut  endings each one being different
why so many you may be asking
i have no clue
the problem is that if you dont use a stradegy guide andor an action replaygameshark it is nearly impossible to unlock all  endings because you have to do specific things ie st give a tomato to 
 then go see the harvest goddess etc
like i said before if you have played with the previous harvest moon games you can expect a similar experience in this version
you get to raise cows chicken horses dog etc
you can even upgrade your house
there are lots of shops in the game maybe too many and lots of people to talk toit takes forever to save up money in this game
the day you get  million whatever currency the game uses pigs can most probably flyunfortunately you cannot get married
in every other harvest moon game you can get married even in the super nintendo version
this is a big disappointmentthe graphics are cellshaded
this game  would have looked great in regular d why couldnt they make this game regular d
once again i have no cluealso when it is nighttime in the game it is nearly impossible to seeoverall this game is only for hardcore harvest moon gamers and ps game collectors this game can be hard to find
even if you like harvest moon but are not a hardcore harvest moon gamer dont even rent this game
i like harvest moon but this is a huge disappointment
unfortunately this is the only harvest moon game available for ps
i give this game a  out of second opinion  stars this game is a disappointment to the harvest moon series however nonetheless it is a lot of funfor some reason when i asked ds items to be listed this game boy advance item was in the list and i did not realised until too late
amazon searching system failed mefirst off this game is extremely tedious because the colors are so friggin dark you can barely tell the difference between the ground and a hole
also when sneaking past prefects its so dark that you would run into one thinking its a wall all the time
second in the obsticle courses and trials if you are very far but die you have to start all over again with everything back the way it was unmoved
third there is only one boss and he is very easy
there are more problems with this game but i dont want to write them all
overall dont buy this game unless you have tons of money to sparethis game is fun until you get to the flying lessonhootchsconstant quotconcentratepotterand try againmake you want togo over and strangle hergoing through all those hoops makesyou feel like youre a trained animal going through endlesshoops to entertain hootchflying through  hoops was annoyingenoughbut having to fly through  hoopscome on nowfortyhoopsit gets boring having to keep flying through hoops constantlyand its a waste of timeif you have this game and cannot get past the flying lessoni suggest you put ituntil game shark video game enhancer comes out with codesfor this gamethis game is one of the best ive ever played
but its too short
i beat it in  hours without trying
also there isnt much walkthrough or a map so u dont know where ur going
dont get me wrong this is the best game ive ever played buts its easy
on the bad side you cant pass the cut scenes
the cut scene on the last level is  minutes long
and u have to see it everytime u challenge valdamore i dont read the harry potter books so i dont know wats his nameluckily i only needed  chances to beat him
he is very hard but not frustrating just challenging
i heard that harry potter and the chamber or secrets is coming out i hope that its the same great graphics and everything just alittle harder
anyways rent it before u buyif u get to the level where u meet hagrid then ur about half way done
if u got there in less then an hour and a half then dont cosider buying this game cuase its too easydont get me wrong its the best game just too easyi really hoped that the playstation game would be a great one
after i saw the movie i decided to buy the game cuz it sounded neat
wellthe game is a bit disappointing
i expected much more than harry running around trying not to be late for class casting spells etc
but thats practically all that he does
the beginning of the game was interesting but then you start trying to collect beans run errands blahblahblah
even thought i love platformadventure games this didnt work out for me
i got to  something  and just quit
it was a bit challenging after the beginning but then it just got way to easy and short so i dropped this game and choose ape escape
now ape escape is a way better game than harry potter and the sorcerers stone so if you want a great platform game choose ape escape
and the harry potter movie was better than the game so either just watch the movie or rent it dont buy itdark arena is the ninth best fps for the gba the first announced but the fourth released for the system
dark arena is pretty much a doom clone
whats the difference between the two
well hmmm 
doom is a better game
dark arena features enemies with zero intelligence which make them a breeze to kill even on the hardest skill level
the graphics in dark arena seem a little more bright and sharper than doom but doom looks better all around and is simply more fun to play
dark arena does offer a good variety of weapons some neat looking enemies and some fun levels but all of this is subpar to the doom games
dark arena is definitly a fun and welcome entry in the growing library of gba games under the fps genre but definitly a weaker oneits graphic violance is about all this game has going for it
the graphics are poor the scenary doesnt change much and you get bored fast
this is diffenetly down at the lower end of combat games on the market for psthis is a bad title
spyro games always used to be fun but that tradition ends here
camera angles are bad the grpahics are very dark and the whole thing is just another lame kiddie gamei dont recommend this game at all the graphics are nice at first but get boring the game flat out sucks the only reason i even gave it two stars is because i know how long it takes to make a game and i of  couldnt even figure the damnb this out its confusing as hell and i didnt even want to play it because nothing drew me to iti have all the spyro games for ps  ps and i love them so when i got my gba i bought season of ice right awayand was very annoyed
at first i thought it would be cool because there are fairies and mermaids but the controls are much more difficult on the gba than the playstations
i have trouble getting spyro to go the direction i want him to especially on diagonals
i think its because youre using directional buttons instead of a joystick
i dont think it can be the fault of the button on my individual gba because i bought it brand new and this is one of the first games ive played on it
anyway i have trouble crossing bridges and just moving around in general it makes it incredibly obnoxious because every time you fall in water you die
i say if you have a game cube and a game boy player so you can use a joystick this could be a great game but if you just have a gba dont bother its more frustrating than its worththis game was terrible
the only new thing about this game was that coco was fully playable but you dont get to play as her very often anywayheres an overall view of the gamethe positivesgood graphicsgood bossesnew vehiclesthe negativessucky levelssucky musicit takes about a hour to loadthe game is extremly hardi heard there is a new crash coming out later this year
all i can say is that i hope it will be goodhave you ever gotten home and wanted to play that one game that you just got a new code for dont do that with this game
unless that code makes the game load faster this game is annoying
if this was the first game i played on the ps i would have returned the ps and gotten a game cube or x box
the graphics are not that great and i hate the controls
when controlling crash you feel like you are in a bmw m convertible that can only go a top speed of mph because of an engine problem
everything about this game is slow
i wonder if the people who made this game were slow in the head
other than that the game is fun
it is another crash game nothing special
but the loading kills the funremember when crash bandicoot used to be fun
here comes a new generation of crash
apparently his new developers thought that fun is a bad thing
so they improved on the old one by making huge load times terrible controls and repeated everything way too much
the only fun things where hardly ever presented
if you have any other crash game
any at all you dont need this one
its just to boringanyone remember back when chuck jones had created the successful quotroad runnerquot cartoons for wb then wb shut down the studio and later on wb changed their minds decided that they wanted more quotroad runnerquot cartoons after all and got other artists to do them other than chuck jones himself
remember how flat and terrible those new ones were compared to the original classicslongtime fans of quotcrash bandicootquot will experience the same problem herewhile its true that the game is impressive on a technical level it falls on its face concerning the actual character animation
the most appealing part of the crash games the wonderful cartoon visuals look simply awful
crash moves stiffly now and has none of the charm and charismatic appeal he showed in the earlier games
i swear he looks and moves like a hunchback
also the facial expressions are stiff his actions and movements are puppetish quotjust put him through the motionsquot mechanics and he simply doesnt quotlivequot
the other characters are all animated the same way and it kills the visual appeali wont complain about the obvious quotloading timequot problem as its already been discussedas for the gameplay while it would have been fun even though its quotsame old same oldquot if the animation was designed better coupled with crude animation its lifelessall is not lost howeverthe wonderful game boy advance title more than makes up for this mishap
but youll most likely want to skip the ps version
wait for the next one and see what happens to the concept then and hopei am sorry but
i have to say what everybody is saying this darn game is just bout loading the game play is not so bad but i really prefer not watch a bandicoot falling for at lease  minutes before i can start to do anything this game got to me by the third level i am so happy i did not buy this crap well maybe its good game but
i had not the time to find out the loading is major set apart from other flaws and i really thought that this version would have been more interactive wellthis game is a set back for a ps game oh please
what with the d anyhow i wont buy this so if you try this then take whatever  load of 
you get laters folks gamersive always enjoyed capcoms method of making difficult games
if you die in a capcom game its generally not the fault of the game but the fault of the gamer
their games such as onimusha and super ghouls n ghosts require you to get improve your skills in order to succeed
unfortunately thats not the case in devil may cry
a majority of the time the game is at fault for your death
poor camera angles are at fault most of the time
youll find yourself fighting a lot of enemies who are not onscreen and many times they get a free hit or two on you because you dont see them coming
yes enemies do make a noise to signal an attack but thats hardly helpful when youre concentrating on those enemies that you can see
this is worse when fighting some of the bosses such as griffon and nightmare
there will be times when you are blasting away at them while they are off screen
shooting at the edges of the screen is not as fun as shooting actual enemies that you can seethere is a point of frustration in which a game can get away with but once in a while a game will break that barrier
the point of video games is to have fun not to stress you out
devil may cry is more stressful than it is fun
though most levels are only ten minutes long you will die so often they take much longer than that to complete
and along with poor camera angles another reason you will likely die so often is the speed the game plays at
things happen so quickly in dantes world that it would seem capcom made this game for people with short attention spans
to focus on one enemy for more than a second means you will likely lose your health to another attacker but to take your eye off the one enemy means you might miss a surprise dodge and attack
i wish capcom at least allowed blocking as it would be far more convenient than trying to jump every enemy attack
however that would slow the game down
this is a pure action game
strategy is not required or welcome
this is a game meant for somebody young with quick reflexes and an attention span trained on saturday morning action cartoons
if you do not have those qualities i would not recommend this gamenot everything is bad in devil may cry
for one the graphics are very nice
the character animation is so brilliant i was almost convinced that i was fighting real demons
its a game that screenshots do not justify
you have to see it in motion to realize just how good it looks
also the controls are very well done
capcom expertly creates a control layout that allows you to fluidly shift from firing a stream of bullets to leaping in the air and slashing an enemy with a sword
i just wish the game was more fun and less frustrating because it has so many excellent ideas
i am willing to admit that the game probably just wasnt made for me
im more casual gamer than hardcore and this is the type of game hardcore gamers relish
it provides a very difficult challenge and requires lots of time and practice be put into it
as a gamer who finds that age has slowly taken a hit on his response times i find it difficult to recommend the game to people who arent highly skilled in gaming or whose skills have dulled
if you want to enjoy a game there are plenty better games to choose fromi seriously and in all honesty cannot comprehend why there is such a huge fanbase for this game
this has got to be one of the most bland nonimmersive games i have come close to in a long time
i made the mistake of buying this thing after i heard such great reviews for it with all these great moves dante has and blah blah blah and that it was developed by the same people as resident evil my favorite game series ever so well i got sucked in and for the first few minutes i was interested it seemed cool to kick some serious ass thanks to dantes vast arsenal of moves
but after like  minutes it got to the point where the game was going nowherethere is no puzzlesolving and if the developers consider this game to have puzzles then i could just as well hide a rock under my bed and leave notes saying where the stupid thing is and call it a puzzle and the moves are so simple there is nothing you have to do except press one or two button combosi mean yeah the moves are pretty neat to look at for the first few minutes but all this info throughout the game about strategizing being a must so you can target specific enemy weaknesses is just a load of crap
hit the action button  times regardless of whom youre fighting dante slashes his sword in a funky way  times and thats it
monster dies you move onyou could honestly have a deep conversation with someone else in the room and not lose in the game as long as you keep pressing the button blindly
its that stupidim sorry but i thought this was going to be something else that just a plain shootemup sword slashing game
and it pitifully epitomizes the above characterization perfectlypoint is im done with this game when they realize they shelled out  for a game they finish in about  or  hours
good graphics not awesome just good but the controls can be tricky
you can complete it in the span of a night rental at blockbusteri do not understand all the praise for this game
not only is their little to no plot except for the one they throw in at the end to give you some kind of closure but this socalled action packed action thriller slows down the action with these missions that have you scratching your head
why do i need this orb
how come i have to open this stupid door
why the heck am i doing any of this at all
i asked myself constantly why each mission was so important when the game was giving me absolutely no reason for any of it
i tried to enjoy the action but was caught up looking for items or trying to open doors to reach the next level
some missions are so short literally all you might do is run and open a door and a mission is over
the action would feel more intense if you were forced into most of your fights but if you wished you could simply run away from at least half the battles
the bosses were pretty cool but the motivation really wasnt  therewho were these people to youwhy do they want you to dieif they wish to make this a real action game forget the resident evil style puzzles and just do a final fight type style where you just have to  fight your way to the end of a leveli just really wasnt all that impressed
it was really short and since their was no plot i felt nothing for the main character or the villian for that matter
it was over before it beganit was like a summer blockbuster movie with no plot not as much action as promised and too  many special effects
a very underwhelming experience of a game
im glad it was cheapive been a fan of megaman since i was nine wow back in the day of the nintendo i think mine still works
 and fondly remember my fandom for megaman grow as i play mmiv v mmx and megaman x
more recently ive played the d legends series and love the fact its so lighthearted but i loved the melodrama of x
to return to the x series i bought xack
to my dismay there was zero as in none animated cutscenes
only still screens of characters and japanese dialogue which i actually prayed for over the horrible us voice overs in x with scrolling english
how sad
plus the fact i found zero withtin an hour sort of poured cold water on my expectations of a plotline  he used to be the cool guy i wanted to play through the entire game in x but now he needs x to find all his powerups for him before he can even survive
plets talk upgrades i dont like the fact i have to find every part of an armour to use it
i find  pieces but guess what
im still missing one from each
not to mention when i go back to revisit levels to find the missing pieces the nightmare effects system annoys me even more
sure its fun and almost surreal to see nightmare zero chasing you
but its just isnt challenging its annoying when they turn out the lights making it impossible to see during certain levels well you can stand there long enough and wait for enemies to hit you first  now i find myself having to restart the entire game because i didnt play the levels in the correct order since wo boots for better jumps i cant advance and yet with the nightmare system on i cant get the upgrades due to a a big sliver block blocking my way to the capsule bicy blocks impossible to advance unless i have a longer air dash ability ci cant see a thing in the darkfans of the x series play x again and wait for the next one
this one is pure dissapointmentdont waste your time or money
capcom has it become to known as has been releasing worse games then ever before
x was one of the best mega man games in my opinion and after that they have just gotten worse
x and  were obviously done by a different team of capcom then the previous games
its not very mega man like if you have played mega man games as long as i have which is  years you would know what i mean
people who say this game is a  or  stars have no idea how good mega man games in the past were
capcom shows once again that they dont use enough testers for their games
its all about dead lines and getting the game on the shelf not putting effort into it
mega man is dead in my opinion due to the lack of effort and creativity in their games
this game doesnt look like a mega man type of game from the game play and story linei know i have one review praising this game but now ive a second view on this game
it really isnt that much better than x if at all
youd actually think capcom would learn from their mistakes that x had
well they didnt they only made the game worsemega man x was a surprise to me
being that there wasnt even a year wait from x to x
this is good for those hardcore quotit doesnt matter if its goodquot type mega man gamers but for the gamers who actually want a complete game this one is rather rushed for its release and because of that capcom didnt take the time to take out what was wrong with x
x was a great mega man game and the ones before were brilliant
this one is merely subparfirst the gameplay
there are no cutscenes at all but rather still animated scenes in japanese voices that carry the story along
whats worse
the handwriting isnt quite legible with the letter quotfquot commonly looking like a quottquotthe worst part of the gameplay is how levels are never the same twice
you must do levels in a certain order to get all the armor pieces
this is bad because you need all pieces of an armor before you can actually use it
well the whole random level thing would be nice if it would actually let me get the friggin capsule
how am i supposed to get to a capsule when this huge gray block is in the way
you dont once that quotrandomquot effect happens it stays thus making you start a new gamethe other bad thing is that zero really isnt the best in this one
unlike x youll need x to get nearly all his power ups for him
it takes the fun of playing as zero
what does this do exactly
well it means that if x must get zeros powerups it means that x has to go through the level in which x gets the heart and the bonus at the end of the stage
something that zero could getthe music is okay at times but gets annoying
unlike x and before it doesnt set any sort of action mood that suits the stage
x can use zeros zsabre but youd have to be desperate not to just select zero because x battles much too slowly with it stick to the xbusteras i mentioned you must grab all four pieces of an armor before you can actually put it on
this really brings up the decline in the xseries
since in the prex era we were all used to the part being added to xs armor right on the spot
it was fun looking for all those capsules
this element is lost as well
its no fun looking for the capsules especially when you need one armor to get another onethe game actually does present a bit of a challenge though
but what i really didnt like was that the final boss is the same damn final boss weve been fighting since mega man x
im so tired of sigma
the game fools you by making you think the final boss is this guy named quotgatequot when at the end you only end up fighting sigma all over again
this wouldnt be such a bother if sigma wasnt always the final boss
thus meaning sigmas role in this game is pretty meaningless for a long time
he at least did stuff in x and x
but in this they taunt you by making you think its quotgatequotsorry but this is a bad mega man game to get
go back to x and before because those were mega man x games to remember
i hear mega man x is different thoughwhich could ultimately be a bad thingin december of  i purchased a sony playstation finally upgrading from the old sega genesis
one of the first things i did was to try and find a football game that was as exciting and fun to play as college footballs national championship for the genesis
to this day that still is one of the best football video games ever made for any consolethis game was not available for the psx
for me it essentially boiled down to either madden  or nfl gameday 
i gave both a try but settled for gameday
first of all i was never a real madden enthusiast
in fact i did not own a madden title until madden  for the psx
that year i ended up getting madden over gameday because i thought it had more depth than the  version of gameday
since then ive bought madden simply because there has not been decent competition in terms of football sims
madden is obviously not without its flaws see my review for madden  for the ps but simply put there has been no other viable alternative for people like me who are looking for football simswhy i do i tell you this
because i want it to be understood up front that i am not a singleminded madden zealot
when i first heard that sega was making nfl k for the ps i was elated because i knew that k for the dreamcast was hailed
further pushing my anticipation was the memory of playing the old college football game on the genesis
if they put the effort into k that they did in the old college football game i knew this was going to be a great gamelets just say that sega gets a b for effort but they fall short in executiongraphics    as a person who has very little knowledge of actualy computer operations its my opinion that graphically k does match up with madden
i think the animations are for the most part pretty strong with very little shimmering
however in the closeups you can still see that the animations need a little refinementaudio   in my opinion k supercedes madden in the audio department
if for no other reason you dont have to listen to madden drone on and languish through the same limited collection of phrases that hes been using in this series since   the audio is timely and keeps with the gameplay very well
in my opinion k really outdoes madden in this departmentgameplay    where it really breaks down is the gameplay however
players tend to skate across the field and the physics simply dont match up against madden
for example ive had receivers run  yard hooks only to be knocked clear back to the line of scrimmage after catching the ball for gains of maybe  yards
this is simply not realistic
in the no huddle offense the team magically appears at the line of scrimmage instead of realistically trying to catch up from the original line of scrimmagethe ai is somewhat awkward too
ive been playing with michael vick at qb and its nearly impossible for him to get any mustard on a ball throwing off his back footand hes got one of the strongest arms in the league
meanwhile the mildarmed brian griese  controlled by the computer  routinely drills  yard bullets accurately downfield off of his back foot
what gives
but the largest gap between madden and k is in the respective franchise modes
say what you want about madden but anyone looking for a realistic franchise play would certainly be taken aback by the grand depth of the madden mode
the k franchise mode is woefully inadequatefor example players are rated in  areas specific to their respective positions using a bar graph for each trait
in madden there are countless traits on which players are measured
players are not assigned colleges or universities in the college draft
at the end of a season theres nothing that tells you how much a player has progressed or regressed from the previous season
you know it happens but you pretty much have to memorize your players individual ratings in order to determine how far theyve advanced
there do not seem to be any player awards at the end of the season eg
mvp rookie of the year etc
once you enter the next season activities ie
resigning players making trades drafting there is nothing that shows you what the draft order will be
this is critical if youre trying to trade up to pick up that franchise player or to trade down to get more picks
in order to do this you have to write down the order from the season before
ive played  seasons now and the salary cap has not increased
although ive not tinkered around enough with it yet it does not appear that you can use created players or teams in the franchise mode
the retirement times of players is not realistic
jamal lewis retired after  seasons in the league
keith brooking retired after only his ththere are  things that i do like about segas franchise you can actually trade future draft picks
players overall ratings actually ebb and flow throughout the course of the seasoni bought this game after reading only a couple of reviews mainly because i have been less than satisfied with madden this year
i was genuinely hoping that nfl k would take my mind off of the flaws with madden but its only made me appreciate more what madden offersadmittedly some of my frustration is based in the fact that i am learning to play a new football game and that it will take some time to adjust
but in my opinion if youre looking for an actual football sim madden and the many options it provides through its complex and deep franchise mode is the better alternativebut i anticipate a better product from sega in  and will gladly give it another whirli may be alone in my thinking but this game is worse than nba k for dreamcastto start off with the free throw shooting system is very hard to useive tried endlessly to line up the two arrows with the baskethaving never succeededthere are other reasons why i dont like this gamebut i wont go into all of themto be fair this game has gorgeous graphics and the player likenesses are the best i have seenmany hoops fans seem weary of michael jordans comeback
they say hes too old too slow and the wizards are too bad of a team
eager to see for myself how air might fare i played with the wizards against the lakers and won by  in my first game
then i ratcheted up the difficulty and still won by  finally i turned it all the way up to the superstar level
you know thats where the computer steals the ball by just looking at you
the marginwizards over lakers by  despite one of the ugliest displays of computer cheating ive seen since nfl blitz made me fumble away a  point lead
now if i could beat the game when using a bad team on the hardest difficulty level then jordan can make a glorious comebackin nba lives world at least where zone defenses are as sturdy as warm butter rebounds are handled like wet soap and a pin point alley oop pass from scrub marcus fizer is thrown down by dinosaur charles oakley
five times
in one game
it surprised me that this plays so unrealistically after seeing how great the players look on the court especially when they show emotion while driving the lane or bitching at a ref
even dr js fro is sweetly d rendered on the classic all star teams
it feels like ea sports focused on beefing up the fancy graphics and features and hoped we would overlook the rest
that might be enough to drive an arcadey slam fest but nba street fits that bill so much betteri rented it and it is no better than last years which stinks
i am about ready to give up on there ever being a good nba bball game besides nba street which is not even  vs   dont waste your money on thisea sports said this was gonna be a improved sequal
as far as im concernd this game is bullhow come the center scores the most
like shaq scores  points and kobe only scores about  or  in a  minute game  and why when youre ahead by  the other team comes back like its nothin
and the other team steals the ball way too much
it also seems the other team keeps gettin offensive rebounds till they get there way
if i were u dont waste money on a piecelike this
the only thing good about it is it will keep ya entertaind when u board git  it was betterafter renting this nascar title and many others i have noticed that that gameplay has become harder with every new release
for a beginner racer i would suggest nascar heat for medium racers the ea sports title nascar  but for somebody who needs a challenge i would say that nascar thunder is the right game
in nascar  the racing style is almost the same but i was winning every race but with nascar thunder i was having trouble not being in last place even when holding x the whole race
i was slightly mad because the fact that if you wish to make your own racing can that it takes a very long time many many savings numerous loadings and trouble with corperate ads on my race can
 stars is my reviewthis games packaging made it look promising but while the graphics are beautiful the linearity of the puzzle solving astounded me i have never played a game before that required such an absolutely linear progression and the puzzles were far far too simple for experienced gamers
i had my pad of paper and pencil all ready and only once did i actually record any information theremy husband and i we always play games as a team were also amused by the fact that while you retrace this mans steps from his journey in the s at each step of the way you pick up a computer disk to help you to the next stage
marvelous s technology those computer diskseven for one of the massproduced games coming out of dreamcatcher this one was disappointingi being the nerdy batman fan i am was of course drawn to this game allured by the ability to roam gotham city and use all his cool gadgets
but i was sadly mistaken
first off you cant simply quotroam around gothamquot like how you can roam liberty city in gta iii
the levels play more like an obstical course negaiting the use of the d graphics
his gadgets are a huge let down his grapplerthe thing he shoots a coard from and pulls him up can only be used at certain points and it tells you when so it takes some of that fun away from it
these things are enough to ruin the game
but theres more
the controls are absolutely hellish
certain things can only be done at certain times the combat system is sluggish and very unresponsive try nailing one of those special moves
ha ha
like thatll ever happen
not to mention extreamly anticlimactic
i even cheated using my game shark but it didnt even work
basicly as suggested by my title rent it first and if you like it youll probably stay that way
i disliked it from the beginning and ive been pretty consistantthe one plus in this game is the cinamatics
theyre better quality than they were on tv and it also saves them in a file so you can rewatch them at your leasure something i really wish final fantasy would dobottom line this could be a good game to the right person but i certainly dont care for itthis game makes your ps shine graphically but the poor controls and limited scope of action will drive you nuts
batman will fall from catwalks so easily and miss doorways so often that you almost think he is still in training
the gameplay is okay but you are scripted in what you can do so this is limiting
i would say rent but do not buythe short version pokemon takeoffthe detailed versionthe original jade coccoon is one of my favorite console games ever along with final fantasy  when i saw an ad for jc i was aglow with delight
i read the reviews i downloaded the previews and comercials etci bought the gamei started complainingthis is a rather sad sequel to what was a very good game
i think its very revealing that this game was only released in the us and not japan where the first was more popular
this game was designed to sell to young american kids who think pokemon is fun and it makes this very obviousthe game play is ok in jc divine beast breading is more like an industry
some elements of the original carry over which is neat
the portrayal of levant a thousand years after mahbu died is very interresting
ra mu and kikinak are also back
i also have to ashamedly admit i like the sassy fairy
the graphics are quite good and the music is goodthe plot is almost nonexistant
the first game delt with issues like why does man suffer
and the fall from grace of both man and spirits
the sequel deals with such thoughtprovoking issues as kahu likes girls but they think hes a dweeb
late in the game there are a few points where the plot gets interresting and there is some very good dialogue
then its as if the writers thought oh no
too much thought
well loose the interest of spongebrained american children
new scene
new scene
for light entertainment this game is ok if you think pokemon is cool youll probably like this game
if you want something as good as the original the total sellingout to the pokemon mentality will sorely dissapoint you
i was waiting throughout the game for any of the characters to use the prase gotta catch em all
thankfully they didnt but i would hear it in my head every time id playi desperately wanted to like this game
as a strategy rpg hoshigami occupies a very niche corner of the video game world
truthfully im obsessed with strategy rpgs and im always eager to devour new ones which are rare you see
games like tactics ogre and final fantasy tactics two titles which heavily influence hoshigami are some of my alltime favorites
i love them for their exciting battles and elaborate character micromanagement systemsso when i started up hoshigami i was impressed
it looks pretty good along the lines of final fantasy tactics the story is interesting and it seems intelligently designed intricate and difficult
i love a challenge
but i was betrayedas i played further hoshigami became a chore subject to a stupid loophole in the gameplay that made the entire thing quite ridiculous i will explain belowthe big innovation here is the rap system
each character has rap points which are consumed by executing actions movement attacks etc
i can see how a system like this could be applied to enhance the games strategy but something went wrong
in the end the system only empowers certain characters to make an extra attack or move a few more spaces every turn
all that really happens is you end up pressing the button a few more times every turn which makes already slow battles slower
oh my
why not just give a character more movement
more attacksspells appear on little goodies called coinfeigms
you can equip characters with coinfeigms and elective magic is an idea i really like
the number of coinfeigms to be collected is very impressive too
however they are entirely useless
for all the games difficulty spells imbued in coinfeigms are hopelessly underpowered
further evidence that spells are completely unavailing is found in the fact that as i played through the game none of my characters were ever slain by an enemys spellin hoshigamis polytheistic world your characters develop skills by following a specific god and gaining powers through devotion
devotion levels rise just like experience levels so fighting makes you more devoted getting you more abilitiesright
right
this was a very intriguing idea unique skills according to different gods but the developers messed up
firstly it takes forever to raise your levels
the stretches between levels are long long long
secondly the skills you earn with higher devotion levels are almost always useless
these two things make the game very difficultand i mean very difficult
anyone who plays hoshigami is sure to get slaughtered several times in the first few battles
the enemies are far more powerful than your team and you are almost always outnumbered
plus if a character dies hes dead  resurrection only becomes possible much later in the game
initially i was glad for a challenge but there is a fine line between challenging and morbidly frustratingand hoshigami crosses that linethe only apparent way to strengthen your party is to enter the towers of trial which serve as training grounds for your characters
the towers made me want to kill myself quite honestly
they are stunningly boring with repetitive battle maps monsters and everything else
i didnt want to train in these towers which were degenerating my sanity but how else could i be match for the games ridiculously hard battlesso i discovered the stupid loophole i mentioned above
instead of using a full team of characters i used just two fazz the main character and one other mercenary
my mercenary would be a dummy fighter to draw enemy attacks while fazz did the fighting
usually my mercenary would get killed quickly but i could always hire a more powerful one later
even if the mercenary survived any experience he gained would still leave him at a level lower than another mercenary i hire so there was no point in keeping him
the beauty of it all
fazz accrued  of the experience and became a death machine
it was mildly difficult at first but soon i was able to kill most enemies in one or two hits
it became even easier when my weapon of choice became a bow  arrow so i could kill from a distancesuddenly a viciously difficult game became mindlessly easy
i must say i dont like strategy rpgs to be mindless
i pushed on to the end to see what would happen in the moderately entertaining story but the gameplay was probably making me stupider with every battle
granted the fact that i could defeat  enemies with just two characters was somewhat amusing for a few battles but it became very boring very quickly
a game that is too difficult is not fun
a game that is too easy is not fun either
with hoshigami its either too easy or too difficult  either way its not funget tactics ogre on gba and skip hoshigamii bought this to play along with gran turismo  because i thought it would make this better
i was wrong
the steering wheel is so tight that it makes it difficult to turn the wheel
finding a spot to set it down is even more difficult
it takes a long time to get used to using the wheel and the foot pedals
it didnt make playing the games any better
luckily i was able to return itif you compare this game to hit and run well you just cant
do not paly this game after playing hit and run
this game is so unrealistic that it is boring
you can play as a lot of different players and there are many different people to drive but its just so repetitive
in the road rage all you do is drive people back and forth
they didnt even put time into making the level right
in mission mode you do different missions but once again they are very repetitive
if your friend recommends this game like mine make sure to rent it before you buy it
because if you do buy it you will probably just end up selling it hererating out of ten    this game is pretty boring
its just like crazy taxi just with the simpsons as the cast
the game is just the same thing over and over again you pick up passengers and drop them of at the designated area in the time limit you are given so the game is to repeticious
i rarely play it anymore
the only thing i really liked were some of the silly things that the characters said other than that theres no reason to get this gamenormally im a big fan of the simpsons but this game really did no justice to the name
aside from the snide remarks that the simpsons crew throws out constantly which in my opinion is the only entertaining bit to this game the game is very repetitive and boring
the graphics were very choppy and sloppy
it was like time turned back it was  and i was playing pacman on my atariit plays like crazy taxi which too was also a bad driving game
this is really not a game for the older gamers but kids will enjoy this very much because of its simplicity
i hated it but maybe youll like it
have fun and happy gamingthis game had so much potential but the designers just didnt put any thought into it
for example in the special tasks games why not have a level where otto has to pick up kids at bus stops
instead mindless crashing into barrels and picking up characters over and over and over again with nothing to keep you interested
its barely worth a rental
i love the show but the game just doesnt do anything for methe novelty of this game wears off very quickly
at first it was fun to play as several of the simpsons characters but when they started repeating their dialogue for the th time it became mighty tedious and tiresomethe gameplay is very simple
if gta vice city is the lego technic of road rage games then simpsons road rage is without a doubt the lego duplo
it is sooo aimed at kids
no one over the age of  will be particularly impressed with this
its just far to safe
the simpsons tv show is full of satirical humor and intelligence but this game is just a cheap spinoff aimed at a much younger audiencethis game is a fun concept and the simpsons references and sounds are great but it takes forever to load
and then you finish a level and it takes forever again
and then you start another level another eternity of a delay
it felt like i was back on a commodore   maybe worth a rental but dont buyanyone from minneapolis or montreal is likely to play this game and think its a simulation of driving in either of those cities with the added attraction of extreme property damage
i had debated buying this game for many months and while i am a huge simpsons fan many of the ps games i have played have been really awful
in fact from where i stand about one game in ten is worth playing much less actually own it
i also usually try to never pay full price of a ps game if i can and if that means waiting for it to be reduced in price or made a greatest hits title then so be itthe simpsons road rage is one of those games
i cant imagine anyone paying full price for this game playing it and think it was a good bargain
dont get me wrong its not a bad game on the same level that time splitters was a bad game rather there just isnt enough to do but pick people up and drop them off somewhere else as quickly as possible or running things down in the socalled mission mode
destroying stuff would be at least be visually pleasing if when you crashed into something instead of the polygon model breaking apart it exploded like most things in the simpsons rabbits chief wiggum in a garbage can i mean how many times has a car crashed in the simpsons and not exploded
right about  timeswhats worse is it isnt even that funny
the dialog never seems strained the actors do their part wonderfully rather what they say isnt going to win any emmies
my question here is in  seasons of the simpsons there have been about  really funny lines and even if only  pertained to cars and driving they could have just sampled them and stuck them into the game
but no we get lines like everyones a psycho but me
from lisa or youd make me the happiest christian in the world if you could take me to the church
from flanders
would have been so hard to go to gracie films and borrow some of their writers for this game in order to get some good lines
funny video games are possible anyone remember sam and max hit the roadalso the game presents some funny glitches like two apus standing on opposite sides of the street waiting to be picked up
or the time when driving as bart i dropped marge off at the she she lounge
i found marge waiting to be picked up in the middle of lake springfield standing on an island
later i found krusty waiting there as well
graphics are soso
a mixed bag of great character models and detailed locations seen in the show but almost everything else is pretty lowrez and over antialiased
some buildings dont even have textures on all sides
the physics model actually isnt that bad and i wish cars in gran tourismo handled as well as the ones in the game do
in that vein all cars drive and handle the same whether its barts soap box racer or marges canyonaroas a simpsons fan i can barely justify the twenty clams i laid out for this game
it will actually be worth it when it gets to half thati am a die hard simpsons fan and its really hard to write this review
the second i heard about this game i thought it would be really cool and i wanted it
when i got it and played it for a while i discovered that it was not fun at all
to unlock more cars and characters you have to pick people up and drop them off at different destinations
this gets very dull and repetitive
the only other thing can do in this game is these ten missions that are mainly composed of collecting or destroying objects in a time limit with no reward
oh yeah there this sunday drive thing which is picking and dropping people off with no time limit
in fact the only thing positive i can say about this game is that some of the voiceovers are funnyonce sentence captures it all  pretty lame  millhouse
for those who are simpson illiterates thats mrs krabapple describing millhouses science fair project
millhouse bellows behold the power of gravity
 and then lets a slinky step once down a ramp
there are so many great games that i wish they would copy and insert simpsons characters in
the only time i ever played doom on the pc was when someone installed the simpsons wad
to be homer simpson and to fight giant flanders throwing bibles at you me was great fun
of course when they blatantly copied a game they had to blatantly copy one of the worst games out there  crazy taxi
why couldnt they copy something good like grand theft auto   they could have had a hit with grand theft donutthe fact its the simpsons and you drive through springfield is pretty cool
thats about it
the  missions levels are decent enough to finish but arent exactly fun
the graphics are decent and they actually have the characters speak which is somewhat fun though not clever or laugh out loud funnythe main game consists of getting money to unlock cars and levels and to get one million dollars
each time you go through a run you gain about 
the run takes about  to  minutes to complete
every  grand you can unlock a new level or a new character
the unfortunate thing is that after  rounds youve done pretty much all there is to do and the novelty factor wears off
i got up to  before being thoroughly bored with this game
there was no way i was going to unlock all six levels and all seventeen characters
no way would i even consider trying to get one million dollars the monotony would have killed methe simpsons road rage is a game that gets old really really fast
its fun for about  hours max
rent it if youre curious but youll be disappointedthis game is cool if you like the simpsons which i do it wont matter if you like this game or not
ea uses the simpons to sell another driving game that is kinda like crazy tazi in springfield
this game is ok but not greati think there is a reason why accurate flight simulators are few and far between on the consoles
with only a few buttons a dpad and thumbsticks on a controller there isnt a great deal of input choices that would make up for a keyboard and fullblown flight stick
flight sim developers are plane nuts and they strive for accuracy many gaining access to the real aircraft even taking test flights in them
ace combat  is not such a game
its a fun romp through a campaign across a fictional nation that much is certain but it has all the depth of a wading pool
combat is a simple matter of simply getting close enough to lock up an enemy plane and firing a missile while evading an incoming missile is as easy as turning and breaking
also i know for a fact that real world aircraft do not carry upwards of  missilesflight dynamics are a joke there is little difference between piloting an a thunderbolt or a f characteristically both air craft handle pretty much the same save that the f is faster
realism goes out the window as one can usually outmaneuver an f in an f whereas in reality an f would fly circles around the venerable phantom
aside from carrying five or six times the missile load out missiles themselves are equally good at shooting down aircraft as they are blowing up tanks and hardened targets like bunkers
fire a sidewinder or a sparrow at a modern battle tank and even providing you could hit it the missile might scratch the paint
theres a great difference between aircraft aluminum and layered and ablative chobham tank armor
bombs are equally weird mk  lb gbs seem to shoot out of your aircraft as if launched from a cannon
when doing a bombing run you can actually see them fly on ahead of you towards their targetwhat also got me was how useless the m mm gattling gun is on most aircraft
i did a little research  a few years ago and found that the cannon is incredibly accurate
its spread pattern of  meters even at two or three thousand meters range indicates a  to  hit ratio
in ace combat  however its a bullet hose with all the accuracy of fox news
the real weapon is so accurate because its muzzle velocity is so high and thus overcomes gravity and wind resistance to a greater degree
in other words shooting down another aircraft is very difficult because you have to hit it so many times and providing you can maintain a close target lock long enough to pump enough rounds into it
this includes the as mm avenger cannon the depleted uranium slugs of which will chew up battleship hull armorthese are pretty glaring faults for a game but despite these i found myself enjoying the game a great deal on my first play through
i liked the story as told by a young boy whose village is under enemy occupation
i generally like games that let you pick and choose what aircraft and weapons you wish to fly for each mission that is if you have earned enough money to buy such aircraft to give yourself that kind of choice
each mission gives a series of objectives that must be met to earn cash a little like anime area  where mercenaries on both sides battle in the skies over africa and use earned money to buy new planes or repair their existing aircraft
you also get a boatload of weapons various bombs guided and otherwise laser guided mavericks and phoenix missiles which are actually really cool because when armed they lock up everything in front of you
and when you fire you launch as many missiles as you have targeted aircraftso from a realism aspect ace combat  misses the carrier deck by such a wide margin that its in a completely different ocean
i can accept that because its fun
and fun is the name of the game
going after the massive guns of the stonehenge base and racing down the death start ii tunnel system to wipe out monolith is darn cool
the lack of mission outline the fact that missions are timed and the fact that missions objectives are handled pellmell is not
the plane graphics are great and the landscape images are good from a distance
the combat chatter is fun but you dont get to hear enemy in your cockpit in real life
ace combat  is a fun game but a long long way from being a real flight simulator or even accuratei have to say i expected a lot more from this title
comparing it to the past  for the psone it appears that thq still doesnt have a working model for the story or career mode
i was able to unlock  of the secrets in   hours
the grapics are good and the load times are quick saving is agonizing
create a wrestler mode is as deep as ever moves included
however i just cant get over how weak the story mode is  matches max and your story is over
then you have to start over with the same drawn out fmv scenario and limited choices
you will play yourself out of this in a few hours
then really what are you left with
exhibition matches
no thanks thqwhen this game was first released i was pleased
i rented it then put it on my personal quotto buyquot list
after i finally purchased it i spent several months watching my created wrestlers caws in action
i said quotwatchingquot because i wasnt very good at actually playing the game
i would let the com be all the characters
eventually i tried playing the story mode
boy was i in for a surprisefirst its almost impossible to perform a top rope maneuver
by the time your guy physically gets on the turnbuckle the opponent gets upthe second problem is opponent recognition
in a match with several opponents you have to manually make your character focus on the person you want
imagine how frustrating this can be with up to  other folks on the screen including the refereethe third problem is the story mode
i guess thq attempted to fix their previous story problems from sd and sd by offering very brief scenarios
on one had this is good because you can unlock things faster
on the other hand it gets very repetitive very very quickly
you cant skip the cut scenes and all the characters use the same movementsnext issue is the load times
alone the load isnt long around  seconds
but i often want to make fast changes to my caws
those  seconds add up very quicklybut the straw that broke the government mules back is the programming bugs
i spent over a week unlocking items
then i made a caw with a certain premade move set
this particular bug causes the game to freeze once loaded
i later learned that other bugs are in the game
there are way to counteract the problem but only if you know about the bug first
after you save there is no way to fix it
now i have to delete all my hard work and start from scratch
i dont want to unlocking stuff all over again
ill be getting a gameshark soon
if i cant unlock everything with that im going to sell my gameps the game takes up over  bytes of memory card spaceyea at the time it had the story line right
and yea the game has a high replay value
but this game is hard even on easy this game is hard
the story mode is long and repeditive
i mean dont get me wrong i am a hard core wwf fan but this game is shame full
stone cold does not look like stone cold
the entrances are correct but in no way long enough
and the quotcommentary is laughable not at times but thought the hoel gamei grew up playing all the wwe games this is by far the worse one they have came out with
bad season mode bad roster bad graphics skip this game and get shut your mouth way bettter selectionnotice the developer of it is not neversoft they were the wonderful folks who brought us thps and   however they worked on number  for the playstation and handed the rights of playstation version over to some other developer
early reviews are saying that it cant even compare with the other tony hawk games and that the new developer totally screwed up the game
so while it may have the name sounds like it isint going to be very good at all psm gave it a 
im as big a fan as anyone else but i guess the ps version is a whole lot better which sucks for us still stuck with a playstation
too badi bought this game played it for a night and returned it to get ghost recon which happened to rockprosits playable out of the box
i used to not care about this so much but now i dont expect every game to work right away
how tragicthe graphics are excellent
i was very impressedthe game is very original
resources like water and rice that grows make the game more interesting
the unit alchemy is a very new concept
horses are really cool in the gameconsall in all the game wasnt all the fun after a while
i just went back to playing civ  and dark age of camelotthe battles though they look cool are not fun to fightthe resource cap is very annoyingthe unit alchemy system means that making all of your peasants into the top unit is really all you need to do to dominate
there is no reason to diversify your troopswhereas i have been enthralled by the series up to this point and was seriously excited about the new d screen and other updates i find myself sorely disappointed by the final productgripesnew adventure screen is a bit hard to see as the objects are all a pastel and tend to blend in a little with the pastel backgrounds
also the adventure screen seems cluttered and tight and opening up to the highest resolution makes everything too small to see so you need to stay on about  x the combat engine is in need of a boot to the head
what used to be cool animations in d has turned into some lame unit drawings who lumber around the field and take swings at each other
the spell animations have also lost something in the translation as they seem very cheesy and amateurishthe pace of the game seems to have gone way down
either the maps are too big or there isnt enough to do but sad as it is the game is a little boring in comparison to prior versions iii especially which was great
go back to the drawing board and put back what was taken out for the principle of progress
instead of the next generation we got the retroatari interface version 
too bad ltweeping this was one of the first games i received up until then i owned no games myself
dont let the nice looking cgi intro and ppg theme fool you though
its not a good gameits a rather slow game
its hard to execute moves
its hard to win a battle and even after you do it isnt fullfilling
i would only recommend this game to the most die hard ppg fanrent it firsti love the look and feel of the powerpuff girls on tv and had high hopes for this game
the d cg animated opening which basically copies that of the cartoon is really fun and enjoyable
that with the inclusion of all the major ppg villains made me think i was in for some funthe game aspires to be something more than just your average fighting game with its use of all three girls and playpen style fighting arena
there are powerups and props which are crucial to fighting along with some special moves and character taunts
but with all that plus reasonable ps graphics the game is still a bit sluggish on the controls and quickly repetitivei wish this game has faster controls more varied gameplay and a more involved use of the cartoons sound fx for both the game and the interfaceit could have been much cuter i thinkits a really hard game to play unless you put the cheat codes in
i love the power puff girls but this game was a little disappointing
but at least it was better then the other powerpuff girls game relish rampage
that game was so terrible i wouldnt recommend buying that onei have never played the previous bond games
however i know that as a game it is an imitation
the map design is sophomoric at best try deus ex instead for a real experience with covert first person shootingrole playingi used to own an n and id play goldeneye for hours at a time by myself or in the excellent multiplayer mode
as the first game on my new ps system i prepared myself to be wowed by   and at first i was
the controls arent as intuitive as goldeneye but the incredible graphics made up for that
unfortunately my excitement soon decayed into boredom as the inerrant autoaim took care of all of my enemies
run into a room hold down x and you win
theres body armor all over the place so you cant die and you can get shot a thousand times in the face with an automatic weapon and not even whimper
in other words this game was no challenge at allas for the multiplayer possibly the worst multiplayer of any game ever
again the autoaim lets you kill your friends with thoughtless ease
the only good scenario is one in which you must either protect or kill a vip
hours of fun in that one thoughsave your moneyregardless about whatever anyone else tells me the world is not enough is still pretty much the best bond game and one of the best console shooters out there
i was hoping that agent under fire would steal my heart but it broke it insteadgameplay the single player mode is very straightforward and short
the ai is nothing short of atrocious and the entire game basically revolves around heres a bad guy shoot him
your dull witted opponents will simply stand there and wait for you send him to his maker
the multiplayer was also somewhat dissapointing with the crappy ai dull stages and boring weapons
remember the huge rocket launcher that could be fired rapidly and was laser guided
they had to take that out and replace it with just a simple rocket launcher with no appealsound the music is outstanding as well as the voice acting but occasionally plagued by cheesy dialogueinnovation the driving and turret stages were different but totally lame and repetitive and as i mentioned the weapons are totally dull when you compare it to the world is not enough or any other bond game for that mattergraphics very pretty but with lame explosions and the characters move like robots
and why dont you have any handsreplay value two fairly decent multiplayer levels and an unsatisfying single player will make you quit before you even finishlets hope ea does justice to the series and does a better job with nightfire or give the liscense to someone elsethe conquest for any bigscreen to psscreen game is just simply to be good
the plots always become to developed without you actually doing anything to invoke it just shooting some people and sitting through a cut scene
this game is no exception
there seems to be no storyline continuing into the actual gameplay just the cut scenes
the levels dont allow any exploring
further more even though i enjoy an easy fairly quick game auf takes both of those to extremes
if youre good these measly  levels can be beaten in  hoursthere are two good parts though
the controls are good allowing you to scroll through qs gadgets easily
the second is the multiplayer mode with about ten unique environments and cool weaponsoverall  buy only for the multiplayer modei just reviewed night fire far superior and realized i missed this one
i wish i had missed it at the store too
this is definetly a rentalthe game just doesnt feel right from start to finish
my biggest complaint is weapons fire
it doesnt feel like really firing a weapon
its more like your shooting noise maker that spits out little tracersthis game had so much potential its to badhowever bonds face is better in this one than in night fire bronson on botax
ea should stick to the generic bond face like in this one
the role is about to change anyway jude law anyoneyou shouldnt have to be patient and wait for a game to get better
the playstation to this point is the most awful rpg system i have ever played
i miss the playstation already
this game is acceptable has a cute story but not an epic by any means good rpg for newbies and kidsthis game has its ups and downs
the plot in this game is fairly original
it takes bits from different stories and it becomes something new
and i love the comedy in this game
for example there is a rivalry between two of the characters for control of ari which is amusing
there is also flirting which you take part in if you choose
and some of the characters are fairly interesting
but the dungeons are terrible
theyre repetitive you just beat urns and things a lot of the time to move on
plus youre under attack constantly outside of cities
and since the combat is boring its an excruciating experience overall
but the cut scenes are fun and you get to choose what to say many times throughout the game
i think the plot being revealed is worth the torture the rest of the time
you should probably rent okage and check it out before buying itnearly seven years after the birth of the xbox i found myself in line at a local video game retailer buying a used box for a fraction of the original cost when it was released
i dont know what got into me but i had to give this system a try
i have been an offagain onagain gamer ever since my father got me the original nes when i was in grade school for making all as
over the years cinema has become my new favorite hobby but occasionally i crave for that ability to blow something up the perfect destressor to the corporate world
i must begin by saying that i am the college generation of goldeneye for n so i place the bar pretty high when it comes to any fps that teeter on the thought that they are the best ever
i remember when halo was released causing a rift in the gaming world
people couldnt seem to get enough of this game addictions ran high and halloween costumes of master chief seemed to be popular
that was back in   it is currently  and last night after two months of random playtime i beat this game  and let me be the first to say this although i am not  i was not impressed
halo begins flawlessly
with big guns ablazn you play as master chief a dutiful soldier that is taken out of hibernation to do what the rest of the military cannot stop the covenant
similar to goldeneye you have the unique ability to pick up weapons use the terrain as your shield and literally blow everything up
the excitement of this game comes when you realize that you have the mighty grenade in one hand with a choice of two weapons in the other
the weapons are creative but nothing spectacular and as the game develops further it adds to the painful repetition due to the fact that as you progress no new weapons become available
thirty minutes into the game you can pretty much count the weapons you will get to use in one hand
halo attempt to keep the players attention by changing scenery as much as possible giving the covenant some impressive ai
ability as well as slowly introduce a better arsenal of weapons used solely for the enemy
this game at times reminded me of the television show gi
joe because while cobra definitely had the best weapons the joes would always be victorious  i could never quite see the math behind that
quickly i would like to apologize about my constant critique of the weapons of the game but for me a person that wants to be able to pick up anything and constantly want to upgrade the arsenal the weapons seemed cheap and dull
i think even master chief was getting bored with the lacking arrangement of weaponsjust when a level of comfort settled in the developers decide to throw some new enemies in which does allow for some hectic moments mainly because these new enemies the flood fight anything that moves  even covenant
this means that grenades are flying everywhere or you can be like me and duck for cover and watch the destruction happen from the comfort of a corner
just like with the weapons you have the ability to ride in vehicles for both good and evil
let me be the first to say i hated the warthog
who could control this beast
i was surprised i was even able to get to the ship at the end of the game because i was cursing the engineers that developed this vehicle
apparently you needed a special drivers license to operate this machinery and my master chief could not properly study
i couldnt control it and it caused me to further lessen my enjoyment of this game
yet and i dont mean to point fingers but the covenants choice of vehicles were easy to use well equipped with weaponry and fun
why couldnt our teams stuff be more like that yet again eluding to my cobra reference from above
slowly the annoyance factor because to erupthalo did have one plus to its name and that was the controls
outside of driving the warthog i felt that the controls were relatively easy to learn and use
by the end of the first mission i thought that i could easily evade any baddies along the trip
but no matter how easy the controls were where halo suffered the most was in the development of the story and scenery
this game was exciting for the first twothree missions but after that we just fell quickly into the world of repetition
the background felt like it remained the same the evildoers jumped out of the most normal of places and eventually i got to the point where i just wanted to finish the game because i was getting bored
halo the game that defined the xbox literally bored me
my fingers were getting numb the story was stale and my eyes were bored
if i could use one sentence to summarize my halo experience it would be the previous one
i expected more because of the hype surrounding this game but i never got it
visually it started out well but eventually it just became old  very very quicklyoverall i think everyone should give halo at least one shot
i didnt go too deeply into the multiplayer aspects or the team play because honestly i play games for the story and adventure
halo for me needs to get better for me to enjoy the entire series
i am looking for a stronger story in halo  as well as more captivating bad guys a stronger score for those that speak highly of this  watch akira you can find the same music there and more weapons
if i can get one request across it is to loose the warthog the worst vehicle ever developed
i am on the fence
i thought it was good but not the greatest fps ever created
i will still put goldeneye on the top of the list as being the forerunner in this category
oh i nearly forgot what also annoyed me about halo was the ending
i thought it was rather cheap for the amount of time that i put into the game
i want strong money spending development from beginning to end
halo pulled some cheap shots and now six years later  it feels datedgrade  out of i usually dont write online reviews but halo warrents one
its just another game
i wasnt impressed
the levels are highly repetitive and get boring quickly
i never finished this one not because of the diffuculty but because it gets old rather quickly
after a while all they do is throw enemies at you
i dont know how halo got this big of a buzz
honestly
metroid prime was a lot better
if you want to compare it to other fps medal of honor blows it away in every way
including multiplayer
i guess people believe what they are told
ill be looking for halo  to actually be good and live up to some of the overhype of the first oneever wished that james bond was wearing concrete boots in goldeneye
well bungie has made this fantasy a reality with halo
dont worry about falling out of your seat halo keeps the gameplay at a crawlnot much fun but a great way to ease into siestaeugh ive seen better multiplayer fpses on the ps and n
the people who are giving this star reviews have clearly not spent a lot of time with computer fps games
quite frankly when you compare this game to t another bungie game cant say the full name on amazonits trash
if you want a console fps game youre going to get one and its no better than any other on a console
that is not good
i strongly suggest you ignore this waste of cds and buy some computer fps games
once again i suggest you start with t which in and of itself is a much better gamei cant see why people call halo the greatest fps of all time
i played the game at a friends house and i was expecting more from the game
the single player was simply pointless
there was no point to it
the  stars are for the multiplayer which is fun for the first  minutes and then gets repetitive and boring
the graphics are ok but the controls are truly horrible
the whole xbox controller design is horrible for that matter
max payne especially on pc is a much more interesting and enjoyable game than halo
a disappointmentfirst off these were used disks and i knew that going ini had to return the first set since they would not play at all
the vendor replaced them without a hassle and i would buy from them againthe second set plays but is really slow to load
the screen sits there so long you wonder if its frozen then suddenly it loads
once it does start it is fine for the durationagain these are used disks so do not expect them to perform like newok so im a little late to the halo party
i mean after all the game i am about to review is  years old and was one of the original xbox launch titles
but ill tell you what happened
way back in the day when i was just a brussel sprout of a lad i had an atari  or was it the sears version
then i got an nes then a sega genesis when i started college i think around 
but after the genesis i sorta drifted away from gaming for over a decade
it wasnt until christmas  that i bought a ps
so during the period  i didnt really pay much attention to games
so since the xbox came out in  along with halo i missed the whole phenomenon
thats not to say i wasnt aware of it
my dad bought an xbox and halo back in  and i remember playing through its opening sequence but nothing else
when halo  came out it made me want to go back to the start of the series so i began playing this game then
i got about  of the game completed and just sorta drifted away from it
now that halo reach is coming out i wanted to finish it once and for all and played the last  hours or so of the gamefirst things first is that theres not a lot of story in the first halo game
what little backstory you can glean is in the instruction manual but doesnt really give you a feel for the universes mythology
im currently reading the prequel novel halo the fall of reach and would highly recommend reading it before starting this game
or i guess you could just play halo reach in about  weeksin the far future humanity has mastered interstellar travel and has moved to colonize other worlds and systems
earth has become unified under the united nations space command unsc which serves as the peacekeeper of all of our farflung settlements
but things arent all hunky dory as there are some who want to rebel against its authority and yep you still have criminal pirates that raid ships
some in the unsc fear that eventually even bigger threats will emerge as humans move ever further from the centralized authority of eartha secret program called the spartanii project is initiated to breed and train the ultimate supersoldier
if successful the genetically and bionically enhanced spartaniis will be much stronger faster and intelligent than a normal human and serve as the goto black ops arm of the unsc
unfortunately just as the spartanii soldiers complete some of their first missions a new and unexpected threat arrives on the scene
we have our first alien contact with beings calling themselves the covenant
the covenant has no interest in friendly relations
in fact their priests have declared all humans an abomination to their god and instigate a holy war to wipe us out
the humans have plenty of ships and weapons to fight the covenant but they are mostly ineffective against the energy shields and laser and pulse weapons that the aliens possess
in effect we are completely outgunneda desperate plan is launched to smuggle the spartaniis led by their commander master chief onto a covenant ship and take the war to the covenant homeworld
before the mission can be carried out the spartanii homebase is invaded by the covenant and they are all killed except master chief who is saved by the ship pillar of autumn
when the ship comes out of a blind jump into deep space they encounter a huge ringshaped artificial world called haloand a covenant space fleet
it is said that the covenant think that halo is a powerful weapon and are attempting to figure out how to use it
the unsc needs to find out if if this is true but the pillar suffers severe damage from the covenant fleet
as the pillar heads for a crash landing with halo master chief and the ships ai cortana enter an escape pod that will take them to the rings surfacei have to say i found myself a bit unimpressed by the halo experience and found myself a bit bored in this first game
is it just because its almost a decade old or because its just not as good as advertised
probably a bit of both
first of all i would have liked to have had more story in the game itself instead of having to read a prequel novel to get the full impact of the game
because of its age what cutscenes there are really show their age polygonal and automaton movement glory to the max
from all of the other media that has come out since the games release i realize that universe of halo is very rich and deep but coming into this game i get none of that
it just feels like playing any other pointless shootera negative byproduct of this game being an xbox launch release is that the original xbox became synonymous with first person shooters first while the ps offered a more diverse game catalog
and really i dont see how this game was so evolved over earlier fpss like doom or quake
a lot of this had to do with the boring weaponry and enemies
you basically have about  types of each
the spartans main weapon mab assault rifle was probably my least favorite gun in the game
in fact spoiled as i am with cod it felt like a noisy dart gun
i found myself gravitating to the sniper and shotgun most of the time or picking up covenant plasma weapons over the human assault rifle
if you cant get anything right at least make your protagonists main weapon interesting
the levels themselves were quite lacking in imagination as wellthe vehicle controls especially of the warthog the equivalent of a humvee were awful and were especially cumbersome in the latter stages of the gameone of my pet peeves about videogames is when they have a fake save system
by that i mean they have an option that says save and quit but in actuality if you use it it only takes you to your last saved checkpoint
what makes this fake is that your last saved checkpoint is where the game will automatically start you anyway
so the game makes you believe you are saving when in actuality you will lose all progress since the last checkpoint
i also felt that halo suffered a bit because it didnt offer many checkpoints when it came to longer battles where you had a ton of enemies to take down
in fact a lot of times i just tried to rush past some of the battles instead of getting involved in them and dying and having to repeat myself
i actually found myself repeating out loud as i played omg this is so frickin boringso boringso boring
this happened a lot when i had to repeat whole battles over and over
i finally got through them or found a way to bypass them but it was not an enjoyable experiencereally i guess in the end i could sum up my thoughts on halo combat evolved as tedious
i did not have fun playing this game
it seemed more like work than a game
i never had a wow moment
the lack of story and the lack of variety in the environments weapons and enemies all served to make this game a major downer for me
i guess its worth playing for its historical i didnt think it was a very good game
if you do choose to pick it up definitely check out the fall of reach novel first to give it some contexthalo combat evolved is the most overhyped game ive ever encountered
ive heard for years how great this game is so i finally bought it on sale for  even that was too muchi am a veteran pc player of first person shooters who started with the original wolfenstein d and have played almost everything since including all the dooms quakes jedi knight halflife and unreal tournament
there is nothing in halo that hasnt been done before
in fact its the easiest most linear fps ive ever played
i finished the single player game in a little more then two daysthere are only  levels in the game each of which is broken down into  to  sub chapters
the game play lacks any puzzle elements switch hunts or boss battles so all you do is move down a path shooting everything that moves which is fun for about  min then it gets old
you are outfitted with a motion sensor right out of the movie aliens so its no mystery where the bad guys are
there are a few times in the game where you are required to locate specific areas but that is aided by your onboard computer assistant who kindly gives you nav points to locate them so you just follow the dots leaving piles of bodies in your wakeas other reviewers have noted you can drive vehicles but the human vehicles take no damage at all and you cant get one of the other marines to drive the vehicle if you want to take the gunners position so you are left to driving but then you cant shoot from the drivers position
this leaves you stopping and dismounting everytime you want to engage the enemy
alien vehicles are one man vehicles so you can shoot as well as drive and they do take damagemost fps games let your character carry far too many weapons
halo has the opposite extreme
your character is limited to carrying two weapons and granades so the majority of your post combat time is spent looking through the piles of bodies for the best two weapons you can find
all the standard fps guns are here the pistol machine gun sniper rifle alien plasma rifle needler direct halflife rip off shot gun and of course the rocket launcherenemy ai is also vastly over hyped
its obvious after a few minutes they run a standard pattern that is easily overcome with a quick trigger finger and a strafehalos graphics are very pretty and the frame rate is smooth throughout the game but combined with the unispired story and game play and linear design it not a big a plusmultiplayer play is limited to the usual styles but lacks any online capability at all
to use it you have to all be local then you can share the console or connect several togetherif youre a veteran fps player halo is likely to disappoint
if youre a newbie to fpss then you will get some enjoyment from this game till you discover the vastly superior pc fps games which you have been able to play online or over a network with your friends since the mid sbe warned if you are looking for a game similar to tetris bustamove or any of the other very addictive multiplayer games do not buy fusion frenzyif you are looking for a game to play with many friends who have little skill on a gaming system then this is for you
there are an abudance of games but many of them are similar to each other and the variation is no where near as great as it could beadditionally the oneplayer versions of the games are weak and are of little enjoyment to play alonebottom line is that if you choose to purchase this game no what you are getting a game for people with little gaming skills that can be picked up very quickly
the graphics are good for what it is but make very little use of the xboxs potentialgood gamingfuzion frenzy isin many waysfun
there are close to  games a bunch of characters and lots of things to try
unfortunantly the games have no real purpose no real rules and each uses such different controlsits hard to get into a flow
heres what i thought of microsofts fuzion frenzy the gameplay well there are dozens of games to try and u can play with up to  players
the graphics are pretty good and the game is pretty fun
the problem
the gameplay is repetitive the controls stink and it seems like a game that tried to be  or  different games and in fact doesnt seem in any way its ownyou start out by picking a game type
multiplayer single player tournament arcade etc  in arcade for example u can pick any game and play it over and over againor pick another game
you can do this with as many players as u wantonce u pick a game type and how many people are playing you pick a character
the problem begins here
the players seem to be different through color and gender not through persounallity
each person just seems to be either a green guy or a pink girl
they hardly ever talk have no persounality or grudges or talents and seem to just be there
this was a major problem as i never found anyone to be my favorite
its not like mario party where each character is different and fun to try
here everyone seems to be the sameand they are
another problem is no one seems to have a face
just eyes a nose a mouth
they dont react smile talk
no mustaches long hair
each person is so similar u wont care who u pick
thats a major problemthe games thankfully are for the most part fun
theres  minigames to try each pretty fun
there are games where you hop in vehicles and do things
for example try not to hit each others tail or knock the other off the sumo court it continues to shrink and you try to push the other  peoples ballshaped vehichles offlike sumo
you have games where u collect the most valuables kill the most bugs etc  when u win a minigame in a tournament u get points
st gets the most followed by second third fourth etc  you add up points through about  minigames
the winner gets bragging rights
unfortunantly  minigames isnt that much to choose from the characters arent that interesting
in the end it gets very dull
and not all of the games are goodsome are just boring and seem to be impossible and can take  minutes just to understand
thats no fun especially at a sleepover or party where this game is aimed at
the controls arent very good and with just  minigames all of them needed to be
not the case here and may have killed this games gameplay graphics decent but nothing the ps or gc couldnt handle
the water looks decent and plain the characters have no real special affects
the envirements are vibrant and colorful but nothing great
this was a launch game by microsoft where they boasted the best graphics in the worldyet these graphics were nothing new
they get the job done but dont in any way save the game
the graphics were goodbut any console now a days can do good
what we want is great options several
you can play all types of games in all types of modes create how long your game is how hard etcvery good
there are a lot of characters a lot of games and a lot of different things to try
there are a lot of optionsbut it didnt save the gameoverall if u have no multiplayer games u might want to pick this up especially for its price
it is fun it is pretty unique but it needs a lot of improvent
i enjoyed playing it it did have a lot of cool stuff but it wasnt anything id brag about to my friends
this is a good game that the whole family girlsboys at any age and if u find a good deal u might want to pick it upjust dont expect mario party here
its a good game with decent graphics but gets pretty old fairly quicklyhope this helpedthxif this game were a multiplayer only game i would actually give it a much higher score then two stars
the reason being that the only fun part of this miserable game is the multiplayer and when you have friends over
on your own it is just a discrase with horrible ai graphics gameplay and audio all this added together equals a very bad gamei will now split my review into sections of graphics gameplay and audio
of course this game doesnt have online capabilites because it came out before xbox live was even released
to be honest if xbox live had come out at the very beginning and this game supported online play i would probobly give it a  because of its extremely fun gameplay when you are playing against one another offlinegraphics the graphics in fuzion frenzy are definetely ones to be embarassed about
with horrible character models background design and retarded looking features on each map the graphics portion of the game is definetely lacking in deatail
it reminds me of something that you would find out of a gameboy advance now a days actually come to think about it this games graphics are probobly worse then even that
thus if the graphics were better in fuzion frenzy i would give the game a much higher score but please graphics like these just arent acceptablegameplay the gameplay in fuzion frenzy is extremely simplistic as well
basically when you are accessed to the menu of fuzion frenzy you are given the choice to enter a tournament or you can choose mini games that you can play on your own or with friends
the game is made up of at least  minigames each one of the at least  minigames requires a maximum of three buttons out of all of them on the xbox controller to be used
sad
if you enter a tournament you can choose between two four or six stages each stage consisting of four random minigames that fit that stage and then a final game which they call fuzion frenzy where you can basically gamble the points that have earned for the other games and depending on whether you lose or win will get processed to the final rank of that stage putting you in a certain position from characters doing the best to the ones doing the worstlike i said before the gameplay is extremely simplistic which makes it really boring at times and it forces you to just shut off your xbox consolehowever if you are playing multiplayer it is a much different story considering that there is actually a challenge most of the time and the players actually know what they are doing instead of the incredibly dull and stupid ai running all over the placeaudio oh god the worst part of this miserable discraceful game is yet to come
the audio
every time you play a minigame there is this annoying voice counting you down until the game starts
as the game progresses the annoyvoice does as well providing you with helpful commentary
also did i not mention that the music in fuzion frenzy are produced by wannabe techno djs
well now i have and yet another reason not to buy fuzion frenzyin conclusion this game would get a lot higher rating if they had made it multiplayer only but enhanced the features a lot more and provided us with a little more complicated minigames
but for now its just a wannabe game that didnt get anywhere in terms of money made and in my opinion never willthe cars are sweet
the graphics are sweet
too bad racing is just  in here
this game is wayyyy too hard
i cant even get past some of the tracks in easy difficulty
not a good game though you gotta love the carsi bought this game a couple days after i got my xbox because i saw all the screen shots and read all the reviews for it
boy were they wrong
whoever reviewed this game and praised it for being one of the best racers ever was smoking  sure ill agree the graphics almost cant be beat but i wanted a racer with more than just good graphics
i dont know what i hate more about this game the repeatitive tracks or the cars that handle like a mac truck
you cant hardly win a race in this game at all not even with a fast car
i found the beatle blowing me away in a audi tt
this game doesnt even give you the chance to feel like youre racing because you are constantly slamming on the brakes to make another turn
also dragging this game to the bottomless abyss is the inabillity to upgrade your carswhat the heck are the  kudos for if you dont have to buy the cars you win them instead and you cant upgrade themif you want a fun race game buy need for speed high stakes for playstation
the graphics might not be as great but its a fun game and you can upgrade your cars to make them look and performe like a car shouldpgr is second rate compared to rallisport
rallisport is more fun better graphics better sound better controlspgr does have cooler cars thought because most of them are consumer cars as opposed to just rally cars which most people have never heard of
the background in pgr are very boring and stagnant hurried to get done before release datethe controls are extremly hard to use and the game is extreamly hard i didnt like the game at allim being honest here i dont understand how this game got good reviews here  i didnt like this game as much as i thought i wouldthe value of the cons outweigh the value of the pros tremendouslythe pros that were enjoyable were the awesome graphics the system of advancement is mature and the ability to race with your own musicthe problem is the major cons
while there are stylish things in the game the gameplay totally is bad
it feels like im driving a turtle the cars dont go fast at all
i thought something must be wrong as i couldnt believe how slow the cars go at top speed
its so slow its almost sillyand i agree about the controlling the cars as some others said its a nuisance
i mean it shouldnt be so ridiculous
i just want to race go fast and have fun
if you played splashdown awesome gameplay you will know what i meanthe cars dont race smoothly and it isnt practical for a game
for example you cant turn with even medium speed
you have to let go of the gas way ahead and brake completely almost coming to a full stop when turningthe bottom line is that yes there are cool things about the game but nothing is more important than the gameplay and it totally bad
as a note i rented this game and i certainly wouldnt buy itif you want to know what i mean by awesome gameplay for racing see splashdown
the engineers did an awesome job somehow theyve combined difficulty with fun and awesome speed
i completed the career and have played it so many times and i can play it all day because the racing itself is just pure fun
thats how a race game should be unlike project gothami wouldve gave the game a  but i gave it a  only for cool graphics and music supporti loved the oddworld abes oddysee and the oddworld abes exoddus games
the whole concept of puzzle solving raised above everything else the idea that there is no life bar do or do not there is no i barely made it through but i only lost half my life its totally gutted from the game
argh
who took a great idea an awesome concept and pissed it all away by making it like every other game out there
sure they kept the same great world with those great characters and the same humor but what happened to the fundamental elements that made oddworld stand apart from all the other games
now its more like the ratchet  clank the jax  daxter or the sly cooper games but its not as good as ratchet  clank or sly cooper
what happened to the challenging puzzle solving play concepts that made the previous oddworld games so great
whoever made the decision to be more like other games on the market to stop being their own different and original game line really screwed the pooch on this one
this new direction in the oddworld games makes it nothing more than one of many generic games in an over saturated genre
its really sad to see the great succession of abes oddworld games come to thisi played this as far as i could maintain interest in it i really wanted to see more of the world the humor and the clips with the glukkons bad guys but the game was just lacking
i found myself just running through areas while just trying to avoid taking too much damage and not really focusing on real game play
but that was the problem there was a lack of that challenging game play that made the oddworld series so greatand the camera and controls were irritatingim through with this game for what it is it isnt worth playing just to try to see the interesting clips and humor that might be in there
i might see what the next oddworld game looks like but if its like this one oddworld munchs oddysee then im done with anything new from oddworldi am really disappointedi give this game a little credit on the graphics but other than that its pretty annoying from the controls especially munchto the characters voices
this isnt my style of game but im sure some will like itnice graphics a few exciting moments and kinda cute
but the gameplay is bland and and doesnt do a good job of captivating the playeryes the story of this game is somewhat compelling but i have to agree with most other reviews on the web that this game certainly is lackluster
i was expecting much more surrounding the hype of this gamethe gameplay in this game could have been done much better
you are subject to only a few attack moves and the elemental powers do little to accentuate this
i must say that the wings you get  were a throwback to the old kid icarus days thougha major drawback of this game is that the world of azurik really isnt all that expansiveas the puzzles in the game arent very difficult
also with all the hype around the game surrounding this quotmassivequot world to explore i found myself wanting more in the freeroaming capabilities and was severely disappointed
another drawback is the amount of backtracking that needs to be done throughout the game
a final drawback has is the graphics had they spent another  months polishing them up some of the areas they attempted to portray could have been gorgeousi have to say that after finshing this game i was quick to trade it in at funcolandazurik is a pretty bad game
it very quickly becomes boring has a very bad plot and the whole game is justkindof stupid
cmon you go around fighting polkadotted lizards and looking for crystals as a blue guy who likes the adult version of skeeter from the cartoon doug do not waste your time or money on this game
before i played it i thought it was going to be a great game i read previews and good reviews
i was very very wrong
the only redeeming quality of this game is the graphics it  might be fun for some people i heard it gets better later in the game so ill give it  stars instead of onebut i could barely play for  minutes
ugh
spend your money on great games like halo dead or alive  project gotham racing nfl fever  etc
but you dont have to listen to me rent it if you must and see for yourself
but remember i warned youthe only way i ever suggest you to buy this game is if youve never played the one on dreamcast n or the playstation
sure its probably the most complete version of the game but its a sleeper hit in my opinion
if tony hawk  werent coming out for the system id suggest you get it but since it is i suggest you rent before a purchasexbox may have great titles like amped freestyle snowboarding blood wake dead or alive  my favorite genma onimusha and halo but one questiondo we really need another tony hawk  
i mean come on now this game is about  years old
i know what you guys are thinkingwhy couldnt craig give this a better rating 
why 
because this is just an upgraded version of the same skating game that released  years ago
but let me give the lowdown on the game
the graphics are improved 
there are a hell of a lot of changes made for the xbox version and the skaters look great especially when they do shadowlike movements when their special meter turns yellow and the stages are bigger than ever
there are some new ones and old ones from tony hawk  but nothing really special
most of the characters look almost the same
the only slight change is the detail and the framerate
the sound is still the same
the same grinding sounds from rails and cement
and especially the same old soundtrack 
i just got tired of it now 
the only additional song is the one from the new skatepark on england
it sounds like an instrumental of ddrs paranoia
but once againnothing special
the gameplay is still the same
the controls are still the same way it was from the playstation n and dreamcast versions
the only new element is the multiplayer where players can go at it with four controllers 
wowwas that supposed to amaze me 
anyway this game is only for the people who never tried the tony hawk series or people who never even bothered to play the tony hawk series
but dont get me wrong
its not like i have anything against thpsx
i like how the game is done but im just saying i already played it on the dreamcast and playstation
there is really no need to port it over to a powerful machine like xbox i still like gamecube dreamcast and playstation  better
if you never tried out the game nows your chance 
go ahead and get this game if you own xbox
but if you already played it just forget about it and keep putting your focuses on the now and current tony hawks pro skater  if you have a gamecube ps or game boy advance
all in all an average game for the xbox but this game is  years old and its really pointless if an old game is played on one of the latest systems out there
maybe tony hawks pro skater x shouldnt have been made in the first placeheres a thoughttony hawks pro skater  is already out on the xbox so go get that one instead 
it looks better and most of all it plays better
the xbox version has one additional skater and one additional stage
tony hawks pro skater x is only for the people who never played the earlier versions so stay away if youre already familiar with it honestly unless youre lucasarts completist collector theres no longer any reason to buy this game
with the pending sequel jedi starfighter many of the things that annoyed people about starfighter se like its highly inadequate multiplayer environment are going to be addressedand we hope resolved
give this one a misspoor sound poor picture poor everything
what a waste of time and effort
they could have spent the companys time ad money on something good or a rushed piece of garbage
they chose the latter
this is nothing we havent seen before even the graphics are nothing we havent seen before
advanced system with graphics that should be on a psxif you find a copy on the street dont throw it away you might be able to use it as a coaster for your drink
dont put it in your xbox though
you will have to punish yourself for abusing your system by using it as a garbage disposali suppose the great review are from people who just got their xbox and were impressed with it
im sure after playing the game awile they reflected on their  stars with dismayno game that freezes for a full second during a race should get  starsyou can get  in competition but not if your friends join inwhy on earth only  players instead of  player mode could have been too hard but surely  would have been easy enufif anyone has had x on their computer they will be dissapointed
i was anticipating more parts than before and i dont count  different types of winchs as a great improvement
its a fun and addicting game but they should have done alot better at making a sequel
i played it for about  hours before i got the fever and reloaded it on my computer to play the best x i have the original it played online toothis game was ok to play the graphics are decent but not to impressive
the storyline is pretty basici gave this game  stars because of good graphics and good entrances thats it
i dont know about anybody else but for me what matters is gameplay and this game does not have quality gameplay
i strongly dislike the fact that you have to get the crowd to cheer for you so that youll be able do your special move
as one reviewer said if you hit your opponent with a chair so many times theyll begin to cheer for them
what baffles me is why you unlock clothing for creating a wrestler is one thing but using it for a weapon is positively ridicoulus
example beating someone up with a bandana or sunglasses here are some other things in the game that annoy me you cant put people or your created wrestlers in stables
you cant have your manager come out with you
not a wide selections of moves taunts and entrancesfinal analysis do not buy this game no matter how much your craving a wwf gametheres no excuse for a half baked beta test like this to be released on the marketanchor should be ashamed of themselves and microsoft should be downright embarrassedits things like this that validate all the xbox bashing thats been going on
the charges of it being an eye candy machine and nothing more stand true on games like thislet me say here and now that smackdown  still stands well unchallenged as the best wrestling game of the newer generation thus far
i think gcs wrestlemania game has great potentialthis had outstanding potential and i was well pleased when this got delayed by four months
why
because i thought a lot of extra work was going into it
now i shudder in fear to think of what this would have been like had it been released on its original december datethe pros gorgeous looking and sounding like any xbox gamecons gameplay mechanics are slow and cumbersome at times
player model and movements are downright bewilderingnear zero options and replay value
you cant even go for the tag titles
no story mode
no steel cage no royal rumbleno nothingthe roster is filled mostly with jokes
 wrestlers sounds impressive until you realize its filled mostly with names like kkwik and haku
theres no excuse for not having the updated postinvasion roster ready to goi am angry enough about this that i am starting to make plans to unload my xbox
i have one game for it halo
i dont see anything coming anytime soon that looks promising
everything else has been empty eye candythis is a crime and they should pull it off the shelves and issue an apology
they should also rework top to bottom and in about six months give us the finished productsmackdown  looks like a masterpiece next to this
i am ashamed to own an xbox as of nowthis game is okay but were is season who the hells haku wheres blood
nothing good about this game u cant climb ladders and it almost imposibble to win titles
u cant save ethier this game blowsim really glad i rented this game first
graphically its stunning starting with the perfectly recreated raw open at the beginning
but graphics can only take you so far
there also are a ton of available wrestlers in this game but most of them fall into the hes still around
categorythe problems start right at the main menu
there are only the most basic matches like one on one tag team triple threat and a sixman tag match
you can make the matches hardcore but thats about the extent of what you can do in this game
no ladder matches no steel cage or hell in a cell matches no options
you cant even fight into the backstage area or crowd in a hardcore match
there is also no career mode meaning no alliances built and no real direction for you to go
instead the game allows you to go after the individual belts which require you to beat a certain number of superstars
after you win the belt thats it
and you cant save your progress either so be prepared to spend a solid hour and a half at least going for a belti also have issues with the gameplay
its a simple enough system and pretty easy to use but there are a few quirks
the stamina meter is a great idea thats been very poorly done
four punches and youre out of breath opening you up to all sorts of attacks
i thought these were wwf superstars not homer simpson
the computer also gives wrestlers like xpac the ability to reverse everything including punches and kicks and never let you get anything going
that can be a good or a bad thing depending on how much of a challenge you want
but the most annoying thing has to be the crowd meter which allows you to do your finishing move when it starts flashing
in order to get this you have to vary your moves which i dont have a problem with
what i do have a problem with is that the crowd turns on you bigtime if you use the same moves repeatedly
for example you can inadvertently let your opponent do their special move if you throw one too many punchesthe createawrestler system is good but ive seen better
the developers also see some reason to only allow you to create  wrestlers
also if you expect to create a true superstar that wont happen
you cant build your stats up enoughoverall this is an ok game that could have been much better if more time was spent on it and the developer didnt rush it out
its worth a rent but just barelyafter months of hype the game was finally released far lower than expectations
there is no story mode road to wrestlemania instead there are championship modes where you need to go through  wrestlers to get a title shot
the raw arena is the only arena and there are no backstage areas
nor is there any real hardcore action because even though there are s of weapons these weapons are helmets tutus jackolanterns chairs bandanas and so on
the wrestlers do not bleed at all not even with a code
there is a pretty deep createawrestler feature however you can only create  wrestlers
so you have to go out and buy memory cards to hold  more wrestlers ripoff
there is no rvd ddp booker t and so on however there is rhyno spike and haku
there are very few modes exhibition and the king of the ring tournament
there are no table matches ironman matches or  man tag matches even though the game lets  wrestlers in the ring at the same time
all of the titles are not even in the game
the only belts are the world intercontinental european lightheavyweight and the womens title
the play is very unbalanced such as the rock and the undertaker can undoubtedly beat up kkwik and xpac so there is no chance raising a new star
another detail to the game is the new stamina bar where your wrestler will get winded the more he runs and does power moves
so rhyno cannot do gore after gore because he would get tired
with there being a stamina bar there is also a voltage bar which is basically one long bar that determines who is winning and when you can do finishing maneuvers
the controls are unique where you have an attack grapple block and action button
the attack button is capable of several attacks such as hold up and press the attack button will do a dropkick hold down and press the attack it will be a kick or a punch
its the same with the grapple button
the action button can do anything from perform a taunt pin an opponent pick up weapons put on clothes and climb the turnbuckle
the graphics and sound are amazing but what fun is the game if there are no modes to keep you interested inhypea lot of ithypeit didnt live up to itnot even closefacts wage war with top wwf superstars modeled in amazing detailthe look and detail are ok but wrestlers knees do not bend
lolreally
but games are not looks aloneassault opponents before you get to the ringya click the y button and the game takes over not really that big of a dealwatch the audience scatter as the action spills into the crowdnot in this game it was left out and the quotaudiencequot is still very dull to see and have that quotcardboardquot cut out lookbattle in more than  backstage areasnope again not in this game
something else that is promoted but not truelook as a adult i play games for fun but to promote them on my websites or to other adult friends
this game has nothing to offerthere are only a few modes the game its self is overly hard  took me  hours to win a match on easy mode because no matter what you do the computerxbox kicks out most of the time if your going to buy this for a child make sure the kid does not get bored fast and if your buying this for yourself rent it first  stars
the creataplayer is very good
the over all quotlookquot to the games is very well put togetherthis is a rent first buy later game i knew this game wasnt very deep when i bought itused for  bucks
but even so i was shocked by thelimits of this game
the roster of wrestlers isnothing to write home about and there simply isntalot of moves you can do
the lack of matches is alsoa big negitive
i got to say that i have not playeda good wrestling game since wwf no mercy on the nintendo
seems as though wrestling games died after thatanother thing is that the fun seems to be lacking
youdont have much freedom due to the crowd factorthisshould be an option and not a unchangeable ruleand itmakes me feel tight as a gamer and you really cantafford to play around with the oppnent at all
just nofun here at all
gave it to a fews son
what a poor soulhe isgrand theft auto iii is the kind of a game that is immersed in popularity so deep that it actually has more cons than pros
there are too many negatives about playing grand theft auto iii due to numerous useless and pointless missions limitedness of freedom repetitive playing constant use of x button lack of ability to save the game when needed and ridiculous storyline and miscellaneous information
let me get the positives out of the way first
for one grand theft auto iii looks cool for its playing features and the ideas of what to expect are of high level
there is a plenty to do around each of three islands
it took me about a couple of months to beat grand theft auto iii so more bang out of the money
several special types of missions are fun such as rampages and unique jumps
now for the negatives as they are many of them
novelty of a game can only wear off that its no longer replayable
grand theft auto iii is no exception to this case
i beat this game a while ago and i showed some interest in playing it again few years later
what i had forgotten about grand theft auto iii is how monotonous the game is
i perfectly outlined my objectives for each island of three cab fire cop jumps packages rc rampages and missions
each of them not the rc anyway takes too damned long to finish
the worst aspect of grand theft auto iii is the dreadful ambulance mission
it takes a good two hours to finish this one there are twelve levels level  save one person level  save two persons etc
if the ambulance is either flipped over or shot up i am back to square one and must do it all over again
in the midst of this there is no allowing of saving at any point of the mission
it has to be completely done from start to finish
actually i reached level  and saved nine people
then suddenly i flipped the ambulance over not because i wasnt paying attention but my thumb literally got tired
of course my mind got numbed and i grew frustrated at the idea of doing it again
i understand that those missions along with cab fire and cop are to familiarize myself with the geography of each island
my suggestion to improve the game play why not just have  cab missions on one island  fire the second island and  cop for third island
maybe ten levels of ambulance are okay and allow me to begin at the highest level possible where i screwed up
whenever i am doing something on each island ninety percent of the time my thumb is constantly on the x button
it gets sore after a while
the tedious driving around and going from point a to point b can be thought of preliminary stages of alzheimers
its no fun
as for the real missions they are all right for rpg but nothing special
the storyline is ridiculous at best why not get the main character to make a name for himself as he rises to the top as mafia hood boss or something
speaking of the protagonist who is he
what is his name
what does he really look like
what can he do
what is he interested in
the statistics are helpful but must i know how many inches of rain fell or total people wasted or weight of explosives used or total amount of money paid by cops
when i pointed out limitedness of freedom mainly i have objectives that i must complete and when i am in midst of them i feel the rigidity that i must follow this way and no other way
the game is not actually hard to beat but its not that easy either
all in all grand theft auto iii is full of cycles repeated to death until  completion is reached
when that is accomplished is there a sense of satisfaction
not really
and no i still cant fly the freaking dodo and its not even necessary eitherwhat a waste of intriguei know i know
this game is innovative a venture into the new world
it brings video gaming to the next level
i will admit this game was creative the concept is pretty good and at times it can be fun
but the overall gameplay is just a bit too gory for my taste
heres what i thought after a few hours of gta the graphics pretty good
i disagree with anyone who said this game lacked graphics
i own an xbox and hate pss graphics but i was impressed by the many things this game supports
there are dozens of cars bridges people shops trees guns and just about everything else
the world looks real and comes alive
the weather changes and the worlds are huge
as much as i hated all the gore this game definantly looked pretty awsome in every other way
grade b
the gameplay okif u like going around shooting people to death
theres way to much blood and the way u can just keep hitting people again and again with the bat or the gun just gets sickening
the blood is everywhere and it really takes the quote fun out of the game
the whole concept of hejacking cars is cool and swithcing cars again and again or running on foot was pretty cool while trying to escape the police
you can hejack anything from regular old jeeps to taxis police cars ambulances fire trucks vipers tanks and anything else out there
once again all this would have been fun even shooting peoplewithout the gore
this game could have been so much more but instead its just sickening
gangs are everywhere freedom is everything
but overall i just didnt find it fun in fact quite the opposite
grade c
replay value i can see how an extreme person might like this game and if u can handle shooting peoples head off to see a fountain of blood go ahead
but overall the game made me feel like a criminal nothing else
but if u do like this kind of game there are dozens of missions freedom beyond your largest dreams and cash to earn
rival gangs and kick police   the concept was awsomeit just didnt click for me
grade bwell i hope this helped and if your sickened by gore like me you probably wont like this game
a sour feeling left in my mouth i will never be a gta fan and could care less if one of them makes there way on to the xbox
my friend likes it he can like it
it justnt didnt click with me
would it with ui wish i won the lottery but thats for people with hope
i have hope
youd have a better chance atblah blah blah blah blah
thats the way it always is
plus youd have a better chance at liking this
it is so boring
i might never win the lottery just like all of those sobs who have all of it to themselves
it makes me furious
even though in the series this game leads straight to vice city at least the main character has a friggin personality in that game
i dont know yet how good san andreas is either
the graphics for gta  are just plain crappy you dont have a code for weapons and when you kill someone it doesnt sound like youre trying to
everything echoes for some reason when you go down hills of streets shrug
if you want a better game play gta vice city dragonball z budokai or mk deadly alliance
you will not only get blood but a lot of good fun violencewhen gta came out i did not get around to it
here i am eight years after the fact coming back to it to see how it plays and compares with later games in the seriesit doesnt fare as wellim an old enough gamer  to still appreciate how revolutionary this game was for its time both gameplay and pushing the envelope on what they could get released for a console unfortunately still branded as a childs toy by much of society
still the game is not much fun to play even compared to its immediate successor vice cityfor starters navigating the city is itself unfun
with no big map overview its hard to get oriented
much of the landscapearchitecture doesnt stand out so i found myself navigaing by remembering road curvesintersection angles on the small immediatearea map
this is further hindered by objectives that you dont get to see where they are only what direction they are in until youre close enough to see them onscreen
also finding the pay n spray while being hounded by the authorities is difficult without any locational indicatord until youve been on an island for an hour or two to get familiarmany of the missions are simply not passable on the first try
theyre not that diffcult in the end but most will likely take  tries to figure out exactly what youre doing
it usually has suprises like suddenly getting  stars wanted rating or attacked by a halfdozen driving members of some gang or suprise instakilled by the fbi or some other government people abound
ocasionally it reqires out of the box thinking to react to an event and kill someone before they can get away ie you have to know to block a certain alley with a busfire truck to cutoff an escape route beforehand or else its almost impossible to catch up
the biggest funkiller though is the constant aribtrary time limits that get thrown on the missonsbugs abound
ive had missions where targets become invincible people im supposed to pick up in a vehcile dont appear or they get stuck and stop following or spawn inside a buildingterrain feature and get stuckstill the game has some good aspects that stand out even now
while the graphics are relatively bland there is a lot going on and the game almost never hiccups or loses framerate
the voice acting is above average even for nowadays it must have been spectacular  years ago
its got that rockstar polishthat touch of irreverant humor and good storytelling even if its limited and your character has no personality literallygta was a great and revolutionary game when it came and set the ground for not only sequels but launched a new genre of game
the numerous improvements that have been made over the years though expose a lot of the gliches and problems in this one though
unless you are bound and determined to play all of the gta games like me or have already played them i recommend steering clear of this one and getting one of its successorsbut lets take a look at the whole picture
true the city is huge within its respective townships but all the pedestrians are limited to a few in reality
next the character modeling is okay but far from being great
third the games missions and other things become tedious after the th time that you have done them
even provoking the police gets boring after a while
additionally there was very little storyline or cinematics to provide an actual story
for example the characters exgirlfriend all the sudden becomes a factor on the last mission
i wish there were radio or television broadcasts that would display who or what the character affected
like if you murdered a mafia boss the news would display what you did on television or something
also whats up with npgs all the suddenly disappearing after the missions are completed
thats a cheap tactic for the developers to limit the storyline and make it shallower than it already is
the only thing going for the game is the freedom involved but with all that freedom the game is full of itself
the game doesnt portray the grittiness of the streets
in fact the don of the la cosa nostra wouldnt like this game either
its just too incredibly boring after a while
hopefully games in the future such as the getaway will resolve this inordinate shallowness of grand theft auto doa looks great its graphics are incredibleand if that was all it took to make a great game this would be one however that is not all it takesthere are a lot of moves to learn in this game all of which are nearly useless because by the time youve entered the button sequence your opponent has mashed you into the floor with stupid button smashing rendering all your hard work useless
eventually the player always comes back to simple punch and kick combos making gameplay completly without depththen theres the story and endingshardly any of which have a point or even make a little sensethe only reason i give this two stars instead of one is because its enjoyable to change the female characters cloths and look up their dresses when their throwing high kicksif your a more serious fighting gamer who enjoys utilizing a characters moves and combos go somwhere else doa is almost a  pure button smasherbelieve me nhl k and nhl  totally waste nhl hitz which is so unrealistic
the only good things about this game is the playbyplay announcing the graphics and the great easy controls
hitz is just terrible form there
the gameplay is not the nhl
if you have played nba shwotime you know what i mean
this game is   nhl hockey with terrible gameplay
the computer is so easy to get around they barely check you but it is impossible to score
then on the other end the computer scores right away
i gave up  goals in a mater of  minute
also just like in midways other games when you shoot the puck smoke comes out of it
it is very unrealistic
i still find this game pretty fun though
if you own an xbox dont waste  bucks ont his game and get eas nhl  i thought this would be a good game but midway blew it again
but if you enjoy playing nfl blitz or nba showtime and want some fun buy this gamethis is not i nice controller for a few reasons the first is the buttons areclose together
you dot want to hit the wrong key when you are play a fast paced game
the second and last reason is it doesnt fell to great in your hand
get the mad catz controller like i did for it feels great and the buttons are spaced farther apart to a good distance and they arnt too far scaped itherthe original xbox controller was large awkward amp cumbersome
the poor ergonomic design and the hard to reach positioning of its buttons made the original controller incredibly hard to get used to
fortunately there is an alternative  the xbox type s controller which i have found to be one of the most comfortable and easy to use gamepads out on the marketthis thing is a monster
the controls are awkward and it doesnt feel right
i bought the other controller which is smaller and the buttons are placed better
i try not to use this big monster controller
it makes playing games difficultthe xbox has the worst controller i have ever had the misfortune of using
even the original boxshaped nes controller is more comfortable
the xbox controller appears to be the illegitimate child of a dreamcast controller and a microsoft sidewinder
it is bulky and heavy so large in fact that microsoft had to design a whole new controller for japan
many japanese gamers simply couldnt grip the thing properly
the button layout while pretty is moronic in terms of practicality and the dpad is round so it is very difficult to find specific directions when tapping in things like secret moves in fighting games
the shoulder buttons are clicky and stiff and the other buttons can be hard to reach if you have small hands as most children do
just about the only good thing about the controller is the analogue stick which is only a little less comfortable than the one on the playstation controllerthe controller plug includes a device which allows the plug to pop out of the console easily
this means that if someone trips on the controller cable the console wont be pulled off of its perch and hurled to the floor andor disembowelled
owners will need to be careful not to lose the plug device however because if they do they wont be able to plug the controller into the console
the device is a great feature and one that more consoles could stand to have but it cant redeem such a pathetic piece of hardware as thiswhat about the competition
sony has shown its true confidence in its own triedandtrued hardware designs by adopting the quotif its not broken dont fix itquot attitude towards its controllers
the ps controller is externally identical to the psones dualshock analogue controller with the only modifications being pressuresensitive buttons and a slightly modified force feedback system
and the gamecubes controller is smaller smoother and more comfortablelooking than ever somewhat similar to sonys offering but also very unique
i look forward to trying itthis doesnt mean you shouldnt buy an xbox but it does mean that if you buy another controller for one you should probably look at thirdparty controllers
not many are available at present but i think that that will change after the xbox is releasedto begin this controller is huge
its way to big for me or any of my friends
the stupid xbox symbol in the middle takes half of the space away and thats why the buttons are too close to eachother
also ur right thumb kills when u try to reach for that dpad at the bottom
microsoft did a terrible job
you should get a controll sthis pad is extremley uncomfortalbe
the analog sticks have too much give the main  buttons are too close together and shaped strangleyi much prefer the controller s  which makes up for everything that is wrong with this padi simply do not like this controller
it puts a very difficult strain on both of my wrists to move the thumbs and fingers around to reach these countless buttons not to mention the controller itself is so incredibly thickits thickness is unbelieveably uncomfortable
reminds me of the dreamcast controller with its bizarre design
its true that controllers do take a while to get used to but with something like this i dont think ill ever want to get used to itill stick with a console that doesnt have so many buttons and that fits perfectly in my hands
ill take one of those cheap ripoff controllers over this thingso you bought an xbox and you want some memory
i think years of console experience has ingrained into our heads that we must have a memory card
in the past that has been more than true try having a dreamcast without several
years of pc experience has always made me laugh at console gamers for reasons such as this but that didnt stop me from buying a memory card when i picked up my xbox on nov ththe only thing keeping me from saying quotand boy what a mistake that wasquot is the fact that some day i might actually have a use for the thing
someday i might need to have my information portable
of course i did also buy the custom xbox backpack so i can easily transport my xbox anywhere so why do i really need thisthe xbox has over six gigabytes of hard drive space
it translates that info into memory blocks
when you view your xbox hd memory it only says  blocks
now i own five xbox titles halo doa project gotham fuzion frenzy and amped and all of their saved games are saved to the hard drive
i also have three full music cds copied to the disk and the box still says i have  memory available
dont worry about running out of room on your hard drive
six gigabytes is an enormous amount or spacewhile im sure this is a solid product as far as quality goes it is insanely over priced
now if microsoft would have gone the sega route and made vmus i could see paying  bucks for them because at least then they would have some useif you still really want to own a memory card by an aftermarket one as they are almost half the cost and you really arent going to use it much
trust me for mb of memory
this is unacceptable
mb equates to around  blocks of space for the xbox
 blocks would only hold one splinter cell save there are some games kotor that you cant even save because the file is too big
sure the xbox has a massive hard drive but what about those of us who want to back up our hours of game play in case the xbox has problems and require service
you hard drive will more than likely lose all of your data after it returns from service
what if your hard drive just quits on you one dayif you want to back up your xbox data in case a catastrophe occurs you have two options 
purchase anywhere from    of these little memory units at  a pop 
purchase a bigger memory card like megaxkey or max drive for xbox that hold  times the space for only  more
on top of both of these cards also allow you to moves your xbox saves to your pcs hard drive and even burn them to a cd
because of the included usb to xbox adapter you can connect these to both your pc and xbox this means you can back up all of your savable game files to your pc by only having to buy one memory card
better yet use of these items do not require your xbox to be modded in anyway
after backing up all of my data to my pc i restored them to my xbox and had no problems with the files although the max drive is a little more user friendly and also can go up to mbxboxs are composed of manmade mechanical items that will eventually fail or have problems
no one wants to lose all of their data just because they are unable to back up their stuff
it is too bad microsoft forces their customer to depend on the hard drive only since they do not offer a costeffective efficient method of back up
to add insult to injury they dont even offer bigger memory cards
mb is the largest and only memory card option they havei love my xbox but microsoft really needs to get with the program here and offer bigger memory cards and also an option to back up saved game files
if other companies can do it why cant they
unless you want to carry around a pocketful of these tiny memory cards your best option for back up is something like megaxkey or maxdriveunless you are just using the memory card for saving small game files like rosters or settings then i dont think microsofts memory cards are worth the moneypeople say one of the drawbacks for this game isbecause it is too much like roller coaster tycoon
however i a lover of almost all simulation games and roller coaster tycoon i disliked this game
unless you find the concept exciting do not buy this gameunlike roller coaster tycoon the scenarios are much more boring and broad and after a while for me two or three hours the game became monotanous and boring
it was definately not worth the money and now it is sitting on a quiet dusty shelfalso unlike roller coaster tycoon this game appeals to younger age groups
my friends on  yrs
old loves this game with a passionso to conclude i would only recommend buying this game ifthe idea of building a zoo appeals to youif you are not buying for youself primarily younger people will take an interest in thisyou dont mind a somewhat monotonous game playthis game had potentialbut they never worked out the bugs
i find myself worrying about whether the stupid game is going to crash more than winning it
not only that but you have to start the research projects all over again when the game crasheseven if you saved it
the animals also have issueslike my penguins who after a few months in zoo time froze
i truly was disappointed next time i hope microsoft fixes the game b they release ithowever despite all thisi mastered the game in a few days
maybe i became tired with the game because i never got far enough to unlock the secrets which cannot be done if the game crashes every two secondsfor the first couple days this seemed like the best game in the world
once the initial thrill is gone however it just gets terribly monotonous
there are several gameplay modes but quotbattlequot is the only one youll ever play
yes it is dont argue
seriously straight racing you can do on any car game this ones selling point is the characters interaction with eachother
youll be cracking up when you hear the oneliners being passed arounduntill you notice theyre the same  over and over and then that little green quotmutequot word your tv puts in the corner gets irritatingone thing i will defend on this game is the cartooncel graphics
people complain that the xbox version couldve been more realistic
its supposed to be a cartoon peopleit was my mistake i guess but this game is for the first xbox so it is kind of too old
i wish they would have the same one for the new xboxi rented this one and im glad i did
you might enjoy a rental as well
if you absolutely love the simpsons like me and think theres no way you wouldnt enjoy anything simpsons related come on youve got the first season on dvd dont you
 you will still be disappointed
if you arent convinced i still say rent it just so you are sureit is not as horrible as simpsons wrestling
this game is at least playable
still it never feels like you are driving a car however or any of the other vehicles you supposedly drive
its more like you are just pivoting an arrow on its axis and pushing a button to move forward and backward
no im not expecting a sim experience like project gotham but at least a driving experience like crazy taxiafter you unlock a few levels youll get bored
it becomes even more repetitive than crazy taxi ever did
the most ardent simpsons fanatic might insist on unlocking the relatively large cast of characters and who doesnt want to drive homer as mr plowbut the fun wears off
in a short time youll have heard all the banter of every character and gotten over the fun of driving around a very sparsely detailed springfield
not that all the springfield landmakrs arent there they just look terrible
once youve played halo you expect a little more than buildings that are nearly flat shaded boxes
i hear this looks better on xbox than ps but thats not saying muchi think the development team also made a major mistake trying to make the simpsons a d world
it looks funny
your simpsons heroes dont look right
if you have the first season dvd youve heard in the commentary that the show producers realized early that the d side perspective of faces were so much more expressive than the other views they tried in that first season
a similar view holds for this game
the simpsons road rage would have looked beautiful if done in the style of cel damage
cel damages engine does d but it looks flat like you are watching a cartoon
it is absolutely stunning in that perspective gameplay problems in that title aside
the simpsons road rage would have benefitted greatly just by using a similar engine and graphical feelwhen you finish a level youll be irritated that they couldnt have the real krusty voice give you your rating
instead you get a horrible imitation
youll also wonder why you have to view a loading screen on the xbox no less
to go from the game to your summary screen
crazy taxi on the dreamcast didnt even do thisyoull also realize that the key to unlocking items has nothing to do with your ability to play the game
you just play long enough and youll eventually unlock it all
but it wont matter if you get better at the gamethis is a game unworthy of the xbox
however the simpsons tiein is not too bad
i would suggest renting it for a week and getting your fill of simpsons laughs
hence the two starsi have been a simpsons fanatic for the past  years and am humiliated by this video game
for  thing the simpsons is a great show so it shouldnt have a scummy video game like this one
they must have been on a low budget making the game
here are  good reasons why this game shouldnt have been invented  the graphics are bland their entrances to the car are absurd
hans moleman doing a flip into a car
 the mission mode is unbelieveably sinchy
 they dont even have all of the characters
no patty  selma no julius hibbert no lenny  carl to name a few  the lines get dull  repetitive in  minutes and most of the lines are from old simpsons episodes
 this is just an imitation of some game i forget the name of oh yeah crazy taxi
i rest my casethis game is amusing stupid and wierd
it is a copy of crazy taxi with a lot of stupid extras that make the game even worste
do yourself a favor and do not buy this gamechoppy framerate confusing graphics sluggish controls and its well boring
this doesnt look like an xbox game at all do yourself a favor and stay away from thisthing
there are so many better games on xboxgolden sun looks awesome
it has great graphics and good control
however this was my first real rpg experience and it left a bad taste in my mouth
there is so much dialog in this game that it lost my attention very quickly
just to get through the opening sequence takes about  minutes of dialog
i keep hoping that ill play and play some more and the dialog will get to a managable level but it hasnt yet
if you like to hear little squeaky fake voices and read lots of dialog get this game
if not buy or wait for a not so rpgish game to come outlike the legend of zeldadoom probably had me hooked more than any other computer game even starcraft quake  etc
i still remember spending quite a bit of my computer time back in grade school blasting through episode  map  or episode  map  looking for different secrets and weapons
and when i wasnt doing that i was happily playing multiplayer doom over the internet or downloading different wad levels off various fansites
so when i finally decided to buy doom ii i was overjoyed to own what was supposedly an improved doom
i got the exact oppositefirst the good
the graphics do look a bit cleaner and less pixelated than in the original doom
there are several new enemies at your disposal the dreaded arch viles being possibly the worst as in most annoying to ever grace a computer game
there is a new weapon the doublebarreled shotgun
and the levels this time around are a bit larger and more complex
sounds like an improvement so far albeit very small
so why exactly did i dislike doom iithe levels while more complex just arent as well designed as they were in the original
they tend to get too mazelike in parts more so than in doom  and the enemies seem like they were just randomly placed rather than thoughtfully put into certain parts of a level the way they were in the original doom one minute you would be in a quite hallway the next  chomp
a bulldog demon just came out of nowhere
sadly the best level in the game was imo a bonus level titled wolfenstein
it was sort of a remake of em from the original wolfenstein d
nazis castle textures and everything
but its buried in a slew of horribly frustrating andor boring levels like suburbs and circle of death lion king parody
 or possibly the worst experience ive ever had with an fps  the spirit world
considering the fact that the improvements are so minor do i even need to mention the games feeling of been there done thatso in brief im afraid i just couldnt really get into doom ii
id software foolishly opted not to release a shareware demo for the game which means you had to spend money to play it back in  disappointing since that money would have been much better spent on games like dark forces or the original system shocksoldier of fortune is a breakthrough of violence in the gaming world
but that is all it is
the game uses a heavily modified version of the quake  engine
the characters look somewhat blocky
the worst part of the game is that it is extremely repetitive
you kill person after person after person thats all you do
by the end of the game youll have killed over  people
the story wasnt worth telling and the enemies never get exciting
the difficulty settings were badly designed luckily you can create a custom difficulty setting which i reccomendif you enjoy computer game violence this is for you
youll dissembody every conceiveable body part
youll here men screaming as their skin burns
if you dont care what the violence in games looks like there are many other fpss better than thisfirst let me say that i absolutely loved the first dragon warrior and the last which is part  so why do i dislike part  so much
oh where to startfirst off the graphics and sound are beyond terrible
old school is one thing but there is no need to make this game look and sound like an  bit titleand the playable characters
what a shameach of your  or so playable characters joins your party for no serious reason tags along for  hours and pretty much says  lines of dialogue in those  hours
your characters have the personality of a wooden boardand this game is unnecessarily huge
it took me about  painful hours to complete but couldve easily been reduced to  or sothe reason is that you have to visit almost every single town cave maze and dungeon twice
going through every area  times is not fun and is repetitive beyond beliefand yet another fabled aspect of this game is its huge assortment of playable job classes yet they fail to mention that its brokenthere are dozens of classes that are worthless yet a couple that pretty much make the game a cakewalk thus breaking the game
get yourself  godhands for ultima hit and  teenidol for hustle dance and the entire game is yours to conquerthis game never hit greatest hit status in america and for good reasonas big a dragons quest fan as i am this game was simply dreadful
the plot was lame the characters were weak and there were several dead ends in the gameplay that necessitate starting all the way over from the beginning which wouldnt be too much of a problem except that leveling up is slower than any game ive ever seen where even fighting enemies that are above your current level will take you anywhere from one to two hours to gain a new experience level
as for the dead ends you acquire items that require interaction with different substances and if you put the wrong one in first you cannot remove it and cannot move on
seriously if you want to play a good dragon quest game buy the titles released on the ds or nesit feels like a long rpg made by rpg maker
terrible graphics music from  and rpg maker style battle system with basicaly no story
not worth itreviewers note throughout this review the product is referred to as dragon quest vii and not dragon warrior vii
theyre both the same game but the truth is the series is called dragon quest
so dont get confused
i also refer to the other games in the series as dragon quest and not dragon warriordragon quest is huge in japan
the games actually have to be release on sundays or holidays because of how big they are
the dragon quest games are not nearly as big in america
the other dragon quest games are actually a real treatparticularly the snes games that never made it to the states
dragon quest vii does not hit the height of the nes and snes games in any way shape or form mainly because this game in particularly does nothing to actually make the dragon quest games mature and thats really sad
its great that they got it together for dragon quest viii but it cant stop the seventh in the series from being the black sheep of them allits really sad to because of all the dragon quest games the seventh installment is one of the only ones to have a satisfying storyline where things actually progress and you dont spend a lot of time running around so lost you dont know what to do
its not a deep story by any means but it does have more focus here than other dragon quest games
because of the structure of the story theres not too much you can explore from the get go and thus youre limitedthe first thing about dragon quest vii that people will note is that the game looks absolutely horrible
for a late generation psx game going up against the likes of chrono cross and final fantasy ix at the time this game looks like a rejected super nintendo game and it may be because it was originally in development for that particularly system
the towns look really bad the textures are mostly pixelated the character sprites look horrendous
simply put this is just a terrible looking game
the sound effects are even worse
youll dread each time you have to pick up a barrel and toss it
youll dread opening a door
the games framerate isnt even steady
the only thing to the games graphical credit is that some of the enemies dont look so bad and that its colorful
still even for those who dont base their judgment of a game on graphics will have to take a moment to get used to just how terrible they really arethe second annoying thing is the menu system
its the exact same one that was used in dragon quest vi and its just a pain to navigate
in a world where games like final fantasy vii made navigating the menu as easy chewing food dragon quest vii makes it a tedious task
characters are limited to what they can hold and i dont want to go into the nightmare of equipping and reequipping characters over and over again
the menu interface is absolutely horrible
it seems like such a dumb thing to complain about but in an rpg released on the playstation inventory management shouldnt be so difficult nor should i have to spend more time in the menu than actually exploring a dungeoncombat is also a big problem
its not that battling isnt fun
firstly you dont get into a battle for quite some time
in fact youll spend the first couple of hours of the game roaming around not battling anything
itll be a miracle if some gamers can even hold out that long
especially because its an rpg with little story exposition in the beginning
when you do make it to that point though youll be met with mixed feelings
for some odd reason battling is fun but again the graphics really make you wonder sometimes
the battle system is essentially the same as it was on the nes and snes
the problem here is simple this isnt either of the two systems
i dont mind the combat being menu based but the fact that you dont see your characters and that they dont physically go up and strike the enemy makes battling feel a little empty and uninspired
some of the enemies actually look pretty good but im bothered that the battle engine is exactly the same as dragon quest i from way back when
dragon quest viii certainly did a far better job in at least making their battles look good
here you just feel as if youre not involved enough
its simple and it is fun because the combat is surprisingly deep and strategic
even better the game is a challenge
but all the while you cant help but thinking youre playing an nes game on a system that is capable of so much morethey say itll take you about  hours to plow through dragon quest vii
the game is in fact huge
theres tons of sidequests and just when you think the game is getting stale they do manage to throw something else at you that gets a little more involved in the gameplay
the job system for instance comes along hours after youve begun your quest but it adds a lot of variety when its finally added in there
enough to keep you busy for hours
what a lot of people dont mention about dragon quest vii however is that a lot of those  hours are spent on heavily raising your party to getting better levels and stats
dragon quest is known for making gamers work and dragon quest vii actually does that
for example the game will not let you overpower your characters job classes
theres a point where they do cut you off and you have to advance forward
however youve still go to worry about their normal levels and you dont gain a whole lot of experience or gold from these monsters
thus of the  spent to plow through the game youll more than likely spend more than  hours just leveling up to take on the next challenge
and dragon quest vii is not an easy gamewhile the sound effects are bad the music of the game itself is quite good
dragon quest has always had good music and dragon quest vii is no exception
the game falls short in almost every category except music
heres where the game truly shines and not only that but dragon quest fans will recognize some fantastic tunes from other gamesthe bottom line is simple
is dragon quest vii a good game
the answer is surprisingly yes
you just have to really be able to get passed the fact that youre playing an nes game on a system capable of so much more
simplicity has kept the series alive at least but the game seriously looks like a rejected snes title that they felt they needed to dress up in tattered clothes and shove onto the playstation
the game isnt bad its just that by the time dragon quest reached the seventh installment one has to wonder why the developers didnt actually make it look or play like a playstation rpgif you can look past the nes appeal dragon quest vii is a great game
its fun to battle in despite its graphics
there are tons of minigames and sidequests to do and theres so much variety that youll want to play just for the sheer fact that you know you havent uncovered anything
still the old school nature of this game is going to be hard to swallow even for old school gamers
the game is slow the menu system is horrible the graphics are subpar the battles feel like youre doing nothing
with these kinds of cons taunting the game its hard to recommend it even to die hard dragon quest fans
fun to play but its asking a lot gamers to look past its glaring shortcomingslet me start by saying that i rented this title rather than paying the money to buy it and i believe i made the right choice
max payne is a very frustrating game that gives gamers a headache
average graphics average gameplay and horrible control
game play becomes a very challenging task since one analog stick is for moving and the other is for aiming
put it this way for the hours that i spent playing this title i could never grasp the controls perfectly
overall i recommend renting first to see if you like itthis game is hard i cant finish it if it was easier i would have given it more starsmax payne rocks
the pc version was terrific the xbox port was even better
but n comparison to pc and xbox ps is bad when it comes to the latest technology in graphics especially memory and polygon capabilities
it results awful gameplay a lot worse graphics in the ps version  bullet time isnt as cinematic and actually looks cheap framerate problems  its choppy its laggy and overall the game feels terrible savegame feature is stupid  in the xbox and the pc versions you can make a quick save whenever you want except some higher difficulty levels have limited saves but in ps you need to get checkpoints the oldfashioned way another example of ps weakness  loading times are long and while the pc max payne had only one quite brief load at each level in the ps port that level would be divided into like  parts each part would have to load almost twice as long as the start of every level in the pc original this causes interruption in the action and storytellingso if you have a relatively new powerful pc or an xbox get max payne for either one of the systems if you have a ps dont even bother buying this porti had high hopes on this game but i was disapointed
the controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout  was bad
the story line was basically typical it really didnt hold my interest for long
i did beat the game because i spent  on it the day it came out and i figured i would at least do that
i gave the game to a friend of mine after i beat it and he had the same opinion as i did
its worth renting but definately not worth buying
hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controlsi feel like i played a different game from the rest of these reviewers
i made it into the early missions of the second part before i couldnt take the abysmal design flaws anymore
its disappointing considering how good the story and atmosphere of the game areplenty has been said about the positive so ill lay out the games many flaws in more detail than ive seen in many of the negative reviews here  lack of precision digital controls if youre a gamer you probably know that most games utilizing a joystick pretty much every game made in the past  years allow you to change movement speed based on how far the stick is pressed
for instance ever since mario  pushing the stick a little bit forward allowed the player to move slowly sneaking past unsuspecting enemies or gaining more precise movement over treacherous terrain
pushing the stick all the way forward allows the player to run
sometimes theres other increments in the middle sneak  walk  run
max payne does not have this feature
if the game detects movement of the joystick you set off in a wild sprint
usually this isnt an issue tact and stealth seem to be words alien to payne but in a few areas your character must walk along narrow walkways
a slight tilt on the joystick will send max tumbling to his death
considering the era in which the game was made long after the release of mario  the lack of precision controls is almost inexcusable especially when precision movement is expected  abysmal ai making lifelike enemies has always been a challenge for game companies
theres always some obstacle or unforeseen circumstance that the ai has no script to compensate for
yet it feels like the ai for max payne consists of a few lines that say point your gun in the players general direction and shoot
enemies will repeatedly try to fire at you from behind walls or run one by one into your line of fire like a duck shoot
later enemies will throw a grenade then stand there while waiting for it to explode
of course the developer compensated for poor quality by putting in a lot of enemies
the worst issue i found however and the one that actually made me turn off the game in disgust is the ais ability to detect the player
a certain mission early in the second part has max unarmed with the exception of a baseball bat
he says that the best course of action is to play hideandseek with the enemies
only problem is if you use the games third person view to look around a corner at a group of enemies they will immediately detect you even if youre several feet outside of their line of sight and come running also apparently calling the rest of the enemies in the area
there is no excuse for this  dull repetitious game play i guess im not the best judge of this as a fan of jrpgs but the lack of depth in enemy ai and the emphasis on runandgun game play makes every level feel dull and repetitive
most opponents can be overcome by following the same one or two strategies and the huge abundance of ammo means that youll never find yourself needing to conserve your better weapons
ill admit that the opening of chapter two was refreshingly different but consisted of a long segment involving precision controls see issue  and the aforementioned part with the baseball bat issue ive heard that the second game improves on the mechanics of the first so im willing to give it a shot but i couldnt play anymore of this onethis game had a cool feature bullet time game motion
basically a slow motion system that allows a pseudomatrix style game play for a few brief seconds
apparently they thought that such a gimmick could sell a game
unfortunately thousands of people fell for it
the only real revolutionary aspects of this game are the new heights of tedium that this game inducesthis game starts off with a story consisting of a comic page animation eg
mostly still cheaply made with what apparently was an english major desperately trying to use big words and a raspy voice in order to sound sophisticated deep and dark
this fails miserably and the darn thing never stops
then there is the game
you can only save at the start of sublevels which automatically brings it down two notchesthe game basically is a sequence where you turn a corner wait for the slow bad guy shoot try to open a door then try another enter wait shoot and on and on until you hit a save point
thats it
the first level is fine but the second level gets you
the controls are clunky and shooting is jerky and unresponsive
bullet damage is seemingly random
sometimes you shoot a guy point blank with a shotgun and hes barely touched
you shoot a guy fifty feet away with a handgun and he might go down for no reasonthe first level is almost fun since you might die to the randomness but youll have to repeat the killing of one or two guys again
the second level you sometimes have to face up to  guys
its no fun when the th guy at  feet away and out of sight shoots you in with a handgun and destroys all your health
and it takes forever to return the same place beforehand
the producers apparently couldnt differentiate between needless waiting and stealth
by the middle of the game i was so frustrated by the repeating waiting random deaths i just turned it off and sold the game immediately
i have never gone that far in a game and not finished it
just totally frustratingthe best way to describe this game is like the noncar missions of grand theft auto without the fun
i know why this is called max payne now
it hurtslets freely admit it
profess it
the future is here
technical advancements are screening throughout the world and not im not rambling about nanomachines or emigrational space travel im aimed at the gaming industry note the capitalization
oh yeah its that huge
face it the gba  in all its rights  comprises extraordinary brilliance
many deemed tekkens conversion on  the gba to be an ungodly fighter and get this you can bite down on your pillow now they were absolutely positively on que
bashed in it are horrendous moments of frustration
okay so the greatest future isnt actually here and by the effort of namco gaming is not at its finestno tekken advance is not a revival of the tekken paradise but it thrashes mortal kombat in every direction
with gba limitations the leap from the massive d environments to d was namcos hardship
the gba tries its best to capture the essence of tekken and crashes
consisting of only  lousy fighters the controls on each character have obviously been tweaked into a condensed format
single punch kick throw and tag buttons are dished up on a skyrocketing discomfort level
because of the lost of the essential control scheme the moves list was trimmed down to simplified sluggish combos
worst the ai is a recurring challenge and heavy with bevy combos
missing the intensity of a hardcore fighter the repeated combojumble fighting proves to be nothing more than a disgrace
on a happier note the reason for that extra star the controls are extremely responsive and the directional pad is just as splendid letting players easily walk dart hop and backpedal
on the whole the gameplay tries to deliver an adequate amount of mayhem
easily unraveled by the range of modes from previous installments such as the arcade survival and tag battle this repulsive remake deserves no credit because this one was never meant to begraphically tekken advance looks to be infected with a deadly case of visual disgust
look at this thing it keeps a doleful cast of prerendered fighters who have faces of callousness
the colorful backgrounds are ruined by jerky animation and smudged texturing
even when combos go athunderingin the graphics transform into a squalid pigpen
tekken advance by screenshots appeared to have taken complete usage of the gbas full capacity but is nowhere linked to the mighty emphasis of past games
tenements of the franchise strictly belong to the console market and namco falls extremely short to do justice on their handheld attempt
mark my words d fighters belong on specialized d formats  otherwise known as the ps gamecube or xboxthis game is extremely boring
the graphics arent really that great there are practically no sounds all you do is hit things with weapons and get their stuff and do it over again i get no fun out of it whatsoever
this game would be nowhere without eqdo not think i am biased to eq i do not play it it basically got all its ideas from it and added a little more
to me it is just a total eq clone it would have never been created without the thoughts and ideas eq had
my advice if you dont like plain old ordinary rpg games like this one is to wait for shadowbane to come outwell to start with i have a level  paladin and several other characters in the s so thats where this point of view comes fromnow on to the flamingwhen you first start playing this game and the world is new it really seems like the holy grail of online rpgs
the first  levels or so new skills come fast and the expierience treadmill is pretty easy to put up with
there are also an abundunce of quests to do pre level  that actually give decent rewards especially if youre playing your first character and have no cashitems to twink with
the world looks nice the character models arent bad not great but not bad all in all a pretty good looking gamenow warp to post level  play and the shallow nature of the game and inherant problems start to loom larger and largerjust because i like lists ill make one  questskill tasks good exp go find mob x and kill it sort of things pretty much go away
the level treadmill starts tilting at a steeper incline
you begin to notice you dont get new abilites just version  of the spell or ability you got at level   hmmmmmmm by this time youve probably run the length of the realm youre in and the world is starting to get smaller
content problemsthere just arent many places to go and the places there are to go are small and overcrowdednow lets warp to post ish play and what is touted as one of the big features of daocrealm vs realm combat
pve content has become almost non existantthere is currently one dungeon you can go in and everyone and their brothersister is there
next patch is adding epic zones so well see  realm vs realm rvr from this point on is hopelessly imbalanced and just plain bugged
i wont go into detail but there are some huge game stopping issues that dont seem to be getting fixed
also its entirely based on level and i mean that
a level  chimpanzee banging on the keyboard will defeat a level  highly skilled pvp player
level is everything and i mean everything in this game
player skill is non existant
so back to the level treadmilsee  and repeat this cycleso thats the short listthe pve content is almost non existant and the rvr combat that youve worked so hard to level for turns out to be one of the worst implementations of pvp in gaming historynot so hotyoull love this game at first i certainly did but boy does it get old fast
very short shelf life on this one will be a blip in online history  years from nowwhile i have never enjoyed overly linear games ie legends of dragoon for ps i cant imagine how one stays interested in such an openended and bland game ok ok sometimes it is fun just to roam but i feel like im in the sahara without a compass when im playing the game
no doubt that the graphics are beautiful but the story is basically nonexistent the whole game is just a thousand side quests no exaggeration
such great potential for interaction exists but there are no characters that you develop interesting relationships with you just make friends or make enemies and later they forget if theyve even met you
plus the game is either way too easy or way too tedious tons of big weapons and tons of annoying and boring enemies
the battle system is just sitting there hitting the swing button seriously besides some use of magic its like a bad baseball game
plus the worst is the crashing of the game im far along though i only play because i hate not finishing a game and this thing crashes a lot
someone should sue the maker for such shoddy productionif you own any other system buy any other rpg it is not even worth the  price
if you only have an xbox and want an rpg you areumm to put it politely out of luck
which is sad i own a ps and my roommate owns an xbox and i think the xbox would be the better system if they made anything except halo copiesideally i think the perfect adventure gaming experience is an environment practically as diverse as reality while far more fantastical and allowing the stretching of a logical framework that is the bread and butter of our daily life
this may be a technological impossibility but it does lead to some interesting contrasts with the constant appeal of occult and religious beliefs
maybe satisfying gaming is a substitute for the samebut in continuing the analogy that means morrowind is a poor illusion
it aims for what we want in a good rpg a departure from a tightly scripted path that is the only flaw in a far superior game like final fantasy
it tries to do though what it cant pull off and the end result is more tedious and mundane than liberating
yes there is a lot you can do and you can do it usually when youd like but it isnt much fun which makes me wonder if the true scriptless rpg will ever be here on the console
maybe a fantastical story does need plot more like a novel than a life
add the narrative flaw to a poor combat system and xbox still doesnt have a great rpg though more efforts are on the way
wait for themi thought after watching multipul videos about this and skyrim that these would be the greatest games ever
 i was wrong i played this and skyrim once
never again
never
againperhaps my attention span is shriveling up from the action genre of pc games but i just couldnt sit still for this game
this could be a fabulous game playing experience but ill never know
i couldnt get through the first boring hour in morrowind
can my character move any slower
i ran everywhere then had to stop to restore fatigue
this may indeed be the gaming experience of someones life and the storyline open ended gameplay and graphics do suggest that
i just think i have been forever spoiled by the likes of more exciting games like nolf system shock  deus ex tr thief halflife unreal avp etc
if i wanted mellow id read a bookin a previous review of this product i railed against what i thought was a bit of a lie on the part of the manufacturer
hailed throughout the industry as a model of openended play morrowind i thought had a surprisingly linear ending
that being a fairly important issue i decided to devote a whole review to it
but theres more to bethesdas new babyor rather theres more to warn you aboutif you like quests youll love the core game play itself
but soon enough i think youll find many of these quests so much busywork
worse some of them paint inconsistent pictures of the characters you meet  one minute they behave as benefactors the next theyre basically asking you to steal or murder
truth is theres not a lot of plotdriven logic to most of these quests
while they do gradually reveal the mystery of the main quest to your character in a moreorless satisfying waythey dont particularly make sense from the perspective of the characters that order you around
take the mages guild as an example
according to the rules of the guild youre not supposed to steal from a fellow mage
but several quests revolve around you doing just that
you fail the quest and get kicked out of the guild if the theft occurs in plain sight
but if you carry it out covertly youre golden
theft only matters it seems if others are watchingif youre into exploring the world of a game morrowind does a better job than just about any game out there of letting you go anywhere and rewarding you for your curiosity
youll love finding little towns and all the small stories happening against the backdrop of the overarching main quest
youll probably be amazed the first time you see day dusk into night or the way rain grows from a sprinkle to a thunderous downpour
the weathertime module is probably the most advanced on the market and youll simply marvel at how precisely the developers have caught the suns progress over the course of a day
indeed this more than any other aspect is probably what will keep you playing
but all this is not without its price
the extreme intricacy of the environment combined with the detailed growth your character is undergoing leads to a very buggy game
its just too much stuff somehow
ive never had a game that so regularly crashes my xbox
yeah
you heard that right  crashes
this game does everything from completely freezing up during an intense fight to stopping in the middle of saving a game ouch
 to randomly bouncing back to the opening xbox title screen
there is it seems a price for being the most ambitious title ever releasedand you get charged that price not only in crashes but in errors throughout
heres a partial list of bugs ive encountered spelling errors everywhere
this game relies on text
the developers shouldve relied on a spell checking program and several copy editors
 movement errors at random times
my character gets stuck all the time
that is she behaves as if theres something blocking her progress
when i switch to the thirdperson perspective its obvious theres nothing that should be holding her up
shes just stuck and the only solution is reloading the last saved game
items magically duplicate themselves in your inventory
the bestworst example of this is with some of the items that make potions
i had a particularly expensive item that would grow every time i selected it
at last count i had over  of these items in my inventory and theres no sign that the bug has an upper limit
since these items are worth about  gold each ive basically found an endless supply of money thereby crashing the economy of the game
 a hopelessly disorganized inventory
once you get to the point you can carry say hundreds of potions youll know how frustrating it is to try to find one of them
theyre not alphabetized
theyre not sortable according to any quality
theyre just in the order theyre in
trying to find a potion can break the flow of an otherwise adrenalinerushing fight
 framerate sometimes sucks
oh how it sucks
get into a fight with multiple magiccasters and youll see what i mean
even on the xbox which can handle complex fights well morrowind can sometimes unintentionally slip into serious slomobottom line  dont buy this version of the game thinking youre going to escape the bugs that are rampant in the pc version
its buggy regardless of platformbut  the games biggest failing to me is the inability to play more than one character  at a time
im not really talking about the lack of multiplayer
no i mean that you cant have more than one player in any one game state
many other rpgs allow you exit one character and bring up another in the same game state allowing you to experiment with different character types without losing your basic progress towards the accomplishment of the games goals
here once youve picked your character you have to play it to the end
given the length of time it takes to finish this game most people will  therefore only scratch the surface of game play
if you find midway through the game that youd like to switch from being a hackandslash barbarian to a potionmaking magic user youre out of luck
youd actually have to start a brand new game to do so
and most people just dont have the time to start overin sum then morrowind is a fascinating if deeply flawed title
i so desperately want to like it that ive written two reviews of it
but at the end of the day i feel like ive just wasted more time than ive enjoyed
at most its worth renting for a week to see what all the fuss is aboutmicrosofts amped is a mediocre game with flawed physics and awkward controls
the gameplay is centered around being free to go anywhere you please but i never truly felt free at all
though you are able to ride around everywhere i still felt that i was set on a predetermined path and trying to change course was more difficult than it should have been
the controls for doing grabs are mapped out onto the right thumbpad leading to unneeded falls
the trick system is very basic and every character has the exact same grabs and tricks
the trick system feels extremely linear and leaves no room for experimentation
when i first bought amped i was expecting a snowboarding game based on realism but i soon found out that amped is not realistic at all and ssx tricky also on xbox is easily a much better game
though not bad amped cannot contend with games like ssx tricky on the market
amped should be sitting in a bargain bin instead of in a gamers collectionput harry potter in gauntlet legends and give him a talking tinker bell in a bottle and youve got night caster
theres no real plot except get through the levels
until you get to the end of the game the spells stinkand all the while villagers and an irish miss cleo are whining at you
the graphics have no detail which makes the game look like it is a  game
like most xbox games its not long but everything along the way will annoy you
better for younger playersits almost painful to see a game with this much potential fail so miserably
the premise is superb  a lone mage fighting hordes of enemies with a wide variety of spells
unfortunately the controls and gameplay kill this promising concept
switching between the different spells that you need is cumbersome and you can only save in designated spots
the graphics are probably the only redeeming features as the spell effects are impressive and it is interesting to watch arran age over the course of the game from a young boy into an old wise wizardoverall i can only recommend this game if you are a serious fan of spellcastingbased games and if you can get a cheap purchaserental priceim a big fan of rpgs especially those involving magic
i was disappointed with nightcaster though and recommend this as a rentfirst game for the xboxfirst to be fair the good points
nightcaster has a cool spell concept
you draw from four different types of spells using a glowy floating orb to direct your attacks
there are different spells in each class  from fire and water light and darkness
enemies are resistant to some sorts of spells vulnerable to othersthe graphics are ok a reasonable level of detail is found as you wander through countryside and towns in your quest to rid the world of evilbut the gameplay in general just isnt there
youre a young boy who is lured by a glowing orb into abandoning your parents and home without even telling them for many years to train to defeat a future evil
when youre finally released you find your village in flames and your parents dead
your sympathetic orb goes jeez time to take revenge
and despite those many years of training the spells you cast are pretty feeblethe game has very much a gauntlettype feel destroying monster generators and working through a linear path
however the monsters are not threatening at all and theres no multiplayer
the great fun of gauntlet a game i love is the multiplayer mayhem and amazing party potential when you get some friends over
in comparison nightcaster is a solo trek through dungeon  after dungeon  after dungeonin its defense nightcaster was one of the first xbox games out and maybe was rushed to meet the release date
definitely a game to rent first before you buyboring
this game has nothing to rave over and alot to dispise
rent it before buying or you will be disappointed in losing  buckssome reviewers loved all balders gaterelated phenomena i personally thought the story was shallow and lacked anything to really define motivation
ostensibly to let the player be the character your character instead comes across as a vapid individual who has no personality or real lines
some people liked the twist of getting caught up in a plot with magi and demons but i found it more like an accident and never felt a compelling reason to continue beyond i havent beaten the game yet
castle of the winds a nowfreeware game for windows  did a better job of getting an adventurer to set out on a dangerous queststory if youve played ps or pslaunch titles youre not far from what youll see here
the scenery looks nice but character models are unimaginative and relatively bland
while your appearance changes based on armor its not a drastic change and the benefits of new equipment arent much different than a new coat of paint
the camera is fixed at a slightly offset topdown that generally doesnt hide obstacles but also doesnt give you a satisfying way to navigate
the lack of differentiation between noninteractive terrain dressing and potentially useful objects like item boxes is also unhelpful
not terrible but the lack of distinction brought the score downgraphics unexceptional sounds at best some were annoying
volume cant be controlled ingame and the voicing ranged from bad rivaling cheap kungfu dubs to modestly compelling with most of it being unimaginative and repetitive  particularly the shops who wont shut up while youre trying to shopsound little actually stood out but after having been through soundtracks like hackgu
or ace combat  i expect music that wont be missed in an empty elevatormusic a very basic dungeon crawler i feel that calling it a hackandslash does a disservice to action games like gauntlet ordynasty warriors strikeforcethat do that subgenre justice
enemies are difficult  you may like or dislike this  but they dont respawn so if you want to practice or level grind you have to save character data and start a new game then import
random drops and inconsistent ability  enemies tended to hit every swing even if they werent at optimal range whereas everything from bows to great swords to daggers had a tendency to miss  not dodged but simply doing nothing
the fact that everything has a single swing as its whole moveset was especially disappointing at least gauntlet had reversestrokes instead of the same chop time after timegameplay you can import character data into any game load that you please but as awkward as the game felt to play through in the first place and as miniscule as the benefits of revisiting an area are especially with the steps you have to take i just cant in good conscience recommend this when there are so many other games that actually let you have fun throughout and then games like ratchet  clank let you cruise back through the story with all the goodies you earnedreplayability if youre a hardcore dungeon crawler fan and think getting a stained cotton shirt  is the greatest thing in gaming then this game will suit your collection
if you prefer characters with more depth than cardboard cutouts tryhack gu vol redemptionif you like weapons and magic with nifty utility as well as flashy combat effectiveness trygolden sun
unfortunately nothing in this game really earns a special mention
its a bargainbin purchase but not quite worth bargainbin prices unless youre a particularly avid dungeon crawler fanoverall i beat it in  hrs and i was taking my precious time
its a great game but so short it wasnt worth the money
it was about as long as i would expect the demo to be
the ending is lame it an advertisement for the next game
a to be continued
its an outrage
grrrrr i was extremly disappointed in how short they cut this game up in order to sell the next
i will not buy the sequel
itll be a waste of money
to be continuedthis game is disappointing because the graphics are sooo blurrrry if it was sharper and more detailed graphics it might be enjoyable butit is noti bought these games need for speed underground and underground  because i wanted to play race games on gamecube as there were very few available for game cubei have played midnight club race games on ps and these are much better choices than need for speed gamesluigis mansion is one of the gamecube oldies
most everyone who ended up reserving a gamecube reserved luigis mansion as welloopsluigis mansion is so incredibly whats the word oh yeah stupidyou start out with a plot line that you have won a haunted mansion in a contest you never entered
you encounter a ghost and some crazy guy sucks it up with a poltergust  a vacume cleaner you then must rescue mario from the mansion and thats when it gets exciting for the one timewhats the gameplay like
well you need to suck up ghosts
first you need to shine a light on them to freeze them then press l and pull back on the control stick to suck them up
but the drop bombs down and you go into them and you lose health and the ghosts
its horrible how you cannot control the way you go
second more ghosts pop out and hurt you and you cant do anything about that either
you would not beleive how stupid the entire thing is
the entire game revolves around pressing l and holding the cstick down
short mini games involve you the size of a peanut againts ghosts x your size
also during gameplay the dumbest things let you get furthur
what does sucking in a peice of paper have to do with letting  boos come out of a sewer
speaking of boos you need to capture  of them
they are virtually all the same and by ghost  you are saying whats the point of this
they travel through the walls and you need to capture them by going into a different room
once i was stuck for  minutes in a hallway chasing a boo from room to room
boooooring
you also lose health for opening doors having mice touch you and you virtually are dead after  touches by a ghosts plus  everytime it shoots out a bomb at you
the gameplay gets a now i know i sound like the old men from a tv
show complaining about everything but i cant complain about this
despite the awful gameplay the graphics will blow you away
everything is in d and makes it look great
ghosts have perfect transparentry and the physics are perfect
if you try to suck up a cloth it will respond to how hard you pressing the button where you are and how much your moving back
its amazing
the graphics get a  but dont count on it to help this games gradethe sound is neutral
i cant complain but i cant praise
the ghosts basically all make the same chattery laughter and the boos have the exact safe sfx for all of them
the sound gets a  but im being generous to the fact that it was one of the first games from gamecubespeeds ok its not like madden  thank god but its superfast
there is loading time but its not annoyingly slow
speed gets a controls are decent except for one part
the y button helps you see what can kill a ghost but its so slow by the time you know what it is it bumps into you and you lose major health
you also have to pull the control stick in the opposite direction which is very difficult because it seems to change while you are holding it
you will know what i mean if you foolishly purchase this game
controls get a whats this replay value you speak of
ls mansion has no replay value
whats the point of doing it again
its gonna be exactly the same everytime
im not joking when i give the replay value a 
you beat it end of story
whats more to dobasically if you want a game that will frustrate and waste your time and your hardearned  buy luigis mansion
case closedlets reviewgameplay graphics sound speed controls replay value total  giving luigis mansion a  my lowest review everam i forgetting something
oh yeah
i always add points for cheats on games
right so now instead of a  im gonna give it the appropriate amount of points for cheats leaving luigis mansion new total to be 
woohoohopefully this isnt the new standard of nintendo games
this was short and boring albeit pretty
i dont know why anyone would want to play it once let alone twicethis game doesnt compare to the other mario games
although the story sounds cool there just isnt much exitement in sucking up ghosts with a vacuum cleaner
its very monotonous there arent really any different places to go and although the ghosts vary in color and shape they all basically work the same
its more frustrating than challenging
i dont know  the areas and ghostsucking may not bore you like it bored me
perhaps one of the few good sides to this game is that its interesting and unique
but the game play is definatly missing something
koopas maybewhat can i say
this game is boring
yeah that sounds right childish
very much so
balenced too well
yes
very much so
quotluigis mansionquot plays out like this in all the same ordergo into a roomsuck up gousts into your vacume cleaner 
find the keygo unlock the next roomrepeatnow go directly to jail
do not pass go
do not collect  dollers
even though  will buy you your gamecube this game will not take off your ming off the spent money with entertainment
honestly i cant come up with any reason why anyone would want to spend  hours sucking up gousts and then not play the game again
there is no real ending and the game ends once you figure out that the game is getting boring
rent only
unless your of the hardcore type and must own everything that is marioi skipped renting or owning this game because its only an hour long
i did not like what i saw when i played it in store so i decided to never play the game again
overall its just not nintendos best effort and is clearly a launch title that was rushed in the end so it could drop in stores the day the system didfirst off i would like to say i give this game a   not a  you cant choose s on ratings second off before you even you read my review i just want to make one thing clear dont buy this game
let me emphesis buy
i mean do not purchase this game for keeps
i would reccomend renting it or possibly playing it at some other kids housethis concept of quotpikminquot is amazing
its a cross between warcraft and kirby  you control an army of tiny little red blue and yellow creatures while you lead them across vast and magical places
youre ship has crashed and with the help of your pikmin to find missing parts you can come home againwhats so horrible about this game
it has every element of difficultyyou are timed and to make matters worse you must do entire missions over if you dont succeed
once it has been  hours which is more like  mins in pikmin land you must get all of your pikmin back in the spaceship
if you dont you lose themyour pikmin are stupumoh yeahid this one time i had a grub dog a monster in the pikmin world eat  of my pikmin
i told them to get a part so they did
then on the way back they walked right into a grub dog
i couldve named at least  alternate routes
he woke up and started eating all the pikmin
they didnt fight back right away and i had to tell them too
second red and yellow pikmin who cannot swim only blue can will constantly fall into the water
its almost funny how dumb they are when you watch them just walk in the wateryour pikmin dont exactly follow orders
i will by walking along and all of a sudden they will decide theyll going to attack a flower that hasnt bloomed
which works againts you because bloomed flowers provide more pikmin or once i saw  of them run off to attack a baby grub dog who were all immediatly killedreplay  wrong
once you played it you played it
i wouldnt spend hours playing the exact same thing i played before would youlastly by the third level the enemies are x stronger
they will things on fire and the mindless pikmin will just go into itrenting it fine
go ahead
youll some fun
buying only if you plan you get rid of it in a weekdont get this game its very boreing and slow its inovative but just not goot at all thank god i rented this game its not worth  bucks go get luigis mansion pikmin is not worth renting  timesgameplay sure it may be innovative and fun at first but thats just it its only fun at first
very innovative though
this game is like nothing else ive ever seen
you collect these little guys that hatch out of a thing called an onion and use them to help fight big monster things while look for parts to your ship
there are  parts and you have  days i think
different colored pikmin have different powers and the such making you have to think for a second and only a secondstory very uh different story
im pretty sure that no other game has used this story
you crashon aplanet that is inhabited by little things called pikmin that come out of things called onions
you have to find the parts of your ship and the pikmin help you
thats about it
intriguing isnt itgraphics the pikmin are plain looking and have no detail
just plain d barely better then n graphicsreplay value i played through it within the first  days of my rent and didnt touch it again after
thats about itthis game is weird and frustrating
the gameplay is so stupid
you run around making a bunch of weird creatures called pikmin do all the work
the rest of the time you spend is solving uncreative puzzles fighting enemies that will probably kill you and trying to get more pikmin
this game has no business being called one of the best games on gamecube no business at allgood things nice graphics and sound not greatbad things simply put stupid gameplay boring puzzle solving frustrating andor boring overall over a dozen nitpicks and minor problems that all add uppresentation it certainly doesnt make you too excited to play the gamegraphics graphics are proficientsound decent sound to go with nice graphicsgameplay unbeleivably boring stupid and frustratinginnovation sure its unique and new but can something that sucks so much really get a high score in innovationreplay value i wouldnt even rent this gameoverall like most brandnew series started from present it sucksive played all of our gamecube games with my kids at one time or another but this one just escapes me
i dont really see a point to it other than pushing hitting shocking and kicking the other player in the game which usually raises their ire and they end up pushing hitting and kicking each other outside of the game tooi prefer games like the incredibles and the star wars lego game that has the two players cooperating in the game instead of competing with each other
i dont mind competition but this is just like a kids version of street fighter or mortal kombat i thinkif i would have known before hand what this game was like i would not have purchased itoriginally penciled in as a late addition to the ns library eternal darkness was eventually shifted over to the freshly born gc where it was meant to be the first of many maturethemed first party titles brought to the system
looking back over the years that have come and gone since that string of adultleaning npublished games never really came to be and the cube faltered in a similar fashion to its immediate predecessor
but this is now and for darkness that was then
the birth of a new console meant an opportunity for a clean slate and instant anticipationthe storyline revolves around a blondehaired blue eyed athletic woman named alexandra roivas
constantly haunted by dreams of the undead shes awakened late one night by a telephone call that informs her of her grandfathers brutal untimely demise
as the mans only living relative shes asked to meet with police about the situation and quickly finds herself drawn into the web of magick satanism and otherworldly struggles that had defined her late relatives life
the entire story effectively transpires on the grounds of the old mans mansion which isnt nearly as dull and repetitive as youd think thanks to the inclusion of a single intuitive plot device
hidden among her deceased patriarchs things alexandra discovers the necronomicon a book bound in human flesh that holds the secrets of her familys legacy and the majority of the games variety
most of the books pages have been torn out and scattered throughout the mansion naturally but upon discovering a new chapter alexandra will dive right in  somewhat literally
each new set of pages tells the story of a different character and his or her interactions with the book itself and as alexandra reads youll take control of that character playing your way through their tale
as such eternal darkness feels more like a series of intertwined short stories than a single gamespanning epic a welcome change of pace 
whats more it allows players to travel unbound throughout time and space adventuring through a roman war expedition one chapter conquering an indiana jones style aztec temple the next without the need for a silly outofplace object like a time machine or worsetruly there are a lot of really good ideas at play here
i loved the idea of playing the role of an th century noble with medical aspirations performing rudimentary autopsies on the bodies of demons after a battle
the suggestion of a steep tower of corpses a sacrifice to an ancient forgotten god is an amazing mental image
even the continued use of the book itself as a means to explain alexandras growth as a character and a magician was extremely wellconcepted
upon reading in explicit detail about a distant relatives discovery of a magical spell its only natural to assume shed have a fairly good understanding of how to go about casting it herself
imagination most definitely isnt the weak spot in sanitys requiem its the execution and realization of those ideas that bothers metake the system of magic for example what shouldve been one of the most important aspects of the game
the idea is that there are three distinct pools of magical energy a red pool a green pool and a blue pool that simultaneously have power over one color while falling victim to the other
green is stronger than red for instance while blue overcome green and red conquers blue
its a brilliantly simple idea but one that falls flat due to being underexplained and overly detailed
youll know that the boss youre fighting is using a green special attack and that you should be counterattacking with a blue assault but exactly which spell you should be using is only revealed through an abysmal series of trialanderror kamikaze strikes
even then half the time you arent casting at the right time or youre not standing in the right place or the boss has shifted to another form
if i had a dime for every time i had to resort to an online faq after reaching the point of frustration during this game id be able to buy a replacement copy and hurl the original into the wall frisbee style as stress reliefits this maddening sense of frustration and helplessness that really strikes the most damning blow to my overall opinion of the game
after a halfdozen hours or so of gameplay youll be so utterly defeated and annoyed that your motivation to continue will begin to pay a heavy toll
as alexandra learns more and more about whats going on with her heritage and what was really behind her grandfathers murder youll find yourself actually comprehending less and less
its a problem i had with what was formerly one of my favorite comic books hellblazer a year or two ago because the story is supernatural and underworldly in setting the writers assume that the solutions to problems dont necessarily need to make sense so long as they sound spooky and look coolmuch of the gameplay is in keeping with that same ongoing trend stupendous ideas lame execution
probably the most unique element of the game is its fright meter which slowly drains as the onscreen individual sees freakier and freakier things
i know id be a little weirded out if a rotting hunk of meat and bones suddenly climbed out of the wall and started lurching toward me were conditioned to expect our heroes to immediately continue their quest without missing a beat so it adds a new dimension to the proceedings when you realize that video game characters can get scared too
if your fright meter gets too low youll even start to experience some hallucinations and socalled horror effects which are a real blast and range from the minute to the absurdly out of place
sometimes youll see something moving in the corner of the room other times youll actually foresee your own death but the hallucinations will always subside at some point
they dont move the plot along like the amusing asides in the original metal gear solid did and only seem to exist to provide a few extra holy crap heartskipping moments
which is par for the course with a horror game ill concedegameplay in general is fairly slowpaced and monotonous with few actionheavy sequences and a whole lot of aimless wandering and exploring
even the boss battles are usually relegated to long sessions of striking wandering around avoiding attacks for a few minutes and then striking again like a hilariously slow chase scene
for a game thats so overflowing with narrow corridors doorways and exquisite surroundings youd think that collision detection with the walls wouldnt be such a handicap but in darkness it quickly becomes your worst enemy
if your weapon should happen to strike a wall in mid swing your character will immediately halt their attack and stumble backwards for a few moments giving your enemies all the time they need to tear you to pieces
attempting to fight a single enemy in a hallway is often like threading a needle youll miss half a dozen times before you get it rightin the same vein as the resident evil series the teenaged bonding moments that are used to fill out a blockbuster horror film are replaced here with a series of riddles puzzles and tricks
i expected as much but couldnt have anticipated how easy and linear most of darknesss riddles really are
with only a few exceptions every item is miraculously found just before its needed to the point that the pieces basically solve the games problems for you
if you find a statue chances are good youll find a peculiar statueshaped hole in the next roometernal darkness visuals have aged even worse than the rest of the title and im not entirely sure they were ever really up to snuff
sure theres always the argument that these graphics were stunning when they first came out but i didnt play this game when it was first released and even though its just four years old today they look extremely shoddy
human skin textures are particularly bad and lumpy but even the environments and items suffer from weak textures and a ragged blocky basic structure
the one exception to this rule is with the creatures themselves which are all brilliantly designed and extremely wellexecuted
id compare the lot of them to most of the bad guys in silent hill and perhaps the most gruesome baddies of resident evil
it hurts just to look at most of these guys the way their flesh seems to stretch and strain to withhold the ugliness thats going on underneath
the only thing i could wish for there is a wider taste of variety since the rogues list seen here is extremely shallowconsidering all that came before it darkness audio is surprisingly well done
the cube does everything in its power to deliver a solid surroundsound experience and those effects come as close to accomplishing the spooky vibe these developers were obviously shooting for as any other aspect of the game
musically the games soundtrack is uneventful
it swells and sways as necessary and occasionally gives a nice bit of mood to a location
it isnt repetitious which is probably my greatest pet peeve about ingame music and it doesnt get in the way but it also doesnt stand out on its own
lets put it this way i wouldnt rush out to the stores to buy eternal darkness the original symphonic score
the voice acting in general is very good with few exceptions and though the dialog the actors are asked to deliver is usually stilted and unbelievable they go beyond the call of duty to give their roles a personality and motivation that was sorely lacking in the script
especially good are the noises shallow screams and ambient ticks of the insanity effects and each characters resulting reaction to them
while the same phrase is sometimes repeated at the conclusion of one of these sequences its not something that ever really bothered me and actually took steps to reveal the characters as more honest and true to life
if youre freaked out and seeing things in an unfamiliar mansion i doubt the first thing to enter your mind is come on lets at least get a little variety into the dialog
youre going to scream the first thing that comes into your head whether youve said it before or notto summarize this feels like a series of very good concepts that were just drawn too thin which is odd because the game itself clocking in around twelve hours is fairly short
there were so many superb imaginative concepts that died on the way to the screen here that it really became something of a sad theme for the whole picture
whether it was the truly surprising insanity effects the unique limbtargeting system or the original system of magic no matter how good the idea the execution was always killing the potential for me
despite the lingering offering of replay value here theres supposedly a super secret ending if you finish all three potential paths i just didnt find myself motivated to go through it all again especially considering how slow plodding and ultimately dreary the majority of the actual gameplay was
considering the amount of people that had pimped this game to me and the incredible reputation it seems to have gathered in the years since i found myself more than just a little disappointed
as a musthave title for the gamecube eternal darkness is nothing but a major league letdownin eternal darkness sanitys requiem a man from ancient times pious augustus has taken control of a terrible force and you play through a series of tasks as different characters that will eventually lead you to stopping augustus from summoning the evil force that will eventually lead to the worlds doomthere are three different ways to go about this game depending on which artifact pious augustus chooses
this means that you will have to go through what is basically the same storyline three times
the lack of difference in the three paths makes the game rather boring the only differences are what enemies you run into the order in which you get the red green and blue runes and slight differences in what the characters talk about
everything else the traps the puzzles etc
is exactly the same in all three paths
you even go through all of the same stages in the same order
yawn boringthe gameplay time is very short it takes only  hours to go through the storyline one time
and it get shorter everytime since you will most likely remember what you have to do to get to the next situation
also none of the enemies are all that difficult to get past
you almost never have to ration your ammunition for guns ammunition is too abundantthe only thing you get for completing the game through all three paths is a cutscene
i was expecting to have access to the purple artifact story if you actually play this game you will know what i am talking about
in fact the cutscene leads you to believe that you will gain access to the purple artifact story
what a big disappointmentwhen ghost recon came out they said tom clancy was going for a more tactical type game
i immediately invisioned myself leading a big maybe even huge team of soldiers
instead i got a game pretty much like the old and originally fun but now boring rainbow six games
its exactly like rainbow six escept outdoors and with less soldiers and less choice of equipment
you have three teams
alpha team can have  soldiers on it bravo  and charlie only  making it very like the rainbow six games except worse
the good points are the good graphics of the soldiers however
thier guns are very well put together graphicaly and the suits for the snipers have nice camoflauge aspects to them
the scenery is rather nice too very realistic are the trees and bushes and sound effects and such
however putting on night vision turns the scenery a bit too gamelike
it falls short in terms of weapon realism too
there is no kick recoil for any of the  weapons making it very much like a poorly designed fps game
the scenarios are nicely designed
with realistic objectives and good maps
however with the small team you have these maps are more of a curse then a blessing
multiplayer on these maps is much much more fun
another thing i wish theyd implemented was the ability to play as a regular soldier
not having to command anyone or anything just to follow along with the mission plan
having to monitor everyone and move them along with you took a big fun factor out of the game
the firefight single mission types and such did keep the game going for me when i got bored of the regular campaign thoughupsidegood scenery player models and gun graphics
several different single player game types
good mulitplayer actiondownsidenot too realistic no recoil with weapons etccan only take six soldiers max on a mission
always the leader cant ever be a grunt
limited equipment selectioni love what ghost recon wants to bea thoroughly realistic military simulation first person shooter
but the graphics particularly for environment are unacceptably poor even archaic by most standards
heavy pixelation poorly designed and applied textures and chunky modelling blend to form a gui that is both tiresome to look at and difficult to use
which is sad because this game should be the standard for realism by which other fps games are judged
instead its hard to take it seriouslyive tried this game a number of times but the most exciting thing ive done so far is crash
i diligently follow all the headings and altitudes but never seem to be able to find the enemy
so i just fly and fly and fly look at the clouds get tired of it and quit the game
what game
i am looking forward to combat flight simulator i own every rainbow six game
i am so so so disappointed the textures in the game were old
details were left out big time i expected this to be the best on account of it being the newest and probobly the last add on to rogue spear
and i know my guns big time red storm paid no attention to making the guns real like
basicly this was a last attempt to make more money but it was worth it because it expanded th multiplayer possiblilities
i say if you like playing it online go for it
but if you want something more than just covert ops dont get it
i dont want to knock red storm down completely but i play operation flashpoint
if youve played it you would know what im talking aboutthis stupid thing was my only way to get wireless connection on my xbox  in the beginning
it was a hack to install and eventually it became unusable but damn microsoft for not building in wifii didnt like this game
ps has its wipeout fusion xbox has its quantum redshift and gamecube has this
this game dosent compare to the other systems
it basicaly is a very mediocre futuristic racing title
i suggest you stay awaywhen i first heard of this gamei thought id like itbut boy was i wrongi played simpsons road rage for psand i totally loved itthen i heard that this was even betterso i got itit is the worst game everthere is no point to the gameno hidden charactersno new levelsnothingthe only reason i gave it  stars is because its only useful if you just want to use it to get high scoresother than thatthis game stinksthis is a direct port right from the sega dreamcast that adds nothing new
there are only  different levels and  different characters
i got a class s license the highest ranking on both levels with all  characters in less then  hours
crazy box mode crazy box mode is segas poor attempt at a career mode is not fun at all and the missions are either too hard or too easy
there is also no car damage making this game seem totally unrealistic
you can run into a wall for ten minutes and your car will stay in top condition
there is no reward to getting a class s license such as additional characters or levels and possibly the biggest problem with this game is there is no multiplayer mode which would have added some much needed replay value
ive played simpsons road rage and that game isnt much fun either the graphics made me want to go throw up however if you absolutely need a game like this definetly go for simpsons road rage at least it has a multiplayer option
crazy taxi was fun in arcades but it just doesnt work for consoles maybe the new crazy taxi  for xbox will at least be slightly fun
the only reason i gave this game  stars is because driving around town in a taxi and taking your customers to their alotted destination within a time limit using any means neccessary is a cool concept and the graphics arent terribleanyone who hasnt played this game should rent it play it return it and be done with it
crazy taxi is one of segas more successful franchises yet its one of its weakest
go figurerogue leader was the first game i played for the nintendo gamecube
sadly it was a poor choice
i own the original rogue squadron and i really enjoy the game so i figured this would be a great first rental
right from the start though i was disappointedthe game starts with corny dancing stormtroopers to some old time music holding up yellow squares to form the lucas logo or something
whaa
that kinda breaks the mood but forgivable
then i got to the menu screen scenes from the movies played randomly in the background serving no apparent purpose except maybe to give the developers less original work to dowhen i finally got in game being new to the gamecube i hit the training mission
i figured id learn about all the cool abilities of the various crafts and how to best fight the empire
instead im treated to a empty field with random training icons floating
most are completely useless such as press a to fire good job
a few are truly retarted you found a jabbas palace good job
if i had that computer tell me good job just one more time i would have thrown my controller down right then and there
so annoyed i quit and headed for the first missionwithout any good explanation or reason im suddenly fighting above the death star
lasers are shooting everywhere ties are flying in every possible direction and my wingmen are screaming at me for leadership
i liked it
i quickly pull up the targeting computer and take down a few ties
then i order my wingmen to do the same and set upon the missions goals
it was a great mission but randomnext mission im in an asteroid field
how on earth did i get here
no never mind it looks gorgeous who cares
im blasting stuff having a unconvinced but good time
sadly this doesnt last until mission  by mission  im bored the gorgeous graphics die down to just standard locations and the missions are very tedious
by the later levels it was so easy to mess up a small detail and have to start over i said forget it no morethis game starts off with a major blast if you avoid the training and dies quickly from there
it doesnt get better it just keeps going instead
if you can find it cheap rent it for the first few levels alone
itll be fun for a few days
thats only if you can find it cheap or borrow it from a friend
dont buy this thing unless youre sure rirathcomthis game is so stupidit took me  weeks just to get to the third levelthe challenge is too hard for a normal person and the missions are very tediousi miss straight forward action shooters where the only mission you have to do is shoot other space fighters and beat the bossthat may sound simplistic but done right like in star fox its awesomethis game is really dumbnot fun and its hard thank god i rented it cause this game stinks its not worth junk rent it and find out ur selfim sure in the dawn of next gen consoles this was the cream of the crop but nowadays we expect more
im not talking about graphics im talking about gameplay
this game is waay too linear and boring
what really bugged me is the death star attack
was lukewedgeand biggs the only rebels fighting against the death star
the attack on the death star was a huge battle and so dire taht it the rebels lost theyd be as crewed as thai hooker
so why would only send three fighters to take care of a colossus weapon like the death star
also luke isnt such a good main character he gets annoying afteraround the second mission
so why does it get the two
because it works you shot tifighters and its star warsi was a fan of the first installment of rogue squadron but im not impressed with where the series has gone
the main problem for me is visibility tie fighters are tiny and almost impossible to see especially in space battles making taking them too much of a challenge
they added a targeting computer feature that helps a bit but you lose points the longer you use the targeting computeroverall i found portions of this game to be fun but they need to brighten up the graphics to make it more playablei would say  and a half it was fun to play but boring only to have player
was disappointed in thatthis kind of a game should have multiplayer always otherwise unlocking eveything is just so less speciali woulda given it  stars if it would have been multiplayergames with the star wars name have rarely been disappointing going all the way back to the days of the atari  even with primitive raster graphics that star wars game sucked in thousands upon thousands of kids and mesmerized them
these days with graphics that are light years ahead of the old  the entire experience can be that much more enjoyable
sadly for me i had more fun watching this game than playing iti will qualify this review for you  i am not very good at flying games
i am much better at sports games strategy games and an occasional adventure here and there
even driving games werent my style until gran turismo  came along for the ps
like my experience with ssx for the ps this game came as part of a bundle and it wasnt one i thought id really enjoy
unlike ssx rogue squadron ii has failed to draw me inif youve played rogue squadron on the n youll have an idea of what to expect  pick a specific ship choose your mission in this version you start with two choices a training mission and your first real one and complete your objectives to earn a medal and unlock the next objective
do better at the same mission and earn a better medal
get enough medals and other good things happen
simple enough to explain and easy enough to follow
the early missions spell out your objectives fairly well although there may be more details that youll need to learn as you proceedthe graphics are excellent from the shadows of your craft on tatooine to the dogfights over the death star with asteroids floating in the background to the recreation of scenes from the various movies in the options menu
if you are watching youll definitely get your moneys worth
if youre playing youll need to remind yourself to stay focusedthe game play is well done too  youll find yourself leaning to one side or another to avoid oncoming ties leaning back to pull up as you barely avoid crashing into the side of beggars canyon and wondering how the heck youre supposed to keep track of  enemy craft space objects and numerous enemy ground support
dont worry though because youll get help on some missions
as in previous games you can ask your wingmen to stay in formation with you or pursue other objectives as you take care of business yourself
i didnt have too much trouble directing them with the dpad but you will have to make sure that you dont suddenly swing to the side and see one of them in your sightsthe game play is good all right  too good for me
in the first mission flying through the trench in the death star proved to be costly again and again
i found myself consistently burning up my three ships you can die up to three times before your game is over although dying too many times will jeopardize your chances at better medals trying to move up and down around the obstacles while avoiding the lasers from darth vader and his helpers
the various craft respond a little too realistically for my taste and in the training mission on tatooine i found myself cursing the controls as i tried unsuccessfully to keep up with wedge and biggs watching their computercontrolled craft easing past me race after race
perhaps some of it is simply my being accustomed to the response of a car on the road  much less inertia and much more controlin any event i found it difficult to sit down and play the missions again and again
one of the drawbacks or challenges to the multipart missions is that you have to complete all the parts to finish the mission
make it through the first two fail the third and youre back to square one
it reminds me a bit of dark forces on the pc which was infamous for its exceedingly long levels later in the game that provided no save opportunities until they were completedagain though this was based strongly on personal preference
if you are a fan of star wars air combat games or both youll probably love this game
in any event if youre getting a gamecube bundle youre not going to have much choice
the advantage in a sellers market is that you can certainly sell it if you dont want to keep it
however you may find that hanging in there and playing through it will make it worth your while
as for me im getting back in my rx lm race carokaylike i said about pikminits fun and challenging for the young and oldbut thisokayi think gamcube just made one of the kiddest games everthe namei meansuper monkey ballwhat the stinky kinda name is that
and thecutelittle monkeysdumb enough to make me puke
i am not saying gc games are badwhich they are notthis is just to psycho
what will someone come up with nextmega bunny hopi had a playstation  then bought a gamecube
youre much better off just buying a playstation  any extra games you could play owning a gamecube dont justify its cost
i wish i had just spent the money on sly  jak  or ratchet  it would have been money better spent
live and learnafter the ns ultimate failure against the psx many nintendo fans myself included figured nintendo would realize its errors and get back on the ball for this new wave of consoles
when the gamecube was first announced it seemed that it would be a fierce competitor to the xbox and the ps
it had a nice variety of exclusive titles and sported a lower price than both other systems
sadly over time the majority of the exclusive titles went multiplatformthe gamecube uses minidiscs instead of standard cd sized discs
this has its pros and cons
it gives gc games a faster loading time than the ps and xbox but it prevents cds and dvds from being loaded into the tray
minidiscs only hold gb of data while a standard dvd holds gb
this makes multiplatform games harder to put on the cube since most games are around gb and the smaller size forces developers to cut out certain parts of a game in order to put it on the cube
now you know why youre seeing so many games that come out on both ps and xbox but not the cube
the choice to go with minidiscs ended up biting nintendo in the butt just like their wild decision to use cartriges for the nas for the control design the cubes controller is pretty good
it looks awkward but is actually more comfortable than the xbox controller
however when it comes to controllers sony has dominated that territory with its more simple yet effective designas for online gaming there isnt anything available other than phantasy star online
a couple of years ago nintendo stated that gamers didnt care about playing games online
they have since retracted that statement and ironically the nintendo revolution is expected to have online capabilitiesas far as graphics go the gamecube has the edge over the ps
the gamecube is capable of dreamcast quality rendering which the ps doesnt have and has x resolution like the xbox and dreamcastthe games department is where the gamecube fails miserably
the gamecube has a smaller library than the xbox even though they were launched around the same date and the pss library trumps both systems
if you like lots of great fighting games sports games action games or rpgs then look elsewhere
one can argue that there are some but for the past couple of years a lot of multiplatform games have just been passing over the cube
nintendo develops a fair amount of games itself for the system but the majority of the games are the same franchises that were around for the original nes in the s
nintendo continually focuses on making mariopokemon and other kiddie games for the cube and continually ignores the tastes of adult gamers over the age of  developers like capcom sega square and namco have realized that the system sells poorly outside of japan and are more reluctant to release exclusive titles for the cube
as a result many former gamecube exclusives have jumped over to the xbox and ps
over the past year the number of games being released on the cube has dropped significantly
i hate to say it but it seems as if the system is already dying out and nintendos nextgen console isnt even close to being released yetwhile it has better graphical capability than the ps and is more affordable than both other systems the gamecube has been crippled by its poor game library
i came up on the nes and snes but with  failed systems in a row i have to say that i will not purchase another nintedo console
what really disappoints me is the fact that nintendo just turned its back on the gamers who came up in the s and s who made the nessnes sucessful and continues to cater to the younger crowdyou know the games arent that good for this  classic systems are betterim dissapointed in gamecube
all of the old nintendo systems have had good games that had major action and violence
ive had the gamecube sice it has been outhere are the pros and cons about this systempros origial games like the mario classicsit is a small system that is lightweightgreat controller stylecons games are pathetic and boring to teensvery few good gamessystem freezes up sometimes or can scratch disksmemory cards can not hold much memoryi would recommend the xbox because the game choice has great topics
the graphics are unbelievable and memory is stored in the xboxi hope you will listen to this
dont get me wrong but the gamecube is a good thing for kids  and underfarewelland by the way my name isnt gloria im a boy whos having a system from all three video game companies psx n xbox and loving them all equally im saying this from a nonbiased point of view
lets see what nintendo does right and what it does wrongit looks nice but superficial advantages are hardly an excuse
by the way all you xbox haters should be quiet about it being huge
unless youre nomadic and need to carry all your belongings on your back every day that shouldnt even be a problem
besides if you cant afford a house you shouldnt even be investing in video gamesthe controller is bad
worse than the ns
the button placement is bizzare and tough to get used to there are about half as many buttons as the pss and xboxs and you cant click the joystick which means even fewer things you can dowhile the little cd things are sexy theres no dvd playergame selection is small
gamecube has about  games
while thats good considering how its been out for a relatively short amount of time filtering out all the sports titles and other bad ports that should never have been released at all you have about  then filtering out all the same recycled platformers from a decade ago you have about  eternal darkness and super smash brothers and resident evil
at least xbox is making a comeback when it comes to softwaregamecube simply doesnt stand a chance
if it had a wider variety of fpss racers and fighting games it would have stood a chance but a whole lot of childish platformers doesnt cut it for meafter the ns ultimate failure against the psx many nintendo fans myself included figured nintendo would realize its errors and get back on the ball for this new wave of consoles

what really disappoints me is the fact that nintendo just turned its back on the gamers who came up in the s and s who made the nessnes sucessful and continues to cater to the younger crowdlets be honest
the hype is about nintendos reputation and previous successes
not about the gamecubenintendo claimed at release that it would not be about power but about ease of game development for developers
they cant prove that claim and it does not look like it worked
they admitted the system is under par and they quotborrowedquot what was one of the great features of the playstation   look how many great titles are out for that systems
the ps  is already there too
great games ease of development and qualityimitation is the sincerest form of flattery but not a selling point
sony be happy nintendo now wants to be like you instead of quotborrowingquot side scrollers and other game ideas from early pcs and segathe lack of a dvd format limits the quantity that can be packed onto one disk
heck the dvd playback is a great feature
however this is the one feature that may be easy for developers
instead of having to lisence their games and the cartridges like in the past they can now enjoy a higher profit margin which they have been enjoying from sega and sony for a long timefor that matter the sega dreamcast is much cheaper than the gc and a lot of the games look better than on the gcthe gc has some good titles but lets be honest
the same titles are substandard compared to the ps and xbox
also if we look back we remember that the ps had less quotpowerquot than the sega saturn but by golly all the same titles looked better on the ps
the same is happening with the ps so put your money there
the  ps outpaces the gc which came out horribly late and the xbox is just the modern day sega saturnoutclassed by less power
since even doa on dreamcast looks better than doa on xbox dismiss the xboxso for pure power and performance variety dvd capability the online expansion and a wide variety of cool titles  go with the ps
for value and good gaming that beats the gc go with the dreamcast
for common sense reasons put the gc at  and buy it before you buy the overpromised underdelivered xboxthis costs way too much it hold way too little spend the extra for the  or whatever
this will run out immediately especially with owning th re and smash bros meleethe design of this controller is one of the worst i have ever seen
it looks as if the designers took the buttons and just tossed the randomly around but then again nintendo controllers have always looked and felt weird
their quotergonomicquot design basically means work effiecientid have to disagree
the button placement ensures a long learning curve causing you to take your eyes off your game for precious seconds to figure out which button you need to pressalso on the analog sticks the tops easily pop off revealing sharp areas that really hurt your hand if you push on buttons hard like menext time lets hope that nintendo can create a controller that has an easy and comprehendible designthis controller fits like a glovea really tight one
i am  and this thing is so small my thumbs overlap two or three buttons at the same time
the z trigger is in a worthless spot and its not easy to use at all which means whenever they will make you use the trigger there will be all heck to pay
the analog is in the right place this time thank god but whats with the c analog
why cant i just use the the l and r triggers to move the camra
plus why cant i push the a button
i swear
regardless how big that button is i cant use it right to save my life and when playing a video game that could be a bad thingdont even ask me what well ever need the dpad for i dont know
however this is a cool color though so i gusse that counts for something
otherwise i dont recomend
nintendo has has a bad reputation with making bad controllers n anyone
 and this one is no differentif you love long segments of nothing but talking this game is for you
half this game is you trying to extract the right info from people and only one tenth of what they have to say is useful
the rest is the standard shooting the breeze that game makers think creates atmosphere
gothic held some comic value for me as i started to see it not as an adventure game but as a bizzare excersize in making boring people get to the point
this is a useful skill to develop in this world so i give gothic an extra starwhy do game makers feel the irrational need to make you learn a completely different control system for every new game
gothic is the worst in this example of this trend
sure theres some key binding customization availablejust not for the actions you actually want
not only are you banned from binding actions to mouse buttons but xicat breaks new ground in game control idiocy by forcing you to hold down two keys to do practically everythingthe fact is that im tempted to rate this game even lower than i have
but i have to give some credit where due  the scope of the game is impressive the graphics though mixed are effective overall generally the sense that there is a real and entire world available for the player to explore makes me want to like this game
and ive tried for hours to do sobut theres no getting around the facts that a the control scheme is absurd making combat or even simple inventory management near impossible b the acting particularly by your own character is so bad that youll cringe before selecting responses to dialog and c the pacing is so slow that youll spend the first few hours either engaging in the more or less random combat experience or waiting for something anything to actually happeni paid retail for the game because i was excited to see a new d single player crpg
but this game just makes me furious
save your money save your time save your patience for something elsei can apreciate the work that went into creating a game with this degree of complexity and i really wanted very much to love this game
however i have to give it  stars for an overall rating of how fun it is to play
i get the impression from the online discussion boards that in order to do well at this game you need to devote yourself to it on a moreorless fulltime basis for months if not years
if you dont have the time to make that kind of committment to make to a computer game you might find this rough goingi found the overall design to be satisfactory and i like the way you can easily group ungroup regroup and maneuver your armies
it would be nice to be able to exert more control over what your armies are doing once they engage in combat the only combat control you can exercise is to choose to flee the resolution of battles occurs automatically without your control but that is minor point for me
you can also exercise considerable control over many aspects of your society such as your tolerance for other religions the degree to which you want to specialize in land or naval power whether you want to be innovative or closedminded and so on
there is a lot here to likehowever there are two big issues that reduce the fun and the replayability for me
the first is the constant problem of revolutions
as another reviewer pointed out you should plan to spend hours of real time endlessly shuttling your armies around trying to stamp out one revolution after the next
this is astoundingly tedious after awhile
the second is the fact that you are completely locked in to the real history of your country
if you are playing china and china historically suffered a huge government scandal in  when  rolls around you are screwed no matter how youve played so far
it occured to me that the point of the game is not really to expand your empire but to try your hand at replaying actual historyy
this does have its interesting moments but it zaps the replayability to  do i really want to play spain again and go through all the exact same historically driven events over agin
not reallythis lockedin history also really limits the number of countries that you can expect to play enjoyably
yes its often said that there are  countries and you can play any of them
however the historical inevitability built into the game limits the fun factor for most
few countries are even able to explore the world beyond their known lands because you need special exploring units to all you to venture into new map zones and the historically colonial countries just have a builtin edge in the number of explorers they receive
you can play the inca empire if youd like to spend several hours staring at the same  provinces with no way to explore beyond themoverall i have to say that i dont really consider this to be a game
it is more like a very detailed history sim
judging from the positive reviews here and the online message boards there are plenty of people out there who love this and i can see how that might be possible for someone who has lots and lots and lots of time to spend learning it and who does not mind the builtin history
i would have preferred something a little less preordained and labor intensivei didnt really like this game
it really wasnt that fun for me
i used to really like the campc games but now they arent that fun for me
one thing that i hate is that there are no cheats
i hate this
i really hate games with no cheats
i think games are more fun with cheats
i dont realy reccomend this game but its okay for the first couple of days you have itthere are a lot of things y pss version is better
thhe framework for gamecube is really slow and i did not like this edition of tony hawk pro skater  but do me a favor
write something in that box i will put belowtony hawk pro skater  has excellentthanksalan ythis game was ok but there isnt really anything new compared to the earlier ones
except for that there is a skateboard shop and a bunch of new stuff but the gameplay is still the same
tony hawk  is the best one thoughunfortunately i was one of those idiots who bought gamecube over ps
i bought ssbm rogue leader thps spy hunter and cel damage
tony hawks pro skater  is my target now
this game is patheticly easy
tony hawks pro skater  is harder than this trash
thps has a horrible soundtrack too thpss is the best
the game tony hawks pro skater x for xbox is much better
the graphics of this tony hawk are incredible though
the levels are quite detailed too
thps had its way of not telling you all the specials and moves like this one does
this game has moves where you go underground
wait a second
how in the world do you skateboard underground
i have one question for neversoft why do you still call it tony hawks
nobody even plays as tony hawk
this is a waste of money unless you only care about the graphics
if you dont have a n then get one and get thps and you will know what i mean by the skill level differencei was really disapointed with this game
the graphics are nice
not great by any means
the objectives are too basic  simple
i thought you had to pick up certain drugs  deliver then to a certain spot
taking long journeys avoiding rivals  cops
this was not the case
basically you run back  forth
the fun level is minimal
common rockstar
you can do much better then thisthis game has better graphics and handling than the original but the sequel to the original has raised the annoyance level bar several levels
first the cops are way too good for this game even better than the first
this makes the game way too difficult
next the unlocking of all the cars and their countermeasures should have been done early in the game because the cops have way better cars than the player has
furthermore what is with the additional cop cars that get resurrected
lastly you should have the ability to request a team accompany you rather than alone
true some of the missions you do receive a team but not often
i mean they should permit the player to choose if he or she wants a team or not to accompany them on the mission
the developers could reduce the point levels and such if you request a team but at least have the option out thereoverall rent this game before you buy
this is not a keeperdemoafter playing the marine demo i see that sierra has tried to follow fox interactives initiative with a sequel to the game
the alien the predator and the marine are all there with more
but when they added more they also took away
in avp when you were one of the species the other species looked like they were made of similar graphics
in sierras version the marine was in full detail complete with hackers tool and shoulder lamp which i like but the aliens were weird little moving things and not as good as the original avp where the alien looked like it was out of the movie
this game is from the creators of halflife and all those so go figureupdatefull gamebut it is a fun game and long gameplay due viewing the different storylines of  different playable speciesthe predator most fun of the  species to play plenty of weapons can jump really high just like the movie this was missing in foxs version
definitely gooood fun getting trophies etcalien very fast gameplay and a lot of sneaking around and weird camera angles due to climbing all over the wallsmarine very fun due to the weapons and tools and trying to help your buddiesthe game saves as you go along but you can also save whenever you want
kinda helps if there are facehuggers arounda def
positive of this game is the facehuggers dont spook the hell out of you by disappearing then wrapping around the monitor screen like in foxs version
in this one youll seehear it leap towards your facedefinitely try this game out if youre an avp fan
it stays true to the seriesmovies
also try primal hunt for some more fun its a mission pack addon that gives  more angles to the story
mercenary ancient predator predalieni enjoyed the prequel to this game and went out on a  limb to get this one
it took me several painfully long tries to get this game to install
it seemed to like to crash my computer
after a successful installation i tried playing the game
the graphics were great but the voice acting was abominable
i realied more on the subtitles than the poor acting in this game
anyway the game was decent when it worked
avp crashed my computer every  minutes
there were times when i could play for up to an hour before it crashed but it always sent me to the blue screen of no return
in case you may be wondering i meet or exceed the system requirments suggested by the manufactureri finally beat the game and was met with a frustratingly anticlimactic ending sequence that left me feeling like i wasted my money on a broken game
it is possible that the game was defective but i wasnt going to waste my time with it
im sure if you get a working or updated copy you will be impressed with good graphics and gameplay
i still feel like playing as the alienthis game isnt that great
i didnt like the characters
the worlds in this one is retarded and it was an easy game
but its still better than parts  and what kinda game is this
i thought this would be an awsome game
but no its not that great
at first you see the amazing landscape fun fights and different contraptions
then after a day the game keeps repeating
there is almost no new enemies
come on let me fight something else
there is practicaly one boss and jak cant jump
he tries but cant
hes almost as bad as the dude in kingdom hearts
and what the heck is with this idiot daxter
whats his point in the story
the comic releif
no way
he says idiotic things like look out or ahhhhh or even dont die on me jak i need someone to feed me
jeez what the crap is the point of him
he cant do anything just flies around like a weirdo
if your looking at good adventure games look at rachet and clank kingdom hearts and harry potter
try to stay away from this game or be prepared to throw it against the wallyou can totally throw the little dude
he just hangs around and then youre like wham
eat my daxter
when i first played this game i couldnt believe my eyes
dont get me wrong i wouldnt play this game with my eyes closed or anything but when they were open it was like wow
trust me on this onethis game shows off the pss graphical prowess or what passes for graphical prowess on a ps
the controls are very easy to pick up and if you dont demand anything from your games then this will probably satisfy you
however i found that collecting power cells and eco was a tedious task rather beneath someone of my intellectual stature
the physics of the game were astoundingly poor who ever heard of a quotdouble jumpquot
even on the moon with its unique gravity neil armstrong was unable to do a double jump and so the suggestion that a spikyhaired cartoon character can transcend the laws of physics is both preposterous and offensivefurthermore it has been noted in countless reviews that daxter the sidekick is not irritating and even perhaps amusing
wrong wrong wrong wrong
you plebians know nothing
daxter is the newman of video games characters the annoying sidekick that you hope will go away but never doesin conclusion the game looks nice plays nice but is ultimately boring and undeserving of my attention
go play dynasty warriors or ssx tricky insteadentertaining and enjoyable but too short
beat it in one dayworth a rent but not a buynote to naughty dog what was there is nice but there was too little of it too justify  you needed at least  times the content to make it worth buying this is a rental game only guys
oh and thanks for nothing concerning the door that requires  power cells to opennote after you defeat the game there is another door wich requiers you to collect  power cells to enter
dont bother
when you collect the  power cells and go to the door it opens a bright light comes out the charactors say oh that is beautiful and that is all that happens
i guess they really wanted to get this game on the market before it was finished or it was a cruel joke to those who collected the  power cells for nothingthis game is borring its only for little kids i have all  jak games and are good but this game is for little kids whoever likes this  game is stupid butholebatman vengeance drops players into the universe from the popular animated shows
while this has been accepted as one of the better batmanbased video games i found it a really frustrating experience
the game has its moments but too many control issues killed the experience for methe main reason fans will want to pick this up is to hear the voice talent from the cartoon reprise their roles including kevin conroy tara strong and mark hamil
the plot isnt terribly special  it tries to innovate in how it links all the villains together so that batman can fight them but it wouldnt be compelling without the voice cast backing itin fact hearing the voice cast became my only incentive to get through the game
batman is animated reasonably well and gotham is accurately if blandly modeled in d to match the look of the show
the combat system though stinks
batman has an arsenal of gadgets but u have to switch into a clumsy firstperson mode to use them
the cstick isnt very good at precision aiming making boss fights like mr freeze and a helicoptor overly difficult
batman is also rather easily beat up in a slugging match despite his years of training
thugs will often land the first punch then punch you again as you get up or corner you in a wall and keep you from retaliating
the constantly shifting camera doesnt help things either
whats a good batman game without a decent combat systemin the end i had much more fun with batman rise of sin tzu and even the muchhated batman dark tomorrow
fans of the animated shows may want vengeance just to hear the voiceacting
its not really fun for anything elsethis game could have been great  but it turned out awful rather than have a great rd person actionfighter you have an acrobatic puzzle solver with some rd person fighting what they should have done was to make the game more action oriented and to make the wirepuzzle solving with easier aim rather than having to point directly at the standing target to point in the direction and for the cpu to make the automatic adjustment also ive never seen batman fall from a rooftop but in this game if you fall  you die  with no chance of recovery that was a huge mistake  had they made the game based on what batman could do in either the cartoon series or the comicsthe game would have been a spectacular success  oh well ive had to restart this game three times because for some reason the game wants to save to a memory card instead of the hard drive the people who ported this one from ps didnt thoroughly qampa this critical feature
dont eject the disk or you will lose a days worth of playingdialogue and cut scenes take up much valuable game time and are pretty obnoxious if you are restarting the game from the beginningthe punch kick combat is very primitive as are the car and jet controls
there is a game called oni by bungie that has breathtaking grappling and kung fu moves and it predates this one by at least a yearrather than being a real game this is more like a narrative of the tv
cartoon and you get to play a bit here and there
im not alone on this please read reviews under other game platforms
one person hits on what im trying to say by comparing it to dragons lair or space aceor perhaps we could be looking at a new form of interactive cartoongaming hybrid
if so it should cost half the price of a real gameas you probably know simpsons road rage is the same as crazy taxi  my guess is that your love of this game comes down to two things   how much you like the simpsons
 how much you like crazy taxii cant say that i enjoyed crazy taxi much so it comes as no surprise that i am not too impressed by this game
the best part of both games are the minigame missions that you have to accomplish
there are only ten of them in road rage and they are too quickly beaten
the rest of the game involves driving around a car and picking up various residents of springfield
you have to take them to their desired destination as quickly as possibleone thing that bothers me is that many people will review a game after they have only played for a couple of hours
that is a big mistake
sometimes there are certain game characteristics which are entertaining for a whilebut then they wear out their welcome
road rage suffers severely from this problemthe cast of the tv show recorded sound samples to be used specifically in this game
that was a great ideai think
some of the things the characters say are funny and add to the enjoyment of the game
however it soon turns into a major annoyance
why
they didnt do nearly enough original voice work
imagine hearing someone say the same thing over and over and over again about a hundred times
does that actually sound enjoyable
youre right
its not
i felt like smashing up the tv after hearing ralph talk about a leprechaun who tells him to burn things for about the zillionth time
i would recommend using the mute button instead of taking this drastic approach
my rating of  stars is for the unbiased game player
i would recommend it more highly for those of you who are huge fans of the simpsons or the crazy taxi game format
personally i found it to be too repetitive to be enjoyable for more than a few hoursok this game has one of the best licences out there
most people love the simpsons and its great to see it in a game after a long absence
the game copies crazy taxi in every way but doesnt do it nearly as well
springfield is reconstructed quite well but there just isnt enough variety in the locations at allthe first time u pick up a passenger u will enjoy the ride and the oneliners from the show but soon they will get annoying
the game just stays the same all the way pick up passenger and drop himher off
there is no variety at all
and also the car handles a bit crap and its not much fun driving around after a few days
worth a rent onlyi just got a game cube for christmas in which case i got two games tony hawks pro skater  and luigies mansion
i found tony hawks  quite good and luigies mansion ok then at the beggining of january i got super smash bros melee which was like the best game ever in my opinion
at the end of january i got simpsons road rage
there are only  good things about this game
nmb
the graphics are great like all gamecube games
nbm
its a good multyplayer game
now i have  reasons not to buy the game nmb
there are only six levels
nmb
after you complete the game nothing happens
nmb
theres no story line
nmb you can only play up to  players
nmb
if its basicly a remake of crazy taxi
nmb
i beat the game in  hours
nmb
after  days youll just be trying to sell itunless youre an abseloute die hard fan of the simpsons and you must have all the merchendise skip this game
theres nothing too special about it and there are other games out there like it that are much better
even crazy taxi is better than this
not reccomendedthis product worked fine for the first month but then i started getting periodic video glitches usually in the form of a quotstreakquot or smear running from highcontrast objects like football players all the way to the right edge of the screen
soon after that the video started going blackandwhite and even sometimes would black out completely for a couple seconds at a time
this happened during  different games
it turned out to be the cheap cables microsoft ships with this
wiggling and repositioning them helped but youll want to replace them with higher quality cables at the first sign of troublethe lack of a story line confusing names bad voice acting and soso graphics are the least of this games problems
the worst aspect is the poor gameplay this has to be the worst of the worst when you are hit it takes  seconds to recover during which time you cannot fight but will continue to take hits and damage from your enemies
it doesnt matter how hard you hit any buttons
your character will spin for a few seconds and bleed away
and get this when you hit an enemy he doesnt suffer from this problem
so if you play this game be prepared to die many unnecessary deaths while theres an impressive list of weapons in the game many are very poorly implemented
get a machine gun or shot gun and youll find that you cant really aim accurately
sometimes even when you aim and fire at the enemy he doesnt suffer any damage
i dont know if this is a bug or just another way for some sadistic programmer to make a gamers life miserable enemies are strong
as mentioned before they dont get immobilized temporarily like your character does and they are really tough  im talking about the nonbosses
and theres no difficulty option in this game even though you can access the save screen at any time during the game it doesnt really save the game at the point you think you are saving
instead when you load the game it starts from the beginning of the mission
and what exactly constitutes a savable mission is also confusingin short this is a terrible game
theres some fun factor in it thats why i give it  stars instead of   but i truly think itll take a few years off your lifespan because of its high degree of frustrationburnout is definitely not worth buying
even a rental isnt quite warranted
actually the best way to experience burnout is to stop by a friends house when hes rented or bought it
if you drive just one lap of a race you get the idea
theres really not that much more to get out of it
with games increasingly being measured by the hours of original play that they offer this is really quite patheticthe idea is appealing to anyone who lives in a metropolitan area and has to hassle with trafficjust plow through the congestion and buzz on
however the execution of the game is so halfarsed that even young children will lose interest after a few heats
get more points by sliding around corners
who cares
drive headon into traffic to get a bonus speed burst
even this is dull in burnout
the replays are very choppy as well the pavement looks about as believable as it would if you were to try to pass a glass of milk off as the statue of libertyit seems that the next ingenious move by some bright developer is going to involve melding the possibilities of this game with the spoton craftsmanship of the gran turismo series
lets invoke crashes on the highway at  mphlets see some damage on the cars where it happenslets have a supedup racing engine that tears through the suburbs and plows down small familieswheeeee
unfortunately grand theft auto  has already done this so dont get all in to a tither like you doif someone wants to make just a racer interesting for me after something as satisfying as gta  though theyre going to have to do better than burnout
pity your friend and his expensive mistake after your obligatory lapand save your moneyi did not like this game at all
however i love the sequel burnout  i suggest you avoid this one and play  instead
end of storythis is another game that leaves much to be desired
the graphics are very psone like and the gameplay lacks any real substance
you race past cars trying to get near misses and by doing so you fill up your burnout meter
once your burnout meter is full you can go to supersonic speed whitch doesnt look or feel any different than when you were going normal speed
the near misses get to be very boring after a while
and there are not enough cars or tracks available
the racing to get to the next ckeckpoint is a little to arcadelike
the good thing about this game is that the steering and control are very tight
bottom line rent it dont buy it
buy gt
thats it from me
im out that is the question that i want answered and thought that i had found it when i learned about this game last year
but the end result is monotonous and seems rushedfirst of all for an adventure game the story needs to much more explained than the little snippets that are given throughout the game
what you do get are little tidbits from the episode i plot line thrown into the mix
but they are displayed poorly throughout as much is in this gameto follow up on the displaying poorly remark i have to say that the graphics on this game are definitely sub par
most of the levels get extremely monotonous
you will know what i mean after following qui gon around into room after room that look absolutley identical
you will also notice that during the cut scenes or during other gameplay parts when characters are speaking they lack the ability to move their lips when they are speaking
it just seemed to me that the developers avoided attention to detail that any star wars fan would wantthe gameplay is what i should really be focusing on though
the force abilities rock as does the manual control of the lightsaber
i have a feeling that these aspects are what they began with and based the game around as they are the best parts of it
this game also allows the ability of bullet time to a certain extent however i didnt find it useful except in a few minor circumstancesbut the major drawback to the gameplay is controlling obi wans movement
he lacks the ability to turn quickly to the right or the left and his movement is incredibly choppy
you may just laugh as loud as i did the first time you saw him run as well
another serious drawback to the game is the camera
there are some serious problems when you get to close to a wall or to another character
other stalls in the gameplay include when more enemies are loading and whenever you turn on or off your lightsaberthis game is barely worth the rental in my opinion and only worth the purchase if you are a die hard star wars fan who needs to play all the games related to the serieswhen i heard that there would be an obiwan game built in the vein of jedi knights i was so happy i bought an xbox
well im hitting myself pretty hard right now
while i will admit that xbox has had a very small handful of noteworthy titles my ps and gamecube have been giving me a lot more pleasure and good games to choose from
obiwan stands as a testament to the type of over hyped garbage that the xbox has been pushing down a perhaps gullible consumer markets throat for almost a year now
to think that i bought the system for this game let me attack every aspect of it that is wrongthe graphics are playstation  quality at best granted running in high resolution but the character models frame rate and animation are all terrible
the control feels clumsy the story is boring and as an obiwan fan i was more put off by the way they portrayed obiwan than enthusiastic about itthe voice acting was terrible
the voice actors sounded nothing like their movie counterparts and obiwan came off as being very smug and unlikable simply because of his voice alone
the sad part of this game is how great the game could have been if a the graphics were more in touch with what the xbox can do which is a lot more than this b the story and dialogue were a lot better and c the controls were not so clumsy and were a bit more precise
it is amazing to me that this game made it to the market like this
it was the reason i bought an xbox it is a good thing im broke and could only afford to rent the game
consumer beware
rent this game before buying itaside from some of the really cool things that you can do with the force and decent controls everything else about this game the graphics look outdated and nonxboxish and you fight the same monsters over and over and over and over again in a very repetitive game
the voiceacting and cg movies are just plain badavoid this game  get halo insteadnow dont get me wrong when this came out i played the heck out of it and enjoyed it
it was a nice storyline and it was fun playing as obi wan and killing enemies
also the levels did have a nice variety to them
however ive realized in my older years there are more problems with this game then i realized
one the game just feels dated in terms of graphics and enemy behavior two the controls arent that great you could be running down a corridor but you could easily drift to the right and also some levels really overwhelm you with enemies that you cant combat
now if you enjoy it hey enjoy it i just dont anymorethis game bums
i mean its a hell of a lot better than the mk  game boy color but its still so darn horrible
the graphics are barely above bad there is not nearly as much fun in the gameplay or moves as there is in mk trilogywhich i plan to get for my big computer and the sound and character design is atrocious
i think that this game belongs on the shelves except if you either have no love for yourself or if you want to pay a jerk back for something rotten he did to you
what was ed boon thinkingno offense to him when he made this waste of mechanics
man oh man dont waste your cash on this game
buy mk or ii or a really worthy mk gameif only midway would put more thought into their games this could have been one of the best games for the gba
first off this is an exact copy of the  bit versions of ultimate mortal kombat  which isnt a bad thing but the translation to the gba could have been done much much more better and what we have is a game that feels unfinished
the graphics are bland very bland
the characters are stiff and the animation is very jerky
the moves arent as easy to pull off as you might think and yeah they take practice to pull off but they could have been made much better
all in all mortal kombat advance isnt worth the asking price but its not a completely bad game just buy it when you find it in a bargain binits umk potable and ruined
it could have been so easy to finally come out with a good mk game on gameboy
the graphics and sound are incredible and the number of players is nice but pnce again the game play is sooo bad
it is extermely hard and very boring
the people move so slow and its almost impossible to win
they should take the old mk for the old gb and port it to gba with color and bloosorta like the gg version that would be a thousand times bettersince my parents wont let me get an account this review is based on the offline playfirst of all this game is very very monotonous
monsters are repeated very very much
the designers got so obsessed with a monster they made like about  types of that monster and the only thing that varied the types were the color and size
also there arent many different monsters in the gamealso most of episode  takes place underground underground mines caves and ruins
and at each place the same freaking rooms are repeated over and over againthe game play at first is ok as well as the weapons character types well balanced and character creation
but this game will bore you in a week or two that is if you dont play it so oftenit has the same graphics as the dreamcast versionif you didnt have to pay  bucks a month for it
go find the original unopened and a dreamcast
its free and basicaly the same expierience
the  dollar fee is totaly uncalled for and not worth it
skip this game
its great but not  bucks a month greatthe world of morrowwind looks like a brown ugly swamp
the same drab colors are everywhere you go
oh ya and while you tour this uninteresting landscape you may be attacked by crabs and fliesinteractions with other characters are highly uninteresting the quests are boring and it takes forever to walk everywherefighting consists of clicking your mouse button over and over to swing your weapon
its really lamethis game falls way short of the quality of elder scrolls i arena
if you want a real roll playing game get baldurs gate ii
thats a modern day classic and you can purchase it for around  bucks nwolike its predecessor morrowind promises great things shows potential for achieving those ends and fails
the gameplay itself is superb with openended character development and a large game world which allows for countless hours of explorationand also countless hours of desktop crashes which require a reboot horrendous lagframerate problems and everybodys favourite memory from daggerfall the fall through the world
actually prior to the patch i didnt experience much by way of ctd but now it occurs after about  minutes of game play and without fail
maybe in  months the game will be sufficiently patched to achieve stability allowing me to return to the wonderful worldsetting bethesda has created
until then however the cd will have to collect dust
even with a highend system configured to run this game efficiently i have yet to be able to experience quotmorrowindquot without extraordinary frustration and disappointmentthe graphics are impressive however when interacting with other characters a window pops up and you basically have to read and click as a means for interaction
there is a main window with text that represents the response of the character you are interacting with and on the right there are headings that read rumors where are you from etc i find this interaction to be totally archaic so i was totally unimpressed by this gameplay
also after you have clicked on all of the options on how to communicate with the character and you click on goodbye as you are leaving the character will say quotcan i help youquot or something to that affect
didnt i just exhaust every question with this guy
what else do i need to speak aboutalso the fighting in this game is really dissapointing
you hit then he hits you hit then he hitsget the point
yawni believe this game would have been the greatest game ever made if it came out ten years agodefinately try before you buyi honestly do not see what everyone else does in this game
i bought it based on the all the tremendous hype it received
i was really excited about the game when i first played it but within a week of installing it i realized that it just wasnt all it was made up to be by all the hypethe world is expansive yes
in fact its overwhelming
the landscapes look great and the enviornmental and weather effects are amazing
the problem with this gigantic world is that it is sparsely populated
you only see signs of life when you go into towns or dungeons
most of the time the wilderness is uninhabited
and that makes the game lonely
in fact this game is like playing ever quests and other similar massive online gamesexcept you are the only player
there is no one else
and that gets lonely
why a multiplayer option was not included is beyond comprehensionthe character models are quite possibly the ugliest character models i have ever seen in a game
the faces are hideous and all the models look deformed and blocky
this is not because of a system configuration my computer running top of the line hardware it is just horrible character design
further adding to the feeling of repetition there are only about  or  different faces per race further split up between gender
so with hundreds of npcs in the game you see the same faces repeatedalot
not only are all the faces and character models virtually identical but they all repeat the same text over and over
although there is a long and involved story in the game i could never follow it
i didnt find it interesting at all and frankly since every character said virtually the same thing after a while i just found myself not really caring what npcs said
i ignored them completely
that made the game utterly boring
maybe its my own fault but i honestly just got sick of reading the same text over and over from the repetetive npcscreating your character is probably the only entertaining thing about this game
you have the option to pick a preexisting class have a custom class created for you by answering questions or creating your very own class mixing any abilities that you wish
there are multiple races to choose from each having unique abilities that set them apart from one another
picking your appearence is pointless simply because there arent many choices and they all look the same
plus youll see whatever face you pick for yourself repeated over and over in the game on the npcs as i mentioned earlierupping your skills in the game is simple enough though it takes hours and hours
if you have the timeand high boredom thresholdyou could stand in one spot using your skills over and over and get them up
using your skills over and over is the only way to advance them and until you find heavy combat areas you wont advance much at alldespite the amazing environmental graphics and weather effects great ambient sound and sense of exploration morrowind just doesnt really cut it
i found the music to be repetetive and dull
there is alot to do in the game but quests just seem so empty
of the few quests that i did i never once got a feeling of satisfaction upon completion
in the end it just felt like more mundane tasks to do and that made it boringthe heavily touted world editor allows you to do all types of things editing almost anything about the game
you could build your very own world if you had the time and patience
oh and did i mention you need a degree in quantum physics to even comprehend how complex the editor is
only diehard heavily devoted users who would forsake everything else in their life and spend countless hours days even weeks trying to learn and master the editor should bother with it
it is definitely not for the casual editor or someone with a remote interest in tinkering with the gameif you have countless hours to devote to this game then you might find it enjoyable
frankly i just do not have the time or patience to devote to the gameand it quite simply does not live up in any way to the tremendous hype it received
if the game did live up to its hype then i would enjoy itthen i would find the time to devote to this game
in the end i found it to be nothing more than a repetetive boring and dreary gameplay experience
morrowind should only be played by fanatic hardcore rpg players
casual gamers should stay awayi am going to make this very simple the quote on the box states quotbest looking rpg everquot
this is not an exaggeration  this is pure fact
the monsters weaponry and game space are without equal  anywhere in any game
but at the same time imagine trying to play doom  or civilization on an atari   you got it it wont work  just like morrowind on most modern day home computersunless youre running it on an nsa mainframe think cray supercomputer then expect three hours of wait time for every hour of play time or worse
and even though the visuals are stunning it becomes maddeningly frustrating to have to deal w all the load times oftentimes in the middle of battleto give you a sense for the system requirements i run an hp  with  mb of rdram with an intel  ghtz pentium  processor and a video card with  megs of video ram
and this game cooks all system resources and consistently crashes my machine about every  minutes
if bethesda softworks the company who eveloped this game is reading this yes this is an indictment of your ability to manage code and system resources  youve done a terrible job of this in morrowindnetnet awesome visuals cool monsters and weaponry huge and i mean huuuuuge world to play in unfortunately do yourself a favor put your money and time elsewhere  this game is simply not fun due to the exasperatingly slow play caused by flawed programmingnow that was a good game
it had decent music decent graphics for its time and the characters you chose looked beautiful
this is so so in my opinion as it is not enough better from what ive seen to warrant an overhaul of your machine you need a pentium  or more a dvdrom and everything else to work well daggerfall ran on windows 
i managed to get it to run even without the dvdrom but i wasnt really impressed
that all considered the controls are harder to maneuver since i didnt have a manual i had a tough time figuring out how to talk to people and they scrapped the default design from daggerfall so you have to move forward using alphanumerics instead of cursor keys
if you have a manual and you have the specifications it might be worth your while
given the choice though id rather purchase daggerfall again
i just found out that even though xp generally forbids daggerfall if you are unlucky enough to have xp and not have capacity to run morrowind go type in daggerfall xp patch into the search engine to reconfigure the system
i think the deal is that its illegal to have both on your computer so if you have morrowind capacity i hate you you shouldnt install this patchfirst i loved the concept and the game had some nice graphics the textures and animations were really nice it also was a really interesting concept fighting game that isnt based on a bunch of guys and gals out to rule the world somehow by beating each other up
unfortunately the developers or producers were really creative with the truthfirst there is nothing even close to  characters
there are  and there is no way to unlock more
if you hold down the trigger you get to choose different colors of clothingsecond the game states that each character has his or her own special power
of the  characters only  have special powers one of those being invisibility that the computer can see throughthird i beat the single player in about  minutes and didnt lose oncethe only reason why i gave this game  stars was because its cheap at frys  and i like kicking the heck out of my brother on itmy boyfriend and i bought this game on a whim
it was a bargain compared to other games like mortal kombat and we figured while it looked hokey it couldnt be that badit did turn out to be worse than we had thought but not by much
despite the mention of a bunch of characters the game is pretty boring
some of them have special moves but most of them done and sometimes what they call unique character looks the same as another character it just has a different name and wardrobethe single player mode is boring you just try and earn a bunch of money so you can skip stops on the way to the capital but it seems like no matter how much you earn you can never move more than like  stops ahead
its like the computer calculates how much traveling expenses are in such a way youre forced to play so many roundsthe thing that was the worse for me was the soundtrack and noises
the warriors make this sound that completely destroys any hope i had for concentration
i just laugh when they make their fighting whoops and dances because it sounds funnyoverall i have to give it two stars
the first is because its a low cost two person fighter
if youre short on money but you want a game that will let you battle it out with another person this fits the bill
the other star is because you can laugh at the game
its ludicrous the sounds are hokey the music is annoying and the characters are either cookie cutters of each other or so wild theyre laughablethis cable has poor video quality compared to the nintendo cable
it seems like there is interference
i do not recommend buying thisok  this game i rented hoping to have a good actionstoryline based game
well theres a story line and i have to day its a good one
but the fun in this game lacks its can be addictive but unless you have alot of time on your hands its not really great
the graphics are top notch the gameplay is good the setup overall is good
but after paying for awhile i lost intrest and put it down
if you are someone who likes strategy lots of thinking and lots of time this game is for you
but if you are someone who likes fast paced action and exitement this game is not for you
i do have to day at times there is some action and some horror but not much so this game i give to stars for the graphics and for the lack of intrest and funthis isnt necessarily a bad game but i found the difficult controls and awkward fighting to be annoying
fans of max payne halo and other games of that ilk should consider renting this game before buying itafter  minutes of game play my character walked about  miles through thick fog and junk graphics
i came to  deadends and killed like  guys which is really hard when the player control totally sucks
ive played this type of game before and usually they are ok but if this game moved any slower it would be on pause
if you are looking for a game with a creepy feel then this is it
but if you are looking for a game to entertain youpick something else
i was bored to death playing thisthis was my first attempt at the horror genre
the game is certainly creepy and has some great scenes but i didnt find it captivating at all
the game was just too slow
the plot was on the corny side but it had a few nice surprises
i think the biggest problem was that you couldnt just spend an hour here and there for this game
it required large chunks of time to really get into it
too bad because it looked like it had potentialthis game puts you in the captains chair only to be the puppet of your officers
new meaning to the term on rails
i give this game  stars only because combat did raise my blood pressuredownload the demo avoid the gamenba courtsides an entertaining game a very easy game to learn and play
the biggest drawback of this game is that its just too simple
theres practically no skill involved in playing this game
theres very little control over dunks blocks shooting and everything elsethe players and their likenesses are in the game but in terms of skill and everything else its just not there
players reallife talents and abilities are not relfected in the game with the exception of shaq being a poor freethrowerthe graphics are also very generic
the crowd looks very bad
the two announcers are those who call clippers games and are decent but their limited phrases get old really fastone of the minor redeeming qualities of the game is that you can create your own player
this feature is great in that you can customize a large list of physical characteristics about the player
of course when it comes to basketball skills the attributes arent specific enough to make a noticable impact on gameplayso if youre looking for a very simple unrealistic but easytoplay basketball game without much customization this ones for you
if youd actually like skill to be involved in the outcome of a game look elsewherewhile this game may be pretty fun other companys offer so much more and for so much less
this is the prime reason this game was overlooked
if youre looking to buy this then go buy nba k instead
its waaaay betterdont be deceived by the star rating this game inexplicably has on amazon
granted its not the worst game ever but it just doesnt compare favorably to most of the other recent games that ive played for the ps
once the spectacular albeit gory opening cutscene is done its all downhillfirst of all its clear that this was intended to be a ps title originally so its not really fair to compare it to whats currently available for the ps
therefore i have to cut them some slack on the choice to go with painted backdrops instead of a d rendered environment
still they clearly didnt have the talent to make the environments interesting andor beautiful
its not so much that i prefer d environments its just that if youre going to go with backdrops please make them well drawn
shadow hearts backdrops dont even compare favorably to most of squares rpg games for the ps let alone stuff thats available for the psthe dialogue is more often than not skincrawlingly bad
they were apparently trying to be campy and anachronistic however they didnt take it far enough to make it seem deliberate
you could write it off as bad translation but the frequent use of modern american idioms makes me think otherwise
someone at sacnoth just had really bad taste with language
the main character yuri goes from manchild timid to toughguy bravado far too quickly its not clever or funny its just inconsistent writing
alice the pretty young thing and object of everyones desire those programmers really really need to get out more  i mean just look at her skirt is drawn paperthin in terms of character and everyone else is just there as props
the writers also seem to take great glee in presenting you with as much blood and gore as possible
im not sure what the point is
is it supposed to make the game more adult or edgy
its just icky
theres one section of the game when youre pretty much just walking around on bloodsoaked earth and probably entrails and the accompanying sound effects are enough to turn your stomach
yuck
the bad guys name is roger bacon
im sorry thats the most ridiculous name for a villain ive ever heard
yes i understand theres a historical reason for this but come on youre up against a breakfast sidedish
i mean how threatening is that
i went to the store today and i picked up some roger bacon
the subplots are mostly lame you have to go through trials to get to the temple  how original the cutscenes are long and boring ask anyone who has played this game about shloop shloop splat
skreeeee
 and most of your time is spent just hoping you can get to somewhere more interesting than where you are
occasionally there was a wellthoughtout plot point that i enjoyed particularly the parallels between yuri and his father but for the most part its just one dull environment after anotherthe plot itself suffers from serious lack of development
it looks like the programmers and writers simply ran out of time so they wrapped it up as quickly as possible in fact they specifically threw in a notsosubtle selfconscious joke about the fact that they couldnt finish writing the game in time so they had to cut stuff
really sad
the end battle and resulting aftermath is so anticlimactic and boring that i ended up feeling like the whole game was a complete waste of my time
thats  hours of my life that i will never get backthe music is one of the games few strong suits with a pretty good number of catchy tunes
but once again its wildly inconsistent
its  and youve got heavy metal blaring in the opening cutscene
wha huh
the music tends to be fairly inappropriate for a lot of the game but at least its entertainingmost games that feature turnbased combat since final fantasy vii at least tend to involve selecting an action and then you sit there for a good long time while the animation plays out
not so with shadow hearts you have to do a little thumbdancing with the judgment ringtm
overall i find this to be a plus because it adds a little riskreward element
you can elect to just go with the safe route or you can take a risk and go with a more difficult and more damaging option
i like itthe monster and player animation is adequate
not great
every once in a while a character does something clever or amusing and i have to chuckle at the animators sense of humor but meh
ive seen better
for some reason something like  of the monsters are essentially humans hanging upside down or with misplaced limbs or joints
im betting that they found it easier to simply move a few limbs around on a standard humanoid dmodel to create a new monster instead of coming up with something truly originalfor some reason inventory items are limited in the number of characters for the name so you get really stupid and meaningless item names like vbladeblodauth
whathe use of emoticons is reasonably clever but it seems to me that it was mainly implemented for the purpose of cutting down the number of animations or movements that they needed to code
it doesnt really add much and sometimes its a little puzzling like just what is that icon that looks like a teardropto sum up if you do get this game youll probably have a good time but youll have to laugh at some of the ridiculous cliches and other absurdities
overall i give this game  stars as it isnt entirely horrible but its just not quite developed enough to be what i would call average
i would only recommend playing through this game if you intend to also play the sequels which are markedly better in production quality and more deliberate with their use of camp and anachronismboring boring boring so so boring
im not even sure this is a game there is no action and when there is action its crap for every minute of game play you have to sit through about min of a really bad movie story sucks game play sucks because there is none characters suck cut scenes are dull irrelevant and you cant skip through themso far im about ten hours into this game
which isnt saying much
most of the gameplay isnt really gameplay
on average for every hour you play for about ten or fifteen minutes you can actually control what your party does
everything else is just drawn out microcinemas
i am a big fan of all the other ff games but i think they went a little overboard on the cinematic aspect of this game
the graphics are amazing
thats true
im not trying to dispute that
it does however take more than dazzeling graphics to make a game work
i think square sacrificed some of the finer points of gameplay to accomodate the stunning visualsi would recomend this game to anyone because i am loyal to the series and it still may surprise me yet
just be warned to be patient and be ready to put your controller down often
also up until this point the storyline has been relativley flat and dullwhen i got this game i was really up for it
i was in the middle of ffxii buit decided to start on ffx
i had started to play it on my nephews system a year or so ago
anyway i ended up with a ps and decided to get my own copy and start over
the graphics were  star as was the storyline
the design was poor
it was over balanced in so far as the number of battles
you could barely move without getting into another tussle
you start to walk up and talk to someone or get ready to open a chest and another battle
after about  hrs
of this i finally gave it up and took the thing to the used game store
my nephew who lives to do battle said it was way too much for him and it slowed down to a crawl
i ended up with  in the game and i was in the main corridor of the al bhed place
i couldnt move forward because of one battle after another
by this time the game had quit being fun and enjoyable
that was almost  hrs
invested for nothing it went to the used game store
again had they balanced out the game between moving the story along and the occasional battleboss battle it would have been enjoyable
bottom line is that this game is heavily loaded with constant battles with hardly any down time in between
great concept poor execution
charlie s richmond vai was very hyped to try this game out
when i did i was blown away at first but as i progressed through the game i realized how slow and boring it is
the voice acting is ok at times but terrible at most
the story is emotional but the voice actors just couldnt add that to the games characters
which is a shame
id rather read the dialogue like in the previous ff gamesi have played the game for about six hours now
i am truly dissapointed
the storyline develops very slowly not making any sense yet
i wonder why squaresoft introduced the blitzball game it is completely annoying
i have been forcing myself to play just to see if the game gets any better so far nothing
i can only say that this has been the most boring ff i have played so far
previously i had played ff and i had over  hours of gameplay i couldnt play anything else so i am giving this game ffx two stars just because i expect to see some improvement later on i hope my expectations are not wrong
the sphere grid ability system is far from intuitive and i still working on figuring out what to do with the charactersthe good things about this game are the graphics very well done
square is taking on the advantages that the ps console provide in terms of graphics
the voice acting is very well performed also it is really good to hear the characters talk to each other definitely something i missed from previous ff releasesi hope i can come back and rewrite this review and give more stars to it but i can only say for now to those of you who are about to buy this game to hold it and wait rent it play it a day or two and then decide whether you want to purchase this game or not
so far i am planning to sell this game if it doesnt satisfy me the next two dayswow was this game a waste of time
watching my brother play it i didnt think it looked all that great but the music was catchy and the battle system looked interesting so i bought itwhat a mistake that waswell the music is allright at times but only at few certain times
most of the time it is standard at best and thats the games high point along with graphics of coursei wont lie the graphics are great but who cares about graphics in an rpg
i dont the storyline was where the horror all startedblitzball
pleasecouldnt they have come up with anything better
this game is a prime example that squaresoft now square enix is horribly running out of ideas and is seeking the road of desperation
surprisingly this game is made by the team who made  which is amazing
i mean  is my favorite ff game next to  and i cant believe that team made such a horrid rpg
sure there are similarities such as realistic characters and a story that is more involving of the characters themselves but comen ffx is a tragedy
the worst part of the game the part that killed it for me was the sphere grid
oh man where do i start
basically you sit there for long periods of time moving a cursor around this big dark greyblue sphere grid
it is incredibly boring making you constantly click on different nodes and move there and then use certain items to gain abilities
and what happened to leveling up
i guess the geniuses decided to take that out as well
it is really pointless because now exp is taken place by ap which is a substitute in disguise
battling seems much more tedious now and you never truly feel that your characters are getting better especially when you consider how long it takes to master this game
the sphere grid is just too big and too boring
if i wanted to be bored i would play mist or halo or some other computer game
it was cool to be able to play as summons i will give them that but when its better playing as a summon than the actual character you know something has got to be wrongjust avoid this game at all costs unless you want to waste a bunch of your life moving a cursor around a sphere gridfinal fantasy x  is a roleplaying video game developed and published by square as the tenth entry in the final fantasy series
the game marks the final fantasy series transition from entirely prerendered backdrops to fully threedimensional areas and is also the first in the series to feature voice acting
final fantasy x replaces the active time battle atb system with the conditional turnbased battle ctb system and uses a new leveling system called the sphere gridset in the fantasy world of spira the games story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as sin
the player character is tidus a blitzball star who finds himself in spira after his home city of zanarkand is destroyed by sin
shortly after arriving to spira tidus joins the summoner yuna on her pilgrimage to destroy sinlike previous games in the series final fantasy x is presented in a thirdperson perspective with players directly navigating the main character tidus around the world to interact with objects and people
unlike previous games however the world and town maps have been fully integrated with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale
when an enemy is encountered the environment switches to a turnbased battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attackthe gameplay of final fantasy x differs from that of previous final fantasy games in its lack of a topdown perspective world map
earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations used for longdistance traveling
in final fantasy x almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map
regional connections are mostly linear forming a single path through the games locations though an airship becomes available late in the game giving the player the ability to navigate spira faster
like previous games in the series final fantasy x features numerous minigames most notably the fictional underwater sport blitzballfinal fantasy x introduces the conditional turnbased battle system in place of the series traditional active time battle system first used in final fantasy iv
whereas the atb concept features realtime elements the ctb system is a turnbased format that pauses the battle during each of the players turns
thus the ctb design allows the player to select an action without time pressure
a graphical timeline along the upperright side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns
the player can control up to three characters in battle though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time
limit breaks highlydamaging special attacks reappear in final fantasy x as overdrives
in this new incarnation of the feature most of the techniques are interactive requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness
while initially the overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock themfinal fantasy x introduces an overhaul of the summoning system employed in previous games of the series
whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive perform one action and then depart the aeons of final fantasy x arrive and entirely replace the battle party fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle is defeated itself or is dismissed by the player
aeons have their own statistics commands special attacks spells and overdrives
the player acquires five aeons over the course of the game but three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various sidequeststhe game has enjoyed high review scores from japanese and western critics
the japanese video game magazine famitsu and famitsu ps awarded the game a nearperfect  score and readers of the former magazine voted it the best game of all time in early  another japanese gaming magazine the play station gave the game a score of 
famitsu famitsu ps and the play station expressed particularly favorable responses toward the games storyline graphics and movies
the game maintains a  approval rating on gamerankings and  out of  on metacritic
producer shinji hashimoto stated that the overall reception to the game was excellent having received praise and awards from the mediaigns david smith offered praise for the voice actors and the innovations in gameplay particularly with the revised battle and summon systems the option to change party members during battle and the character development and inventory management systems
they also felt that the games graphics had improved on its predecessors in every way possible and that the game as a whole was the bestlooking game of the series and arguably the bestplaying as well
greg kasavin of gamespot praised the games storyline calling it surprisingly complex its ending satisfying and its avoidance of roleplaying game clicheacutes commendable with tidus viewed as an appealing protagonist
he also lauded the music feeling it was diverse and well suited to the various scenes in the game
similarly gamepro described its character building system and battle system as two of the best innovations in the series
the visuals of the game were commended by gamespys raymond padilla who referred to them as topnotch as well as giving praise to the character models backgrounds cutscenes and animations
the voice casting was praised by game revolution who noted most of them were above average and called the music richedge rated the game considerably lower criticizing many aspects of the game for being tedious and uninnovative and describing the dialogue as nauseating particularly panning tidus
andrew reiner of game informer criticized the games linearity and that players were no longer able to travel the world by chocobo or control the airship
eurogamers tom bramwell noted that the games puzzle segments were depressing and superfluous and that although the sphere grid was a nice touch it took up too much of the game
the linearity of the game was positively commented on by gamepro who stated that a player would not be required to participate in sidequests or the minigame to reach the games conclusion finding some of them unappealing
game revolution complained that cutscenes could not be skipped some even being too longi dont understand why some people love this game
from the obnoxious voice acting to the obnoxious characters to the mindnumbingly boring plot there are no saving graces of this waste of energyi should have quit playing after ten hours but i deluded myself into thinking it was going to get better
yes there are a few surprise plot twists but they were predictable
combat was interesting but got old real fast
the leveling system was neat but only superficially so
the cut scenes were plentiful and by plentiful i mean too manyand dont get me started on blitzballafter the masterpiece which was the seventh game the final fantasy series slipped with part eight
part nine lifted the series but this tenth one just about killed it for me
i have yet to play xii but if its just as bad as x then im finished with the final fantasy seriesyes the plot is great and the game starts off really fun
and it has so many elements in there that make you enjoy it
however as you reach toward the end of the game the battles start getting ridiculously hard
if you are a game pro or you start off by following some game guide from the very beginning maybe its not a problem coz by the time you reach the end your characters are strong enough and you would have enough items to support yourself in the battles
but fact is not everyone is a game pro or has some guide to follow
we shouldnt have to
the games difficulty should be reasonable for everyone as long as they play through
but apparently if you dont do well enough in the beginning then the game will become very miserable for you at the end coz you have to rely on luck to win
its a punishment for not being pro enough
and youre pretty much screwed unless you have to mood and time to go back and start off again
there are other flaws as well
for example the game maker could be a lot nicer by adding an item description when youre trying to use items during the battle
some very useful items for battles are not available for sale
you will get frustrated as you reach toward the end and that misses the whole point of playing a gamethis may shock you but i really dont think this game is the classic everyone says it isthe goodthe ability to tag your party members in and out is really neatthe summons actually stay and fight instead of attacking once and going away
 i was amazed by this the first time i played it
there is some exploration and hidden eons at end gamethe badeveryone is really good at killing a certain kind of monster turning random battles into rock paper scissors
tidus for the lizards auron for the shells lulu for the elementals rikku for machines ect
this wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt so prominent
you will literally go through most of the game oneshotting anything that isnt a boss monster and dont even get me started on stonetouch weaponsthe voice acting is cringe worthymost of the game is a linier to the point most of the game world feels like a giant hallwaythe other characters are infinitely more interesting than tidus
which is bad because hes narrating the story
the blitzballthe plotholesthe mehthe art style will either be hilariously camp or jarring to the point it takes you out of the story or bothi mean the whole thing just screams cosplay this
i dare ya
in conclusionif you like this game then good for youif you dont then im honestly not that surprisedwhen i played final fantasy x it felt like pokemon but with really cool monsters and a great plot
now dont get me wrong pokemon was a great game but on playstation i expect a little better
so what do you do
walk around unimaginative maps where you have absolutely no freedom to explore
then at any moment the screen flashes and a monster appears that you must battle with your own
the battles are fought entirely on boring menus
when you kill a monster you are bombarded by huge meaningless numbers
the whole game just screams pokemon
yawnplease note that the  stars is on the final fantasy scale in the sence that its still pretty good but that there are much better episodes out there like  and though the voices are a necessary change from the old word boxes some of the narration sounds like the narration in quotthe wonder yearsquot which often take some of the seriousness from the storyline
some of the voices are good like lulu and auron but yuna is downright bad
it sounds frequently like shes reading right of the script for the first time
and with tiduss overthetop personality his voice begins to grate on you as well
i still welcome it though because it makes life easier not having to read they just need to find some better actors and charactersthe new battlesystems gave me mixed feelings
the good part is that you can change characters at any point in the battle
the bad part is that only yuna can summon the aeons only lulu can use black magic and so onone of the better parts of this episode is the new sphere grid that allows you to advance your characters
i have yet to fully understand the old systems so even though this one took some time getting used to its alot easier though i latched onto how to do it a bit too far in the game so i may just be skrewedas i mentioned earlier alot of the characters are below average as far as the ff series is concerned
there are two specifically that are just the worst and they are the two main characters  tidus and yuna
to be honest i couldnt care less about their tepid romance and it got me all excited when we find out that to defeat sin she has to die dont worry this is not a spoiler the news comes midway throught the story and it isnt really surprisingthe plot is average as ffs go
typical battle plot against the backround of a developing romance of the two main characters
not much shocking stuff happend herebecause its been done beforeoverall id recomend you buy this anyway if for no other reason but the improved movies and graphics in general and to have a fantasy for the ps platform
i also think youll get a kick out of the voices theyre pretty funny after awhileok when this game came out i ran not walked to buy itboy was i in for a nasty surprise
the gameplay is awful i dont know what else to sayi found my self in one annoying battle after another i mean in the beginning it was reasonable but further on i found my self in impossible to the point of screaming with frusteration battles
ok the graphics are breathtaking i have never even seen something so real and the story line is to die for
another thingthey have extremely complacated and wacko systems i felt like i was in algebra class
tutorial after tutorial and none making sense
also it is almost all movie
ok though the story line is so amazing it didnt bother me but then i found that every  steps i was in a unfair impossible battle and would die and have to start all over again
ahhh
that is when i took the game backi suggest renting and if you like it i did in the beginning try to get a few levels past blitzball that is when the  steps and a battle where enemies get  or  turns each taking  to  hp ok often you dont even get a move before you are dead
before you buy itps   well its going to ps   revamped  but the story is fast its mostly long beocuse of the required long  fights  while  not  movong  closer to the endwell there were great graphics the plot was cheesy the characters were idiots and the game play was horrible
im sorry but i couldnt stand this game
the further i got the more i grew to hate it
you do all this reapetitive fighting to get to maybe a few seconds of great graphics
they liked to talk to lot to
i guess thats what role playing games do but these characters were just so dumb
so if you havent gotten this game and dont know why you havent now you knowsquaresoft and final fantasy games usually get great reviews
the voice acting really sucks the actors sound like theyre reading emotionlessly
but the fact that it has voice acting at all is pretty neat
pretty boring
i guess if youve played any ff its just the same as the one before it but with better graphics
speaking of graphics this game is total eye candy
the sweetest graphics ive ever seen
the only thing i dont like about the graphics are that they are too bright happy and colorful
i havent played much yet only about  hours or so but im pretty sure im going to just abandon it until i finish playing shadow hearts
with the realtime expressions and voice acting instead of text this game really should be fun
i guess im probably just sick of playing these ff games
but knowing myself ill probably fire up the gameshark  and play it quick just to see the movieswith a hugely absorbing plot and some beautifullyexecuted longoverdue ingame enhancements final fantasy x ought to have been the standardbearing megagame that we all expected it to besadly thanks in no small part to a very limiting control system and very little room for gameplay freedom ff x instead descends into the bargain bin of pretty games sans substanceplayers control a young man named tidus a blondhaired juvenilevoiced blitzball player who after his city is attacked by an evil force called sin his guardian auran takes him to another world to uncover his heritage and save the universe from sin
from there you get to recruit bigger and better players and there is as always a multitude of nice extras and sidequests that
in theory add colour and excitement to the gamefirst the good points
the graphics are astounding with large beautifullydetailed characters and bad guys maintaining a very impressive framerate onscreen
music is fairly standard ff fare stirring battle tunes and ososweet ballady tracks adding much atmosphere to the proceedings
the voice acting has been unfairly criticised its good and a hugely welcome change from endless reams of text to wade through
its also easier to remember plot points when you hear them and theres no danger of skipping over them with a cancel button
however this is customisable and you can have the audio with or without subtitlesthe plot on paper is one of the best ff plots around  detailed and complex without being confusing its the stuff of solid games legendsunfortunately though none of these points can save ff x from the ingame mechanics and this is where ff x fails badly
the shrines and cityscapes of ff x are beautifuly detailed and bear exploring and the fact that one can learn the language of al bhed are excellent points both worthy of exploring at ones leisure
however thanks to the hugely restrictive gameonrails nature of ff x its oftentimes impossible to go where you want to go or to prepare for the bigger battles
this affects the storyline too as major events for the first part of the game are few and far between and so fighting beasties to build up your levels becomes such a choreplodding along you very quickly get a sense of not having much to do with the game itself that youre just there to watch events unfold and press the x button intermittently
and for some gamers thats fine but aftermagnificent titles like ff vii and ff ix its not really good enough for a ff sequel
also blitzball is possibly one of the most overcomplicated side quests ever really worthy of being a game in itselfa disappointment that could so very easily have been an unequivocal classic ff x is really a rentbeforeyoubuy titlethis game could be good
if they had a more variety of moves and a more variety of types of matches and arenas
it doesnt have some of the great people i though it would like ken shamrock and some others
but it lacks variety
id choose wwf raw over this anyday
this game is straight up garbage
the people who rate this game good obviously dont have good taste or they are just too big of ufc fans
please for your own sake do not buy this game everoriginal thoughts upon first starting the game i have the dvd version of this game and this is the first day i have played it
i have to say the install went well very few options to choose from in the dvd version
apparently in the cd rom version you can select how much to load onto the hdd but you dont get that option here
according to the website this is most likely because the speed of a dvd rom drive is so fast there is no need
unfortunately despite the speed of the dvd drive the game play is so choppy that its unplayablethe recommendation from the vendor web site says that if your game play is choppy turn the soundmusic off
that doesnt make for a very interesting game if you dont have music in the background
i did turn the music off and it does make a difference but the choppy scrolling and pausing is still there plus no music
the game seems to pause the dvd every time you finish scrolling or moving which means it has to spin back up if you want to move and scroll again
this on a p machine seems a bit too problematic for the game to be any fun at alli agree wholeheartedly with other reviews too the acting is a bit blah
when you read mission logs from some of the scientists you can see them reading from cue cards pretty much
though the game isnt about the acting its about the puzzle solvingjust for grins i went onto the vendor web site and looked in the game hints section
i have to say that the first hint presented on the page is simply mind boggling
not only are there random sequences built into the game so that each game is different and each time you play it it is different but all the mathematics involved seems to be quite counter intuitive
im not a meteorologist so tracking weather patterns isnt my forte
so i have no clue how to get past the main first puzzle without reading that hintall in all after only  minutes of game play im quite disappointed
there is one thing to make a puzzle challenging quite another to make it so random that game play ceases to be funfinal thoughts after finishing the game  i have finished the game now
amazingly quickly
mostly because after you visit three worldsthats it
done
there are so many features of the game and especially of the ship that you never get to learn about because the game ends so abruptly
i was able to get around a lot of the choppy game play by disabling all virus scanning programs before starting the game as well as closing any other open programs even things like my printer manageragain many more hard and counterintuitive puzzles through the rest of the game
there were some neat sound effects with bells you had to ring in certain orders etcand cool water effects
unfortunately since i had worked so hard on the puzzles i felt like the end of the game was a real letdown
there should have been several more worlds to encounter before solving the game and much more of the vivid scenario that you should be able to interact with
its almost as if the game ended just as it got really interesting this game could have a been a world better
the premise is that you are in a theme park and you must complete quotridesquot which are basically mini games that take a few attempts to master and once youre donethats itwhile it is cool to see different characters woody woodpecker frankenstien the map is difficult to move around in
there is no real replay value once youve finished the game
it will just set on the shelfits a definate bargain basket game if the price is low enough because of the great graphics and the fact that the mini games are somewhat fun
but it is fatally flawed with a lack of orginality and low replay valuefirst lets just say that this game sounds awesome
so you order it
get it then play it
then you will say  why did i waste  on this
good questionfirst i will say the visuals of the park are excellent
that is the only reason it got  stars in my rating
but that is where it all ends
you start out at the beginning of the park looking for a park map
you walk around talk to people and woody woodpecker who are trying to give you clues as to what to do next
well you dont need clues
all you do is go to each attraction which are back to the future backdraft lost world jaws et
and western world complete the tasks or minigames for each attraction and get a stamp
oh i forgot the big challenge is to find all of the letters in the park that spell out universal studios
of course it is no challenge at all
once you have collected all of the stamps and have seen the hollywood magic show the game ends
i finished it in  hoursthere is only one possible purpose to this game advertisement for universal studios
maybe it is good and challenging for young kidsunder otherwise dont waste your money
rent it first to see if you like it but i doubt you willan excellent game idea
i played the first and fell in love with it way back when
this newest version though is a big disappointment
it doesnt have hardly any of the original style that made the first so fun and the interface on this one is horrible
there is no real handheld manual for such a complicated game only ingame and that is vague at best
learning how to do something as eventually vital as build a fleet in order to defend or invade is hilariously ridiculous
at the time this series began it was close to the only one like it and easily worth it but its clear theyve lost the magic and the point with this one
pass it byi cant get this game to run on my computer
it is having display issues
its either too large cutting things off or things are just plain invisible
ive tried reinstalling twice
mooii is my absolute favorite game and i had high hopes for this onefirst off when i heard moo was coming out i was excited
more excited because the rumor was that if moo was successful a master of magic  might be developedi read all the horrible reviews that everyone wrote and thought to myself hey i loved moo moo mom civ and just about every other turn based strategy game out there
ill have to like this
i figured all the negative reviews were just by people who get frustrated by complexitythe game is complex
very complex
i consider myself a pretty intelligent guy
im college educated
ive been playing strategy games for a long time
i have no clue the the fbomb is going with the economics and research aspects of the game
im sure a lot of time and effort went into developing this side of the game but personally i find us income taxes much easier to understand than thisive put in about  hours of game playing and im pretty much giving up
i kept thinking that im missing something and the game will get fun after just  or  more turns
the game just isnt fun
i dont mind playing for an hour to get into the game to get the challenge going getting setup in civ and developing cities takes time for the later battle
but the game is just missing the fun aspecteand the most depressing part i sincerely hope they do make a momjust dont let quicksilver developers touch itif youve played the original or part  of master of orion moo then you have an appreciation for all that this game could have been
moo  is not the same game as found in its ancestors
too much has been layered over and too much has been relegated to the closetthe basic premise of guiding your civilization through various science fiction phases of development is still here  but in a much more complex confusing and overbearing manner
sure there are ways to automate many things  but what fun is a simulation game if the simulator is simulating it
and if you attempt to micromanage everything yourself which i have to do in such a game then the cumbersome and often clumsy interface and mannerisms of moo  become apparentgraphics  sound  the music and sound were nothing to write home about
adequate but not impressive
which is unfortunate in a scifi game where so many elements and moods could have been introduced so many alien sounds could have been but arent  the graphics in my opinion were quite good
the game doesnt need overly complex graphics to succeed but the visuals in this game when appropriate were quite satisfying
there is a good look to the alien races and management screensgameplay the interface is clumsy and cumbersome the tools you need to use are buried in the management menus and pulldowns
exploring and experimenting with various buttons levers whistles and yoyos consumes an insane amount of time
the game fails to incorporate the important and minor stuff into one easilyaccessed package  developing your civilization can be very rewarding in a game like this but moo  because of its clumsy interface and very confusing research trees fails to give you a sense of accomplishment
researching some new stellar technology is nothing more than getting an okay its done what do you want next
promptperformance if your pc meets the requirements on the box you shouldnt have any problems
i tried the game on two differently configured systems midrange and highend and had no problems if you have performance issues turn down the various sound or graphic options in game also check for video card  sound driver updates for your system and finally disable any background programs like virus scanners before running stars for potential the rest were lost for not realizing the potential take careyeah im a little late in writting a review for this game about three years
i decided to write one now because i bought this game the day it came out and just within these past few months of  i actually figured out how the game actually works
it definitely has a high learning curve i must of had  or so hours in playing this game before i was even a novice at it
to say its complicated is a serious understatement
theres so many settings and buttons that it reminds me of one of those purposly complicated chain of machines and gadgets they use to do simple things like open doors for fun
just when you think you have it figured out something happens that makes you throw a drink across the room and shout why the  is it doing that
the main weakness in the game is the manual i think it simply doesnt do a good job of explaining how the game actually works
only about  of the features and interactions are explained in it
youre basically on your own to figure out everything else which leads to a mountain of questions
heck it took me about two years of playing the game on and off before i actually figured out how to create a task force
other questions still haunt me with no answers to be found
can you disband a ground force unit
do they actually cost maintenance like the manual says
anyonesupposidly the game has a lot of automation features that make it easier for you
unfortunatly these never work the way you want them too
i cant count how many times ive been in the thick of a war only to find that all my colonies are building scouts and colony ships rather than warships
great the enemy is pounding away at our borders but i got  colony ships in reserve thanks a lot
id like to say that the planetary ai feature does some things right but it really doesnt
instead of setting an compromised steady financial setting it usually likes to just run the colony into the ground for a few turns then do nothing at all for a few turns to fix the damagethe fix of course is to simply turn all the automation off and do everything by yourself
whichcan be quite a task when youre controling  or  worlds
a single turn can take upwards of around  minutes like this usually it takes about  to win the game
its kind of sad that this is all the game is about when it comes down to it
about  of your time is simply going to be spent on getting your colonies to do what you want them too when supposidly its supposed to be done for youof courseall this frustration has to be leading to something really good right
nope
the battles systems ispretty basic
there really is no room for strategy brute force always wins
the ground combat system is laughably simple yet confusing as to how it workswhich leads me to my next rant  taking planets from enemys
thisis extremely difficult
invading a system and destroying and local fleets and planetary defences is actually the easy part of invading
the hard part is what to do next
do you want to just destroy the colony on the planet
or do you want to invade the planet and control it yourselfwellif you want to choose the wisest path and just nuke the colony you got yet another headache in store for you
its basically darn near impossible to do so
it can and does take about  turns of orbital bombardment to destroy a colony as opposed to the one or two in moo
the only time effiecent method is to invade with ground forces and take the colony for yourself
this leads to yet another series of headaches
for one the ground battle system is kind of a masterpiece in that it is both idiotically simple and complicated at the same time
you get to choose from about  different battle tactics on how youre going to assault the planet without any explanation at all on the benifits or weaknesses of any of them
basically its just a matter of guessing and hoping for luck
if you do conquer the planet youre in control of all the alien race there
this isnt so great because the ai isnt very picky in choosing planets so you usually end up with a real dump yet another planet you have to manually control with a population thats useless to you
you cant really create things like colony ships there because theyll create ones of their race not yours
so on top of the mountain of frustrations you have already you get another somehow finding a way to keep your entire empire populated by your original race for simplicitys sakeill stop before i get to far into this rest assured i could write pages more of the headaches you have to deal with but you get the idea
the only other thing i want to mention is the interface really is a terrible design
the first thing i learned in my freshman vb class was to make the interface user friendly number  priority these designers had a whole different agenda
i wont go into many details but let me ask you this  when you go to file then save as then click a file it asks if you want to overwrite the file
as an industry standard which side of the little menu is ok and cancel on
ok is on the left
of course the designers of moo just felt the need to be different and cause tons and tons of frustration for people who blindly think that clicking on the left button saves the gameall in all i play the game because i want to like itnot really because i doits waaaaaaay to simple it takes  minute a mission thats  times  it equals  minutes of gameplay that not even two hours
even oon hard mode its simple
im sorry i just dont understand why it got peoples choice but i hate it
but the graphics are all right and the fighting is all right thats why it got  stars
but its just way to simple even on hard moderated a   the outdoor areas are fun to swing around very beautiful
however the inside places are different webslinging doesnt seem designed for indoors
the fighting makes up a whole lot of the game unfortunately the fighting is so completely dull and lame
the graphics indoors look like good ps visuals
the cinema scenes are absolutely horrid on ps they were ok here on gamecube they are inexcusable
some more work should have been done to improve character models for gc and xbox
there are more camera issues it seems than last time out theres an option to use c to help out but it doesnt much
sometimes spideyll be stuck on walls or pillars
try picking up an item with b and then walking around indoors using c a lot of the voices are great bruce campbell tobey maguire norman osbornguy scorpion its nice to have some of the stars of the film
bruce campbell as the ingame host is spectacular
i dislike how much they strived to make peter parkers face look more like mr maguire than the character sleepy blue eyes
characters like the vulture thugs and mary jane are bad how many times can this game say ugly or freak
there are about  oneliners which helps to engage but i disliked having to hear thugs say the exact same thing all the time
also the music is quite repetitive very much like lame movie sonic wallpaper sprawling sometimes ambient at others very noticeably in the wrong place at the wrong time
overall it sounds like star wars prequel music but nothing like danny elfmans spiderman score
overall this is a solid rental especially if you liked the original but shouldve been more nextgeneration and immersive there could be a metal gear solid style quality spidey gamethis game really stinksgraphics are the only thing that would save it from a  starnice explosionsgameplay is boring and not exciting only fun when you fight in the air like the vulture
way too easy to beatand also when you swing in the airyou can basically swing forever
but whats strange is that youre web shoots to the sky when you swing and doesnt get on a buildingthe web gets on the sky
spiderman looks retarded when hes swingingsound is bad execpt for the voice acting
dialogue sounds awfula badmediocre game
do not buy a waste of youre moneythis game isnt nearly worth what i payed for it
the camera for the game is backwords and you cant fix it and it has other camera glitches that get very irritating
i decided to get a cheat so i could play the last level instead of wasting my time but five minutes looking for the cheat wasnt worth playing the last level
i beat spiderman  for the playstation  at least  times and i would recommend it instead of spiderman the movie if you have a playstation first off do not buy this game
the controls are totally messed up because spiderman might keep running when you try to make him stop and when you are webswinging you stick onto any wall you bump into
id also like to add that this game is very short
it is only a mere ten levels four of which are very easy and a few minigames which quickly get old
the graphics are a small con but still affect the game nonetheless
the only place where graphics are good are the movie sequences
overall do not get this game rent it
it isnt worth fifty bucksplay as spiderman with all these intense featuresa big outside world you can look at and the small portion you can actually visit
swing through the skies with the speed of granny on the porch swing
try to chase villains who are much faster than you
play chase levels against them over and over and over again until you memorize where theyre going because your maximum speed is far to slow to possibly catch them directly
die instantly if you ever even think of touching the ground
play mostly inside levels
its silly to play outsidedoing what hes actually famous for
enjoy a series of short painful levels where your death to a boss means redoing  mins work
now add stealth to those missionsrock onandintroducing the most challenging foe ever in a video game
the game camera
yes you too can try to fight dozens of villains some shooting at you without actually being able to see any of them
die yet again from a gunshot that you couldnt see and had no chance to avoid anyway
use the wicked awesome lockon feature that keeps the camera focused on your villainexcept when it randomly refuses to work
coolbut wait
theres more
order now and well let the camera angle randomly change your controls and send you in a different direction than you wanted
its spidertasticim a big fan of spiderman games going way back
maximum carnage was one of my favorites on the old sega genesis and i really loved the ps spiderman which uses a similar engine
here you do get spiderman and yes theres decent production value to the game but it has a lot wrong with it
i found it a chore to play on hero mode so i could unlock the goblin and at least then i could play through again with a decent character
adding the goblin and giving a storyline was just an incredibly cool ideathe camera is easily the worst ive ever seen in any game and the voice acting with the exception of bruce campbell during the tutorial sounds like nobody wants to be there recording it
toby especially he just kind of sounded tired reciting his linesthe only reason i gave this even  stars is because you can unlock goblin which is a cool idea if nothing else
yeah you can play this game but a lot of other games are better
it seems many people disliked the game but i likedmarvel nemesis rise of the imperfectsbetter than this
you might give it a tryif you only have a gamecube and have few choices in spiderman games get this if its cheap but its just not the greatest spiderman game out therepatientdoctori feel enclosed in many levelsthe first was okay with the free swinging actionbut thenthere was no room to fightno room to fight
sobpeter would say things over and over againi couldnt take it anymorehe wouldnt shutupthat is why i did itthats right i broke the disk and im proudproud proudproudi would do it again too
and againagainhahhahhah hapolice officewhats wrong with himshrinkit seems he has  of  syndromespiderman is a stupid game
it is really boring and hard
dont buy it unles you love spiderman
the controls are horrible too
i hate this gamebla
its not very good and the gameplay combos are almost exactly the same as spiderman  on the ps
plus its soooooooooo soooooooooo soooooooooo soooooooooo hardright off the bat you see the main problem is the crappy controls
also the fighting feels like some cheap double dragon ripoff
i didnt get very far in this because there are just so many better options out therewhen i originally played this game i remember thinking how badly it sucked and how horrible the controls were
however over time i told myself how i must have been mistaken
how could the game be as bad as i remember it when everyone in the gaming community loved this game to pieces
clearly i was mistaken
years have passed and i never broke it out again until nowfirst let me just say that for an early ps game release the graphics are astounding
its has lens flares and isnt even very choppy which is unusual for a ps game as well
overall in terms of graphics this game was incredible
true the models werent that great but they were passablethe sound was great
how could it not be
tobey maguire and willem dafoe lend their voice talents to the game to help give it that authentic spidey movie feel
then as if that wasnt enough they tossed in bruce campbell as the narratortour guide just to bump the game up to cult status
the music and sound effects were brilliant and quite realistic
however it was slightly dated but again i cant stress this enough its from the ps and is  years oldthat was the good stuffthe controls were just as bad as i remember
i mean horrible
however it should be noted that most games released during that video game era had horrible controls
still this is worse than most of those
it could have been a much smoother experience especially since the ps controller is virtually identical to the ps controller
i see no reason why they couldnt take the time to make a smooth control scheme like games have todayin terms of difficulty it wasnt as hard as i remember it being however the game is by no means a cakewalk
it is difficult and at time frustratingly so although i feel a lot of that has to do with the controls
i cant begin to tell you how many times i would find myself stuck to a wall clinging there while being shot atstill the game has some level of fun factor especially if you are an avid spidey fan and with the new spiderman reboot being out it might be fun to flash back to the originalspiderman is sooo whimpy in this game
i wonder if the people who made this game know that in the comics spiderman can bench press ten tons
you have to beat on a simple crook several times to get him to go down
that is so unlike spiderman that its absurd
whats worse the bad guys often come at you in large groups making them almost impossible to defeateach level gets progressivly more difficult and more frustrating
i finally reached one level that had tons of traps and robotsi cant get any farther
that was the first day i had the game
i would strongly suggest renting this one instead of buying it if you must try itokay first of all you cant walk on the ground i mean they wouldve been better off putting clouds under you again
another thing where exactly does his webbing connect to
the clouds
another thing you cant sneak up on anyone
it has no stealth
once you hit one person from the ceiling everyone else comes after you
another thing is that the game is way too dark at times
it gets to a point where you have to turn your tv on bright
and then theres the camera angles
most of the time it isnt the enemy killing you its the camera
it messes up every  seconds
then graphics they start off good
but the farther you go into the game the worse they get
plus its way too short
and it gets boring after the first  days youve played it
it can be pretty hard every now and then
the controls are just flat out bad
sometimes they even reverse on you
so trust me dont get your hopes up thinking this game is as good as the movie
or you will be greatly disappointed because this really isnt activisions best work if anything rent it insteadthis game is really cool but it just gets too hard after four or five levels
i own this game but i have never beat it because its just too hard
it seems like its only made for the expert gamers
wolverines revenge is better as far as superhero games goin their rush to release this game for ps they forgot some very important pieces to this game
the team list is missing a large group of teams
i think somewhere around  teams
no season mode
this is the most glaring mistake
how can you have a basketball game like this and not have a season mode
no dynasty mode
once again big mistake leaving this outthe gameplay is fun but without the above items this game only goes so far
and that isnt nearly far enoughdont get this gamethis game is only mediocore
the game has good graphics but bad sound effects
it takes no advantages over the geforce  and radeon  gpus and it doesnt even use eax sound mode
the game has brainless gameplay which makes the game very repetetive after a few weeks
the only thing i found that the game has as a strong point is that i have never had as many enemies run at me at the same timesonic just isnt the same in d and this game proves it
when you control sonic the game is fun but you are not given the option to be sonic the whole game and you end up going on tedious and annoying treasure hunts with knuckles and terrible mech action with tails
with sonic being the sole character the game would have been a lot better but even still the series just isnt as entertaining in a d worldsonic ab is a mediocre game plain and simpleprosfun  playersome fun levelsconsaverage graphicsbad cameraawful voice actingno four player racingterrible storyi wish that sega would get it throught there heads
sonic is not a d game
i loved it back when it was a classic bit genisis game
if they could make a d sonic with gamecube quality graphics it would rock
oh and take out that chao garbage
it is not fun
in fact that is what gave the game a  instead of a 
get sonic for the gameboy
that is a truly fun experiancei buy and sell hundreds of used video games over the internet mostly playstation games
the drawback to buying used games is that often you get a copy that looks like sand paper as been run over it
why people treat their games like this i dont know
so it came to pass that i bought the game doctor in hopes that it would clean my games before i sell them
the game doctor boasts versatility and can apparently remove smudges fingerprints light to deep scratches and scuffs
in truth it does very little to improve the problemsfor fingerprints and the like use a cloth
only use this product if the game is so badly scratched that it is unplayable
usually i wont buy a game in that condition
i used this on a copy of final fantasy anthology that needed some light cleaning and it nearly ruined it
not only is the game rare but the game doctor drove down the value of the game by engraving a circular patten on the disc
all this does is sandblast the top layer off the disc
if the scratch is super deep it will still be thereoverall this is a waste of money
it doesnt even do a fraction of what it says it does and does a very mediocre job at what it can do
to avoid needing one either take better care of your games or be more careful with checking the quality of the games you buywhat a terrible game
the whole point of this game is to loot stores and cause chaos without getting caught or killed
there seemed to be a lot of hype surrounding this game because of its violent nature but that died down when people realized that it was boring
theres only so many times you want to do the same thing over and over
dont bother with this gameafter playing and thoroughly enjoying gta by rock star i was looking forward to another game that played similar
i thought that soe was going to be a similar type game to gta except with the feature of total destruction of your surroundings and with hundreds of people on the screen at once
and i was right to an extent
you can destroy your surroundings in soe and there are loads of people on the screen at once but it didnt have the same zeal that gta had
soe played kind of like a final fight type game or something
run around punching and kicking blowing stuff up which i know sounds like fun but it gets old real fastnow i realize that my expectations were very high after gta maybe way too high to be honest
i guess i figured that this game was going to be like gta except with lots of people on the screen and with the ability to destroy your surroundings
what i got when i put it in was a cartoony freeforall fight
sure there are missions to perform but they seemed uninspired and got boring pretty quicklysure the game is violent but its got a cartoony type violence to it
the characters in the game are colorful but not realistic
and this may be another aspect that i was expecting to be more like gta which had a more realistic look and feel to it
not to say that aspect of the game was bad just not really my stylenow i realize that this game is not gta even though i was hoping that it would be just like it
its just that the game was not what i was expecting at all
again i was thinking that it would at least be similar to gta except with lots of people on the screen at once
which is another thing about the game
sure its kind of neat to see that many people on the screen at once but after a while it gets a bit annoying
where are all these people going anyways
they just run around and act hysterical doesnt make much sense
but its a video game and i suppose it doesnt have to make sensefor people that plan on buying soe on the strength of how good gta is i would say dont
its not the same game or even close in my opinion
i would recommend renting it first and see if its your type of game
i imagine that some will really like the game i just know it wasnt for mewell the good thing i did do was trade the game in for maximo ghosts to glory and so far i have been real happy with that decision
i should have got maximo to begin with but live and learn i guessthis game is not really my thing
it seems to be a cheapened version of gta
gta was a game that had a lot of class style grandiose feel
i strove to delve deeper into gtas engrossing missions there are obvious reason to compare these two gamesstate of emergency offers  modes of play revolution  kaos
i started the game by playing the kaos mode in which you sole feat is to score as many points possible and keep the clock running as long as you can
if you are familiar with crazy taxi think along those lines
the main charcter rips his way through mallchinatown wreaking havoc etc
after playing this mode for an hour and a half i was like
ok  breaking windows in the mall is now no longer any fun
i was very surprised to see how noninteractive the envirnments are compared to gta   you cant jump in soe and going up and down in elevators is restrictive
the fact that there are  some odd characters on the screen may be a feat as far as games go but it doesnt actually add to the game
it is chaotic which i guess is the point though
i simply found it annoying
shock value aside this game just does not offer the degree of freedom that gta didi then tried the revolution mode
i started doing missions for characters who were just standing in corners of malls
no character introduction or development here just more bland missions for some schlub i didnt even care about soe however is a mere mindless scramble through an environment that involves little to no depth or strategyi give the game a  overall
owhen i first heard about this game in late early  i was pretty stoked
i mean it was from rockstar games the people who brought us the almighty gta series and it was about rioting
i figured it would be like gta vice city wasnt out at the time remember
 and i could riot and cause all kinds of damage to a town
sweetwell i bought the game and for the first ten minutes i loved it
then it got a little boring
the next day i started actually doing missions in revolution mode
boy talk about repetitive
no spoken dialogue no real variety etc
hell some of them werent even that fun
and some were just plain flatout impossible
take one mission please note that this one happens pretty early in the game it is your duty to protect some guy while he goes into a jewelry store something about a bomb i dont remember
sounds easy right
heh heh
wrong
about  different guys start swarming the entrance and if even one gets in mission failed
 my dualshock  controller is now slightly dinged thanks to that missionthe chaos mode was a little better though and keeps me from giving this game the dreaded lonestar review
in this one you could just go completely crazy and destroy stuff
but even this mode has its faults
for instance  of the time you get a significant amount of points taken off if you kill any civilian
huh
and even without it the game gets quite boringi ended up selling this game to a video game store for a lousy  store credit card that got ruined because i left it in my pants pocket and it went through the wash and i had to throw it away
no big loss
i really wanted to like this game but its just not that good
save your money and just stick with the gta series if its violence youre afteror of course you could just give me a billion quotnot helpfulquot votesalthough this game is entertaining its gets old fast and repetitive
the goals are timed and a little too coached
if your a kid youll love this game but if your a little more mature and like a more realistic feel to a game get gta
i wished i had not wasted my money on this game but with any game its a gamble
if you want a hot new game i suggest maximo
now there is a fun game with all the goodiesi dont know what to make of this game
i think the idea is for it to be serious but i wound up laughing at this game while playing it
you are going against the corporation and all hll breaks loose
for that matter everything breaks loose
the crowd is all rioting by breaking into stores and stealling
you go around with your trusty baseball bat and club people to a nice pulp
but wait till the cops get a hold of you
you wont be a happy camper for long
basically the idea is interesting if not a little warped
but the final verdict is that it is boring to play and has very little story line if any to keep you wanting more
i would say i got a few good laughs out of it
you havent lived until you have seen a town go on a riot rampage
speaks volumes about how rockstar sees society
lots of people were looking forward to this game
it is luck that there wasnt a riot after they found out how poor the game was
good thing i only borrowed the gameyup
but it is good at wearing out your thumb
i can imagine how many people will want to buy this game given that rockstar made the great gta
just dont let the name fool you  this game is just a lot of headache theres way too much going on on the screen at one time and its near impossible to concentrate on the game hero
the game is basically a specialized gta centered on beating people up and breaking things except its nowhere near as realistic you can run straight through people and the amount of detail is miniscule compared to gtaoverall i strongly recommend renting this game first
once you do im quite sure you wont want to buy it
everyone is everywhere at once and you will find yourself jamming the buttons mindlesslyits always disappointing when something doesnt live up to its hype
video games are an institution based on hype with mixed results ataris et didnt work but nintendos super mario  was a great game
mechwarrior  turned out to be a dud but black  white deservedly took its place in the valhalla of video gaming
and rockstar games has given us two muchhyped titles in the last year  grand theft auto  and this game state of emergency and true to form one turned out to be great and one turned out to stinkin case you need it spelled out for you state of emergency is the one that stinkseverything rockstar did right in gta  has been replaced here
although the graphics are a nice attempt to return to the cartoonstyle that made gta and gta  such enjoyable and not so realistic games they are about the only thing that soe has going for it
there are two game modes revolution with a storyline and chaos sans story all mayhem that are basically the same
the idea behind chaos is that you run around grabbing weapons breaking windows and killing lots of cops
since you have access to all the weapons right off the bat and you can kill the cops one by one like the foot soldiers from mutant turtles they wait until you are done breaking their buddys neck before attacking you so chaos mode looses its fun after a few minutes
on my very first game right out of the box i got more than quadruple the factoryset high score  and i thought is this it
revolution isnt much better  the storyline is just a series of excuses to run around and kill cops and gangsgameplay is a joke
the camera also a problem in gta  i should point out has a very hard time showing the action especially if you want to turn around and clobber the guys chasing you
in soes favor is fairly decent stick control unlike the godawful batman vengeance but fighting comes down to little more than buttonmashing
and thats really all there is to say about soe
little plot crummy gameplay  its just not enough to keep you awake
i played it for about an hour and there it sits
i think ill go trade it for a sega saturn and a copy of darius gaidenif you need any more proof that this game is a letdown take a look at how many people are selling used ones and how many people are waiting in line to buy used ones
as of this writing less than two weeks after the game came out and its a hard game to find i might add  people are trying to dump them and there are no people waiting to buy them
dont make the mistake of having to turn around and dump yours in the next week either  stick with gta this game has a lot going against it
if the mass media gets a hold of this game like they did gta there will no doubt be a collective outcry from parents groups conservatives and other general naysayers with a microphone and an opinion
unfortunately i dont think this game is good enough to warrant that kind of attentionlike a lot of people i was really looking forward to this game
while i dont own gta im waiting for the xbox version i have lots of friends who do and i have to admit its a fantastic game
its huge openended versatile and has that nihilistic charm that truly makes it a guilty pleasure
unfortunately soe has all the nihilism and little of the charmeveryone has wanted to fight the power and stick it to the man at least once in their lives and for that primal urge this game does provide a welcome catharsis
it is fun to run around in chaos mode with wild abandon beating people down smashing windows and blowing stuff up but eventually you have to take in the fact that the graphics are really shoddy im assuming with the huge crowd constantly in circulation the developers had to sacrifice quality and the gameplay is really monotonous
i have to say the biggest flaw of all is the lack of multiplayer
this could have really been a saving grace for the game
the whole idea of mob mentality is completely lost in a single player game
it seems so obvious to me that i have to wonder what the developers were thinking
its the difference between anarchy and stupidityalso i hate to sound like one of the groups i was kind of shelling earlier but the mindless violence concept of this game seems a lot less fun in a post world
im definitely an anticensorship kinda guy but anyone buying this game for their young kid should question their skills as a parent
its made for mature audiences and only us old guys need apply though once you start playing the game i doubt youll feel very quotmaturequot  i think i would have enjoyed this game much better a year agoi also might have liked this game better as a rental but lack of a rental outlet where i live means i get burned more than id lke to admit
if you can rent this game and feel the absolute need to satisfy your curiosity rent dont buy
take that one piece of advice above anything else ive written here
if you find that its a must own then you can go shell out your  with perfect confidencei have had this game for months now and i will say that in the beginning it was sickly entertaining
the game made me laugh more than anything
but after about a month it got really old and somewhat boring
the game is a great one to rent and then forget about it
the replay value on it is horribly lowmaybe even in the negativesi know this isnt grand theft auto  but come on i was expecting something close to the quailty and overall fun of grand theft   what i got was a boring and headacheinducing excuse for a game
there are people running all over the screen
this is old news about  minutes into the game
the controls are awkward and worst of all there is no substance to state of emergencyit is boring
go pick up gta  and ignore this waste of timei went and picked up a copy of state of emergency when it was released yesterday and boy was i disapointed
i was very psyched to get this game as ive been reading previews of it for months on the web and all the hype about it has been nothing but good
but this game is a definete waste of money
first of all the graphics are sub par and the camera angle can be very annoying at times
the controls are ok but you can only hold one weapon at a time
the thing that made me the most mad was the actual game
the game comes off immature and childish
the missions are not fun and just plain annoying and the user interface is confusing as hell
i am a very big fan of gta and this game cant hold a candle to it
i think they should have taken themselves a little more seriously when making this game
i returned the game today and picked up drakan ancients gates and that game is awesome stars for a good attempt at a storyline and the fun factor of whooping everyones butt with multiple weapons but gets very old very quick
stay away and make it a renterit is like they thought if they make it as bloody and violent as they could it would selland i guess they are right
once you get past the fact that you can mow down a crowd with a ak  or chop someones head off or break their leg and arm there is not much to this game
it plays like thiswalk around beatingshootingstabbinggangs and the policecorporation and doing silly missions like escorting characters killing heavily armedprotected business men and things of that nature
you cannot drive anythingthe weapons are pretty cool as is the fighting actionbut the story and actual depth of the game is not all that at allgta was  betterrent it before you buy itstate of emergency was released the spring after grand theft auto iii became a national obsession
published by the same company rockstar  but developed by now outofbusiness developer vis the game successfully cashedin on grand theft autos success
featuring similar ultraviolent mission based gameplay state of emergency actually plays nothing like gtathe game takes place during massive riots the games claim to fame being the more than one hundred characters on screen at once and you play as one of a number of characters rebelling against the corporation
there are three levels each featuring about fifty missions to complete amidst the chaos
trouble is the missions are all mindless and repetitive and are virtually all just a slight variation on a basic formula youll either be sent to kill a target sent to protect a target andor escort him or her somewhere else or youll be sent to destroy a building car or area
the missions are fun for a short while but once you realize youre just performing the same task over and over again it quickly grows tiredsome of the minigames are fun however and rather than being mission based they are generally based on time and points  youll kill people or destroy property while collecting extra time from downed enemies while racing against the clock and youll keep coming back for more trying to beat your best scorethe gameplay however is still simple and boring just a d beatemup with a few attack buttons and a handful of weapons to wield though the ability to pick up some smaller objects floating around each level like benches is a welcome feature
and yes it is an ultraviolent game despite the cartoonish visuals
blood sprays realistically as you fire in to crowds taking down innocent civilians pink blobs guts pop out when people are shot limbs and heads come off you can wield them as weapons in fact  its all mindless and gimmickysure its really cheap these days and if youre really interetsed id say go for it but it really isnt even worth a rentali checked out this game because probably like the majority the makers of the of the greatest games of all made it
state of emergency strongely dissappointed me
the levels well actully i cant tell if theyre all the same or not because ive only played the first for about a half an hour and got bored
but the level itself was pretty dull
the only cool feature was the civilains the many many civilians running around for you to chase or shoot at or whatever when youre bored pretty much always
you find weapons on the ground ranging from nightsticks to uzis to bazookas to use on your enemies who as well have a wide variety of weapons as well
this may sound fun but its not
you quickly grow weary of running around for people who want you to kill a certain security guard or steal diamons ect and the coolness of the civialians running around gets very annoying especially when they get in your way when youre trying to shoot a bad guy and end up wasting ammo on them
i dont recommend buying this game to pretty musch anyone but if you must a quick week rental would be enough
thats allthis game was a big disapointment for me
i have been waiting for this game for a long time only to be disapointed with doing the same thing over and over
the only thing that changes in the game is the setting
all you do is fight and then fight and then fight some more
i would not recommend this game to anyone
in fact i am taking my back tonight and getting a different gamethis game was pretty disappointing
i was waiting for this game
and now that i have it i am like what was i so excited for
the game is fun for about an hour but then you have the missions which are frustrating and a little annoying since you cant access all the characters immediately you have to beat the missions which are too difficult for their time
i have more fun and got farther playing gundam zeonic front which i must say is a much better gamei liked gta best game ever and the missions though difficult were fun
plus you had the freedom of roaming the parts of liberty city and little side missions to improve your skills
in state of emergency there are no side missions kaos mode is still limiting theres no sense of freedom as in gta which was a way better gamestate of emergency is something rockstar ought to have kept to themselves
i look forward to another game as violent and free roaming as gta but state of emergency just played with my emotionsi strongly think you should rent this game but dont buy it
it literaly gets boring after a  hour
it also makes your brain hurt its a fun game to play but only for  minutes at the most
dont buy it i repeat dont buy iti was excited when i first started playing this game
the storyline is pretty cool i liked the idea of playing as a revolutionist trying to overthrow a repressive government
but after  min the game fell through
the game is just too monotonous to be of any replay value
i enjoyed the game at first but the missions are pretty much the same thing over and over
i trudged through the game anyways just to see the ending
what really annoyed me was the ending
i thought the ending would be interesting but it was not worth at all
if the game had a good ending i would have given it more stars
i would not buy this game
rent it you can beat it in a few days
after going through the game once you will not want to do it ever againthis game is cool when you see everyone running around
its kind of funny
but this gets old real quick
you end up doing the same thing over and over
all the people running around are the same thing over and over
rockstar is an excellent game producer with gta under its belt and vice city
but this is the worst of all the games they ever made
im sure san andres will be awesome but soe sucks
sorrythis game starts off under the guise of and innovative and entertaining fantasy based adventurerpg
having never played the original i was a little in the dark about the story but the history is fairly intersting even though the main plot is kind of thin
the gameplay is fluid and you definately get a good assortment of moves to dispatch your enemies with
the level progression system is definatively diablo inspired
now for whats wrong with the game
for starters your max level is  which for any adventurerpg title is very disappointing on more than one count
case in point you cannot max out all of your stats at level  which means you must allocate points to only the skills you want to really beef up
which wouldnt be terrible if a you were actually aware that you had to do this and b if the game didnt force you to use all of your potential skills
so what you end up having instead of a customizable character whom you can choose to make a fighter or a spellcaster etc
you are forced to have a little of everything creating an overall mediocre character
my second complaint although not as bad as the first is that the difficulty of the game only increases in the number of monsters you must kill later on
so instead of throwing some engrossing puzzles at you you end up just hacking your way through the last few levels of the game
if they ever make another sequel i hope they improve on these flaws because the game does have a solid foundation but in the end i was disappointedi tried out the demo for the game and while at first it seemed like it would be good after a few minutes it got rather boring
first off the controls seem a bit difficult to manage when flying the dragon
when i was attacked it was very hard to locate where it was coming from let alone try to turn around and defend myself
the controls were a little bit better when maneuvering just the womanthe dialogue sure got repetitive fast quotlets flyquot quotlets goquot how about lets shut up
the graphics where pretty choppy not at all better than what you might find for a ps game
even the characters seemed to defy gravity after a monster was killed it just hovered there in midair
and after just a couple of hits you yourself are dead didnt seem like there was any way to replenish your health except with the potion you start off with and can run out of fast
maybe in the real game theres more you can pick upand then there were all these inventory items to deal with potions spells weapons and the like
which reminded me way too much of an rpg game not and adventure gameall in all the demo sure didnt make me want the full game but if youre even thinking about buying this game play the demo first before you shell out the doughlook i loved the first parappa game so much that i imported the soundtrack
heck i even love umjammer lammy despite its vomiting catipillers forcing women to give birth but this game just doesnt measure up
the main problem is the lack of a fun storyline
the entire business about all food being turned into noodles is even dumber than it sounds and the events  leading up to the actual levels are just plain unfunny
the fact that the songs arent catchy is also a big letdown and then add in the fact that you have to play an annoying practice level before each song and wellit just gets worse from there
the two player version isnt much to write home about and the load times hasnt improved much at all
all in all this game has had the fun beaten out of it with a large bat and that makes me all too sad
you can find the first two games waaaaay cheap so if you havent played a parappa game then pick them up and avoid this unless youre a diehard fan
in that case just rent iti rented this game back when it hist stores and i must say thank god i didnt buy this game
the visuals are reasonably good the dioloug is pretty funny and the music is cool but this game is extreamly short it took me about less then  hours to beat this game and i immidiatley returned the gameoverall parappa the rapper  isnt worth the money at allvery short game out of  starsi first bought this to play gta and after installing found that the right stick does not calibrate properly im running windows xp when i try to use this in that game the person starts to spin around until you nudge the stick slightly towards the middle before it ceases this undesirable activityin windows the joystick calibration portion of the device driver allows you to calibrate based on extremes of movement to pick the mid point and the extreme ends of movement in any direction after installing the logitech software for mapping keys and functions to buttons i found that they have absolutely no way of changing your calibration
i supposed they thought their product is always going to be perfectly calibrated and will never have a problem anyhow at the time i figured it could have been a problem with the hardware so i took it back and exchanged it for another one
same thing happened with the new one
i called logitech up and they wanted me to send it back and replace it with one of theirs they hadfiguring a replacement would still do the same thing guessing the rma process would waste good  weeks of my time
i uninstalled the logitech software and fought with the calibration built into windows and finally tricked it into finding the proper center of the stick
the problem with doing this is you dont get full functionality from all the buttons in certain games where you cant map functions to specific buttons in game
i am fairly well versed in windows so i couldnt imagine anyone doing this whos looking for a non nonsense install and setup i found myself wanting to bash it with a hammer and chucking it out the window
though i kind of got it to work many games will not detect a remapping of the two sticks and your either stuck with their default use mappings or you cant use them at alllogitech makes decent hardware but they seem to allways fall short when it comes to drivers and software i own their z sound system and a number of versions of their cordless keyboards and mice and find that the default windows drivers run far better than what they have to offer without irritating programs running in the systray and consuming memory and wasting time with loading useless garbageware every time you bootbattery life on this stick is pretty good after buying it and using it for about a month its sat on my desk for almost a year without use and still powered on when i tried it
to my dismay a couple months later when it did stop working i noticed that a couple of the batteries went south and started to leak inside
no damage was done to the unit so i put a new set of batteries in and it started working again lucky for me because id hate to have a paperweight that leaks battery acidseriously consider getting another game pad or buy it from a place that would give you no problems returning it if you decide that you dont like itif logitechs corded wingman rumblepad had the same design and ergonomics i would have gotten that
however it did not and i fell in love with the feel and action of the logitech cordless rumblepadwhat i feel is great about this pad is everything except the cordless facet of it
there are no hard edges or loose feel to any of the parts
there is nice solid feel and feedback to the dpad i prefer the solid concave disc less fatigue
the dual joysticks are also concave which is nice on the thumbs
they also move and feel just like the sticks on the dualshock psps gamepad which is good
the buttons on the cordless rumblepad are solid and have a good action to them
there are no harsh edges to dig into your skin
there are no loose hardplastic reactions or noises to these buttons
and the hand extensions are perfect for my hands
once again there are no harsh edges and everything is contoured to fit comfortably
the rumble effect is just like the dualshock as well
its neat and sometimes helpful but really isnt necessary
fortunately logitech allows you to control whether the rumble effect is on or off major battery conservation in having it off
i never had any problems installing this gamepad or getting it to work within games until recentlygamepads are a seasonal item
theyre only good for certain games
often they are necessary for ported console games
which brings me to my present
i have the urge to replay final fantasy vii and vii on the pc
these games cry for a gamepad so i fetched my wingman cordless rumblepad
after a week of web research i have discovered the my receiver is dead
and that this has happened to numerous wingman cordless rumblepad owners who have had their gamepad for a year or morethere are no replacement receivers sold
the best advice offered is to quottryquot logitech tech support
with a decent set of rechargeable batteries total of  aa  if you want to hotswap them and a good rechargeable battery recharger that drains all the power from the batteries before it recharges them you will have the best wireless rumblepad for a year
and then after that year you may find yourself with a dead receiver
and after it becomes a lost cause through normal avenues you may find yourself wanting to open that receiver to see if you can find the short or whatever is causing the problem
youll find the screw in the bottom holding things together isnt alone and that the seam on the receiver is sealed with some kind of acme super glue and give upwish me luck
im off to find a replacement gamepadbattery recommendations powerex aa nimh mah or bettercharger recommendations maha energy mhcffailure
heres why
no franchise mode i mean come on
franchise is everything and is what killed this game
no franchise  no real fun
i probably would have gotten it if this hadnt been the case
the overall gameply
according to everyone its to easy the annoucers are horrible the players look stiff
and is it just me or is the stadium really dark
so much more could have been done
better gameplay graphics and overall depth is how this game failedwhat i did like about this game was the passing and shooting style
the passes were cool and easy and the shots looked awsome
unfortunantly everything is dark the rims dont look like rims and the gameplay is easy to beat
trust me ive played this gameoverall this game just didnt live up to what it could have been
but microsoft already fixed the problem with the  edition
the game has a ton of dunks fluid player animations and a whopping  season franchise mode
sure its  more to pay but its either that or this
go for the new and improved  edition
either that or go for nba live  or nba k
thxok im gonna be frank and you can be joenever mindwhen i was wee and i got my nintendo  system the only game that intrested me was goldeneye
i had played it at my friends house and i bought it and played it everyday
i liked how many of the things were based off the movie and how somethings were added
to me it was a good gamethen a couple years later a new james bond game was made
i bought that game too
played it and liked the multiplayer the best and the story line too how everything tied inbut this game this one is pathetic
i bought this game along with beach spikers and i can tell you right now you wish you would be playing that insteadok  if you are gonna make a good james bond game then get rareware to do it cause they looked like the only people to make a good james bond game
why
well those are the people that made your loveable goldeneye
col
get a new plot
the games plot was so stupid i mean seriously q or r looked like dumbledore from harry potter
and you obviously knew the girl was gonna turn out a bad personnot technically but ya
i mean come on
who the crap was the rig diver
i mean they introduce her in that big jump off scene and yet they dont say who she isthe good thing or should i say the best of the best is the multiplayer
the grapple was the coolest idea invented
i mean who would give up of being spiderman for a game period
i like the bot idea
like twine thats the best idea ea came up with
i like how if i wish to play alone then that would the best thingoverallim rating it  stars only for the multiplayerif you are a collecter of jb games then you should rent this one first
for me i beat it in dayflat
without cheat book come on ea
i want a more harder game that some kind of game thats so easy
the only thing this game is good for is multiplayer
i sure hope nightfire is better than thisjoanna dark it is notthis game is dulltalks to you as though you are watching play skooland the most real complaint it is hardin a headache inducing wayto focus laser guns etc on the exact spot you need to focus them onridiculousthis game does have nice graphics and sound
the punch selection is pathetic
there is no way to choose body blow v head blow
you can get your boxer to move around the ring but you cannot truly make him duck and bob
basically all you do is try to press your buttons faster than the computer can
if your fighter is ranked higher no problem fight someone tougher than you and its aggravating
basially you just stand there and exchange blows until someone falls
no strategyno one can call this a boxing sim with a a straight face
its a arcade button mashers nightmare of the worst kind
how can ea who is know for making great sports title drop the ball no pun on kk
first off ea needs to put as much time amp effort on its boxing games like it does with its other sports titles
for those who think this is a boxing sim let me point some things out
real boxers dont throw  punches a round
all boxers dont get up  times in the a fight like ea would like you to believe
im led to think ea never watched a fight their entire lives considering there are no one punch kos
its the typical reduce the fighters health to zero before knocking him outdown routine
in this day amp age of true gaming sims this doesnt cut it
like football players every boxer is unique
boxers fatigue differently etc
not all boxers are the same as ea would like you to think
im not talking about the obvious attributes like speed amp power
they need to take into consideration the boxers heart chin defense illegal tactics combination punches signiture punch boxers weak points choking in big fights having a off night etc i might sound harsh but when i hear of a boxing sim i get very skeptical
ea is insulting boxing fans all around of world with this title by claiming its a sim
call it what it is a arcade boxing game with boxers
amp why arent all the fighters real
football has how many hundreds of players amp ea could only come up with  real fighters
very bad
i suggest they try very very hard by inlisting the aid of boxing experts boxing fans amp trainers alike
this is the only way to get a real boxing sim up amp running
the bottom line is ea doesnt care about boxing games so they dont put in much realism to it
you cannot fool me by having great life like graphics when the core of the gameplay isntanyone who wants a real boxing sim check out lance heffner boxing game
its great
a true boxing fans dream
there are no graphics so you arcade boxing type fans wouldnt like itthe graphics are sharp except they seems a little carttony for the players
one big problem for me is the rather difficult fielding and even easier hittingyoull have a  to  game by the second inning if youre not careful
and lastly the game feels a little rushed imrenting a version and it crashed on me  times  not a good impression ea sports back tot he showers with this onedo the people who made tp even try to make it better than last years
they did not suceed in any case
it is relatively to hit and pitch but fielding is just too difficult
my advice buy high heat  insteadfirst off read the review titled not bad but could have been more that person has done a good job of summing up the gameplay and the overall quality of the game
i would echo the fact that the game is fun for a few hours
the gameplay ramps up considerably fast and i find the second  levels to be really challenging
only for the extremely dextrous fingers
the audio and video are both very solid and i bet fans of britney esp young ones will really enjoy the back stage reward features where you can unlock footage of her rehersals from her vegas show that was on mtv
the slightly interactive concert footage is cool and there are a bunch of other clips of britney being goofy to unlock
all this would have been better if the film quality or backstage footage was really high quality but its just not so you are left sort of wanting more
the major drawback if not for the following i would have thought the game had meritted  or  stars is that it only contains  songs
that is just silly britney has at least  singles and other popular music games make it a point to include closer to a dozen different songs
i like stronger hit me baby oops slave and hhmmmm the other one escapes me but its just not enough after a couple hours
furthermore any parent or roomate listening in will be driven crazy after an hour of the same  songsone final note  the game has a very nice  player mode that allows for a good deal of handicapping while still making the game fun for both players
that i can appreciate
in conclusion while by no means a dud britney could have added another  songs and the game would have been a real sleeper
as it is its probably a better rental except for die hard fansgtv said this was one of the worst games ever
well its certainly up therethe graphics are pretty good
the cgi britney looks like britney and this game will remind you of britneys better days when she was doing  oops i did it again
in the background you get just about the entire music video and songokay this is why the game is crappy
first the game is hard to control with the ps controller because the buttons are sensitive and you need to push them quick
furthermore when you mess up the dancer on the screen doesnt mess up
no matter how good or bad you do you watch the same cgi dance loop over and overthe  stars are for the good britney cgi character her music videos and the songs
thq should have done a cool britney gamesomething creative like britneys space adventures or westerni bought this game a while back now i have to say this is the hardest game i have ever played
im a long time gundam fan and thought it would be good because a friend  recommended itdont waste youre money on this crap hard contols the enemies are aways better in so kind of way usually in numberspostivesnonenegativethe game alway sets you against a plethora of enemiesway to hard even hardcore gamers how feel the pressureyou can be killed in a shotit feels like the enemies always have a upperhand on you with weaponesyoure teamsmates arent to brightthey promise mission but theyre only scarcity of moblie suitsit takes forever to get a new mobile suit its that can still died in a hitif youre a hardcore gamer that love a challege this game was made for youif youre a poor sport about losing at a game dont buy this you might just throw youre tv out the windowi bought this because i wanted to see if there were any improvements over the original absolutely none
i had the original on n and to me the gameplay and graphics were way better on the original
i have it also on dreamcast and the sound and graphics are better
this game offers new tracks
but to me they suck there simple and the ai are a little smarter but the controls arent smooth and its hard to control plus the customization of the pods are there eitherso i have nothing good to say about this game
maybe if they remake it again in with the design systems of today i might appreciation the graphics if they do a really good job
but i doubt they will remake this game it didnt have a big audience then
i would appreciate it but i not gonna cry over not having a new oneplay the original
on dreamcast or n if you have those systems
or get a really good emulator for pc and game on that
there arent that many reliable emulators so make sure you do your researchyou know what i love about the sims
i enjoy builing houses and adding furniture as my income increases
i also enjoy enhancing my sims skills and advancing them in their jobs
i do not enjoy just watching them interact so that i can play house
because of that the sims vacation was the last expansion i bought because it disappointed me for the same reasons the hot date expansion did
im sure there are people that love to roleplay their sims in new downtown districts ie
hot date or hotel resorts ie
vacation but i found both of those additions boring
its already hard enough to keep all the sims hygiene social and other tabs updated and it becomes even more difficult when you take your sims on vacation
sure its interesting for a few minutes to watch your sims ride an attraction or another expansion feature but its not what made the game fun for me in the first place
i would only recommend this expansion for the diehard fans of the sims series
id check out the sims unleashed or the sims superstar expansion packs the two most recent expansions first because they seem to focus on normal gameplay enhancements instead of the side attractions that make up the sims vacation or the sims hot date
of course if you only want new decorations and furniture vacation adds it own fair share of the normal expansion extras
honestly id wait for the next deluxe edition that packages several expansions together
with the upcoming sequel you can expect some good deals as the sims tries to repackage all sequels for one last sales push
or you can just wait for the sequel which will be out in a few months and has the same gameplay but much better graphicsi realy am going to be honest this is the worst sims expansion pack
its really a waste of money because there is no use going to vacation island when you can throw a party go to studio town or go to downtown sim city
before you buy this game buysims superstar sims house party and sims hot date those are the best sims expansion packsthese pads are like most ddr pads out there  poorly constructed and not durable
the pad slides around when you play on it and one of the buttons stopped working about  days after i bought it
i thought id pick up a cheap one since i needed an extra pad when friends came overdo yourself a favor and head over to redoctanecom for some quality pads
i have their ignition pad which is way better than this type of cheap pad because it has a cushioned insert which slips into the middle and keeps the pad from sliding around and is easier on your feet
another friend has the regular redoctane pad with pad cover and it works great too
overall dont buy the intec pad unless you know you wont be playing ddr for very longi have the red octane mats and those are awesome but i used this mat at a friends house
holy cow
it moves everywhere
if you dont hit it hard enough i tap gently for the most part you miss
you start off facing front and then the mat moves you across the room backwards
not conducive to getting as
get the red octane mats
totally worth the price
love emthe xbox never impressed me and this is one of many games that shows me why the system was so weakthe game is pretty awful overall
the music is terrible
its just a bunch of techno beats that weve all heard from better games
countless other games in fact
the game gets boring really fast
skating around the same people all the time is pretty boring
skip this gamethis game is okay at first but then it gets boring
i thought that it would be alright i must have been kidding myself
i am up for the new challenges but not this
i cant see how this game gets such a high ratingi think it is for kids honestly
i am a kidatheart but i couldnt take thisskating gamei just hope they dont make anymore sequels they should be donei know i am
rated two because shaded graphics are coolokay first off i didnt glance at this game i immersed myself in this game
please ignore those reviewers who played a game or two and said this game was great
i played approximately  exhibition games a twenty game season with playoffs created players and explored all the various game modes and played quite a few  player games
this game really seems to capture the essence of baseball
notice i used the word seems
when looking at this game in depth this game has no longterm playabilityfirst off the graphics are terrible
i mean really really terrible
its almost like they transported the player graphics from super nintendo land
the feel of baseball is almost deadened after looking at the super cheap animations
of course in most sports games graphics shouldnt matter
this is baseball though  the ambience the look of the grass the feel of the crowd the skyline all contribute to good game
this hampers iti would gladly sacrifice graphics for a good game
at first i thought it did
after a few exhibition games i felt like they finally reached the holy pantheon of sporting games to be seated next to madden  and the original nhl for the pc nba k and nflk for the dreamcast lakers vs celtics for the genesis and baseball simulation  yes  even though it was released in the s for the original nes
my hopes quickly fadedthe games pitchingbatter interface is very polished and definitely is the game
unfortunately its full of glitches
in one camera angle the high and low pitches are distinct but outside and inside pitches are awful
in another angle the exact opposite occurs
why not have an angle that can show both
in two others angles its just plain impossible to judge anything
curveballs are a plain joke and couldnt even fool jeremy burnitz while sliders and changeups are just plain evil to hittersdont get me started on the home run contest
i hit ten home runs on ten pitches with shinjo
with barry bonds the only way not to hit a home run is to not make contactin terms of longterm play i started off in pro level and after steady improvement i easily mastered it and progressed into allstar level
all of sudden my team was chalked full of jose cansecos and dave kingmans
even though i averaged three to four runs a game almost all my runs were off home runs the vast majority being solo shots
troy glaus drove in more than half my runs
for the very few times i got a single the next atbat resulted in a double play
this type of game would bore any true baseball fan to deathso my offense stagnated but i won approximately half my games on allstar level
then i noticed something
mostly all the games i played were one run games
out of these the games were decided in the last two innings
all of them
no matter how much i altered the simulation level the game would massage the abilities to make it a close score
any true baseball fan like me would be revolted
part of baseball consists of  games along with the  games
closers proved worthless
to test my hypothesis i chose to play the angels versus the yankees in the playoffs
in every game that i was leading going into the eighth my pitchers couldnt throw any strike except right down the middle and all the yankees became the reincarnation of barry bonds
even though i could easily strike out bernie williams in the second inning i would give up walk upon walk to alfonso soriano
of course constantly walking alfonso is not just a minor glitch its releasestopping bug
while losing troy percival would be pitch like byun hung kim in the world series
after he gives up the lead hed pitch just like pedro
this type of things flies in the face of actual simulation and just plain ruins the game
i found myself not trying to score in the fifth and sixth inning so i can have a chance of winningso the earlier innings are a waste and the offense is boring as heck the computers ai sacrifices the very notion of simulation the graphics are terrible and its full of annoying glitches
why would anyone want to play this game
a baseball game is made to be played for a long time and this doesnt come close
the only thing that redeems is it is that its still pretty good in two player
of course try to get a friend to come over and play a whole season  good luckbaseball is the hardest game to simulate and this game just could measure up
i wasted some serious cash on this so i hope you dontall right folks be warned
while this game is on xbox and we all like to think of the graphics first on the big green machine youll have a major obstacle in your way
the controls
its sorta of bad mojo too
this game could have easily been put in the same category or close to devil may cry if the controls were better
you only get to use the dpad no analog love for us
think resident evil controls but worse you gotta push on the old nintendopad to move
remember doing that back in the days when we just didnt know any better
maybe the army has just gotten me thinking like this but how could something like this continue to happen to games
i hate to see things like this persist in any area especially gamingi got wreckless with the antipation of owning a new fun xbox game
i being a veteran gamer was left sorely disappointed
after playing several missions ive come to realize that the developers of the game must think we gamers love having to do boring things over and over again
they also think wed like to see a terrible looking instant replay of us doing it over and over again
the game frequently pummels you with below the belt hits smacks you with cheap shots and puts a doom clock over your head just for spite
the graphics are fantastic but who cares when the gameplay is lame
they say the physics engine is accurate
i dont see it
gtas better than that
at least the cars dont disappear in front of you or corners throw you for a  everytime your near
the in game arrows will blind you and the huge map and displays all over your screen make seeing where your going a huge hassle
bottom line save your money or just rent ithomer simpson would have one thing to say about this game quotboooorrringquotwreckless offers stunning graphics but very little in the way of gameplay
it is a good demonstration of xbox technology and very little elsethe game centers around a set of missions that put you against the japanese mafia
the missions involve racing around a city and usually involve destroying something using your car other cars dim sum stands etc
missions are timed and you must complete sets of missions to advance
completing missions unlocks new cars as well
all in all the missions are diverse but arent interesting enough to keep you playingthe cars themselves arent particularly easy to drive
they tend to have a lot of oversteer meaning it is very easy to loose control of the back of the car
weaving in and out of traffic at high speed is almost impossible with some of the vehicles
a bit of understeer and better sliding ability would make the driving aspect of the game much more enjoyablethe major upside to this game are the graphics
they are just amazing
it is worth renting this game just for a few days of eye candyalso the destructability of the city is very impressive
you can drive just about anywhere and hit anything with all objects reacting just the way you would expect
at the end of a mission youll find youve leave the streets in turmoil  wreckless cooly shows off the graphic power of the xbox
the rendering of a stylized hong kong looks just gorgeous
the framerate is also good and there is a lot of action
but the controls are a big letdown and makes the action a moot point at times
for some reason i have a lot of trouble making simply left and right turns and when i try to powerslide i more often than not slam into a wall  mind you that i thought i was pretty good at playing project gotham
the cars also flop too easily and you can get stuck occasionally due to what looks like a bug
very frustrating
at best a rental titlethis game was predicted to be one of the reasons to buy an xbox but unfortunately that prediction was way off
the graphics are great i cant deny that but the game is too short and repetitive
i finished my friends game in a few days and it was good while it lasted but now that its over i wont return to it
but a longer and larger sequel could be a great gameim not just saying these negative things about this xbox game because i am a nintendo fan but this is just a bit poorif u want good games for xbox buy halodead or alive id recommend renting this game
i picked it up thinking it would be something like grand theft auto  but its nothing like it at all
you are stuck in your vehicle the whole time and crashing into other people gets really boring after about  minutes
the missions are lacking and downright easy and the graphics arent all that good
the cars handle really bad and i find it awkward to steer them at higher speeds
i dont know what catagory to place this game in im thinking junk would be a good one though
right now with games like this out im thinking i should have stuck with the psprobably the most unknown resident evil game of them all solely for it appearing on the gbc
the game plays like a rd person adventure then when in combat with a zombie or creature switches to a first person view where you your shots to choose where to shoot them
overall for a resident evil game it isnt the best
but for a game boy color game this is one of the best
so if for some reason youve never played a handheld more advanced than the original game boy or the game boy color or if youre a diehard resident evil fan youll enjoy it
otherwise you could probably find a better way to spend your money
nnycw for capcitythe resident evil series has had a tried but true tradition of creepy chills and shocks to elevate itself in the survival horror genre its just too bad that none of that matters on this nearly pitiful attempt to bring the series to a portable system on the game boy color of all systems nonetheless
you get to play as leon the hero from resident evil  and barry one of the heroes from the original resident evil and go up against an army of umbrella undead on an ocean cruiseliner
that might sound good on paper on a nextgen home system but on the gbc the idea falls flat thanks to the systems limitations
gaiden features some innovation the game is played on an overhead view and switches to a d first person perspective when you encounter an enemy
the graphics however are pretty bland as is the sound
control is pretty tight but you wont notice that as you wander around looking for the ever so tiring find the key to open the door type puzzles
with all this thrown in gaiden gets repetitive and boring and you will likely not finish the game due to being disgusted with it
all in all resident evil gaiden is a must play for resident evil fans but you wont find anything to hold you to it
then again it is better than resident evil survivorthe game features barry burton from resident evil and he also appears in a bit of resident evil  and leon scott kennedy resident evil  and resident evil the story tells that leon s kennedy went to a ship called starlight and that somehow he got lost so barry has to come to that ship to find out where leon is and to rescue him he discovers that the ship is full of zombies and some bows because the umbrella corp put their dirty hands on that ship barry also finds a survivor who is named lucia
and shell help him to find leon and whoever else is there graphics i must say this was one of the few games ive played on the game boy color so i cant really compare but for all ive seen not that much the graphics are good for that plataform they try to work with shadows and stuff well they did what they couldbut the character looks horrible not detailed at all even enemies are more detailed sound the music isnt very good you feel like its the same one in the whole game game boy color is not a powerful console for graphics nor sound talking about the few melodies in this game i think theyre ok but cant be compared with any other resident evil game
you get sick of them fun this is not a masterpiece
its very far from it
you can beat the game once but youre probally not going to play it again because its not very scary without the soundtrack which has always been a great point in resident evil games and with bad graphics educative this is the only teenclassified resident evil game all the others are matureclassified
the thing here has no big deal some blood violence youre killing zombies anyway youre not killing any human or any good guy youre killing biological weapons and zombies i think you parents dont have to worry about itafter all this game is disappointing
i only suggest you to buy it if youre a hardcore resident evil fan or if youre a gbc game collector
its a great title for gbc  who has no big titlesi am a year street fighter veteran whos played over a dozen permutations of this series on seven eight different consoles mostly padbased
the prospect of any sf game working well on the game boy advance looked slim and sure enoughthe game just doesnt translatemy main concern adapting to the fourbutton layout turned out to be minor compared to the poor response
every attack takes half a beat to be executed requiring the player to quotpreexecutequot moves before their time thus making the delicate complex street fighter fighting system impossible
the graphics are impressively close to the old playstation version that i played and they managed to keep all the characters but this is no compensation for the fact that the control pad is too unresponsive to handle street fighterstyle combos super moves and charge moves
where i used to be able to pull off a hit combo with karin now i struggle to pull off even a twoinone fireball and my left hand was cramped after two or three fightsi cant blame the game developers all the way the game and the console were simply not a compatible match
nevertheless most of my gameboy advance games excluding the incredibly poor  nightfire are far more responsive than this
i cant help but think if they had sacrificed some graphics and scaled down the character roster a little they would have had a much more playable gameyou know pirates are all about sailing the seven seas scourging and plundering mercilessly to retrieve your loot and stab your trusted officers in the back when orders are not fufilled
but pirates the legened of black kat is anything but what you thought a pirate game should befirst off the only real highlight of this game is being the captian of many ships and buying repair and weapon items
but even sailing them and doing sea battles is not that challenging and not that funyou can also dock on many islands and many worlds as katrina de leon but even that is exceptionly bad
she does not have many moves or abilityes and heck she cant even climb up the smallest hillsgraphics on this game are very poor and all of the villians and chest items you retrive look horrible
the only good graphics of the game are the waters of the oceans you sail which look very realthe music is alrightwhen it decides to turn itself on
one of this games many flaws is that it gives you no motivation to keep adventuring while you play and you dont feel like you ever want to plug it in after your done playinghowever there are little aspects of this game that seem interesting but not enough to keep you from being bored such as tiki heads which give you different attacks and magical figureheads on your ship to give it powers out of the ordinary
yet even these items do very little to keep you wanting to playmostly i kept wanting to see more variety of gameplay and challenges as it quickly got repetitive and the puzzles on this game are quick to solveall in all if you like horrible poorly desighned laking gameplay in a video game i sugest that you dont even glance at this game next time you come across itit just plain isnt worth itlets see this game was made about  years ago maybe then it was considered great but now
nope
call of duty  for pc was way way better than this
no thanksfor the past couple of years ive watched electronic arts formerly one of the most reliable game companies on the scene squander its reputation with game after game filled with relentless bs
i gave it another shot with medal of honor frontline because it was part of the franchise id played for a long time and i thought how bad could it bei should have remembered that the last two medal of honors ive played spearhead for pc and infiltrator for gameboy advance both sucked
frontline was the first time since medal of honor underground that i played this game on a console
it should have felt like home  instead it felt like i was playing spearhead without a mouse
what caused them to mess up the control scheme so badly i cant tell
but now your character aims blindly thanks to a touchyfeely right analog stick
ive had to do much more minute aiming adjustments in syphon filter  the omega strain targeting distant enemies in the head and i found it even harder here though the enemy is just several steps away from me
from the first level i bumbled about blindly because foolishly the game designers now rely mostly on sound to let you know where to go
not that bad a thing except they botched the sound mix
rule of thumb in sound mixing  music and effects should never never drown out dialogue
here your superiors instructions are neatly covered up in the gunfire overloud music and ambience
from the beginning i had to run around the beach while under enemy fire looking for scattered teammates who were supposed to be yelling and waving at me to reach them
well i cant hear them and since theres no radar i had to rely on blind luck to find them
a very dumb flaw easily fixable but neglected
did they actually test this thing on real playersas with  per cent of games these days the lighting looks good and the music is great
but once again this game qualifies as a goodlooking goodsounding product that flunks its grade on mechanics
i dont feel like im in control of my character
nothing is more of a drag than that
i shouldve listened to my instinct and passed on this one
i regret even the reduced price id paid for it 
medal of honor and medal of honor underground were such classics its baffling how ea managed to botch it all upi bought this game over a year ago and ive only popped it into my ps on two occassions once on the day of purchase and once yesterday
the control system is so terrible that it makes the game nearly impossible to play and completely impossible to enjoyperhaps i wouldnt have felt so strongly about this if i hadnt already played the excellent quotmedal of honor allied assaultquot on my pc in which the player can use the mouse to aim
other than that and a few slight differences in missions the two games are almost identicalin quotfrontlinequot the player is forced to use the analogue sticks to aim
to add to the confusion most control settings require himher to use one for moving the view horizontally and the other one for moving it vertically
it is absolutely impossible even on the easiest settings to aim and fire  as quickly as the ai making things far more frustrating than enjoyable
furthermore the speed with which the view moves is always either too fast causing the player to zip right by hisher target or too slow causing the player to take a dozen rounds in the chest before reaching the targetive been annoyed by the unrealistically lightningquick reactions of enemies in war games before like in the original quotrainbow sixquot for example but this takes that annoyance to new heights
not only are the enemies too fast the player is too slowthat said i cant in good conscience give this game the lowest rating
the missions look sharp and the theme is always a good one
i also found the soundeffects to be quite nice
but there is no way i will ever subject myself to this awful control scheme againfor all those that played the demo its nothing compared to the mixed themes of this game
when do chefs on a uboat thtow knives at you
and men shoot through walls
men quickly change from the marines to the army in a matter of weeks
this game has terrible ai limited gameplay and no replay value due to a total lack of fun and multiplayer
very disappointing after the great allied assault pc game
this game is not great but a sad excuse to anybody that compares it to goldeneye
very disappointing and not worth buying or even renting
nothing about its good
so stop with the good reviews and get lives you  yearold newbies to the firstperson shooter world
its better without your reviews and lies about this gamebut not good
as another reviewer said the playability of this game is just silly
graphicsgreat soundgreat realismtruly leaves you scratching your head
as mentioned by someone else the enemies can engage you way before you can engage them
now granted some of them have the accuracy of the bad guys in a rambo movie but more often than not you will get pegged from somebody that you cant even see
i even noticed that no matter where i took cover i still got hit
the only way to make it remotely real is to cheat and put it on oneshot kill mode
as the other reviewer said you will get nailed about  times before you can even aim and then all you do is continually reaim because every time you get hit the crosshairs move
the oneshot cheat solves this by actually making enemies go down when you shoot them
but i hate cheating to win a game
if you want a firstperson shooter that is as close to real as they can get buy any of the halflife series of games
i have played firstperson shooters since the original castle wolfenstein came out for the old  computers remember those kids
 and i must say that i have yet to find a more realistic and engaging game than halflife
allinall moh frontline is not a game that people should buy if they are looking for realism
rent it for a weekend solve it and then move oni dislike this game the only good level is the storming the beach levelvery intensebut after i played call of dutyit left me wishing call of duty made a storming the beacxh levelcan u imagencall of duty is a far superior wwii gamethis is way too linearand in war u dont fight all by ur lonesomeur surronded by men a lotthis game is too linearfollow the path shoot shootand it would be okbut i found myself getting incredibly frustrated i get frustrated with a lot of games but if it frustrates to tyhe point where i just say screw it and sell itits badim not a great gameri suck at games ill admitbut stilli expected so much from this title but it suffers from the exact same problems as the first two moh titles
they are as follows in order of frustration level to meproblem  bullets come from absolutely nowhere while this has been toned down since the underground installment it is still very prevalent
your enemies will shoot straight through buildings on occasion and bullets will travel around corners as wellproblem  every nazi you come across is an absolute crackshot
i can sit there and watch an enemy through a thick fog in my sniper rifle scope from  yards sidestepping my crosshairs or running from side to side and hosing me down with a wwiiera stg automatic rifle one of the most ridiculously inaccurate weapons ever made with at least  accuracy at the same time needless to say this ends the level for me rather quickly
if i have a hard time sniping someone with a sniper rifle even though they are dead center in the crosshairs theyd better suffer the same problemproblem  lt patterson is an idiot when it comes to weapons
he can squeeze the trigger but aiming is another story
you should see operation repunzel i am armed with a silenced pistol getting hit from all different directions and i cant hit a guy standing less than  feet away
the moron fires and a bullet hole appears in the wall behind him at least  degrees from the intended target
in short its ridiculous
a us army lieutenant had to have been better trained in smallarms skill than this if he is to have survived wwii
fortunately he shoots quite well with a sniper rifle but the machine guns and pistols are beyond frustratingproblem  realism
i never quite felt like i was executing a mission but rather it seemed like a wild goose chase from medkit to medkit absorbing dozens of bullets in my notsohuman body in between
this may have passed in the heyday of fpss like doom but today that stuff shouldnt cut itfellow gamers is this what you think we should be getting from the most realistic wwii shooter of all time
sure the graphics controls and sound are great but it lacks the flair where it really counts
skip this oneif you have access to a half decent computer than dont even bother getting the ps version of this game
allied assault is so much more entertaining than frontline its not even funny
i turned frontline off in  minutes and played allied assault instead
not only does allied assault have single player action but online multiplayer which the ps version does not have
get allied assault on pc and forget this onemaybe im just getting old
but this game seems to have no identity
as a shooter its pretty bad
trying to aim the crosshairs to shoot the enemy is an exercise in frustration its just not possible to precisely aim using the playstation  analog sticks the way you can using a mouse on a computer
so many times i was in a small room with a german soldier and i couldnt even put the crosshairs on him and my character was like  feet away
sometimes its hard to hit a target just a few feet away even when you have a machine gun
these flaws might be forgivable if the story was any good which it isnt
another reviewer raved about the graphics and i have to ask  were we playing the same game
definitely nothing special here
this was my first foray into the quotmedal of honorquot series and i have to say i was pretty disappointedfirst let me start off by saying i was really upset with ea for the  way they show dday
if youve ever seen saving private ryan youll know that the invasion was no walk in the park
but ea through some extraodinary act managed to show this in an amost whimsical light
you dont have to sprint madly across the beach dodging bullets and mortor rounds stepping over bodies and wounded soldiers
no
instead you run around on a fenced in stretch of beach maybe  yards wide helping men who are pinned down by gunfire
its as simple as running well you dont have to run really over to these men and firing into the bunkers causing the germans to stop firing at you for a couple seconds and long enough for whoever you were helping to continue on his way
its incredibly stupid
then when you finally get to the bunkers you have to clear it by yourself
for some reason no one follows you in
the rest of the game is basically a oneman assault on the entire german army
you parade around shooting nazis and getting shot maybe twenty times then pick up a canteen which heals you
its so stupid
dont waste any time on this game
i recommend brothers in arms
although its not all the way there its much better than this game
and oh yeah dont ever get moh rising sun
its worse than this game
just so you knowif killing the golden goose were a video game ea bigs version would have crazy stylin tricks a boss hiphop  metal soundtrack and lots of attitude all of which typifies what a huge disappointment the ps version of sled storm is
like ssx tricky this is a game that overlooks solid gameplay in favor of production slickness and a contrived coolnessthe original playstation sled storm was a critics darling and revered by a small fanbase that appreciated its mix of clever shortcutfriendly mountain tracks semirealistic trickoriented snocross tracks and a game system that offered snomobiles that pitched bounced and bobbed in ways that cars and snowboarders dontall of those traits are absent in this playstation  version
the tracks arent clever theyre a garish collection of extreme design elements look its the iceberg tunnel
oh wow its the big lava jump
hey its something from the nightmare before christmas that makes gamers think that the marketing and art departments teamed up to browbeat the developers and anyone left over from the first gamethe controls are similar to the original and the grapics are up to nextgen snuff but racing has been deemphasized in favor of a trick system that builds up a boost meter so you spend much of your time recovering from trickinduced wrecks and boosting to catch up
the camera is often sideways or even upside down and is perfectly willing to follow your sled through obstacles like cave walls and rocks that should be more solid than they areas for the bouncing lurching snowmobiles forget it  paint the snow black and this could be mistaken for san francisco rush ea big i knew sled storm sled storm was a game i beat and this sir is no sled storm
if this is truly the game you intended to make then dont ruin your previous accomplishment by coopting its name call this radikkal extreme sledz or something more appopriate to its big unsubstantiated hypei mean dont get me wrong it was a great game for its time but i am a little disappointed in the game now
but it does the trick here overseas
thank you for shipping it to me over hereif you liked duke nukem or other runandgrabstuff kind of games sure this might be for youi was looking for more of an rpg experiencethe ship fighting is a little confusing when you first start and i never got past the first levelget halo
halo is much better  is only a lazy attempt to get onto the xbox but the aiming is totally off the characters move way too fast it doesnt seem human
very unrealistici gave this  stars because this game basically is bad
it will probably entertain you for the most of one afternoon
one of the two main problems and they are big i might add is the very short game
it consists of  levels early bird ect
and they are all very short
there are some cool things in this game like using a sonic horn to blow up cars but the rest of the game is anoyying
you will beat this game in less then an hour
the second thing is the very irritating music
it is a grunge rock kinda song that no one can understand and it plays over an over again
the worst choice of music in a game ever
i have to say namco probably did put a lot of work into publishing this program
but at the price why waste your money
i would have to agree with gamespotcom this game will only appeal to true arcade fansi really wanted this game so i bought it and was initialy impressed
however the action is mild and wears off fast and the camera is only ok  in general its not that good of a game even though it was criticaly acclaimed
its a rts game with little action and no ability to play the adventure with your own characters
overall forget it
its no fundecent graphics with sometimes jawdropping thought to detail eg pitchers wearing jackets on basepaths broken bats etc
that said game is too damn hard to win
im very good at baseball games and i havent beaten the cpu in about  games
im frustrated as hell with it
not that i need the ease of triple play to boost the ole ego but come on
im looking forward to checking out world series baseball ill leave it at thatthe best baseball game ive ever laid my hands on but it still has a lot of improving to do
due to all the work that i think needs to be done it only gets  stars from mefor one game play is difficult
but thats cool
because thats realistic
practice
practice
practicea lot of things have been done well
the players come to the plate and you can tell who they are by looking at their faces
the movements and throws are very realistic
the atmosphere is sharp
the game keeps track of league leaders and league stats
you have a realistic farm team to work with
send guys down bring guys upthe thing that thrills me the most is the franchise mode
very cool
i liked playing pc games more than game system games for that very reason in the past but times changedownfalls and there are a lot
there are a lot of animation glitches
outfielders will wait till the last second and then start to run and make an overtheshoulder catch almost everytime
when stealing or outfielders throwing people out at bases the way the tag looks means nothing
the animation is off
players will tag the ground on the wrong side of the base and still call guys outwalks are very rare
i think ive played  games and my pitchers maybe have  or  walks as a team note i just managei play in manager mode because thats more fun for me
yet there is no way to pitchout or pitch around
i get a twostrike count to somebody like bonds or sosa you pitch around yet theres no way to control that
the manual says l  r are pitch out and brush back respectively
nope
theyre both brush back pitches and brush backs usually make contactthere is no way to do instant replay
theres an automatic instant replay after every play even pop ups but theres no way to control it
you can only hit a button to skip itfinally and what i think is the most important is there is no drama in the commentary
youll crush a long enough to be a homerun down the line that might be could be a homerun but the computer instantly tells you foul balltoo many baseball games soup up the power numbers and i dont care for that
im one of those guys that likes baseball exactly the way it is
this game does that too but from what i understand not as bad as othersoh one more thing the computer changes your lineup without your authorization
youll set it start the game and find that the computer has rearrange things and even started other people
this severely pisses me offdespite all that its still the best baseball game ive seen
theres a lot of work to be done but this is definately a step in the right directionwhile i only give this game  stars the potential is limitless
all the games anymore will let you create a player and play a season surehow many have cards stadiums players and teams to unlock
those are some of the goodsnow heres the extreme downfallthe hitting
as soon as the pitcher releases the ball youd better have the cursor where it belongs
no dont look at where you think its going or where it looks like its going
even if the cursor is right where the icon should be you always end up hitting high
like a blink of an eye the ball whizzes to the catchers mitt with little or no time to reactif it wasnt for the hitting problem which youll find alot of people have not just rookies this game would be awesome
another major downfall is always having a darn yankee on the cover
whats the deal with that
if you can find this game for less then  pick it up
other than that it will sit on your shelf disappointing you everytime you look at itfor some reason i just didnt feel the suspense this game was trying to convey  the sound and graphics are great  the story line is pretty interesting also  it just couldnt hook me  maybe its the fact that a camera is your weapon  so you have to go to a static first person perspective to fight  and switch back and forth to evade and attack   i would definitely rent this one first ok let me start by saying that this game looks good
the ghosts and the mansion look very creepy
reminding me of silent hill  which i liked
they definetly achieve making you a little jumpy and just pretty much designing a scary atmosphere
so kudos to them for that
hence my  starsthe gameplay however is terrible
the characters movement is slow and annoying
and her weaponan antique camera
who is the genius that came up with this one
not only is it a bad idea but they dont even pull it off
making it very hard to fight ghosts and needlessly tediousoverall i give this game  stars for the graphics and for the spooky environment
but the gameplay and overall game get zip
if youre really that interested in the idea of this game then rent it
dont buy it or you will regret iti am a huge fan of survival horror games and this game is just bad
the graphics are quite good and the level designs are very atmospheric but the positive elements stop right there
the gameplay is awful
the character is very slow and your only weapon is a camera which is not a unique twist it is an idiotic idea
it is beyond me how so many people are calling this the scariest game ever
i did not find this game to be even remotely scary
the ghosts are nothing more than annoying
also there are way too many of them
i could not finish the game because i ran out of film from being attacked by the same ghost spouting the same cliched b movie dialogue every five minutes which is fine because i was seriously considering just not playing anymore anywaythis bondwannabe game goes through the motions of a standard action game but leaves nothing out of the ordinary
the graphics are dated the story is used and the gameplay just isnt all that interesting
this is a dud in the action gaming world
dont spend your money on this onethis game is not all that great
graphics are choppy and load times are long
i say no one lives forever is crapaverage graphics slow gameplay insanely shallow dialogue and cheesy music
need i say morethere are four different modes of gameplay
two of them are racing modes  obstacle course amp time attack
two of them are battle modes  total fight amp freeze combathere is a breakdown of each modeobstacle course  you try and make your way through obstacles and get to the finish line before your opponentstime attack  you try and build a  second lead against your opponents while running through the obstacle coursestotal fight  you try and hit your opponents more than they hit youfreeze combat  you try and collect colored orbs while keeping your opponents away by freezing themyou play through  different levels for each mode
after you beat the extremely easy beginner circuit then you move on to the pretty easy pro circuit
after you beat that a final challenge circuit is unlocked where you have to go through all of the levels in all of the modes and beat dark rayman at them
you can also unlock bonus characters and four bonus race tracks which look awful
needless to say i was not impressed with this game
racing around on foot with rayman is terribly slow and you get frustrated watching him poke along
a better sense of speed would have made things more exciting
the difficulty of this game is also skewed more toward the  year old group and older gamers will find it way too simplethis game does have a multiplayer mode but you and your friends will definitely be bored of it within an hour of playing
this game is only recommended for younger players can only say that its disappointing
its not that the games arent true to the original
they are theyre perfect copies
that is unfortunately where this cart goes wrong
the games look great but the gameplay suffers
of the entire collection only asteroids can be truly called fun to play
the others scream for their original controllers
missle command and centipede both orignally trackball games are at best frustrating and difficult to control
after the first couple of levels on either game it becomes impossible to keep up
tempest and super breakout originally used a knob controller for smooth movement tempest succeeds best in this translation while super breakout is so difficult to control you cannot clear a single level
battlezone
well to be fair i always hated battlezone this version is ok
but the computer gets some really easy kills on you and it too becomes unplayable
as for the trivia game no one should know this much about atari
youd have to be rain man to know the minutiae involved in this quiz
i really wanted to like this cartas far as driving games go test drive offers nothing particularly compelling
it sets itself apart from other driving games in that it attempts to wrap a story around the races
seeing where this story goes makes for interesting gameplay but thats about itthe driving itself is pretty fun with courses ranging from twisting urban environment to rurual settings where you can really open it up
you have a variety of cars at your fingertips ranging from classic muscle cars to modern italian supercarsthe biggest downside to the game is that there is no damage model whatsoever
if you get into a head on at full speed youll see some impressive physics as the other car goes flying but no cars sustain any damage
all you loose is timetest drive is worth a rent but there are better driving games out there for the xbox such as burnout and project gothami still remember the very first test drive game for dos
it had ega graphics and all you had to do was press the up left and right arrows and it was tons of funlater versions of test drive for pc added better graphics and better physics but otherwise remained the same
this xbox version is more or less on the same track no pun intended
the graphics is good but not much better than the ps version
the gameplay is basically the same  lets race and outrun the cops
 although theres a mode quotundergroundquot with a storyline and another where you play the cop and tag the six racers to quotarrestquot them
there are four cities to choose from and a seemingly large number of trackswhat frustrates me about this game is in the basic racing mode you have to be  to win the race and unlock the goodies
and this is very difficult to achieve because the ai competitors are unforgivingly fast even though at times they seem a little quotstupidquot as they crash into walls and other cars  eventually they always beat you
plus its very easy for you to crash into walls and other cars  the car physics model is somewhere between arcade and serious simulation  and if you do this once in a race theres pretty much no way you can finish st so youll need start the race overthe designers could have made the game more accessibly by simply allowing a nd or rd finish even if that earned fewer goodies
i played the same tracks over and over again and after two hours i simply came to hate this game
its sad how unfun the test drive series has becomeso in short pslevel graphics and difficult gameplay make this game at most a rental title unless you are a diehard racing sim fanthis game isnt gooddont waste your money on thisi found it to have bad graphics and it just wasnt funi rented it and i became so bored with it that i took it back  days earlyif youre interested in a good racing gameget either sega gt  or project gotham racingexcellent graphics fast cars
problem i spin out often
i have been racing nascar for  years and i have won several championships
i have been trying to play this game but it wont let me
i have practiced and practiced to no avail
i have read the book over and over
yet at any time any lap i spin towards the left
you spin out go against the wall and that is where you stay
i usually have post position  and i am usually ahead and for no reason even though i glide into the curve and speed up slowly i still spin out
you are against the wall and you can only wait for all cars to go by
from st to  on one spin
 does not do this
computer cars are too agressive
yes  they have great crashes i dont want to crash i want to win
i am selling my  and   my fantasy
too real for meblizzards new installment into the warcraft world is an obvious atempt at bringing the worlds of starcraft and diablo into the already chaotic world of warcraft
the introduction of the hero that can gain experiance points is great for the single player missons but when it comes to a standard multiplayer game i just want to  build up my base and attack when im ready and not worry wiether or not my enemie has already gotten his hero to level  or not
the graphics sounds animation cutscenes and gameplay are great but the whole idea of heros makes me wanna go see whats on tvwc is just another rts
the addition of heroes is nice but game balance issues aside isnt enough to make this game feel new and differentif anything i found wc to be a step in the wrong direction
the singleplayer campaign is so highly scripted it feels like a sierra game where every two minutes the computer takes control away from you and you have sit and watch another cut scene
the maps are very restrictive with narrow pathways you cant walk through wooded areas channeling you down one or two directions in every level
this left me feeling claustrophobicthe levels make the game feel more like an old d sidescroller than a modern openended quotdquot game
the combination of heavy scripting and tightly constrained levels means there is zero replay value in the single player campaignif you want a rts that really has a new and different feel try kohan immortal soverigns and kohan ahrimans giftblizzards latest game warcraft iii has the momentum to make it one of this years best selling games however momentum does not equate to great gameplay
the idea to take diablo ii and warcraft two extremely playable games and meld them together to form a hybrid seems like an excellent concept
the problem is that you get the worst of both worlds
the tedious resource gathering aspect of warcraft and the micromanagement associated with d when you hire a henchmanthe graphics requirements are too high for what you get
compared to the graphics usage done by games like neverwinter nights wc looks like it was written for nintendo   blizzard should have stuck with d graphics like in starcraft instead of attempting to utilize d
make sure your video card can support the game before making the purchase
although listed as supported my compaq nc ati radeon mobility video card would not run the game
note that this card runs nwn halflife and wolfenstein just fine all of which make much more use of d than this game ever will
voodoo  cards can run the game but i found many screen artifactsgameplay is repetitive with little strategy
in the single player mission there is more cinematic than gameplay
ok if you want to watch a movie
not ok if you want to play a gamesave your money or spend your cash on a better game like neverwinter nights because this one is a dudcampaign modeis the best of the game
the graphics are awesome evenbetter of the own wowthe campaign explains to you many things of the warcraft universecustom gameone downside the  races may seem unbalancedyou need experience in rts games to win a matchif you are new to rts games be ready for a lot of defeatsfirst man to rush wins
 minute games max
this would have been a great game two years ago
certainly not worth the  bucks
all your paying for right now is hypei played this game at an online convention
the food limit was  and i had thought this would be reasonable anyway it wasnt as i spent about  or so workers trying to build up resources as normally gold is gathered at  per few seconds and  wood per
come on
then most major processes seemed to be a oneatatime deal making it take forever to build new buildings learn new skills and even just making troops leaving me open to attack
what really bugged me though was two things first you cant gather without your base creating a catch  where if it is destroyed you need a base to gain materials to build a new base
the second is the way food is gathered and done
its counterintuitive
rather than hunting down critters and expending resources making food decrease when you breed crittersthereby allowing more troops you have to operate within a very artificial limit
and it doesnt seem any way you can dismiss your characters nor does there seem to be a way to convert cough useless cough workers into fighters so you have  workers hanging about which should be  fighters
it is an overhyped overrated game as most of the major problems are addressed in age of empiresmyth games the food the workers could at least fight and if your base is destroyed you just die rather than be humiliated by not having the resources or the heroes of might and magic games your hero that uses magic is actually leader of troops rather than someone who just gets killed off along with the rest and they have wider selection of spells to bootso we were first told about counterstrike condition zero back in  when counterstrike was still a good multiplayer gamer not ridden with as many hackers and definitely not flooded with annoying highpitched kids telling eachother off through the voice chat featureas you would expect from my anger witnessed in the above paragraph i stopped playing the game
i waited and waited to get cscz the messiah of the counterstrike title
so it just so happens that the game gets pushed back a few months and then to the next year and then the year after that
after a while i lost interest in the game and just assumed it would never come out i was wrongso out of no where counterstrike condition zero appears on the shelves of game stores everywhere  and at a pretty unbelievable price
whats there to lose
i picked up a copy and ran home with it  ditched my important work i had to finish at home and saved it for later now it is counterstrike time
i load it up and what do i get
well first for all you linux users it was very hard to get emulating correctly on winex
if you are a linux user and a member of the winex community look at the message boards because there are now posts on how to get the game running correctly
so once i get my emulation problems out of the way i was up and running with my game
impressed
no i wasnt even close to impressed
graphics havent improved even close to what i would have expected them to in this day and age
new content
a little you get a few different weapons some fixed bugs a few new multiplayer maps and a single player addition to the game
so on with the single playerits awful
and unlike many games such as unreal tournament  graphics were not saving this gameplay fault
its not very easy to explain really but all you do is play the role of a counterterrorist leader trying to take down a terrorist organization from committing random acts of crime
no depth to this story here this is no max payne
overall the single player is not a great addition to this dying mutliplayer titlecould anything oh anything save this game from getting one star
something sure did save it
multiplayer something i havent got into yet is a bit out of the ordinary for counterstrike players
first it does not use that awful steam program to connect to servers
thank god
second it has implemented a nice little feature that stops hacking almost completely out of sight
thank you for this because the cheaters on counterstrike ruined the game for everyone and this is the one feature of the game that i thought was worth the fouryear wait
however not much has changed at all as far as gameplay goes in the multiplayer version of this game still your plain ol terrorist vs counterterrorist game trying to defuse the bomb or rescure the hostages or whatever
and a note if you hate counterstrike like i do for the same reasons that i do the annoying and immature players especially all the little children with terrible netediquet you will not be satisfied in this game
why
oh simply because theres more of them in the condition zero game over the original game
dont blow your money on this game as an excuse to leave the terrible playing environments found in the original because this is no sollution in condition zeroso this game isnt technically advanced in the areas of video or audio this game isnt offering a very stellar single player game and the multiplayer game can be found with the free version of counterstrike minus a little of the nonfriendly environments
what good is this game
beats me
overall this game would have earned maybe three stars or maybe even four stars had it come out on time
but honestly we did not wait four years to get a game of such low qualitydont waste your money on this game
theres better games to be bought for this price range
you can try max payne  a great single player game
or you can try out the warcraft series a game i love in the multiplayer scene
for a little bit more money unreal tournament  is possibly one of the best multi and single player games i have ever played in my life
these are better options that will keep you occupied when youre bored and feel the need to play a video gamedont buy this
i hope my review has helped many conciousbuyers out there cheating is such a problem that if you want to play this game then hopefully the single player mod will be good or else just play it on a lan with friends
the internet online games are rife with cheating
sometimes more than  of the players are using aimbot and wallhack and even the anticheating software is no good against them
be prepared to be slaughtered if you do not cheat
valve have done nothing to curb this problem and they have even managed to get the code for hl leaked so cheating is going to be rife again
they keep pushing the dates forward by  months or more which makes fans very unhappyanyway bottom line is the single player is all this going to be worth
the multiplaying arena is full of cheating and i would certainly not pay for a game that can not combat cheating
it should stay free until they can resolve the cheating exploits once and for all
cheating ruins this game
it is like getting scores of  kills  deaths and the guy doing it all is like  kills  death
is that worth your moneylets face itcounter strike fans will give this game high ratings no matter what
true die hard cs players like myself laugh at the weak attempt that was made in condition zeroif you have played counter strike you will be disappointed
if you have dialup or cannot access the interneti still cannot recommend this game unless the price goes below save your money buy unreal tournament  and download some of the weapons mods and conversion mods available for free
the enemy ai is mind bendingly awesome and will humble you quicklyplus you get a more dynamic game that constantly changes and is very dynamiccondition zero is stale repetitive the enemy ai is predictable the objectives are stupid  example you must rescue  hostages and kill a terrorist with the sniper rifle
ok finebut see how hard it is to rescue  hostages when your computer ai teammates keep killing the terrorists and finishing the level before you can rescue any hostages at all
i had to let the terrorists kill my guys on purpose just to get around this problemiv never been a huge fan of the the virtual fighter series and even after playing this game im still not
the game requires so much time and dedication to learn  the time and dedication that im not willing to put up with
the kumite mode diffuculty ranges from easy to challenges the devil has stacked against you
only reserved for virtua fighter die hardsyaaa i dontfighting games dont entertain me for longprobaly because i never have anybody to play them withi played this game by myself but could never figure out how to work the ai thingyi tryed and tryednever could figure it outthis game totally stinks
its all jaggy and the controls are slow
there isnt even anything remotely close to a story behind it
in fact if it didnt have liner notes i wouldnt know why anyone fought
there arent any movies at the end or anything
basically there isnt any reason at all to play this game
tekken tag and doa are way betteryugioh
 forbidden memories is pretty user unfriendly
the game doesnt teach you the basics of the duel monsters card game which is fine since it assumes only fans of the game will be picking up a video game adaptation but the real problem comes in when the game adds a bunch of new rules and changes and doesnt alert you to those eitheryou start off with a pretty shoddy beginners deck and are meant to fuse monsters together by either summoning them at the same time or stacking them on the play field in order to create better monsters
the combinations are at best contrived and at worst impossible to guess
often id create a fusion by accident by putting a monster on top of another when trying to summon it and would then be left to ponder if they fused because of the specific monsters involved or just because of their types
sometimes a fusion that one might think will work will fail because of some limitation on the summoning procedures which just like the new rules are not explained eitheranother unexplained addition to the game is the star sign feature which seems to give your monster an advantage in battle
each monster has two star signs and when summoning it you may select one
if your monster has a star sign advantage over your opponents monster youll receive a small boost to their attack points similarly to the boost you might get from using appropriate magic cards
this addition is pretty wholly annoying as its difficult to keep track of and easy to forget about in many casesthe game ramps up its difficulty pretty severely once you hit a certain set of duels and once you get to that point just combining your monsters wont be enough as this game has no summoning limitations and your opponents will be able to summon high starrating monsters within the first few rounds of play
the game seems to expect you to grind free duels in order to get star chips which you can then use to purchase more powerful base cards for your fusions if you know the password for the card you want with some expecting  star chips in order to purchase the card
you may decide you want to forgo the grind and just play the campaign straight through but since you only receive a single usually unhelpful card for each duel you win and a meager handful of star chips its pretty much impossible to get through some of the tougher duels without grinding free battles for at least a few quality cardsto the games credit theres a lot of brand recognition lots of appearances from wellknown characters from the show and common cards from when the original boosters were circulating
but thats present in almost every yugioh
video game so its not enough to float the game on its own
other pros include a pretty good soundtrack for a ps title and some tweaks that improve the game overall notably the fact that equip items do not take up a magic card slot and the fact that fusion does not require a facilitating magic card to pull it off
but these things are not enough to set this game apart from the pack
if you have a nostalgic token for games of this time period and yugioh you might get some enjoyment out of this title
but otherwise id skip ityet another game i regret buying for the xbox system
the controls to this game are horrible
gun valkyrie has great graphics but the controls and background music just plain bites the big one
i dont know what microsoft is trying to pull on the masses perhaps a secret poll to see just how many people out there like to waste their money onsystems
so far all i play on my xbox are halo  max payne thats it every single game other than those two i have bought for the xbox has been so terribly bad including gun valkyrie i return the following day
mostly trading in for playstation titles
i truely regret buying the xbox system i should have just bought money bucks worth of stuff for my ps
if sega would have fine tuned the controls of this game unstead of getting all the eye candy perfected gun valkyrie would have been a cool gameif your debating buying a ps or xbox system heres my  centsplaystationway better games
excluding that waste of time and money state of emergencymore selectioneasy to control the gamesps has its own chick fighting game called onixboxonly  games that are worth playing halo  max paynegrowing assortment of worthless games that look great but stinkthe xbox does allow me to watch dvds and store some songs that cannot be listened too while playing gamesdont believe me
go out and buy a few hundred bucks worth of xbox games youll be here that night crying on the net just like me
go on do iti cannot recommend this game to anybody unless i want to see that person throw a fit
the only thing this game has going for it is its visuals
thats why i gave it a  instead of  the music is lousy and was so repetitive i had to turn the music volume way down just to keep from getting a headache
the story is as wierd as any other japaneese anime of late
this game had the worst controls i have ever come across for the xbox and that includes quotgrabbed by the ghoulesquot
even if only properly used the controllers took a lot of physical abuse in this game
this is because an often used move thrust essential to the games play has been assigned to the left stick depression with no possibility of remapping
the problem with the thrust being were it is is that it has to be combined with a directional move to even work
directions are also controlled with the left stick
so for example a basic move would be push left stick in hold it down and move forward
that would give a forward thrust rather than just a forward walk
sounds simple enough on paper but when you are forced to moved about the game like this for hours on end thrusting quickly takes over walking it gets to your thumbs as well as your controller i am sure
i would fail a thrust move often just becasuse it is physically awkward to perform not just because i run out of thrust fuel
during those times i would fail to push in the stick hard enough to initiate that thrust
to add insult to injury this game doesnt end with just basic thrusts
to invoke more powerful moves from your character series of thrust moves have to be performed one after another without any break in combinations
one mistake and you start all over
to achive a quotheightenedquot state from within your character  uninterrupted thrust moves have to be performed
uninterrupted means that you cannot get hit by enemy shots or touch the ground
this is really hard to do in game considering the small amount of thrust fuel at your disposal
throw in the aformentioned controls and it borders on impossiblethis very arcadelike game gets its inspiration from segas ownclassic space harrier and its story line directly from the animateds giant robo series
a strange doctor discovers a new powersource that radically advances society but mysteriously disappearsthereafterthis review was rewritten after many hours of gameplayand will highlight some of the frustration experienced five orsix levels into the game
out of the box its a good looking robotechshooter however just start playing it awhile and you will see howthis game can riddle you with anger
if you thought playing gothamracing  almost broke your controller you will bash it to splinterswith this onegameplay is teasing and very demanding
this is a jumping gamefirst and shootem up second
more times than not you will findyourself just barely missing a critical jump to a ledge only to startagain from the very very bottom of the board
for that unfuncharacteristic two stars get taken off an otherwise  star ratingthroughout the terrain you will find obvious surfaces you should beable to land on but cant
its like a literal glass ceiling wherewaterfalls and vehicles are to look at  but cant walk under or landonnot being able to save inside a  minute long mission meansyou will have to repeat your failures over and over again
imsurprised when they were doing the qa they failed to noticetesters smashing the controllers and throwing their arms up infrustration because all of your progress can be lost with theslightest twitchthe control over your movements can be compared to a pinballbouncing  off rubber bumpers your uncoordinated movementsare like mere flippers keeping the ball on a wild coursethe spastic nature of the jet pack will have you screaming at thetv
i compare the sensation to trying to land a hot air balloon on amoving carthey made this game way too hard and the level designers were wayout of touch with what the character is capable of physically doingi kind of like gun valkyrie but after watching a number of friends and especially kids play it i have to warn against spending  on it
two reasons  the controls for flyingjumping are overcomplex and several missions cannot be completed without this move so you get stuck and ultimately bored
you cannot save during a mission so if you get bored with trying the same jump over and over you will have to go back to the beginning of the mission if you dont want to leave your xbox running all night
this imho is the biggest single mistake any manufacturer can make with a video gameas i said i kind of enjoy the game and my more dextrous gamer buddies have little problem with the controls but a majority of casual gamers that i have watched play get frustrated and even angry with the game
so i would have to recommend against buying itbaseball advance is a good solid game but it was overlooked in several areas
first of all you can only play in  different ballparks instead of being able to play in each of the  major league stadiums
you cannot steal theres no autofielding option and you cant be hit by a pitch it just goes right through you
plus if you want a baseball game where you can play with a friend at the same time you might as well forget this gamethe best baseball game for game boy advance would definitely be high heat baseball 
 players can play at the same time you can steal bases with ease and if the ball hits you you go to st base
another aspect of how high heat baseball  is a more superior game is that it has updated  rosters while baseball advance only has  rosters
plus high heat baseball includes all  major league baseball stadiums and it has a home run derby feature where you can show off your hitting with any player in the major leagues even pitchersive now given you all the true facts about these two games so its now up to you to make the decision
i personally would purchase high heat baseball  because of all of its ingame features that it has and the easy smooth play control along with great graphics
thq just went to sleep on baseball advance making the game hard to play and just plain boring
its your decision and an easy one at thatfeel sorry for anyone trying to pull off high scoring combos with the xbox controller
expect to throw your controller frequentlythe gfx might be good but what good are realistic graphics when the gameplay stinks
this game has amateurgamestudio written all over it there is only one way to beat every level
that makes it basicly a walkthrough interactive movie with linear advancement gets very boring and doesnt require intuitive or logical thinking on the part of the player
after playing games like deus ex or nolfnolf which had excellent story as well as multiple ways to complete each level a game like unreal is a jokeplus there are lengthy loading screens about every  mins of playand im on a pghz with gb of pc and it takes min to load levels
i mean max payne had nearly as good gfx in unreal but had much shorter loading screens and they were few and far between and not to mention in unreal u must wait min just to quick load after you die it really tests your patienceon another note the reason i gave this  stars instead of  is because the introduction movieingame cinematic with studio logos actually puts you in awe very breathtaking but from there on out the game goes downhillalso for people experiencing crashes there is a patch out that fixes it i had the same problem i had to disable eax but after patch i can now enable it again and the game runs fineoverall
this game is a waste of money it belongs in a jewel case on the value shelfduckit seems to be a trend in the video game world to make a game that has little or nothing to do with the original
such is the case with unreal   the original unreal was an interesting game for a few reasons
in the course of the story you were dumped into an alien environment that was hostile and wondrous at the same time
nothing was explained to you and you were left to your own devices to figure out the world
it was a story idea that works very well with first person shootersnow quiet a few years later we are given unreal   a game that has little or nothing to do with the original
one gets the impression that the developers decided to buy the rights to the name to push an otherwise boring game ideanothing original is done here
the story is boring and totally pointless
this is nothing new in the first person shooter gender but it seems pointless to keep doing things we have all seen before
so like all first person shooters before we look for the innovations
something that sets the game above the rest of the pack
playing the game i could not find it
the graphics are quiet nice but the level design only get interesting at the end of the gamesince this game is a true single player game its over way too fast and the replay value is pretty much zeroits sad to see a original game like unreal turned into a game that will be totally forgotten in a very short time
its a shame really because the game is not bad but just not as good as it could have been
a different story line something closer to the original and less goofyokay first of all ive got to say that i love the graphics in the game but that is probably its only redeeming quality as far as im concerned
i have listed my multiple beefs with unreal ii as follows
storyline has nothing to do with the end of the first unreal
john dalton your character moves waayyyy too slow
its almost like he tiptoes his way into battle
there are only about  or  levels altogether
the first unreal had  levels not including the intro and ending sequences
what happened to the rest of the enemies of unreal 
most of the enemies in unreal ii are human boring
i want my krall my titan my skaarjgunner my brute my gasbag my devilfish my skaarjgunner my skaarjberserker my skaarjwarrior my skaarj
too much babysitting  i hate waiting for other characters in a game while they sit around doing their thing
there was no quotbossquot which took about  or  rockets to kill like in the first unreal
wheres the sense of accomplishment
where are my powerups
why is that such a bad thing
why did they even use the name quotunrealquot with this game
so there were a couple of skaarj from the first game and the dispersion pistol which cannot be upgraded  bummer was available
big deal
there is little resemblance to the original game
i know that the makers of the game wanted unreal to quotevolvequot and to give it a different storyline but they didnt have to ruin the game like this
you cannot skip the cinematics
why cant you just hit the mouse button if you dont want to wait for people to finish talking
and why do you have to wait for aida to take her sweet time to waltz from one computer to another
why cant you just skip the debriefings altogether
boy what action this game hasbottom line if it werent for the excellent graphics i wouldnt even give this game  star
heres to all the newest games with all your polygons and polident and whatever else it is that makes great graphics
i think ill stick to the original unreal which has been out for almost  years now thank you very muchmy initial reaction to this game was that of annoyance  i wanted to start playing but couldnt because i had to wade through several minutes of unnecessary speech
i assumed this would be temporary but no  the nonskippable cinematics and speeches are a painful part of this gamethat said to call unreal  a sequel would be an insult to the original  unreal being a great game from both visual and entertainment perspective
the new levels are good looking but like many have noted short linear and nonexpansive
compare this to the first unreal in which every level was large and varied
in addition levels in unreal connected very well together and the bits of information pulled from electronic diaries were enough to understand the plot of the game while unreal  is quite the opposite  after every level you end up on the mother ship and have to take off to another planet if you can sit through another boring briefing by someone who looks more like a playboy playmate than a member of military personnelyes unreal  is very good looking but that doesnt take away from the fact that it should be a shooting game and not a sad attempt at a halfarsed rpg
people shouldnt have to sit through  minutes of speeches just to start the stupid game  its a shooting game for gods sake not final fantasythis game does have some redeeming qualities  the weapons are very interesting for one thing
the levels are also different from one another visually
also the idea of having extra firepower on hand marine assistance is fun every now and then
and sorry i cant think of anything else
the rest are cons  long winded speeches about nothing in particular weak plot extremely long loading times even for a machine less than a year old linear gameplay very little freedom and restricted level structure
the game is also painfully short  it really can be finished in the matter of hours
i managed to actually finish it on my work computer within a week playing half to an hour a daythe original unreal was very impressive as it ran circles around quake visually
while this one looks nice it lacks serious innovation
sure the poly counts are higher but what else
not much apparentlyplaying unreal  has got to be one of the most tedious gaming experiences i ever had since i played hunters the reckoning for xbox
the plot seems like something right out of some scfi tv show
you are an exmarine on a ship with a crew you get missions from one of the crew members and youre on your way
daltonthe guy you play as says the most stupidest things i ever heard
the graphics are great but the level design looks like it was inspired by star wars
i almost fell asleep while playing the second level called quothellquot why its called quothellquot is beyond me because the level is on a snowy planet
you battle these giant bugs
why introduce these new creatures
why not just give us the skaarj
you get to see them on the first level along with quotspace monkeysquot but the awesome atmosphere that the original unreal had was missing
heres another thing no multiplayer
soldier of fortune  had tedious singleplayer but the multiplayer component made the game worth buying for alone
i know they didnt intend for unreal  to have multiplayer but if it did  it would have probably better then the singleplayer portion
folks do yourself a favor and pick up these awesome titles unreal gold unreal tournament  halflife soldier of fortune for multiplayer only
i never even finished unreal  and i dont intend to either
im just going to wait until a cool mod is released and at least ill have unreal  to play iti am very impressed with the graphics
the problem with this game is the lack of content
it is a frenzy of mindless carnagejust shoot shoot shoot
like serious sam on steroids
to take a beautiful graphics engine such as this and use it to produce adolescent rubbish is a crime against technologyas expected unreal  has some pretty nice graphics and environs
each world is nicely done and filled with ambient wildlife great lighting colors textures all that stuffunfortunately unreal  is anything but
gameplay is very uninspired and trite
its more of the same move linearly from point to point blow up a few baddies press a switch go to another point get blocked from main route find some alternate route kick more butt ad infinitum
occasionally youll need to protect a scientist or fight with a couple of marines but those moments are rare
the only refreshing feature is the use of turrets and laser shields
a few times you will need to strategically place them to defend your position from overwhelming enemies
unfortunately their usefulness is limited and you will find yourself out on the field doing much of the workone of the things i enjoyed about this game is weapon selection
sound effects are nicely done and you can feel a noticeable punch when you fire
theres no useless weaponseach weapon is ideal for a given situation and there are two firing modes
youve got a gun that shoots spiders
 sniper gun with a scope that really zooms up close grenade launcher with several different types of grenades powerful shotgun that has an alternate firing mode that blasts your enemies on fire and finally my favorite the ultimate weapon that fires miniblackholes and sucks in your opponentsyou are taken from mission to mission on different planets in your small space cruiser
this could have been a nice touch but its poorly implemented
the ship is merely used as a device for useless briefings and conversations with your three crewpeople that move the story along
like the story the conversations are linear as well and frequently consist of  yes  no
there are no conversation chains just a number for each tell me about subject
much more could have been done with the ship
for instance it seems as if the whole galaxy is after these relics that you are collecting and anyone notice
for some reason the ship is never in any danger while you freely roam the galaxy
some space battles or anything other than the usual fps faire would have been nicewatch a few cheesy science fiction movies or games and youll see where unreal  gets its plot
as suggested earlier you need to recover all  pieces of some ancient powerful artifact
regarding your mission theres hints of a conspiracy and things are not what they seem
come on
dont insult our intelligence here
hasnt this scifi theme been played out enough alreadyai is about the same as in unreal
player movement is very slow must be the power armor and its hard to dodge the highly accurate fire from your enemies
you spend lots of time running behind cover instead of jumping around and running circles around your opponentsno multiplayer
these days this is inexcusable
of course in the future theyll probably sell a multiplayer addon for  bucks
sighgame looks beautiful and runs smoothly at a nice framerate on my midhigh end system p  geforce 
though ive heard some people have had problems with it crashingmusic is not bad but not memorable eitherfinally the worst thing about this game is that an average player can complete this in  days
with no multiplayer theres no replay value other than the next difficulty setting but what fun is that when the missions are all the same
if you really want this game you should rent it wait until it hits the bargain bin or get it through other meansoverall a true fps fan will enjoy unreal  for a few days
players who enjoy this genre but are looking for something new or something unreal will be very disappointed this is just bythebook fpsi really loved unreal
im also really impressed by unreal tournament   but i cannot believe what a poor product unreal ii the awakening is
while i can see that they needed to give you more storyline than previous fps games i simply find the characters boring the dialogue pretty triteyes even for a macho firstperson shooterand the gameplay terrible
the animated cutscenes while pretty tend to go on too long and usually involve a long shot of a ship landing or docking or someone walking up a staircaseits really like ut and unreal ii were built on  different engines  they play like night amp day on my system a pretty decent piv ghz mhz fsb with gb of ram
movement is sluggish weapons work soso and although unreal ii gives you the ability to quotvault upquot onto those crates and boxes that are so hard to negotiate in other fps games you still feel like youre wearing weights on your ankles
i can play at any resolution or level of settings and the gameplay is the sametheres also bad cropping of the map  ive run across quotinvisible wallsquot that are in the middle of walkways enemy combatants that get wedged into the landscape and jog in place and objects that look as realistic as any yearold fps from the days when piii was cuttingedgeid suggest you consider unreal tournament  and playing as one player with a lot of bots if you want a singleplayer game instead of trying to slog through the poor performance of this game
the only reason im giving it  stars instead of  is that teams of ai bots tend to behave better than the bots in the original unreal
this doesnt redeem the game but it makes me see that they tried to bring something to the sequelim really torn as i write this review on the one hand i had so much fun beating this game but on the other hand its just isnt worth its price tagthe graphics are the best out there today but this comes at an extremely high cost i own an extremely high end system and it chugged pretty bad some placeswhen it comes to first person shooters for me the main fun is in the weapons and this game has no lack of weapons
while a lot of the weapons are kinda weak and could be done without some of them are just plain cool
i personally loved the very last weapon in the game although a bit overpowered
some of the weapons could have been more balanced but you certainly have a wide variety to choose fromi have heard mised things about the ai while i didnt pay much attention to thne ai ive heard it is extremly good however it cant live up to its potential because of the restricting corridors that plague the gamethis game is full of action and most of the time you wont have trouble finding where to go
this is the way i like a gamehowever it justends i beat the game in  days and i wasnt by any means playing through it nonstopi cant justify the price tag without a multiplayer modefun while it last but not enoughtetris is awesome
i could play that time waster all day  but something is amiss with this game and it manages to make me not want to playit could be the loud thumping synth and techno music that plays in the background on infinte loop or it could be the fact that they attempted to add a story to tetris by adding strange creatures that speak a more annoying version of animal crossings babelese it could be that the colors look like they have been washed out and are difficult to tell apart or it could be that there are barely any modes to play except marathon tetris gamesi think the real reason is that they just botched it
its tetris in some ways but theres just something off about itits the simpsons in a skateboarding game
i thought it was pretty strange myself but i guess it was brought onto the market because of how big the simpsons are and how big skateboarding it
sounds like a great match of course for me being a simpsons fan and a skateboarding kid
well it wasnt
the graphics were not good even for the cartoony look they had the control was absolutely terrible every trick wasnt fun to look at the level design wasnt good the lines characters say is repetetive and there is just not a lot of characters to play as
i am a gigantic simpsons fan but that does not mean i like the video games
 except hit and run and road rage 
i definitely think you should pass this one up everything about it is bad which means nothing about it is goodi didnt expect much from this game giving the bad reviews
honestly i dont really know why i bought it
i guess i was just in that simpsons mood where i had to have everything simpsons
but i bought it im stuck with it and frankly i dont mind being stuck with it
its not a horrible game however its not a very good game eitherthe overall idea for a simpsons skateboard game is perfect
i mean in the early s i looked to bart as a skateboarder
one of the simpsons best gags is homer skateboarding and tumbling down a cliff side
why not a simpsons skateboarding game
well its the way this game was executed that doesnt deliver
the maps are really big and are filled with springfield townspeople and locations but they feel really thrown togetherthe graphics arent extremely bad but theyre pretty bad in some ways
they did make the characters look pretty decent and the buildings look like they should but everything else is pretty bad
one of the worst things is the scaling of characters to buildings to objects
bart simpson is about the size of a cars tire and doors on buildings are obviously for giants
the buildings seem a little wide as well
it just seems like they ran out of time to polish these things in the game
the physics in the game are pretty bad even for a dated game
it manages to make turning around on your board a chore and hitting a move correctly even more of a chorethe sound effects are pretty bad too
while the voice actors are here the game basically has to repeat everything they say over and over
its a little disappointing but i expected that as well
other than that there seems to be very little sounds and hardly any good music to go with the game
i figured theyd at least put some decent songs in there but its all original stuff that doesnt fit skateboarding that wellregardless of these things gameplay is always the most important thing we deal with and this game bails bad in this
theres a lot of invisible walls youll run into or my favorite running into a sidewalk and having to pick speed back up
the overall mechanics seem to be chopped up into a complete mess
the overall skateboarding experience just feels too generic
i mean it does feel like youre skateboarding as in youre riding a board but its just too hard to really pull off amazing moves
you have to max out stats to get anywhere in the game and to max out your states you need to get places in the game
lastly the characters you pick from is really limited
theres  or  id have loved to skate with grandpa
how hilariousit would have been a bit better to make this just a tony hawk clone completely instead of partiallybrowsing through the mix of reviews here for this game piqued my interest
the game seemed unquestionably bad but yet with a glimmer of fun for the hardcore batman fan
being just such a fan i decided to rescue a copy from the bargain bin and try it out myselfill say its an absolute shame the controls and camera in this game suck because otherwise this couldve been the groundbreaking comic booktovideo game translation
the production values are amazing
you get not only very nicely rendered models of batman and major villains like the joker and mr freeze but also a bucketload of lesser villains and supporting characters like black mask killer croc ratcatcher lt montoya and the cassandra cain batgirl
this is probably the only time fans will ever see these characters in d there is a full orchestral soundtrack which can also be unlocked for listening along with a gallery of production art
the voice acting is suprisingly strong too considering how fans are used to the superb voiceacting from the animated shows
the ingame graphics are also nicely detailed in ways that the celshaded vengeance and sin tzu batman games cant hope to matchhowever playing the game is like performing a masochistic ritual
the camera is fixed like resident evil but cuts to so many different angles in a single room that it screws up the players sense of direction and control
finding black mask in the warehouse stage while he guns you down is horribly frustrating
there is also the poor implementation of stealth
in a bit of realism enemies gang up on you and even kick you when youre down forcing you to find creative ways to fight them seperately
you might be asked to lean out from behind a crate knock an enemy down with a batarang then go up and disable him with handcuffs
however by the time you toss the batarang press the various buttons to unstick yourself from the wall and maneuver the camera angles to find the bad guy you just took down hell be back on his feet and have sounded the alarm
what could have been a fun stealth experience is completely ruined by poor programmingif kemco had put just a bit more polish into this game it couldve been so much better
batman dark tomorrow is playable but only in a way that makes you scream in frustration every step of the way
if youre a batman fan i invite you to come experience the pleasure and pain
if youre not theres no reason to go near this game at allbeing a quottycoonquotsim fan i figured to ignore the warnings of other bad reviews and got this game
i like malls and shopping i  love sims so how bad could it beya its pretty badthe graphics although apparantly take a lot of system resources to run remind me of the old nintendoarcade game quotpaperboyquot
the movement and detail of the characters are about the same and look very underdevelopedthe game does have a lot of potential
there is a large variety of stores products and decorations you can select from to build several floors worth of mall
however the purpose and goals of the game are vague
the ingame help and descriptions are limited and the play is not as userfriendly as other games in this genre
there is plenty of quotsceneriosquot to play but i have yet to win or lose one and not sure how to
you do have control of the store names and some details but there is no control or details about the customers that roam your mallafter playing this for a bit i decided to go back to playing quotsimshot datequot where i could build shops and enjoy a game with some purposeoverall with mall tycoon i feel like im playing a beta version of a game and want the final product that i was hoping forgreat concept yet it was tourn apart by the terrible programming
the controls are hard to get used to and the animation is poor
they messed up how the mall should be made
it should have been that people came in and asked you to put their store in but you have to create each of them
all though this is a good point its also one of the bad ones
i hate the animation because the customers dont look like they buy anythingword of advice to the makers of this game  think a bit more before you go and ruin something as cool of a concept as this
there could have been so many more options and better graphics as well as soundsi am a huge fan of tycoon games and this one is awful
what few controls you have are not instinctive and its basically just boring
you buy a shop which is premade and plop it down on the plot
thats about all there is too it
plus you can hire a few people janitors and security i believe and thats about it
its boring the graphics are horrible and its a waste of money
believe me i have played just about every single tycoon game out there you will have a lot more fun with zoo tycoon rollercoaster tycoon simcity the sims even restaurant empirethis game looked cool after i read about it a month or so before it came out
i bought it and i do admit it was fun when i first played it but theres not much to the game after the first few hours
the graphics leave much to be desired with simple polygons and such and the zoom levels arent that good
you start out with  or so to build your mall
you will be lost without completing the tutorial which is tricky
i needed help from the games message board provided free online just to finish it
you build walls entrances atriums and of course stores
there are four types of stores to choose from with a good selection of products such as clothes electronics housewares etc
but once the mall is built it gets boring
there are only like  or  types of shoppers and it does not show them in your stores
they simply walk up to the entrance disappear and then reappear with bags
i built an atm and pay phones and no one even used them
there are also basic repeating animations such as clerks inside each store which get very boring
the game has little replay value
it is a cool idea but could have been a lot betterwhat a tragedy
perhaps the later versions of the game have fixed all the problems with the original but since ive only played this one i can only speak to itgame summary build a mall from the ground up
lay the floors walls stairs doors stores etc
control marketing staff special events and store price margins
the game concept itself is great and appeals to any tycoon fanpositive aspects a great selection of decorations stores and improvements
the possibility for combinations is really good
some stores can have up to  different departments and you can mix and match whats available in them the game interface is easy to use
once youre familiar with where everything is youll find it very simple to navigate
the buttons are all organized fairly well and make it simple to understandnegative aspects the graphics and sound are rough
sometimes irritating
every single time you build something you must endure the sound of a construction crew at work  or shut the sound off
the music is rather lame
the graphics are poorly done
some of the animations are okay but overall the effects are lacking theres no tutorial to speak of
the one provided in the game is more of a brief talking head trying to explain a couple of things about the game to you the gameplay is disappointing
you can build this great looking mall with tons of different stores and endure a meager  people shopping in it
which of course doesnt do wonder for your finances
its difficult to tell how to attract people how much to charge stores for operation and what to research nexthope this helpsnot the best game you gott a have a pretty much powerhouse computer to play it without lagafter releasing the great spiderman mysterios menace for gameboy advance i thought that this would be a similar and great game instead spiderman the movie lacks any complexity and diversity
you are of course spiderman armed with a few punches uppercuts wall clinging and limited web slinging ability you actually need to find a building in web slinging distance and finally wall clinging
as for spidermans other tricks like a web shield web bullets and webbing bad guys those are special items that you need to pick up in order to have them
there are unfortunately no maze levels providing simple straightforward gameplay against dozens of enemies per level
after every two levels a villain steps forward to challenge spiderman
unfortunately because this game is based on the movie there are less than stellar villains
the vulture and the scorpion were never hit villains
the story itself for the game is very watered down compared to other spiderman games and the interludes are not comic strips or animated in anyway instead its spiderman talking
something that does add to the playability of the game is the fact that you can actually take pictures by pushing the select button and you can view them at the end of each stage
this game is a letdownkains back from the deadand this time hes boring as and loving it
despite having a gripping dark tale to work with and superb graphics to match this game sequel is just too painstakingly slow and poorly paced for effective and fun gameplay
heres some pros and cons and unfortunately the cons winpros dark creepy tale  fun to jump into this world if just for a short while good graphics voiceovers and music
kains jump and glide move is a cool way to cruise around town
also the sidekick vampire chick is a hottiecons slow slow slow
im ready to play but have to wait through seemingly endless hours of painful dialogue awkward fighting
i know this kain guy can tear some action up can leap  feet into the air can suck blood and vanish into the mist etc
 but he fights like a total  with a big here it comes im about to hit you with my claw look out ready  one would hope hed be a little more coordinated
wait im turning around wait hold on i just irecommendation  all in all solid package but not paced quickly enough to keep my interest  finally when the fighting does begin its just a little too awkward and sucking blood out of these corpses tends to get old after the rd time
rent first then buythis game was simply a waste of potential
i am glad i rented this game firstbecause after completion i had no further desire to play it again
this game portrays the vampire subculture in a very cool way
the story was entertaining but the voice acting is where the game really shines
i sometimes want to play the game again just because of the great dialog
uinfortunately the gameplay is terrible
you fight with the same couple moves each time you get into a battle
punch punch grab throw
unless you have a weapon then expect chop chop big chop
the only thing that adds diversity in the monotonous fighting is the few vampire ablilities you can use
even then its still going to be the same silly fight after you use one of your abilities
they would be better off making a really intriging movie from this series because the game itself offers nothing but linear gameplay and tedious fighting puntuated with wonderful dialog and great voice acting
keep the directors and actors fire the game developing teamits ok nothing spectacular and it feels a bit tried
a bit old
it features no new game play that takes advantage of the added muscle of the next generation systems it seems contrived essentially like a playstation one game that has been rejigged with better graphics
eidos has been bereft of new ideas for a while now and the trend continues
one example in a tavern in the early part of the game i quickly disposed of all of the local townspeople but could still hear the chatter and the talk of the crowd
hey theres nobody around
the ai needs work since in many cases some of the townsfolk can see the brutal murder and blood sucking of one of their friends as they continue to chat among themselves as if nothing happened
come on guys
also block puzzles
block puzzles
seems like somebody doesnt have any new ideas
finally i have read that the xbox version is the only version that comes with real time shadows
however as you walk around a light source close then further away you would expect to see your shadow loom larger or smaller depending on your position
but in the game nothing
seems like a case of bad executionthe story is twodimensional doesnt offer a lot of suspense and is essentially straightforward with no real twists
the voice acting as usual in this series however is superbnot a horrible game but just more of the same
i would strongly recommend max payne over this if your interested in this genre
if youve played that then i would just keep waiting for some new ideas
this is not what we were looking forward tomuch of what im about to say has probably been covered by others but ill try my best to make things concise
this game could have been quite good but unfortunately has major flaws that make it more annoying than anything elsei found some difficulty with the controls
while all games require an adjustment period to get used to the new controls these are combersome no matter what
to turn your character around you must actually walk him around in a circle which can be quite difficult and deadly especially when getting attacked
while other games have a rotate button for fighters in d environments this does notnext i found the cutscenes to be horrible
not that the voice acting or animation were bad at all but rather that you cant skip over them with a press of a button
obviously if youre into a game youll want to watch a scene once to follow the story
but its just too much to take when you reach a difficult point in the game and get killed only to have to watch the same  minute cutscene over and over again until you figure out how to beat the particular situationlack of problem solving is another issue
why have a mature rated game with child level problem solving
all problems are obvious and usually only take a couple of minutes to solve at the most
the majority have a flashing beacon over the objective so you know exactly where you need to go and theres always only one very obvious solution to the problemfinally the gameplay just gets old
i suppose because the rest of the game is so annoying that you just get tired of dealing with the same old thing
there are difficult controls that once mastered make it easy to beat all enemies
tiresome cutscenes that seem to never end and problems that are all to easy to solve
and lets not forget the animation that causes many enemies and some much needed weapons to fall halfway or all the way through walls and floors
i was amazed to see that enemies will end up buried halfway into walls or stairs simply because thats where they landed rather than bouncing
if i didnt know any better i would think that this game had been made  years ago
this last problem is a programming error or laziness that theres simply no excuse forin the end rent this game if you have to but dont buy itdo you like button mashing games
games where you repeatidly press the same button over and over until the next level
if so then you will like this game
the game is similar the nintendo  version but has added many more levels and characters
the game is one to four players
the game is at its best when you are playing with four of your buddies but if you are playing by yourself it gets very repeditive and well boringthe graphics arent that great and well if you didnt know this was the gamecube version you would think that you were playing the  also it is very frustrating when you just miss two or three gems and you dont know where
the people at midway looks like they just rushed through this game to get it donethere are good things about this game
there are a few good things about this game
the levels and all the different combinations and weapons will keep you playing for a while
my advice is unless you love these kind of games i would just rent it
i dont think it is worth purchasingwhile gauntlet offers a lot of levels mosnsters and bosses it will get boring really fast
it helps to have friends playing but even then it will still wear off fast
if you dont believe me play all the way through the game then say its still entertaining
you almost cant do itthe game starts out great
the training missions are fast smooth and fun
i have to assume that all the high reviews are from people whove just started playing itthe problem is once you start the actual missions the frame rate seems to drop noticably presumably because of all the extra objects the game has to draw
not only that but the frame rate becomes uneven which makes targeting anything while on the move rather annoying
the pixelated graphics dont help and the fauxd is rather obviouswhen you compare it to say burnout  its clear that very little effort was spent to get the game running acceptably on the gamecube
ive seen smoother graphics on ps games i own both systems
definitely one to steer clear ofunfortunately i was one of those idiots who bought gamecube over ps
i bought ssbm rogue leader thps spy hunter and cel damage
spy hunter is the worst game of them all
the levels are too dark
the graphics on the otehr hand arent that bad
the weapons are too limited
the movies are horrible especially the saliva one
i bought this game knowing nothing about it
i regret i spent the money or so on this game
the multiplayer mode isnt fun at all
they need a deathmatch or something
i dont find killing a bunch of chickens fun though i do find it quite amusing
trust me this game is a total waste of money no exceptionsthis game gets old quick
despite the list of weapons listed on the box you really only use  the heatseeking missles
this game as a whole lacks any options for jazzing up gameplay and its pretty easy to beat
the only good thing was you can unlock the  classic game and play it
you might consider renting this game but theres no need to spend money on itthis is a pointless game with very little story
not very hard but with very very limited controls it make shooting the path in front of you even impossible
not my idea of a good game try somethin elsei am a long time fan of high heat and have bought every years version
this was not a pc game but a poorly executed console port
if i wanted to play a console game i would have bought the console version
but to get a console version that plays on the computer well is insulting
as others have written there is no mouse support
i could live with that if the interface was easy to use
this interface attempts to be cool which only leads it to being difficult and not at all intuitiveoften you get to a place and have no idea how to do what you want
the help key is not very helpful either
without a mouse it is hard to find what you want or to get out of the wrong place that you will find yourself often
i felt insulted by this gamei should have listened to the reviews that downgraded the game
i actually found the play at times fun but the game crashed x out of  games
not good
that it crashed during the only enjoyable game i had well was not reasuring
the addition of new pitch types was a good change
the circles to assist fielding are way to large and intrusive
the game often required six or more imputs to get it to accept the pitch selection
yes my sidewinder was calibrated and works fine with other games
this totally interrupts the flow of the game and is very frustrating
the player graphics look like they were taken from an arcade game and not as realistic as some past versions
some of the animations are really entertainingoverall i was very disappointed
getting a console game wrapped in a pc package to me is unethical
the menus are flat out awful
if you want a console game to play on a pc well this is fair
as a pc game it is poori have always been a might and magic fan
i thought  and  were great games despite the graphics because the graphics didnt get in the way and still set a good atmosphere
i realize they were dated but it workedthe graphics in might and magic ix so far are inexcusable
just in the training area there are a lot of clipping problems and i have already gotten quotstuckquot in between textures twice already
the mouselook is exaggerated which makes it almost useless
the text is blocky and choppy  it looks like zoomed in text on an lcd panel running at the wrong resolution
they really tried to take the faces on people and improve them but they look very out of place against the jagged backgroundon the positive side of the graphics the monsters do look goodthe sound is quite good however so im hoping a good sound card and  speaker system can help set the atmosphere
although get to know your sound system very well  i was presented with seven sets of d sound options with no explanation of them or recommendationsthe character progression model also looks entertaining and it obviously has some nice mampm touches that should still make it enjoyable
however it is hard to get around the graphicsalso as of april th do still does not have a support section available for mampm
thats right  no support
if youre hoping to find an answer as to why the graphics look so bad or why the text is jagged youre out of luckso the pros mampms have always been good in the past
the story seems to have some interesting lines to it
the character model look like fun mix without being overly complex
good looking monstersthe cons terrible d graphics that look flat and jagged  their old d model looked more like d
numerous clipping errors including the ability to get quotstuckquot
bad implementation of water
jagged text
no explanation of sound options on installnice open world looks good and with a fairly laid out story to back it
however controls especially for combat is garbage and instantly took the joy outta playing for mei might feel compelled to let more slide had this not been a sequel and had it not been on a console thats been around for years
i suppose what im saying is that there would be some relatively valid excuses for the problems that plague this game
but it is a sequel and the ps has been around a long time and theres no justification that can explain the horrid end result
the getaway brought enough originality to the immersive crimeaction genre that you could overlook how unpolished awkward and spotty it was
two years later black monday cant claim to be original rather a regurgitation of everything the first was but it too is unpolished awkward and spotty
yes they addressed some superficial problems with the first
traffic moves faster for example
but for the most part the most crippling and frustrating problems of the first are still here and theyre joined by some new onesnegatives
the controls and camera angles are terrible
i can only call the differences in play style of the three different main characters clumsy
mitchell has the amazing ability to instantly arrest someone no matter what theyre doing with a single button click
apparently theyre magic handcuffs
so when you get tired of shooting back just run up and handcuff them because thats far more effective
eddie is fun for a little while then its reduced to just mashing the same buttons to beat people up
sam is all stealth which wouldnt be so bad if the enemies ever bothered to move
i guess this is compensated for by giving them telescopic vision in the one direction they perpetually face
her section is painfully boring
either you sneak past or they see you
there are no stealth attacks
if they see you either youre dead or you hide behind something they reset and you try try againbut i have to come back to the first two points again
the controls and the camera angles are terrible
never before have i been so quickly turned off in the first few minutes of the game
you start by raiding one apartment
then with nebulous direction youre sent chasing off after criminals who are trying to escape
you end up bungling around in a pitch black apartment trying to work around obstacles you cant see unless they just happen to fall in the path of your narrow flashlight beam  which by the way you have almost no control over because the camera angles suck  actually i dont feel the need to add any more here
this game is borderline unplayablepositives
london is spot oni almost felt guilty writing these comments until i remembered what i had paid for this game
please do yourself a favor and dont make the same mistake
i cant even recommend renting it
if you have a friend who owns it they may well just give it to you to be rid of it but then id wonder if theyre a really a friend at allim giving it  stars only because the city is so well recreated
judging that aspect alone would warrant  stars
however the controls deserve zero  wait its my review negative five stars black monday holes
 the cameras negative five the interface one the writingstoryline a four or even five voice acting a four audio a two visuals a two replayability absolutely zero innovation one  i could go on but the point is that overall its subpar
this isnt worth owning at half the pricewell i started playing this rpg game because i really liked advance wars and someone said if you loved advance wars you would like this too because its also strategy
its fun but its also got major frustrations and disappointments
i started playing the game and thought i dont like this game but maybe it will get better
it did get better and i started to like the game but i was never satisfied with the gameplayok first whats goodits got a lot of different types of characters such as humans of various classes and fairies dragons monsters of many sorts both male and female
it also has quiet a few spells to choose from for the different classes that use magic
the graphics are decent but not great
the fighting sequences are fun but get boring fairly quick and require a lot of clicking through confusing menuswhat i dont like the battle navigation is too long and requires you to make too many clicks to get anything done
you even have to point your character in the right direction after moving him or her to a spot
even turning off some display options like the useless experience points notification doesnt speed things up enough
now experience what a mess that system is
every single battle you face the enemies will always be within  or  levels above your highest character and the same level or  level below him
everywhere throughout the map
its like everyone in the world keeps up with you and your training
you get more experiece for attacking someone a higher level and very little for attacking someone the same or below
so your characters are always advancing at the same rate throughout the gameexcept new weak characters who rapidly jump up in level until they reach the level as everyone else so going up a level is worthless because you never meet whimps who provide quick battles and you only use it to grow enough to use new spells change classes or use new weapons or armor
this is not a game to really explore
the routes are preset
there is no walking across the country side but rather just select one road from one city or site to the next
many times you find yourself just moving back and forth from one city to the next and back again waiting to be attacked so that you can get more money to buy something or convince someone to join your teami played all the way until the very last end boss
grrr
 battles each an hour long or more and you can suspend the game but never save it to a slot or go back to a city and get more supplies
then the very last boss hits your guys and does trememous damage
i cant kill him and i dont want to even try again after  hours of battle just to get to him
and i had to create two teams to get through parts of the game i didnt like having to do that
advance wars i plan to play again because it was fun
this game is going into a drawer to collect dustwhen you see the intro scenes for rallisport you think quotwow
this is going to be greatquot  unfortunately thats about as fun as it gets
sure the graphics are awesome and the number of car and driver options are titilating but the fun quickly runs out
i rented this game for the weekend and definately would not buy iti found the cars difficults to control and even with hours of practice there were some tracks that i could never win on even on the least difficult setting
in early career mode most of the more interesting races tracts and cars are locked out
until you achieve enough points you cannot get access to these advanced options
by the time you get enough points to get there you no longer caredefinately failed to keep me interestthis is not what i thought it was going to be
i never play it and my kids wont play it and my mom wont play it my dad wont play iti tried to like this game
i really did
one of my alltime favorite games was the underrated tetrisphere on the n
my friend and i would sit there for hours playing the darn thing day after day week after week
it has the perfect learning curve
the game kept getting harder and harder and you really had to put a lot of effort into the later levels but you prevailed in the end if you tried hard enough and developed a good strategy
one more important thingit was fun
this game on the other hand is too repetitive to be fun for very long
zoocube is honestly quite enjoyable for about the first  hours of gameplay you put into it
matching up identical animal shapes on a cube probably doesnt sound like much but youre always trying to get better and advance to the next level
it can be interesting in a certain sort of obsessive way for a while
the problem isit is extremely difficult
im an experienced gamer of over  years and it took me an eternity to beat the game on the easiest setting
suretheres a feeling of accomplishment after that but you realize that you hardly enjoyed the game while you were playing
there are seven levels you have to proceed throughone for each of the worlds oceans
beating those levels unlocks an eighth bonus level gulf of mexico
other than checking that bonus area out the replay factor is almost nothingunfortunately some game developers believe that if they make their game extremely difficult then the replay value will be high because you will never be done with it
perhaps there are people out there who really enjoy that
i dont
you can play the game on  different speed settings but unless youre superhuman the higher settings are all but impossible to get throughultimately the frustration factor is high with this game and you will probably end up becoming disgusted with it
that just isnt fun
i would recommend renting it if you can find it
however unless you are a die hard puzzle fanatic dont waste your money buying it
youll likely give up trying to get past the outrageously difficult and boring levels and your game will just sit around collecting dustit is a bad game
no need to go into detail its just a bad gamewell this game is ok
but its way too hard
i rented it last night and dident mind about it
it is easy to crash and way too easy to run out of timesometimes racing games always seems to be exactly all alike from each other every single time
that comes within the feel of the race and thensome
for burnout the game actually seems to falter a bit through the lines
largely because the game is one of the most lackluster video racing games ever
not only that the game also has its replays in crashes more likely than the game itself
although they are nice the feel of getting first place is really not there in this game at all
instead youre mostly draging around in the mud
the object of the game is for you to race and not only capture first but also fill your boost meter to the max by closely missing each of the ongoing cars
it does seem to falter a bit and also the game is not the best in control
i strongly suggest you pass up this game and instead get mario kart double dash instead
youll have a much better timethis game is handsdown the best racer for gc
but theres a major flaw
this game took me about  days to beat after you unlock everything theres really nothing left to do but  player mode which dries up easily
and the ai isnt nascar worthy
this game is great for renting but not for buyingpeacei have to admit that i am probably jaded
i got burnout  b before getting burnout  b and there is a world of difference
now if i had gotten b when it first came out i might have been impressed
but now there is no way i would trade them
b has much better graphics better sound slightly better control
b takes too long for many races
it forces you to see crashes way more often than you want to
i did not find b any quotharderquot than b just more annoying
the jaggies on b make it hard to see detail so that makes b so much more impressive it runs on the same hardware
only get b if you want the quotfullquot burnout experience andor are trying to be records the latter is my perspective obsessivecompulsive person that i ami lucky i rented this before i purchased it because the game is really boring and there is only a couple of vehicles to usei almost blewalot of money butinstead i got super smash brosthe crashes are stupidthe hood gets a little dent and the windows cracki dont like games that time you eitheri would recomend you to get super smash bros melee or starwars rogue leader or ssx trickybecause those are the best games on gamecube so farthere are lots of new games coming out so just waitwhen i rented burnouti thought that the crashes would be betterthe graphics would be betterthe sound would be betterthe gameplay would be betterbut all of it was worsegraphicssoundgameplaydumbi got this game for the ps
xbox games tend to have better graphics and sometimes extras features but never are that far different from what they are on other systemsnow the concept of this game is fantastic
any wrestling fans dream come true to be able to be so many different past superstars some of which are no longer with us
unfortunately acclaim makers of the game despite creating a new grappling system for this game still fail at making a great grappling system so youll find moves to be very difficult to perform a lot of times
graphics are on the cartoony side which didnt really bothered me much and are actually quite goodyou have nowhere near the match options other wrestling games of today like wwf games have
no cage match ladder match or even barbwire matchesoverall if your a long time wrestling fan buy this game
your appreciation of the old wrestlers featured in it will justify the purchase but if your not a wrestling fan or are more into the new style of wrestling and dont really know any of the wrestlers in the game pass on it
youll more than likely not like itmy initial reviewi dont dislike ecco but the controls and graphics are somewhat overrated
the underwater scenes are not as convincing as they should be for the ps
also the challenges sometimes seem like tedious buys work
i would recommend this game for those looking for something different but it is not on my must have listadded after trying to play this game for a few weeks i have learned to hate it
save your money this game is of poor quality and can be very frustratingi heard konamix was better than max but bought max anyway
i am a very good ddr player i can handle most  footers thats pretty hard for those who dont play or arent that good
i play mostly max on ps and th th mix at the arcade th mix is extreme
compared to these i was disappointed with konamix
the songlist save for burnin the floor matsuri japan afronova afronova primeval and bu was pathetic imo
plus i noticed a  second lag between myself hitting the arrow and the game registering it
could be that the disc was scratched
is it supposed to do that
someone tell me in a reviewget max or wait till september  and get max
trust me its better than this oneif you arent a die hard gamer this game is likey not for youthe controls in side scrolling lightsaber mode are complicated and nonintuitive
example  stop moving press the a attack button first then the direction pad to direct your attack
with most games its simply attack in the direction you are moving
while this may be life in the real world uh oh i better get ready to fight attack go for the chest it doesnt work so well in this game where the goal is to move to the end of the leveli didnt find the graphics to be all that impressive
its pretty hard to well show lots of detail on the small gba screenhonestly take this game on a test drive find a friend before you shell out the hard earned dollars for it  unless youre hardcorenow there have been some bad star wars games and this is one of them
when i first saw screenshots of this i thought it would be a great platform game like the original super star wars for the super nes
boy was i wrong
the controls are unresponsive and while the characters are nicely designed the background levels arent designed very good
the john williams score is grating on the gbas tiny speakers and all that combined means that you will die a lot
and when you die no matter how far you get in the level when you die you start over right from the beginning
all in all i think star wars fans should use the force and skip this oneman this game is sad
graphics are palatable but the controls kill what should be an otherwise awesome game
for example the controls during lightsaber battles are so complex that you are required to stand still while dishing out your justice wrestlemania xlets be honest this game is not acceptable by any means
whether ir be from a wrestling game point of view a sports game fighting game or even a video game in general it is truly not good at all
the graphics are sub par the controls are really bad even worse in my opinion than psone and ns wcw nitro and the sound is pretty bad toofirst off the graphics
theyre not clean and neat compared to the smackdown series on ps
each character is barely individual as well
they just have the clothes and the moves
other than that most of the characters look fairly the same
and lets not even start on the create a wrestler because that is also a pain
the game itself is surrounded on the ring and the first few rows of ringside seating and nothing else
what does that mean
it means you can only fight in the ring area
you cannot go into any back areas and going on the stage still looks a little plainthe controls werent working for me
i couldnt get it down no matter what i tried
plus the motions and movements of each character are a little stiff
the controls take a little time to get used to
after some practice its not so bad but still theyre a little advanced for younger gamerslast but not least the audio is a disaster
there is no commentary and there are no voices for the wrestlers
the only sounds i heard were when you hit the mat and the audience noise
and the some of the wrestlers entrance themes are off
perfect example the new world order music is not even the real thing
its some really bad guitar power chord and riff fusion and i assure you it sounds badunfortunately id have to say skip this one and wait until the gamecube gets another wwe game because wrestlemania x wont be worth your money
trust me i had to learn that the hard way
i bought this game and traded it back in  days
if youre still looking for a wrestling game for gamecube check out legends of wrestling ii
im not to fond of that game either but there are a few improvements to that game
again do yourself a favor and skip wrestlemania xi got in the mood to play wrestling games and it mostly stems from me having a lot of fun with them when i was much younger and really enjoying them up to about n but that was also about the age that i stopped following wrestling so i dont know many of the new wrestlers about the time that the wwe was formed as i was much more into ecw and wcw
anyways i got this game and i have to say that it just feels like it was rushed to marked on some sort of deadline but without the team behind it that many big sports games like madden have and i cant help but feel like if the developers had just put some more time into it then it could have been at least something
from what i understand this was a really big wrestlemania and it makes sense that they would want a video game tie in
i have to say that since i am not as familiar with many of the names as some of the other reviewers the game just doesnt look very good
there is a lot of footage mixed in which always signals to me that they had to put something there since the actual graphics are much to be desired
there really isnt much of a story mode and the create a wrestler features here are a joke and the most important part of any wrestling game the way that you actually fight well the controls and the point just suck
there is no other way to put it
the matches just feel aimless
easily the worst wrestling game on the market
sure thee are lots of different kinds of matches and a couple of cool features but maybe they should have focused on just getting the first one right and going from there
avoid at all coststhis game is by far the hardest one i have ever played
but i did beat the game it just took me a million times on each level to get through after ripping the game out of my ps several times and throwing it across the room
buyers beware
this one is hardthis game has many flaws
the graphics for one are basically just the same as driver for psone except for some cutscenes
the controls are poor and there is no way to change them
apparently if u r going in reverse u cannot use the ebrake
the gameplay itself is original but it just gets monotonous with no real storyline
u can build your own stunt arena and screw around there but that is the high point of the game
this game is basically driver with a limited amount of space and with your every move just yelled out to u  rent this game firsttoo much crap to get through before you get to do any gaming
a boring gamestuntman is extremely overated
the theme is interesting enough that i can see why some people defend the game so strongly
acting out stunts from your favorite movies is something anyone wants to do
yet poor design decisions and sloppy controls has made stuntman much much harder than it needs to be
you must rent this game before you buy it trust mei just dont like being forced to do the same limited thing over and over again in a game
you have to perform the exact stunts the game wants you to in the schedule it requires and the slightest mistake means instant death
hitting anything in the level any building car or even a fence or sign and you are forced to restart
fall behind even  second and the game only gets harder
and speaking of time i dont like waiting  seconds for the game to load after just  seconds of gameplay
when you are forced to replay a level  times i would estimate that youve got  hours of load time to sit through
it gets old fastthe game physics are extremely chaotic
collisions and jumps at any speed or angle can cause a flip or spinout all too easy and usually force you to restart
even minor steering adjustments can cause a spinout and cost you a hard played level
hitting a small curb has actually flipped my car onto its back more than oncethe levels are tight and restrictive with most obstacles appearing suddenly from behind a hill or corner with no time to react
you memorize this game not play it and as you play each level encountering something new will most likely kill you immediately
there will never be that magic moment you find in games like gta or tony hawk when youve learned the skills to start improvising reacting to new obstacles as you encounter them and making up your game as you go
no sir not this gamecalling stuntman difficult isnt accurate enough
frustrating too restrictive poor controls and annoying are better descriptors
i wouldnt even recommend renting this game unless you enjoy insane obstacles
buy it with riskthis game should have been great
the graphics are there the playability is there the concept is there and the originality is there
  what i wouldnt give to have a day with the source code
a few little tweaks and youve got a four star game
too badthis game is tough but more importantly its annoying
i realized that they were some serious issues with this game when i had to do the first stunt ten times
first off there is no walkthrough of the stunt
you have to emulate a series of stunts and they wont tell you whats next in the series until just when youre about to execute it
this meant that youd probably not have the right speed or angle going into the next part stunt
thats not too bad
whats worse is that the timing and accuracy have to be perfect for many stunts
if you mess up a little bit you run out of time and have got to start the mission againthere are six movies to complete each with about three to six series of stunts to accomplish
about half way through the second movie when i went through a stunt  times i realized that this was a waste of my time and energy
there were more worthwhile things to do with my life  like watching grass grow voting for third party candidates evolving watching behind the music of mc
hammer for the nd time  anything but this game was more worthwhilein short  avoid this game
i only rented it hoping to capture the essence of grand theft auto  and i still felt ripped offstuntman puts you behind the wheel as a stunt driver in six films that lovingly knock off classics ranging from  to indiana jones to the dukes of hazzard
the best label for the gameplay is a cocktail that blends pilotwings with gran turismos license tests hurtling along preset paths you must guide a vehicle through a precise series of jumps swerves and other hairraising maneuvers
the requirements for success are unforgiving and demanding if you lag behind even slightly or deviate from the path in the smallest way its stunt over and you have to start again from the beginning apparently the directors of these films dont edit
as a result this game is truly very hard and the absence of difficulty levels or even checkpoints means no mercy for lesshardcore gamers looking for a break
basically stuntman is about being perfectand incessantly repeating a stunt until at long last you get it exactly right
adding to the frustration the games physics sometimes feel wrong your car will often wreck in goofy weird ways fences that break in some places are impenetrable barriers in others and the like
if all that doesnt turn you off bump the fun factor up to  because stuntman deserves major props for its unique concept and thrilling stunts
the buzz of jumping a car over a moving train whipping it past exploding gas stations and then burning nitro to soar over a river just cant be denied
when you complete all the stunts for a film youre rewarded with the trailer which is a series of cinematics spliced with the stunts you performedand thats just way cool
the game also supplies an awesome stunt constructor which lets you create the craziest set of ramps barriers and obstacles you can conjure up then attempt to survive it in the cars youve unlocked
instead of that mode though what stuntman badly needs is a practice mode where you could take your time and master the stunts
after all dont reallife stuntman get to practiceor at least get a peek at a mapbefore the cameras roll
in the absence of those aids your frustration will rapidly boil over as you struggle more to learn than to execute
in a delicious bit of irony at one point a cinematic tells you that supercomputers have been used to model the precise speed you should hit a jumpbut that speed is never revealed to you
if youre the sort who likes to crack a tough nut stuntman has a pair cast in titanium
its definitely not for everyone but for the right gamer who can tolerate its flaws and appreciate its rigorous challenges its gold
if thats not you rent it for a quick spin and check out its cool driver  trailerthe dragon ball z cartoon series features awsome looking anime characters rapidly punching each other at ft in the air while flying at super human speeds and shooting out devestating exploding beams of god knows what
this game dosnt
this game has clunky piles of pixels that barely ever show any raid movement for characters two different attacks that all take time to charge up and can only be shot one at a time  basic punch move a main character that walks as if he broke his legs during a horrible standing accident and background tunes that sound like what shrank your ears back in the days of nes
there are some neat anime senes in there sometimes but still have the horrible background music blaring along with it
there are some moments with corny oneliners audio clips from the show but force you to look at the mudpuddle of a screen while listing to them
the graphics do feature some items and places that look alot like their anime counterparts in the show but have a horrible looking ground of dots of sanddirt color under them
the sound is also so bad  come on
you can put more effort into games than that
this could have easily been done on a game boy color
there are no pros i can say here
i dont understand how anybody can like this game
you trudge slowly through the terrain in the four cardinal directions no diagnols and shoot anything thats behind in front of or on your left or right sides
dont buy this
dont even bother to illegally download it for free or go to the trouble of even thinking of it
i should have said only that this whole time
other than my complaing thanks for reading through my complaingi hate games that are based on movies and cartoonsthy put no effort into itthey just make it so hard core fans of whatever the show or movie is will buy it because they loooove the showthis game is pretty badit has a bad and hard to aim battle systemi was thinking of buying this but i changed my mind after i tried it
and it is really shorti recommend golden sun if you like adventurerpg gamesif youre a hardcore dbz fan egt the game because it has a great plotline but otherwise dont
its extremly easy youll beat it in mere hours and gameplay is too easythis game is hard and boring
u can fight many enemys and hardly ever lv up
one wolf can kill u in  turns and ud need like  it gets pretty boring scince u cant hardly do nothindont buy this gamei rented this game a while back because of its innovative idea
control a mosquito suck blood from members of a family of three and stay alive through the summereach level has you in a room with one member of the family and has selected certain parts of their body for you to get a select amount of blood from
you have to be careful not to be spotted or theyll swat you and strike you dead
also many of the levels feature obstacles like mosquito repellant and candles you have to watch out forbut the problem is thats the entire game
about twelve levels like this some of which will take many tries that will only last you about two or three days at mostthe graphics are poor the execution is strictly alright so all in all this game is nothing more than an interesting concept
not really even worth a look even for fans of weird gamesthe goodnot really anything good but the game is really original
its kind of cool sucking blood
the mosquito looks flythe badso many problems with the game its tough to chose where to start
the controls are hard to get used to
rotating the right control stick to suck blood gets is annoying because any button you press will cause it to stop and if you have big hands it happens a few times
the characters a poorly designed im sure that one bath scene is what lured you to want to get this game but once you see her face well i dont think you would want any of that also the other family members look just as messed upthe battle type is really stupid and because of the bad camera angles is hard to masterthe levels are super smallbut most likly its largest problem is the fact that its to repetitive the characters do the same thing over and over and over and oversummaryover all a bad game
it may be fun and cool the first min but youll get tired of it fast so my recondmondation is rent it from a video rental store or friendhuh probably most reviewers wont agree with me on this one but i found this game extremely boring
im a star wars fan so i can appreciate everything w a good story decent visual etc
i know this game is fairly old but i still play old games even ones from the early s so old graphics really dont disturb me that much
but the storyline should be much better that dfs i never felt any interest in the game playing it was almost like playing quake  arena pointlessacting is almost horrible in this one  they shouldve gone with graphical cut scenes inseat of live actors acting is actually so bad that it hurts
most of the b movies have better acting than in this gameid say avoid this game at all costs unless youre a really big lucasartsstar wars fan
i got the game for a bargain price but still feel fairly dissapointedi bought this game by accident
i thought i was getting star wars jedi knight  outcast
turns out it was dark forces  my fault for not reading the description more carefully
even so i cant help but be dissapointedjedi knight dark forces  is the sequel to star wars dark forces
it follows the story of kyle kataarn
a young jedi straddling the line between the light and dark side of the forcei realise that this game is over seven years old
but still when held against games such as tom clancys rainbow six which was released the same year this game looks graphically challenged
the characters are rather stiff and rigid looking and the environments are extremely bland
the gameplay fares no better
it esentially consists of running around blasting and hacking various nondescript bad guys and later stormtroopers with little rhyme or reason
occasionally there are boss battles but those are often frustrating
eventually you are rewarded with different force powers none of which seem to work very well
the controls will often have you fumbling to find the right key for the right weapon or force power
also our man kyle is not exaclty the heartiest hero on video game
he is often easily overwhelmed and collapses in a heap making you restart the level
the level map is not very helpful eitherall in all i have to say that the games biggest downfall is its age
it just hasnt held up well over the years
unless youre a collector or a star wars fanatic its best to stear clear of this game
it wasnt very fun to say the least
spend a few extra bucks and either pick up jedi knight  outcast or even jedi academy
one thing dark forces  does is let you see just how far technically video games have progressed over the last seven years
other than that theres not much reason to play this gamei really wanted to like this game but ended up returning it after a few days of gameplay
since other reviewers have gone over the good points ill just highlight the bad points that killed it for me theres only one save file allowed and this file is erased as soon as you start playing
maybe the designers did this to emphasize the story or seriousness aspect of the game but it prevents you from saving at a decision point in the game and efficiently checking out the whatifs
i didnt have the patience to play all the way through the same point over an over to find out how things change based on my answer to the th question in a conversation late in story
and especially not when it takes me a good  minutes of walking through mostlyempty environments punctuated by careful combat to get to that point
when you die the swords you took with you from your warehouse go away permanently
the game boasts something like  different swords with  possible moves among them
great
but are you going to take your best lifeenhancing attackdefensemaxed swords into the story with you knowing youll lose them if your character dies before reaching one of the story endings
note theres at least one path that leads to premature death and its not in combat so you have no chance if you make the wrong decision
also losing the sword means losing all the advanced moves youve learned for it
if you start the game with another sword of the same type you are forced to unlock the moves all over again
like the savegame system this seems like an arbitrary obstacle to really exploring the depth and richness of the game because it forces you to be very conservative about your choices
they should have made the sword skills part of the character instead of attaching them to the specific swords to encourage people to try out the other weapons
its a painful choice you dont take your best wellused sword for fear you might lose it and you dont take a new fancyschmancy sword you just got because you dont know any moves for it and youll get killed and lose the sword by the first grunt
whats that leave
well i got very very good at using the basic moves of the default sword you cant skip or fastforward the dialog scenes
lets face it by the time youre trying to hunt down that last elusive story path youll have read the same dialog bubbles a hundred times
since they dont change and some of them take a loooong time to unspool youll be futilely mashing buttons to try to get them to go faster
the inarticulate grunts that were inserted in place of actual speech dont make these passages any more palatable
i figure they account for about  minutes of inactivity during any given  minute playthrough of the story
given that youll have to play the story many many many times to get all the story arcs and sword skills that adds up to a lot of wasted hourstoo bad
there are a lot of cool story arcs and sideplots in way of the samurai and much replay potential in perfecting ones sword combat with each weapon
but the game designers seem to have done everything possible to discourage you from exploring the game
if your idea of finishing this type of game was to get all the story endings and all the swords with all the moves then be prepared for a long tedious journey that has purposely been made much more frustrating than it has to beif you love activision or spiderman and are sensitive do not read any furtherthe goodsthe graphics and animation are cool but thats about it
also it seems that it does not work your computers butt off so thats coolthe badscorrect me if im wrong but i cant seem to brighten up the picture
the game does not let meit seems that activision and whoever they are working with enjoy making life miserable for anyone who likes complete control of their character
there was a spiderman before this and the controls were pretty bad
infact it feels just as badwell in this spiderman sm there is an awkward feel to the controls
you move forward sm moves forward you move backwards sm does not move backwards instead he turns  degrees and then he moves towards the monitor you
in most first person or third person games the keyboard controls the character the way you want
the mouse is used as a pivot for the characters torso movements however in this game the mouse control is completely eliminated
instead the mouse controls the angles
but wait
you dont really have control of the angles the angles seem like they are randomely changed to disorient you
thats right you are swinging left to right of screen when all of a sudden the camera angle decides to change by itself and you are now swinging up to down of the screen
cool eh
um noyou beat up bad guys
and they just fall and dissapear
not exactly fun
you are swinging in the air but when there are no more buildings above you your web is still pointing in the air as if they are attached to the clouds
it is a strange feeling
the spidey senses is not always accurate
you follow it to the best you can however sometimes the target is right under your nose but the spidey senses tells you it is that way or this waythe tuturial is also annoying
you get this voice maybe the movie actor himself i cant tell narrating the instructions to you but he throws in a bunch of bob sagat jokes if you forgot who bob sagot is he is the father in the old sitcome full house
i want to learn how to play not listen to some guy try to be funnywhen you fall from buildings there is an invisble barrier where if you cross it you would die
you cannot climb down the building and walk among the crowds
the invisible barrier stops you
not exaclty a complaint but a warning for those of you who have to get their nose in every aspect of a gameif controls are important to you do not buy this game
if you want a good single player game get maybe jedi knight  it has great controls and even greater multiplayeractivision and its partners could have done a lot better
it is ashame the graphics were negatively countered with poor controls and interfacei gave it  stars because they neglected what is so important in a pc game  controlsafter watching a friend play this game and playing a little myself it looked sweet
when i got it however i found it far too challenging even on the easiest setting
question where in the movie do any of the bad guys carry guns and where are the robots that shoot missiles at you
answer nowhere
so why put them in the game
spidey really doesnt have a good enough defense for either of these and both do way too much damage
also they should have had more city levels where you swing from the sky around buildings and less indoor fighting levelsthe graphics in this game are gorgeous
the formula seems to be a winning one  halfstrategy halfroleplaying this takes a typical blizzard game like starcraft or warcraft and turns it on its ear by giving you characters that not only interact through the various chapters cinematics but whom you get to control
just like diablo they have health and mana and can carry a limited number of items
neat
now you have one character who can customize his skills rally the troops and help you feel more directly immersed in the game instead of just hovering over the world mapnow for the problem  the game mechanics
while the pointandclick interface works well the missions ive played dont seem to show any true ai
enemies just hurl themselves at you and the winner is the one with the most firepower  no careful deployment of archers here knights there
worse yet the ai
behind the scenes isnt operating on your level
you have to build your town make soldiers etc
but your opponent doesnt do the same thing  enemies appear out of nowhere
they attack when you do one action but save restart and prepare for the attack and itll never come
why
because the troops dont exist until the program decides to throw them at you
you dont really feel like youre facing an enemy so much as youre playing through a quotchoose your own adventurequot scenario
one wrong choice and its off to reload
and most of your choices involve bashing your way through  on one early mission in the human campaign your sterling hero turns against his allies and its your job to help him lead men through a village slaughtering all the peasants and burning their houses
hurrah
some enemies might show up to relive the monotony but it doesnt help when they dont have much in the smarts departmentthis is as you can probably fathom a port of id softwares  classic wolfenstein d scaled down and put into cartridge format for play on your gameboy advancefirst off i want to say that the studio who ported it did a pretty good job overall
the graphics arent as clean as they were on my ibm  back in the day but i can forgive that kind of thing because the game feels the same
you move at the same rate shooting feels the same the only thing missing as far as gameplay goes is a keyboardthe levels are faithfully reproduced every secret door is where i remember it was which is always kind of fun for those looking back with nostalgia
it contains all  original episodes although youd think that barring some sort of legal entanglement they could have included its sequel spear of destinythere are two central problems with this port which are the main reasons i cant rate it higher
first you cant save your game wherever youd like which you could do in the original
you can only save at the beginning and end of levels
nothing sucks more than to make it almost to the elevator when an ss guy comes out of nowhere and guns your last  of health away
my other problem is the games lack of music
hey what gives
the original had some classic midi tuneage courtesy of bobby prince who also scored the commander keen games doom and duke nukem d
its just not the same
ever tried watching star wars wthout the music
its like theres a key element missinga good port but incomplete without music and frustrating without a saveonthefly featuredo not buy this game
yes yes its so special the original fps
although a good game it was dwarfed by games like doom and nothing compared to console fps
but what do you expect for gameboy anyway right
wrong
matteroffactly this game is outdated and its not even updated
i dont want to be too harsh on the first fps but if you want to play this just have a friend with old games email the shareware pc version to you because its the same and the control is better on pc
bam
entertainment does make good games though so get the other fps they made ecks vs sever it is definitely the best fps for gameboyfifa  was a great leap for a soccer game since fifa  but the world cup  hits a new all time low
i thought that it was going to be the same as fifa  except with the world cup included and maybe better graphics but i almost threw the game in the trash after i played it for the first time
first of all and most important there is significant slow down in the game especially when you pass midfield
the camera stutters and it makes the game very difficult to follow
second you can only play with teams that have qualified to the world cup if your national team didnt make it well tough luck
one of the main reasons people buy this game is to play with their national team and clasify them to the world cup but now you cant even pretend that your national team is any good
third the people at ea added some special effects when you strike the ball it looks and feels like your playing nfl blitz but for soccer not very realistic
i cant even begin to comprehend how they let this game come out the way it is
with problems like slow down make the game simply unplayable
i so mad they did such a poor job with this game i really do hope they fire some people at ea
trust people stick to fifa  its true there is no world cup but at least you wont have a seizures while playing world cup my old controller was constantly having a problem with the wires and the game would tell me it had been disconnected so i decided it was time to purchase a new controller
the new one worked okay for the first month or two despite a problem with the black button trying to stick quite a bit however it started having the same problem and now if i move the controller the slightest bit the games tell me the controller was disconnected and i need to reconnect it
this happens every few seconds and it makes game play extremely difficult
i dont know if its possible to find an good controller anymore for the old xbox or not but it sure would be great if i could find oneto add a note to the problem the wire is all straight and not twisted and i have no idea why it keeps giving me the error
this is just yet another example where microsoft products are nothing but troublethe buttons take a lot of pressure to push the deadzone is very wrong and the buttons are facing the wrong directionit just sucks but unfortunately theres not a lot of options for original xbox controllers todayi bought an s controller at the same time i bought my system a to have a second controller and b to see what type of controller i like betteras long as your hands are big enough for the original controller which most of my friends and my hands are the original controller is actually better than the new s controller
about the only good thing that thet s controller has is rearranged a b x and y buttons but the other repositioning is very very bad
the start and back buttons and the black and white buttons are right underneath your hands when you are gripping the controller very awkward to have to bring your thumb back that far when you are trying to play a gamethis game is a little repetitive and the company that publishes the game interplay wont release the codes
there is an invincibility code in the game it says as one of the tips but thecompany wont release it
the only ones released was max damage all weapons and stupid sound check
and you can only do the all weapons code once every level the only reason i suggest buying this game instead of renting is that it takes a while to beat unless you play for at least  hours a day everyday until its due back
it is worth checking out thoughi was bored of this game within a few minutes
it seemed like it would be a better gauntlet and looked like it was going to deliver
the opening screens are amazing and graphics during the game are great
however gameplay just isnt interesting
you pick your character and then run around and kill hordes of creatures with a variety of weapons
thats it
to make it more annoying the camera doesnt move well with you at all making it difficult to see what you need want to seealthough gauntlet falls far short of hunter in the graphics department it is much better overall game
ill stick with thatits too bad
i was actually pretty excited about this game initially
why not
it has a pretty intriguing story admirable spooky misty graphics and a variety of cool playable characters
so why is this game such a dissapointmentthere is no stategy or gamemanship required whatsoever
to make it through the entire game which i did requires nothing more than constant movement of your character and a quick and strong trigger finger
this is more of an arcadestyle game of the space invaders genre
hordes of bad dudes constantly chase your character and you shoot them until your finger falls off
its fun for the first hour or two and thats iti bought this game
it had a good start with the cutscene at the beginning
it really had an interesting plot a prison is torturing inmates by experimenting on them or something so they come back from the dead and try to kill off the town along with other creatures working with them
the game also had a dark atmosphere and thats a high point
unfortunately most of the levels require you to kill zombies and rescue people
because of this the game gets old
i actually enjoyed the cutscenes more than playing
what could have been a great game is destroyed by pointless objectives and the storyline is ignoredthis game is hours of mindless frustration and boredom
if you dont love slasher films this game is gonna stick
the camera angle is terrible and you have no control over it which makes aiming nearly impossible
the bad guyszombies with gunspop out of nowhere continuously like night caster and i have often gotten so many enemies on the screen that the game bogs down
while the glorious xbox does its best to make the game pretty the animation is terrible and cut scenes look like the ps one
all in all this game isnt worth the price
hang onto your money and wait for the price to come downway downlike used
or buy a good game halojsrfgotham racinggunvalkbloodwake
im taking mine back todaydespite several conspicuous flaws codemasters project igi  im going in is a reasonable st person shooter with an emphasis on stealth
while the storyline is disjointed and at times incredibly clicheacute in a st person shooter the plot often plays second fiddle to gameplay and it is in this area that igi  is strongest though certainly not groundbreaking or incredibly entertainingthe premise is simple
ex sas operative david jones working for the mysterious and fictional institute for geotactical intelligence must sneak his way through a variety of different levels naturally accomplishing objectives ranging from sabotage to infiltrationas a stealth shooter david jones must be navigated through a series of extremely large levels disabling guards and infiltrating deep into facilities
with such large sprawling levels loading times are long and it often takes more than an hour to complete a single mission
the game features the usual assortment of weaponry all of which sound suitably powerful though often most of the level will pass without issuing a single unsilenced shot
while all this may seem terribly suspenseful and interesting several flaws greatly detract from what could have been a great gaming experiencefirstly the lack of a proper savegame feature prevents players from saving until the end of a level which can be frustrating especially when a single alarm usually results in an unrelenting storm of hostile enemies
secondly there is little in the game to justify any other weapon than the silenced pistol
hideously overpowered the pistol is just as powerful as a submachine gun possesses greater range than a rifle and when fired does not kick
since many of the other weapons are not fitted with silencers most of the levels can be completed with the aforementioned handgun rather than its more powerful counterpartsthirdly the enemy is unbelievably accurate
there are few situations more infuriating than coming a few minutes from the end of a mission and being taken down by a few highly precise submachine gun rounds thus forcing you to restart the level again
likewise it is incredibly irritating when after having guided david jones to hide behind a conveniently placed tree the enemy lets loose a few rounds that pass through the trunk to eliminate the unfortunate operative much to my chagrin
the game thus evolves into one in which david jones must crawl from shrub to shrub snapping off a few well placed shots and generally attempting to escape detectionon a more positive note the music is suitably suspenseful and the voice acting is generally very soundin conclusion project igi  is at best a mediocre st person shooter
the lack of a proper savegame function a palette of boring browngrey visuals long loading times and several flaws in gameplay culminate in a frequently exasperating gaming experience
for every sense of satisfaction after a completed mission i experienced episodes of intense frustrationi bought this game about  months ago after having played the demo about   years ago
i remembered that the demos  differnet levels were fun and the graphics were pretty decent
after buying the game and attempting to play it several times on the second level i finally uninstalled it and put it away
the levels can be hard since there is a lot of sneaking around so you dont attract attention
the problem is that when you do attract attention every guard comes running at you and the ai is pretty decent
herein lies the problem
you cant save the game through the difficult parts and continually getting killed is so frustrating and annoying that i finally said heck with it and put it awaythe game play is fun the graphics are fairly decent and the ai isnt terribly retarded
this game reminds me of alien vs predator which you couldnt save between automatic check points until the patch came out which fixed it and made it fun
there is no such patch for igi
dont waste your money unless you like to punish yourself
good game but maddeningigi  the sequel to project igi im going in is not a great sequel to the orginal
the first game was great though it was very hard due to lack of save games for extra large levels
the sequel has limited saves
the levels are nicely desinged but some of them are very hard and become repetive
you play david jones a covert operative
there is not much of a storyline
weapons are great but can carry only two a hand gun and a large gun
the main problem is the ai
enemy soldier will know exactly where you for the mild noise you make
the game seems to cheat a bit
once the alarm goes on everybody knows where you and start shooting at you with perfect aim even if you are are crouching far away
an enemy soldier was snipping at me with an ak from a watch tower when i was  meters away
the ai is really bad
try this when the alarm goes on run into one of rooms or hide in a spot where they cannot snipe you from a far almost every enemy soldier will come running to that spot to kill you face to face you can shoot them all one by one till they stop comming check your map to see if anyone is moving
this way you could kill almost every one without losing any health
the best change from the orginal game besides the save game is there is no enemy respawn
igi is not optimized to run great
i have winse p ghz mb ram and geforce fx
i did not face crashes or hangs but it was quite laggy and the framerates drop too much sometimes
initially the game runs great but once the alarm goes on the framerates drop drasticallyits a bad game with an original concept
use cards and points to battle foes
the cards come to life similar to baten kaitos and phantasy star online i give this game a rating of  stars and that is only because of the graphics and sound quality of the game
i will admit that i thought the graphics were pretty good and the sound was nice too
the gameplay was horrible though
your only way to attack in this game is by using magical playing cards
this was a big drawback for me
it would have been really cool if the cards were used for bonus attacks and specials but not for everything
the one thing that i really didnt like was the fact that you can quite easily run out of cards
if this happens then you have no way to fight
maybe some of you out there think that this is a cool idea and might like the game but i can definitely say that this is not a game for meah resident evil for the gamecube
how exciting
or maybe not so excitingthe remake promised many things and did deliver to some certain extent
however there are some things that make me rather agitated and other things that make me downright maddialogue  while much better than the original it still lacks grammar in some spots and still sounds sketchy at certain cutscenes
why we couldnt perfect this i have no idea
youre a multimillion dollar company capcom  and were in the st century
i think you probably could have hired better actors or at least done more interesting overdubs
im sure you certainly have enough funds to do sogameplay  it has its ups and downs
the puzzles are somewhat more simple but also more difficult at certain points
the character movements are more fluidbut almost too fluid
tapping the bbutton and directional button simultaneously to run finds you stepping ahead more than you wanted to sometimes running past a door or even stepping right into a zombie
you can master the controls but it takes awhile  which is quite frustratingthe color scheme of the game is very dark which makes it hard to see things
plus the added fact that you cant really see if a zombie is around the corner or not save for the rooms with the mirrors which helps so you end up running right into the grasp of a feisty frienddifficulty  if you were hoping that the remake of resident evil was any easier than the original keep dreaming
its actually more difficult and being that the original was the toughest in the series up until this im sure many were hoping that the difficulty on the remake was a bit more easy to handlesome very frustrating things about this game is the limited ammo you get in the hard mode you barely have enough to stay alive and have to use the knife half of the time even if you are experienced with the series and know how to save ammo how fast your health deteriorates and the all of the godawful backtracking you must doyour enemies may also choose to come back to life if you do not eliminate them by burning themchris the stronger of the two in the game can only take three bites before its lights out
that includes the ankle munchers
the ammo supply is very short limited which forces you to use the very weak and almost uselessahem knife throughout the first portion of the game
the characters do have new defense weapons however but you must find them like items and pick them up
unfortunately they too are in short supplyenvironment  okay we all know that the environments have changed for the remake
so has the mansion
while the brilliantly colorful postrendered backgrounds may catch your eye theres several downfalls to the new environment
the rooms that you always remembered never lead to each other
room a does not lead to room b room a leads to room d and a half way down in nomans land
which can be both a curse and a blessing for those who have played the original every spare minute of their life this may be a breath of fresh air
but for average players like me its rather frustrating
the puzzles have been switched around a fair bit and there are more enemiesthe environment of the game is very dark and you cant see as well as youd like
i find myself subconsciously looking for a light switch on the wall every time i enter a new room
with the added danger of zombies and dogs its like fighting your way out of a paper bagi find this game quite frustrating and difficult
i think in the late s the reason resident evil  seemed more popular and likeable than the first resident evil was because they toned down the difficulty without sacrificing the suspense
just like resident evil zero
excellent game totally a
this game on the other hand i would rate a c or a b
graphics are great environments are great but those with weak hearts and irritability should probably steer clear of this gamejaredthe games controls are the worst and this game is really hard
yes the graphics are some of the best thats not y u should buy this game its not worth is buy eternal darknessits an okay game but is very watered down and simplistic
it will quickly bore anyone with much intelligence or above the age of  its a lot like dd heroes in that senseadd to this that the people online are all price gouging right now when you can buy the same game used in real used game stores for  as of the end of january
i saw a store with  copies of them at the  price and they say they have just as many at their four other branches
i bought one for my nephew who is i would have added more stars if the game allowed you to buy weapons and actually be able to keep it and use it more than a  seconds
weapons and magics disapears after a quick    seconds
you gain a new look after every  levels
all attacks are missile attacks no matter if you are an archer or a knight
this game is sort of easy and not as challanging as it may look in the cover
all the more reason not to judge a game by its cover
dont get this game unless you know what you are going to getok i am judging this game on the other turok gamesturok one was a great one player game turok  was also a great one player game with decentnot fantastic multiplayerthis game is nothing like them at all
you spend way too many levels flying a stupid bird in meaningless missions that drag slowly by and all the levels are way too similarinstead of having like  worlds and portals like the other ones you have ten thousand short levels that pretty much all have the same objectivesi got sick of this game after getting to the th stageat the end the boss is dissappointing as well its a guy riding on a sort of trex type thing with guns on it
lame
what happened to all the big huge bosses like in the previous turok games
the boss in this one is small and stupid looking and easy
all the bosses are
definitely rent first dont buy without trying
like i said it is nothing like the other turok games at all
the weapons suck too
i cant figure out why some other reviewer said they were cool they are lame andyou only get to use the three or four weapons that are in each level
if you found the rocket launcher in level three you wont have it in level fouri gave this game stars because graphically it is cool and it is a turok gamedefinitely not worth buying in my opinionbut try it for yourself by renting firsti am not a fan of first person shoot em up games but after reading reviews of this one i thought id give it a try  mistake
it was a very beautiful game as far as graphics and scenery but the play control was crazy difficult
options werent easily accessed and jumping is near impossible
if you arent a fan but think youll give it a try dont waste your time
i took mine in to a trade in video game shop and got arc the lad insteadfor ps or xbox id give this game about  stars  stars on a real  to  scale the main thing is that on xbox and ps you can choose the control button configuration that you prefer to use or are good at using
on gamecube you are stuck at using the one they give you or you can just reverse the way they give you
but the game with that exception is a  stars
i suggest buy it for xbox
or maybe ps
but if you cant get an xbox than if you can live with the controls its worth buying if you dont have any better first person shooter games
if you do have some other shooter games that are as good as halo or even on that level i say rent it and then decide for yourself if you got to have it or if renting it will do it for younothing special but i dont hate it so it gets  starsturok evolution is the nextgen update to the popular first person shooter series from the n
ive played none of the games in the series but if this game is suppose to represent why these games were so popular and as ive heard good then i guess i didnt miss out on a whole lot
turok evolution was a highly hyped title but unfortunately it doesnt live up to its great expectationsfor the record i played the xbox version of this game its also hitting the gamecube and ps
obviously this game as well as acclaim the games makers hopes to dethrone the current fps champion halo but it sadly doesnt come close
the graphics have some nice effects such as the beautiful looking water but the character models are only ok and the some of the jungle foliage particularly the bushes and jungle brush were flat d models that look just embarrassing for an xbox game
the load times in this game are only adequate but what really offended me was that the game takes  to  seconds to load even a simple menu ie
the options menu
on this console i expect to press the button and go to the menu almost instantly
even the simpsons road rage which had the longest load times of any xbox title ive played didnt stutter when you accessed menus
it may sound here like im complaining about something stupid but it really got on my nervesthe games sound is good
the voices are adequate the gun shot effects are realistic and the games jungle style music fits well
the controls are decent for the most part but some things bother me
its easy to move look around shoot jump and switch weapons but it can get to be too hard to hit enemies
at certain times you have to kill groups of ravenous small animals to proceed
you have to look down to see them and its very difficult to shoot them with your guns
even with your spiked club you sometimes swing it at them for what would look like a direct hit but miss
its a real pain
also sniping enemies is just painful
when you activate the scope for your pistol your sight seems to move around on its own
you may be thinking that im just complaining about a head roll effect similar to goldeneye and perfect dark and that i dont like it
on the contrary
i didnt mind the head roll effects in the games i mentioned because they didnt turn the scope all the way to one side like it does in this game
its like the scope is possessed by the devil or something
this glitch makes sniping so difficult that youll never want to use it
all the better i guess because it doesnt help a whole lot anyway
i do appreciate that enemies die when you shoot them in the head in this game though im sick and tired of shooters where the guy is still standing from a head shot
however i dont believe for a second that these guys could possibly die instantly by having their leg or arm amputated by your arsenal
they would be in extreme pain obviously but they would die a slow and painful death from excessive blood loss not just by the dismembermentthat brings up another point
this game is really really violent
heads arms and legs are all lopped off by turoks weaponry and when this happens the enemies bleed excessively
his spiked club even gets blood on it after you pummel an enemy with it
this is probably the most violent game ive ever seen and defiantly deserves its mature rating ages  and up
in other words dont let your kids play this game
if youre a kid whos complaining that youre not allowed to play this game dont worry youre not missing out on muchto spice things up acclaim included a flying segment to break up the pace but its just awful
here you ride on the bad of a flying dinosaur im not sure if its a pterodactyl or not and shoot down enemy bunkers gun turrets planes and anything else that these guys throw at you
youre told in the story that riding one of these things across the lost land is the fastest way to get there
however the control during these sequences are so jerky id rather just walk there on foot for a week or so
also youll die so much during these sequences youll be begging for mercy
well youll do that and belt out a string of profanities so strong that chris rock would blushthe cardinal sin of this game though is that its really boring
you run around levels graphically ending enemies lives and either get to the end or die
it can be fun to kill enemies in such gruesome ways for a little while but it soon gets old
also there are no checkpoints during long levels so if you die at the very end of one you have to start all over again
one thing that i really didnt like about this game is that the levels feel so linear
theyre pretty much just d tracks and let you do almost no exploring whatsoever
you also barely get to interact with the environment
sure you can knock down trees with your club which is pretty cool and kill wildlife but there isnt much more to do than thatthe game also has a mutiplayer mode for up to four players but since i did not test it i cant tell you about it
if youre hoping that this review will tell you whether the mutiplayer mode is worth anything then you should find another review that discusses this modeall in all i was very disappointed by this game
its not a terrible game but i still cant recommend it as anything more than a rental
if you want a good fps for your xbox get halo if you havent already and if you have wait for another anticipated shooter to come out like maybe unreal championship or brute force and pray that it will live up to the hype something that sadly turok evolution couldnt doi owned turok  and  for the old n and thought they were great so i was really looking forward to this game
unfortunately this one isnt even as good as the old n ones
the graphics may be a little better but the game itself isnt nearly as fun
plus the things that they added to improve the series are just plain stupid like the flying missions you have a pterydactyl that shoots missles and machine guns
i am going to trade this one in toward timesplitters i think that turok could have been much better if they put more time into the gameplay
i loved the multiplayer that was the best part of the game
so i guess ill give it a  only for the multiplayer if the multiplayer was bad i wouldve liked to give it less than a you would think that with the bit era of xbox ps and gamecube that we should be reaching the peak of gameplay but as of recently what were getting instead are games that granted amazing looking but someone forgot something the game
to be honest i shouldnt have necessarily been thinking turok would be a great game
the first two turoks for the nintendo  were well done but far from perfect and turok  basically wasnt good
so the track record was far from perfect but still there was no crime in wishingi suppose
but ultimately turok is a bad way to start off the fall its one of those big name big budget games that looks promising but ends up falling way too shortfor fans of the original series youll find your typical turok gameplay has remained unchanged from the tek arrows to scaling vines and the terribly out of place platform jumping areas
now this style worked for the nintendo  but acclaim should try evolving soon to join the rest of us in the new millennium
the biggest problem here is that the shooting just isnt fun period
blasting lizard men baboons and dinosaurs gets about as fun as stacking blocks in tetris its all the same
the weapons have been seriously downsized from the other turoks theres maybe about  weapons to choose from and all of the classic military weapons have been ditched theres one machine gun and the shotgun and pistol completely arent good so you wont even use them
there are still the bows and arrows axe and your space age weaponry that amazingly rips the spacetime continuum in half or something but cant kill the powerful enemies if youre into that kind of stuff
i prefer guns and lots of themin fact the only new element to the turok series is the flight levels where you hunter rides a giant winged dinosaur and blasts everything in sight
i would maybe applaud it if it had been before panzer dragoon star wars rogue squadron and sky gunner
i bought a fps damn it i dont want to fly i want to shoot and the problem here is  of the game is flying
again this is the only new feature in turok this is the exact same game youve been playing since the more and more i played turok hoping hood things would result the more i was disappointed
acclaim promised genius enemy and partner ai
and instead we have the biggest group of idiots in the world
even on the back of the box they claim enemies take cover and establish strategic positions
well a perfect example of this was when i shot at an enemy he ran in circles numerous times then dropped his gun and ran away i guess he figured if there wasnt a hiding place within  feet hes doomed
another enemy who heard my gun shot started climbing up a ledge making him the easiest target in the world
im not military mastermind but isnt it a little dumb to climb something when someones shooting a place that offers no cover and manoeuvrabilityand when you finally do get allied soldiers they try to be like halos marines but instead their most brilliant move is to run straight at an enemy and wait until theyre in two feet to begin firing
in fact this is the worst ai
ive seen in a long time these enemies need to go back to kindergarten to learn basic movement like run when someones shooting and maybe also learn not to drop their weapons and flee like so many enemies do hereturok is the first flop of the season and is going to fall off your top games to try list like the leaves of fall
its something that couldve been great could have utilized technology
also funny is the aging gameplay system despite the games title evolution perhaps they should check the dictionary
it would be in best interest of first person shooters everywhere if turok would go extinctplease do not listen to the five star reviews of this game
it has all the graphics youd expect from a aaa nintendo title and absolutely none of the fun
the levels sereously seem like chores
artisticly this game is amazing but the game design is very very boring
if you are looking for a fun new nintendo style game i highly recommend you check out truly fun games like pikmin legend of zelda the wind waker or mario sunshine
id even choose luigis mansion over this game
it seems like rare has forgotten how to make fun games
do yourself a favor and rent this game before you buy iti had really high hopes for this game
however after getting about  of the way through starfox adventures i simply had to admit to myself that the game was boring
ive been entranced by zelda and i couldnt put my controller down when playing eternal darkness but starfox just doesnt do it
as has been said by many the graphics are spectacular though the use of character voices gets absolutely nauseating very quickly
unfortunately this game proves the old adage that gameplay trumps graphical might every timeyounger children might enjoy this but i honestly see no reason for an adult to pick it up
try eternal darkness insteadthe game is vary borring after  minits you will want to stopok this game has been out for a while but i just recently bought the gamecube and loved starfox so this was the first game i bought
do not buy this game if you are expecting a true sequelthe biggest disappointment is the lack of aerial fighting
it is very few and far between and when you do start an aerial sequence it is too easy and very short lived
the planetary level is filled with puzzles and gimmics to advance to the next area
many times you must visit previous levels to advance
some of the puzzles are extremely aggrivating even after the attempt at giving advice by your copilot
many times i was stuck for  minutes just trying to figure out what i had to do next
eventually i had to do an internet search for a walkthru which is annoying in itselfthe fights with bad guys are overly simple and like the aerial fighting very few and far betweenit took me about  hours playing time to complete this game  of that time was filled with frustration
the maps are tiny and after a while you get tired of completing new puzzles in old territory
the maps are so small in fact that this  hour treck could have been completed in about  minutes without them bad guys includedif you like games with a bunch of annoying puzzles starfox adventures is for you
if not let this one slide even for the great price of star fox adventures will attract many gamers
the graphics are phenomenal some of the best ive ever seen just shy of resident evil
the fur on fox looks incredible
the backgrounds are great
but graphics dont mean squat if the game is an absolute bore to play and no other game illustrates this point more fittingly than this onemost of the game consists of you going from point a to point b to fetch an item then back to point a to open up another path
whats your reward
you get to play more fetch games and fight uninspiring battles all you have to do is repeatedly jam the a button to win these with ease
there are some cool parts where you get to fly your arwing but these typically last less than a minute and serve no purpose in the grand scheme of things fly through a certain number of rings and the level is over
the gameplay is a chorewith a game like this its no wonder nintendo let go of rare
if youre into great visuals and nothing else then this is the game for you
for those of you who would rather play something enjoyable with some lasting replay value stay far far away from this utter disappointment of a gamefew games can bore me past my patience level
i threw this game in started playing and i thought pretty cool shooting down flying ships from my flying dinosaur wierd but cool
then i went on and found the gameplay extremely repetitive
pick up barrel throw it at bad guys repeat until puzzle then solve puzzle while throwing barrel at bad guys
if you look at my other reviews im not much of a game cube fan been sony for years but i thought i would give this game a chance since all my friends wont stop talking about it
this game is great for about an hour then you get sleepy cuz its boring
the only game worth mentioning on the cube is metroid prime so pick that up and have a blastif you are thinking of buying this product because of the fact that it contains star fox then dont get this gamestar fox games have always been about flying and fantastic flying games they have beenthe original star fox for the snes was the master of graphics in its day and had three shortish paths that could be taken to the final level
you had to play that game all at one time however so it wasn t bad at allstar fox  was also on the top side of graphics in its day but that wasnt what made it sell
it was fun it was a great flying game and there is not really a game out there that can stand up to a star fox flying game though star fox games may be differentstar fox adventures the first star fox for the gamecube is basically a complete wreck of the series
the whole game is on the ground
though this has never been seen in a star fox game thats all there was in this game
no flying no anything that made previous star fox games star fox gamesthe puzzles were slightly boring and for all star fox veterans there was no skill that they could bring backif you want a star fox game for gamecube get star fox assault
the ground levels are better and there is a great deal of flying including that the whole last level which consists of  stages is all flying
staf fox assault great game
star fox adventures not star foxvery simple
this game tries to be zelda but it isnt
no this game is not a shooter like the two previous starfox games
this is a rd person adventure game with some platforming thrown in
true there are some classic starfox shooting sequences but they are very short and resemble a minigame more than anything elseas a game all by itself it just isnt good
like i said it tries to be zelda but it isnt
there are no interesting dungeons or worlds
most quests involve fetching something bring it back fetch something else find someone find something else  headache ensues
not funthen theres combat which is a matter of mashing the big green a button until the bad guy is dead
thats all there is to it
there is an alternate attack if you hold back on the analog stick and starfox twirls his stick around but it actually does less damage so its ultimately pointlessthe only redeeming aspect of this game are the graphics
they are stunning in general and are nd best ive seen for the platforming genre first goes to conker live and reloaded for the xbox but kameo for the xbox  probably looks better
but obviously graphics mean little when the gameplay sucks
they mean even less when you realize that graphics become outdated in a year or two as i already stated conker looks better nowi will admit however that some may like the game
suprisingly a lot of reviews rate this game in the x range
so rent it if you are really interested in it and decide for yourselffirst off why does this game look so much worse than mohaa rtcw and jedi outcast
anyways the missions are boring and repetive
it has an outragous storyline
the missions dont have any real purpose until you beat the game and acually think about what youve done
the weapons are pretty close to real life
but the best feature of this game and sof  is the gore
this game would be very boring without it
the muliplay is good but it adds nothing new or revolutionary to the multiplayer enviroment
overall is a very average gamein their quest to crank up the realism activism forgot to make this game even half as fun as the first sof
you die constantly by unseen forces a grenade from above poof youre gone which im sure is pretty realistic for one man taking on armies but the net result is you spend a lot of time looking at the loading screen and if anyone tells you they dont spend a lot of time with that screen theyre lying
i dont mind dying if i blow it or the ai beats me thats the mark of a welldesigned game with appropriate difficulty
but constant random death isnt difficult its boring
also the aiming is terribletotally lacking the violent satisfaction of the first sof
you can shoot at the same guy forever and not know whether you got him untill he blows your head off even on the novice setting
pumping whole clips into a baddy only to have him pop up and ice you with the same model of weapon you just emptied at him is nothing but frustrating
most of sof feels like the tedious part of allied assault where youre being sniped by unseen enemies
some people got off on the realism of that level but most people who have a life and play video games for fun what a concept hated slogging through that dieathon
for those of us whose grin muscles still ache from playing jedi knight  its one helluva comedownsoldier of fortune ii  double helix is a fps set in the real world
you play john mullins a blackops soldier taking on an evil organisation which tries to spread a deadly virus
the game takes place in different parts of the world from dense colombian forest snowlands a ship an aeroplane ect
the multiplayer gameplay is great and fun online but the single player gameplay is dull with poor level design and dumb enemy ai
the game is very hard because the enemies are very strong and the hero takes a lot of damage in a single shot
the game seem to cheat a bit i dont know how the alarm goes on in the stealth missions and some enemies seems to be in god mode like the snippers in the first mansion level
the hero also keep of playing with his weapon like he throws his shotgun in the air and catches it which makes me very angry
the random mission generator is boring and unplayable because it does allow save games
sof is built on the quake engine i played it on the opengl video mode and it runs great
the graphics and sound are great the swimming pool in the mansion level is very beautifull but most of the game is brown in color
the load times are very long and unlike other qa games like rtcw and mohaa the quick loading is not instant
sof was a great game and i have even played the game till late night this one does not even come close it is very boring and dull
soldier of fortune iis single player is disappointing but the multiplayer is goodi found some elements of this game good and some bad
i was impressed by the weapons selection the knife was awesome and the graphics but the overall game play was kinda rottenprosgreat graphicsawesome weaponsgood storylinecool death animationsconshorrible melee combatsluggish gameplayhard controlsoverall i would not recommend this game as there are many better games out therei agree with virtually everything vadave wrote in his review but nonetheless i came away with an overall sense of having enjoyed myself
for a while
i liked the singleplayer mode enough to finish it
it reminds me a lot of deus ex in part because of the voiceover actors
i wish they would have included deus exs weapon carrying limit
on one hand they try to emulate realisim with supergraphic violence but then they let players carry fourteen rifles
sillyits very linearso much so that i couldnt finish certain missions without having to go back into the house to exit through a specific window in colombia
the ai is not great neither for your enemies nor your teammates and i wish i could move more thingsnothing but trolleys blocking your way in the hospital which seem nailed to the floor
the game looks good as youd expect from the q engineunfortunately i ultimately got stuck in a level called kamchatka and could not leave
i killed everybody took out the safety grid but was not able to complete the last task
i spent twenty minutes at three different times running around the mapno way out
stupid
i cant help but wonder what i missed and believe me it couldnt have been obvious
like
i play a lot of these games virtually every fps that coems to market everything from serious sam to jedi outcast to no one lives forever
i cant stand poor level design
sighthe violence is gratuitous no question about it but you knew that before you read this review
multiplayer feels quakelike
i still prefer the very tired counterstrike and im surprised they didnt emulate it
limit players to one main and one backup weapon which can be bought at the outset of the round or picked up in the gamei really enjoy first person shooters but would enjoy something new as well
lets face itwere all waiting for duke nukem to return and show us how its doneif youve played the st icewind dale you may be disappointed by this one
while it has a superior character system and ui using e rules instead of e giving you far more customization and choice when leveling up feats talen points etc the rest of the game is a borefirst of all it lacks the atmosphere of the first games and of all the dd games from nwn to pst to bg
the sound effects for some reason just arent very good and the music sucks
soules music was much better than zurssecond the combat isnt as wellbalanced or exciting
in iwd there were many epic and welldone fights such as yxunomeithird the plot is one of the worst plots in a video game
there is nothing to it seriously
no twists no turns no depth no climax
the voice acting and dialogue are cheesy and awfulfinally the dungeons and environments are extremely boring and uninspired
in the first game you had gorgeous dungeons such as dorns deep and the vale of shadows to explore
this game reuses too many of the old dungeons and somehow makes them worse than their former selvesi just wish theyd remake icewind dale  and baldurs gate  and  with e rules
sadly theyve already remade the latter into enhanced editions which suck and are still in e ruleslots of people like to sing the praise of iwd and compare it to the bg series by the same company
in this gamers opinion they are right except that comparison consists mainly of what was worst about bg
gone is the epic story
gone is the interesting interactions with npcs in your party because the whole party is you many enjoy this i think it just promits the worst of hackandslash while destroying the fun interaction and saving the programers lots of timewhat the game most has in comon with bg is the old unfortunate notion of the go fetch adventure that was bgs major shortcoming to a large extent replaced in bg ii
what do i mean by fetch adeventure
npc i need some wood can you get it npc i cant  live without those bones can you go find them npc some toilet paper would really come in handy right now
i am all out
be a dear and run to the store etc
you get the idea
the result is a game that is slow two dimensinal and a lot of time just walking between areas another problem that you cannot always walk right from one area to another and are left pacing through empty screens while your mind goes numb
clearly some people really love this game
i dont get it and i am sorry that i did buy it that ison the surface this game is basically similar to baldurs gate bg ii icewind dale and planescape torment a dungeons  dragons game  focusing on a sixmember party of adventurers
unlike its predecessors it incorporates the rd edition dd rules which simplify gameplay and add some options for customizing your characters abilities as they go up in level
the rd edition rules work well here and are an improvement over the previous gamesunfortunately very much is wrong
the first icewind dale was a simple combatoriented gameyou just hacked your way from one obvious location to another
this sequel has that element also but has two glaring flaws
first the game is cheesy
by this i mean that monsters teleport to attack you from behind and the game prevents you from saving at numerous critical pointsthere are several multipart battles where you cant save and a misstep means you start the battle over from scratchthe second flaw is the focus on puzzle dungeons
by this i mean areas where you cant kill a monster unless you pull a series of levers in the right order and maps where going east puts you northwest of your previous location and you can flail about endlessly unless one of your characters has an otherwise useless ability wilderness lore
chapter  of the game out of  chapters is one big puzzleand grotesquely annoyingdungeon where you have to perform each step in a specific sequencea sequence that is never revealed to you by the game
even then the problem is not that the puzzles are hardthey arentits that they are so numerous and so ridiculous
what kind of a  villain would build all these puzzles in the first place
there are parts of this game that play more like tomb raider than dd and while i like tomb raider in its own genre puzzle dungeons are more annoying than anything in a dd gamea lesser flaw is the weakness of the storythe two enemies are simple bogeymen
there is a part of the story which is i guess supposed to make you feel sorry for them but the shades of morality here are far from grey
the enemies simply have no personality just lots and lots of spell effects they can summon instantly bringing us back to the cheese problemi consider myself a fairly hardcore player of dd games on the pc
i cant recommend this game to even players like me for anyone just starting out in this type of game stay far far away
pick up baldurs gate or baldurs gate ii if you want a pleasant introduction to dd on the computerepic megagames have really jumped the boat since their heydays but they were very lucky with unreal and unreal tournament
both were fantastic and simple games to play which hearld back to the days of doom
now with unreal tournament  you get improved graphics and lots of added features from the original game
strange thing is though when i started playing the game i thought i was playing the original
the graphics may look prettier but i didnt notice them neither did i care about the new skins either this is a shoot it if it moves type of game you dont have time to look at the pretty pictures youve got to keep moving and thats why this game fails because basically the gameplay is the same as the first game
a huge but expected disappointment from this once great game developerunreal tournament  is coming soon and it looks like its jumping on the gta bandwagon by adding vechiles for you to control
id say wait for that one but if you cant wait buy the original unreal tournament its cheaper and it wont need a powerful computer ut is a jokei have played the original ut for over three years now and you know what
i still play it more than this new ut   sure the graphics are fabulous its fast the sounds are great and the control is smooth
whats wrong then
well for starters the weapons stink
gone is the sniper rifle replaced by the unusable lightning gun the minigun is all but useless and the rocketflak weapons are shadows of their former selves
my biggest problem with this game are the levels  the first ut had a great variety of immersive moody levels and no two felt alike
all the levels in ut  feel like the same quottechnogrungequot industrial warehouse done with different textures
even the outdoor levels disappoint
moreover the game modes stink gone is fan favorite assault replaced by the ridiculously stupid and frustrating bombing run
gone are other game modes last man standing etc
as a result the game feels like an updated version of quake iii with its identical levels and lighting fast gameplayfinished the tournament twice on different settingswhy less
because there is less excitement less fluid gameplay and less weaponry than in the first installment
where sequels usually follow the formula of lets add things and make money this game takes away things and may or may not make money
two aspects that really lost were the weapons and the level design
the rocket launcher is now limited and no longer has grenades the sniper rifle has been replaced with a weaker weapon and most importantly the starting weapon is now an assault rifle that is weaker than the handgun in part one and they took away twohanded shooting with two handguns
the weapons balance was one of the great aspects of part one
no other game evere matched that balance
even the handgun was effective
with well place headshots you could take out enemies wit better weapons
why the designers would ruin the wepaons balance is a mysteryas far as levels and the game go it seems they were to scared to change anything there and didnt
so there is nothing new but the levels now are less interesting and not that creative
the jumppads are different than the first installment but not to good
they did add a tv atmosphere with an overenthusiaistic announcer but even that come across as annoying and not serious enoughand what are the ancient egyptians doing in the game
new characters in the gamejust like the first time you get the letter in the mail saying you are the winner of the publishers  sweepstakes
 the games graphics amaze you
then the game leaves you hanging with its lack of excitement
the game does not grab youon the bright side the game is graphically and technically superior to anything out there
the graphics are incredible
and on adept and higher setting th game becomes more furious
however the gap between skilled and adpet is pretty largemaybe the producer and design team did not try to hard on this one beacuse they were relying on the laurels of part onefinally a personal hurt  i picked frostbite for the cool rugged gladiator look and then when i took some rounds the character let out a most unmaly owwwwie
 what were they thinking and who put that in thereprobably a good game in its day but way outdated
it does not tell you this when you read the item information
not worth the money in the current day of high tech gamingthis games cool
my friends cousin is in the game
pete william the graphics are pretty good
the modes are better then the first one
but my compaint is the same as the first one
matches end way to quickly
i want more of a stragetic sim game engine involved
why dont ground battles last  minutes or longer
it still feels like a button masher game
the moves are hard to pull off
the create a character mode is way too shallow
the games cool for a while but lacks replay value unless your fighting another live personthe only good thing about this game is the characters who are teams of babes in bikini
sounds good huh
not
this game is about volleyball problably the worst sport in the world
the graphics look great but it doesnt bring much attention to me
if you want a horrible but babe game buy ittoday is the th day ive had this game on rental from blockbuster and no doubt about it its way too frustrating to be fun
the graphics is good the storyline stupid but tolerable and lurking somewhere you can sense a fun factor but the difficulty and insanely unpredictable controls make this game sadistically unpleasant to play
a total letdownanother thing that pisses me off is this is a time exclusive title for the xbox
while its nice to have an xboxonly game even if just for a few months this game is so poorly programmed that im thinking we xbox fans are being used as guinea pigs
if the ps version plays better than this one ill never buy another namco game againthis game has many things going for it but i am not going to itemize those things
the reason i rated this game  stars and subsequently cancelled my preorder  was solely because of the right thumbstick
it infuriates me to no end that i must press the right thumbstick right to look left and vice versa
it boggles my mind that there is no menu option to reverse the polarity
prisoner of war  has the same exact flaw
let me be as clear as i can in the hopes that video game programmers are reading
all players want the most quotintuitive and flexiblequot controls possible  so that they can become effecient at killing bad guys
pressing right to look left will never ever ever be intuitive for me
please agree with this comment so that we send a big message to the video game makers
halos controls are perfect  dont reinvent the wheelif youre looking for immersive gameplay good story and graphicsthen dont buy this game
at first i thought this would be a max payne knockoff which would be fine because that was a great game
unfortunately this game cant even be put into the same categoryfirst off the graphics are just ok  theres nothing wrong with them but im playing on an x box here
the graphics should be great
i would even have to say the the graphics on max payne for the ps are better
the introduction was interesting and visually very good
its too bad that this doesnt carry on into the rest of the gamethe storyline is moderately cheesy
if im playing a mature rated game which this is then id prefer to have a story made for adults
often i would find myself thrown into a situation where i just had to kill everyone in sight
once that was done more bad guys appear and then a few more after that
all the while im not even sure why im there in the first placeive seen a lot of people complaining about the controls on this game
i agree with everything said
it didnt take very long to learn all the controls at all
rather the controls make this game much more difficult than it has to be and sometimes just make no senseon the outside this game appears as though it would be very good
and i suppose that it had the potential to be very good
its too bad that so many things were overlooked and made this into a fairly bad gamea lot of people are talking about dtr as though it was a max payne clone
aside from the issue of bullettime or the slowmotion divingwhileshooting dtr and max share virtually nothing in common
ok so both are stories about excops out for revenge but thats where the similarities enddead to rights has a lot more builtin diversity in gameplay than max payne does
the character can fight unarmed have his sidekick dog attack enemies disarm enemies and steal their guns and hide against walls and kill people stealthily
thats not to mention the plethora of minigames which take most of their gameplay from the venerable track and field series of buttonmashing to some specified parametersdtr doesnt have half the atmosphere that max payne does and thats largely due to the art direction and cinematography rather than anything else
a lot of the cutscenes are done inengine and while dtrs not ugly its not pretty either
visually its about halfway between halo and a dreamcast gamethe most important thing to consider however when trying to decide whether to purchase dtr is that its staggeringly difficult
the biggest problem with dtr is that the difficulty comes not from a legitimate skillbased challenge but from a lousy camera and poor autotargettingat times you will dive at a person with a shotgun who is standing not far in front of you
you might be armed with a shotgun as well so range would be an important consideration since youll do more damage to something closer to you
but rather than targetting the guy in front of you where one hit would kill him you end up targetting someone offcamera to your left whos behind a truck
of course after flying through the air like an idiot you land at this guys feet where he kills you with one closerange shotgun blastthe problem with dtr is that its so full of potential and so full of neat ideas and theyre mired in this halfbaked mess where you cant do any of the things that you want to doits a neat game on paper  full of potential full of excellent ideas
but as it stands its frustrating not because of a legitimate challenge but because every couple of minutes youll be killed by something you couldnt possibly avoiddead to rights seemed like an exciting title in the weeks ensuing its initial release  but after thankfully renting this title i found it to be a pleasant experience on the eyes but nothing else
the graphics are sharp and detailed but the gameplay and camera angles leave a lot to be desired
not only that the amount of ammunition it takes to put down a runofthemill peon is near improbabletwo to three shots up close with a shotgun
i dont think sothe camera angles are atrocious
when you have to fight several enemies you have to maneuver your character all around the room basically running around to find other guys to battle
and when you fight them you sometimes cannot even see them until they are in the midst of throwing a blowthats not coolusage of slow motion ala max payne a superior title to this one is helpful and pretty darn cool  you can throw explosive canisters and shoot them causing an explosion around your enemies plus you can avoid other bullets that way as well
max payne seems to be much better at this thoughto sum it up dont buy this title  ever
if you are looking for a vigilante cop style game stick with max payne
it does everything dead to rights does and more just with better success
dtr was obviously rushed out of development or it would not have been so terrible
rent it first  you might like it
im leaning toward a majority of dislikes though
happy gamingreviewed by robert marneyyes the game looks great in every sense
yes its got new features like walls useful sidesteps and just frame moves moves that require precise timing instead of complicated commands but then again these were all in vf more than five years ago
there are new characters and some completely revamped old ones which is good to see and theres the usual plethora of fun extra modes like tekken forceunfortunately a fighting game is all about combat and this is where tekken  falls short
the cpu is even stupider than it was in previous tekken games the game can be beaten using only heihachis b backfist and  jabs
against humans the lack of character balance is very apparent jin and steve dominate all others to the point of absurdity and some characters on the low end like king and kuma have no chance against any of the top  even with kumas  damage twohit comboif youre not interested in playing tekken  seriously and just want to have some fun this game is great
if you want to put some serious time and effort into a fighting game though there are much better options on the psthere is nothing special about tekken   sure the graphics are nice and theres some new stuff but seriously nothing about this game is impressive
the character selection includes  new guys who are not all that wonderful a couple of guys from tekken  and the rest are all fresh from tekken   everyone got a few new moves most of which are pretty cool and new outfits but i would say that is not enough to warrant a purchase
story mode livens things up with drawn story scenes and cg scenes for each character
tekken force mode is simply annoying nothing more
beat the ht out of a bunch of mindless fools who come running at you beat up some more guys and so on and so on
the new sidestepping wall obstacles positions changins stuff is also rather irritating the computer knows how to do this far too well  and when it uses it the match is all but lost
ive always enjoyed tekken but a better fightingcontrolscemethingie and more and better new stuff wouldve made this worthwhile
this is a rental at besti give this three stars because it is a good game but just a little better then tekken tag
the characters polygons is almost the same as it predecessor only the environment has a considerable upgrade
it feels a lot smoother then t and ttt
ttt gave us all the characters and now we have to go back down to  or 
there is no tekken bowl or volleyball which girls would actually like to play
good thing i only pay  for this
hopeful namco does something more excitement in the next one or this franchise may become a street fighteri rented this game a couple days after it came out
i love tekken tag tourn
my fav character is eddy and i can play that for hours
but this tekken  is a big dissapointment
the game is made to work faster the ttttekken tag tourn
 the graphics are worse than ttt the scenery is a hell of alot better but the charecter visuals are so much worse that ttt
the gameplay doesnt seem to be the same
i played it for aboout  min and feel like i wanna take it back already
listen to me do not buy this rent it first and if u like it then do waht ever
the new gameplays included in tekken  are tekken story and tekken force
i have no idea why they made tekken story mode cause its exactly the same as the reg game with one small difference they show d pictures and have a lame reason for why they join the tournement
tekken force is pethitic it is alot better in tekken  in this one in tekken  it is viewed from behind the guys u have at his back
it is so hard to control the guys as well it is the lamest excuse for excitment on the marketthis is my first tekken game
i think that this part  has fantastic graphics but i am unable to truly enjoy the game because the powerbars are so weaki am able to kill an opponent with about  solid kicks
this makes each round seem waaaaaay too short
there is no way to increase the powerbar in the options menu so that your opponent can take more damagei also have virtual fighter evolution
in vfe you are able to increase the powerbars from  to 
this allows each round to be longer and more importantly  more challenging 
the second fault is that not everything in the environment is breakable
there are a lot of glass windows in the environment but they are not designed to be breakable
only about  of the environmental objects are breakable
i wished that everything was breakablei considered ordering this game because of some of the initial quotfunquot reviews that came out
im glad i rented it first
although the concept of the game is good the actual gameplay isnt all that great
it gets boring pretty quickly
i found myself really desiring some quotrealquot weapons during multiplayer mode
i then started to think that maybe i should start employing strategy only to find out there isnt much to employsummarygraphics are ok gameplay is ok fun level is shortlivedrent it once or twice for a change of pace but spend your real money on something elsethis is a horrible game
it has rather amusing characters but thats about it
controlling the game is terrible especially the putting which is almost impossible
being able to fight with your caddy is amusing as well but this game is not worth owningit is really hard to describe a game like outlaw golf
at times it can be funny and great yet then again in other situations it can be dumb and boring
in my opinion outlaw golf isnt a good solid game
my advice is that you shouldnt waste price of your money to get a game like thispros funny jokes characters features some of the jokes in this game are great
beating up your caddie when your upset when your composure is low is a terrfic feature which def
added to the positive side of this game easy controls the first time you play it i can almost bet that you will have the controls down in a matter of minutes multiplayer the multiplayer for this game is good
what i truly like about it is that you dont have to have  controllers to play against  people
all you need is one controller which allows  all the players to use
also another good aspect about multiplayer is that it offers different types of golf modes to playcons funny jokes characters features although i said these catergories were good in the game there also bad
alot of the jokes get old very fast after you have played it a couple of times
this i think will leave gamers bored and even to the point where the dont want to play it anymore only three courses this has to be the most biggest thing wrong about the game there are only three courses to play
i mean come on three courses for a price game thats really pretty bad
after continuously playing each course over and over again it gets so stupid boring and pointlessalthough in the end it may look like the pros in this game outdo the cons that is def
not true
my advice is to save your money and wait for some better games to come out on xbox
believe me youll be glad you didsure this game is kinda fun if youre into the movie but really not all that great
the only thing i found entertaining about it is how hilariously stupid the ai
isi even have a story to tellupon the point where you have to crawl into the ventilation shafts outside into the underground levels i realized i couldnt bring my ai helpers with me since they do not know how to crouchso rather than leaving them out in the cold to freeze to death i decided to take them out of their misery
so after a good half an hour of trying to command them to walk into a corner eventually having to physically push them slowly into that cornerupon doing so i backed up a good distance and equipped the grenade launcher switched the first person view and right as i raised the cross hair to their general location one of my team members said the most random yet most hilariously appropriate thing ever
i have a bad feeling about thisthe thing is marketed as an enhanced first person shooter by black label games and promises an awesome blend of action evasion trust and fear
i picked it up because i am a huge fan of john carpenter  rowdy roddy piper in they live consistently makes my scifi top ten
unfortunately this game fails to deliver on this promise and even worse it fails to deliver on even the fundamentals of first person shooter games
netnet i find it difficult to believe that any serious gamer could recommend this title
heres why you should spend your money elsewhere hyper linear childishly simple mouse in a maze game progression no jump function this is made even more ridiculous by the programmers use of a fence that comes up to the main characters knees to draw game boundaries no lookup or lookdown capabilities very limited weapon selection  the weapons that they do offer have truly uninspired affects unforgiveably inefficient user interfacethe reason i gave it  starts instead of one is because the programmers have made a moderately successful attempt at enabling the gamer to manage a squad
but since everything else about the game is so tremendously bad the novelty of this wears off in five or ten minutessorry mr carpenter looks like youll need to file this one alongside of escape from lalock on modern air combat lomac is easily the worst combat sim made in the past  years with awful controls bad graphics and a rushed release it is the absolute epitome of lazy game design on a budget
youre much better off buy wings over europe or any other thirdwire sim as they have a better modding community and a very good mission designercampaign systemsuper mario sunshine is now considered the weak point of all the big name mario titles and for good reason its really lousy in several key areas
almost all of them in fact
for those of you that grew up with the d mario games this game will feel lifeless and dramatically different in comparison
for those of you who approached mario with the galaxy series youll have the same reaction
the lowest point of the mario series is super mario sunshine unquestionablylets name all the problemsthe entire theme of the game with the exception of a few platformdominated missions underground along with a ghost house maze area is based around the beach
the one environment that feels totally out of place for a mario game the beach and nintendo actually thought it would be a good idea to roll with it
really disappointing
im totally used to the mushroom kingdom by this point and expected as such
im pretty sure most mario fans feel the same way
incredibly disappointing that nintendo abandoned the mushroom kingdom for something so generic
nintendo should have executed a beach theme only occasionally like how its properly done in yoshis island and super mario galaxy and then added more diverse locations for the other  of the game because the way it stands now the beach is seriously overkill
not to mention all the yucky beach music that makes me sick after a while
variety is a key component of the mario seriesits pretty sad that the underground platform jumping missions are the high point of the game because jumping on platforms is normally a chore in d mario having to line up and carefully execute welltimed jumps
its awful
platform jumping was awful in super mario  but at least the environments in that game are a tad nicermore diverse than the overdone beach theme here
eventually you arrive to platforms that either disappear or square shaped cubelike rotating platforms that are unique the first time you deal with these but ultimately adds more to the frustration factor instead of actually being fun or adding anything to the replayability
the only time these platform missions become somewhat entertaining is when you have to collect  red coins with a timer requiring the player to move swiftly
these are challenging and funmario has a spray nozzle and a rocket nozzle
the spray nozzle is a horrible idea because the object is to fill up with water at every available opportunity and spray most of the bosses until they die which is clearly not what makes many of the other games in the mario series so incredibly fun to play
absolutely no way
basically you spray bosses until they die while dodging attacks
sometimes this is hard when the surrounding danger gets intense but most of the time its painfully easy
the rocket nozzle is slightly improved however because this allows you to launch into the sky really high and reach the platforms that would otherwise be impossible to reachmy least favorite part of the game is a way tie the lifeless empty and boring levels with hardly any enemies or exciting powerups anywhere
trees beaches water tightropes platforms rinse and repeat
for  hours
god the collect  coins to get a shine missions the shines are the same thing as the stars found in sm and the galaxy series by the way
several of these missions namely that one god awful watermelonpushing stage takes forever to obtain  stars
if thoroughly exploring lifeless environments is supposed to qualify as fun and the reason many mario fans make such a big deal about open world exploration count me out
collecting these stars means nintendo is forcing me to explore these generic and boring environments
nooo way having to go back to the same exact stages over and over again to search forobtain more shines
wheres the darn level variety
maintaining a beach theme is bad enough but at least make each stage different for crying out loud
come on nintendo super mario sunshine isnt progress its a kick in the rearend collecting over  boring blue coins many of which can be found by spraying water on these xs located on walls that you will often stumble upon
the reward for collecting so many of these bland blue coins isnt exciting for the player in the end so expect the highest level of disappointment imaginable
collecting blue coins ends up being a needless chore not only because the reward is underwhelming but because the concept itself is unexceptional
no real desire or motivation to obtain them the overworld i guess you can say where you spend a good chunk of your time throughout the adventure is nothing but generic buildings disguised as more generic platform jumping with ugly characters everywhere
how horrendousoh and the storyline
mario goes to jail
give me a break
never ever attempt to implement storyline bits in a mario platformer
the princess is kidnappedkill bowser storyline is pretty weak admittedly but honestly thats all we need
dont even think about making a story anymore elaborate than that or it will fail which is why super mario sunshines story fails so miserablyi highly recommend skipping this gamethose who have played games for a few years now may have realized one thing  games are getting easier
and its not simply due to maturity and being better at finding patterns in games games are truly getting easier
i dont think that is a good thing to do to games
infact the more frusterated i get over a game the better i feel the game is
of course there is a limit  too difficult and noone will complete it but too easy and games get finished in under a weekthis game is fun dont get me wrong
but those who have played older versons of mario will realize this is far too easy and short and does not make a good addition to the super mario legacy
if you havent played this  play it
but if you want difficulty or you want to feel more accomplished when you finish a level  go back to perhaps super mariomario has since the days of the n taken a nosedive in regards to general game quality and super mario sunshine is perhaps the best example of this
though the graphics and sound are far superior to the ones seen in the old days despite the strange shading the game itself has sufferedfirst off the game is marginally insulting if taken allegorically
the people of isle delphino seem like nothing more than a spoof on americans
loud annoying overweight coming in a variety of quotstrangequot colors and completely unable to solve their own problems
just the kind of things a japanese man would mock about america especially since isle delphino bears a more than passing resemblance to hawaiibut more importantly the games summary reads like your laundry list of afternoon chores
marios gameplay used to revolve around quotget the fireball power kill the bad guy invade the castle save the princess etcquot  now its quotwater the plant save the animal clean the wall etcquotthis is by and large a problem that all recent nintendo games except metroid prime of course have suffered from
doing simple and bland chores is not an appropriate substitute for actual adventure and shigeru miyamoto the quotfatherquot of mario aught to be ashamed of himself for falling so fari rented super mario sunshine instead of buying it and im glad
its always a good idea to rent a game firstthe graphics are gorgeous and the sound is good too i dont usually pay that much attention to sound in games so i cant really evaluate itthis is probably one of those love it or hate it games
i found the premise  mario is falsely accused of splattering a resort town with paint and is sentenced to community service cleaning up the mess  cute but not compellingthe camera drove me crazy
yes its usually  degrees but its also almost always pointed the wrong way
i liked it better when a games camera would automatically point in a logical direction even if that meant i couldnt control the cameralots of people love this game
if you want a traditional kill monsters and pick up trinkets platform game in a d environment youll love it toothis game is extremely disappointing
i figured the d mario games would be good since hes their flagship character
this game is terrible compared to d platforming excellence like jak  daxter or sly cooper
considering how much precision the game requires the lack of practical precision the game gives you in the controls is infuriating more on that later
the camera is awful constantly having to be managed by you to get anywhere and it does not see through walls
i cannot believe how pissed the camera made me giving me a fullscreen of wall during times requiring precision
oh and the b button is both the talk and dive button so if you were trying to talk to someone but the talk context icon didnt popup quick enough prepare to enjoy flinging yourself off cliffs
mario also does not respond well to surfaces he can wall jump or slide on  if you hit the wall too smoothly for example he wont wallslide down it hell simply fall straight down as if theres no wall at all
if you are falling downwards its extremely difficult to fall only a little bit forward you often wind up overshooting your mark because the controls dont allow for fine movement unless you move the joystick at  mm at a time
when you are dealing with disappering blocks you dont have time for that kind of fine movement but anything more than that ultrafine joystick movement sends mario running too farthe game also almost never tells you what you are supposed to do next nor does it give any hints
ive had to consult a faq many times simply because i didnt understand what i had to do next in a mission or even where i had to go to get to the next worldthe most important jump in the game the  degree high jump also does not reliably work
if you are moving in one direction your jump height is actually kind of small
in order to get decent air you have to move in one direction for a half second and then do a  and move the other direction and press jump
problem is this jump does not reliably happen
it works most of the time but again it is extremely frustrating when it doesnt work at key moments and you wind up doing a crappy normal jump insteadanother more minor quibble is that there is no option to invertuninvert the camera yaxis or xaxis
nintendo chose to make the camera inverted and youre stuck with it
i got used to it after  hours but man was it annoying
how hard is it to program camera inversion
this game has disgusted me so much that ive lost any interest in picking up the mario galaxy games since they are d mario platformers as well
im not going anywhere near this d mario garbage againi dont like this gamecleaning up the island is so dumbpianta village is too hardyoshi melts too muchalsosaving peach gets boring after the millionth time you do it
she has to get bodyguardsdont buy
starfishiestarcartoony look terrible control shocking violence repetitive gameplay
the cutscenes are hand drawn still pictures
the main character rau is difficult to move about and he gets stuck on everything
collision detection is terrible
and as for the innovative fight controls it amounts to little more than button mashing
halfway through the second mission walk along and kill everyone you come across your sword begins to get stuck in something every time you swing it
frustrating dull and stupid
i quitthis mark of kri game is fun but only like three levels long
this has plenty of blood gore and violance for me but it is just too short for me
the good thing is though i only bought it for two bucks at game stop
so overall this game is fun but too shortok i played rise of the kasaisequal before i played this game so thats why im tired with it
theres only so much fun u can have with this game
in rise of kasai at first i was like this game is great this is cool
the characters are cool but i got bored
why did i get bored
its a simple clunky hack n slash game with an ability to stealth around but why
this is supposed to be one of the best underrated games
pleeeaaaasesee im gonna be honest the controls were not too bad
but the main thing about it is the gameplaystory line
there is not much of a sensible story to the game and you have to buy moves which is really stupidunreasonable
also you just keep fighting about  chinese guys every  feet and then have one guy thats suppose to be the boss that looks just like the rest of the other people they got different clotheslooks and all that but they all look just like everyday human beeings you see on the street so its kinda repetitive
if you love bruce lee this game is worth renting but dont buy plus the levels are not all that interactiveim gonna get right to the point with this one
dont waste your money on this piece of junk
the plot is horrible the gameplay is immensely dull and the graphics are nd rate at best
this game makes a mockery of th john carpenter classic
you will be ready to hurl your controller through the tv after you try to kill a larger alien with fire which is the only way to kill them and run out of fuel and die a horrible grisly demise or light a fuel barrl on fire and die a horrible grisly demise  times in a row
just dont even bother with this pathetic excuse for a gamei dont have a lot to say except that the game is frustrating and darki know this is not helpful but i just wanted to express myselfive only been playing this game two nights and im ready to just give up on it
all i do is run around and die
and when i complete an objective and get to the next part i soon die again and have to start over at the last save point
i dont mind a challenge but i at least like it to be fun and rewardingi like the idea of a video game based on the movie the thing by john carpenter and i was excited to see how they would play on the fear the players had toward eachother is he the thing
is she
as it turned out the game play was extremely slow moving and at first the controls and interface were difficult master
the graphics are a bit dated and if you walk close to wall you may get a piece of the other room on screen
in addition it really didnt follow the movie at all
it seemed closer to a sci fi shooter like cold fear or extermination rather than the mind games i assumed it would containi loved the film
if your a true horror fan youll know the orignal thing was made in the s
as a kid i truly loved it
it was the first time i seen a horror film where it was impossible almost impossible to kill the monster
i believe they killed the thing with electrcity in the first one
the john carpenter remake was awesome much better then the first originalthe game has good graphics  real language meaning a lot of  letter words
if you know anything about the military you know cursing is part of it
try boot camp but the  letter words were really forced
the npcs just said them for the heck of it
i thought this game would have alot gore  disturbing images it had a few but not impressivly gorey
most is not realistic looking
looks more like red paint drippings etc the game play is ok the feartrust factor is nice but annoying
the ai troops are pretty stupid
i asked my medic to fix  power box  he said he couldnt cause he was blocked
there was another way to get to the power box
even when i showed him the way he resorted to his pre programed instinks  went toward the path that was blocked
i had to use a gernade to blow up the remaining boxes so he could repair itthe guns  other items you have in the game are nice
i wish they had a more diverse collection of weapons though
they have  distint types of grenades
i wish they had more distint firearms
the most frustating part of the game is your freeze meter
if your body tempture gets too low you die you must constanty go back  forth into building to rejuvinate yourself this gets repetitive fast  is very tedious  boring
i found this game to be unsuspenseful in most accounts
the game does a good job of picking up the pace the middle parts  will keep your interest during the more tame beginning of the game
not knowing who is infected is pretty cool but lacks in suspense too cause you know your npc teammates are going to be infected
thats a no brainer
there really arent any suprises
only a few minor ohhs  ahhs if you have a weekend to kick back  relax rent it just dont expect it to be a great horror survival experiencewhat happened
why is this game so hard
if you can past even the first level youre gonna have sore thumbs
the genesis version was actually fun this is not
you gotta be some kind of super ghouls n ghosts supreme hardcore gamer to even beat this game
matter of fact has anyone even beat this game yetlet me just start off by saying that i have never played a better game boy game nor a better mega man game
the introduction of a really powerful sword into a sidescrolling shooter is so out of place is to be amazingly fun
the satisfaction of jumping over a slowmoving energy shot and coming down and slicing the enemy in half all in the same fluid move is not to be ignored
however game companies and designers seem to have lost sight of the reason people play videogames to have fun
of course a game that lets you win too easily is no fun but a game as aggravatingly difficult as mega man zero should be banned
this is the one that will have you flinging your gba out the window ladies and gentleman
let me give you an example im a slightly above average mega man gamer so after taking a few lives to strategise against a boss i restart the game and take him on
with only  ticks left on my health meter i decide that i will not loose and that im going to play the rest of the battle perfectly
i do and i beat the boss
then the game says oh you had a brilliant victory and youre almost dead well now you need to escape from tons of falling stone through a locked door
what the  do you think i am the next houdinni
mega man does not walk through walls
in addition to which one of the first and foremost rules of videogame developement is once you beat the boss the level is over
in a game as frustratingly hard as this if the level isnt over a health refill is in order
btw for mmx vets there are no subtanks in this game
in the end get the game but only if you have enough money to replace your gba unit when you toss it on the ground and jump on it till its dustat first i didnt want to get it cuz i figured it would be dumb with all the disney characters in a squaresoft final fantasy type game
i was right
not only that but the game is too hard to figure out
im stuck somewhere i cant get out of some kind of jungle
ive gone everywhere i can think of
the game isnt that fun to play anyway and the graphics arent that great for a ps game
the only thing i liked is you get to meet all the characters from the final fantasies up to that point though some looked pretty bad
they also seemed to transfer the bright blue eyes of the main character to final fantasy crisis core for the psp
now that game is at least entertainingi really wanted to like this game
and after reading most of the favorable reviews here i thought why not
i like disney i like rpgs role playing gamesso ill give it a trythe graphics are nice with little difference between game play and cut scenes and the storyline seems really involved
however the problem i had was with the games camerai know this is a problem with most dfree roaming games and its no exception here
the camera wants to constantly shift to give you a better view of the character youre playing which is great if youre watching a movie but not so good if youre playing a game
and yes you can control the camera by pressing the r and l buttons at the same time which repositions the camera behind the character but as soon as you move the camera swings again giving you a different perspectivewith all the swinging involved i got motion sickness after about an hour of game play
i know that game designers want to wow us with all of the camera angles etc and how they can blur the lines between watching a movie and playing a game but watching the character youre controlling run towards the camera when you really need to see where youre going is not helpfulanother thing i dont like is that the camera is really closeup and you cant really see the environment clearly unless you switch to the first personcharacter view which allows you to see through the characters eyes but that slows down game playif i had known about the camera problems i would have passed on this game
i know that most people arent bothered by this but for me i cant get into the game with the camera going to and fro all the time making me nauseousmy yearold daughter played this game for two hours shuddered groaned erased the file from her memory card put the disk away in its box with the air of a night nurse cleaning up after an unfortunate accident and washed her hands up to the elbow
its sad to see disney trying to inculcate good buying habits buys disney get it
in the very young and comical to see a kid raise her eyebrow frown and grok the entire situation in a sudden furious flash
sorry but disneys crown jewels cant compete with final fantasy xii or even x
how ya gonna keep em down on the farm after theyve seen valley of the winds
and square enix should be ashamed of themselves for soiling their own brandi guess the game is not bad but our daughter got so caught up in it we had to hide it and only allow her to play it for an hour
she got too caught up in the game and would get angryi really wanted to like this game
really
i mean how can you go wrong with final fantasy characters and disney charactersthey went wrongthe main thing that drove me up the wall and made me take my copy back to the store was godsawful camera
ya know the one that constantly points in the opposite direction of the way youre facing
the one that stays up on the top level while youre down on the bottom level
the one that doesnt follow you around corners for hours at a time
yeah that camera
battle system wasnt good eitherthis game was really not that greati played it thinking that i would love itbut whenever i started playing iti didnt like ityou cant move you screen which is a huge handicapthe gummi ships are bad because you have to put them together piece by piece which takes time and sometimes it wont let you do itthe game is also very hardi love anything that has to do with kingdom hearts but this was a letdownpeople say this is one of the best games on the ps and an instant classic
i decided to give it a shot and i am honestly disappointed in this game
i do not enjoy the characters especially the protagonist sora and the cameos of all the disney characters is very out of place to me
the story is just uninteresting to me as well and i simply find myself not caring about the story at all though that might just be me
i got bored quick and it became a chore to finish this game which for an rpglike game is very strange for methis game has a lot of potential but very little skill is required for the majority
the activities necessary to get from point to point arent so much challenging as they are tedious
for instance during the vine swinging area you may get right to the end swing to the next vine hit it directly but you will fall and have to start all over again
there are numerous parts of the game where the main objective is getting from point a to point b by jumping from tree tops or vines or pillars but a few jumps will always be irritatingly right out of your reach causing you to start from the very beginning every single time
its not as much fun as it is time consuming as this jumping areas of the game are frequent
i purchased this game believing it was going to be like a fun form of final fantasy
its not
this game isnt childish because it has disney characters in it its childish because the tasks are boring and repetitivewhat if dungeon dice monstrers dddm had a different set of monsters and left out characters from the seriesthe game would not sell as wellthis game is not duel monsters or about expanding on that premise
in the tv show ddm was dislayed as similar to duel monsters and exciting but it is not
after all konami displayed their dance game for the ps whatever the game is called as a dueling device in the yugioh world where big bullies will trip tea just to win the prestigious dance game and be heroes in the eyes of the community  yawn
the ddm episodes and the dance show were blatant advertisement for their games
and where is truth in advertising todayat first ddm seems complex and interesting
after playing several tournaments the shallowness hits you in the head like a brick falling from the th floor and boredom kicks in
the game promises you excitement but leaves you wondering where the fun or the strategy really isyou only win one monster at a time a step back from current games
and the big beef is  you cannot save a tournament in progress
konami is really living up their duel monster game monopoly
they let you know that you do not get options for their electronic games and you should be happy that they allow you to playthe ps game has a superior movement and summoning system than ddm and does not sacrifice the original game  in favor of the quick buckthis really does not compare to duel monsters
it is an inferior game packaged in the duel monsters wrapper
if you are a diehard fan of the tv series and like interacting with the characters then you will still enjoy this game
if you like the strategy of duel monsters you will not find that herethe truth is plane and simple its not the best game but it is an addictive game
i was desappointed to see no real battle animation but it does have a feel to the original trading card game
it does get boring doing the samethings over and over again but for a kid i guess its an ok game
there are better games out there such as metroid fusion and megaman zero but eternal soul is not half bad give it a trythis game wasnt very fun because when you start the game it just says kill all of the enemy units without telling you how to do itwell i played this game when the xbox majorily lacked mech games
it was before games like mechassualt steel battalion etci poped this in my xbox and right from the top it was a lot of fun
but after awhile it got a bit oldheres what i thought of the first major mech game for the xbox gameplay its fun
you can do all kinds of cool things beggining with turning into a jet tons of upgrades rockets the ability to use incredible fire power and the overall fun of the game
unfortunantly after the first cut scene the game in no way refers back to the story
it is fun but it gets a bit dull on the th mission no connection with the story trying to now destroy a ship
you did it
good job now destroy that city
good job
now detroy that plane
good job
now resist the battle tanks and protect the civilians
good job
mission complete now this time
the whole thing is fun but its just endless destruction
then more destruction then a bit more now fly to this new base a bit more actionit is fun but with no story and minimal upgrades it gets really dull and has almost no replay value
and to add to all this no multiplayer this is probably just a rent not a buy
no story multiplayer and no real organazation of levels or even ability to figure out what mission your on
if u like button mashing mech killing this is for u  but if your also looking for some sort of story and maybe a good multiplayer game this isnt for uas for the button mashing flying mech frenzy its a blast
you can turn into a jet and fly all over the place freely shoot rockets machine guns jump etc and its all a blast
definantly a good rental this will keep u busy for a few nights graphics pretty good
lots of shooting explosions dirt destruction etcand its brought to life pretty well
the problem i had with this was that u cant really enjoy these graphics to their finest the entire time as there is quite a bit of framerate slowdown where when a lot is going on and the screen gets really slow and choppy
it happens so often it gets a bit annoying and it took away largely from a great gaming experience
to finish this section the graphics were very good not great and the framerate slowdown was too big a deal to ignore and it after awhile got so annoying i shut the thing off for a few minutes
its not  but its hard to go more than  minutes without seeing itwhich is just not exceptable counsidering the xboxs power options where the game failed
no multiplayer no different types of games or difficulty settings no way to have more than a few games
i mean its like they just slapped this game together in less than a month
theres a single player game with no story and thats it
no multiplayer different game types and or ways of playing the gamewhat would have been cool was a way to win awards train a few more graphics and actual story to go by
this game was not a very good one because of the so few options and work seemed to be put into itoverall this is a good rental on a night that your bored but definantly not a buy unless u can find it for less than a twenty
it just doesnt go up there with the great games the xbox has to offer and the depth it claims to have just isnt there
a game that could have been so much more gunmetal was a very good gameuntil u looked for more than endless button mashing and mech poweroverall id give this a  stars out of   felt like a half game not reccomended to anyone who wants more than a button masherhope this helpedthxi bought this game and spent  hours trying to play it
first of all the graphics are so cartoonish i had to just crack up
all of the players look like their  foot tall and  lbs including the quarterback and recievers
they all look like their on steroids and they hunch around the field like large gorillas
i was laughing through the entire  hours
when the quarterback throws a pass it looks like hes aiming at a dart board for god sakes its just hilarious
i have played  seasons on all of the ea sports college football up through  and have enjoyed every minute
the graphics on ea are just so much better not to say ea is perfect
ea is far from perfect but the graphics are much better
the quarterback and receivers are the right shape and size and the linemen are chunky like they should be
and also on ea when the recievers runningback and quarterback run with the ball the speed is right on
if a lineman picks up a fumble he lumbers with it cause hes obviousely  pounds and hes slow and always gets tackled
this puts ea over the top
the quarterback in ea has his fullrange of motion of his arm as hes passing the ball
in k the  foot  lb gorilla looking quarterback is throwing at a imaginary dart board hoaky to say the least
dont waste your hard earned dollars on this game
if you really want to get a good football game get k football nfl
this was put out by k games not sega
every sega game i have is worthless except for any of their baseball
the baseball games put out by sega are very very good
so if you have to have college football and want the best get ea any ea college football game will doim going to say it outright i waffled between nfl k and madden   it came down to this
nfl k and nfl k were great on the dreamcast
the last madden i played was nfl  on the pc
absolutely terrible
even though ea is the greatest gaming company in the world i just couldnt buy madden for the psso anyway i pop the game in and despite the extra long loading time and the annoying front end the graphics are tremendous
by far the best for any football console game
the players look lifelike and during a walk back scene after a play a friend of mine who doesnt play video games thought that it was a real televised football game for a secondof course graphics mean so little when it comes to playability
nfl k and nfl k had great playability in this game i found it lacking
there are two big things that irk me and destroyed a great game too much randomness and too many little flawsyou might be wondering what i mean when i say randomness
what i mean is that its hard to gauge how well youre doing when the ai is just wacky
for example about every fifth game the running back cannot be stopped
i shift the defensive lineman crowd the line on  defense take a man off coverage to plug up a whole have three guys wrap their hands around the half back within two yards of the line of scrimmage yet somehow the hb busts through for ten yards
this happens constantly
when this does happen the game is hopeless and i either have to accept the loss or reset the game
what about the other  games
i play dime defense and i easily stop the runhow about the flaws
one flaw is offensive rushing
it basically comes down to one question
do you want to establish the run or do you want to try to win
another flaw is the problem of switching to a man in coverage
often times when switching to a player it seems like it switches to a player that is in no position to cover while ill swear there is guy who was closer had the correct momentum and could have easily hit the receiver
this happens about onethird the time
guess what
there are four downs
i was screwed
couple that with the fact that if i nudge not tackle but graze him a player while hes out in pattern its automatically pass interference
also sacks are just rare
interceptions outnumber sacks  to the most annoying flaw
couple this with the player switching and pi bug mentioned above and its this when the computer feels like passing it will win
the best way to stop a drive
give it a nd and short
it will try to rush the next two downs and thats the best way to stop it
not quite a grand simulationother things annoyed me
the long long learning curve for one
another is the extensive amount of plays
both of these take some getting use to so its not too bad
field goals are a little tough especially when youre struggling for  yarders while the computer is kicking  yarders anytime it wantsso how did i do in a season
i played franchise mode which was neat
being able to sign a player i got chris carter is cool but im not a fan of the little micromanaging that needs to be done like negotiating contracts or signing backupsanyway i was the packers pro level and i finished   i was first in passing offense and first in overall defense
i was dead last in rushing
i had one sack and i was sacked  times about  of those times were due to the fact that i had an empty backfield
farve through two times as many interceptions as touchdownsheres irony for you
i started off  and  then i started to learn the game and got a whole lot better so i started losing
huh
well let me explain
i started to learn how to spot open receivers figured out how which plays work actually got a little rushing going learned to totally stop the run learned how to play defense pretty well and usually got off to a lead
this meant that the computer would start passing at almost every down
theyd exploit the bugs mentioned early drive down and score and keep doing this
theyre two minute offense is unstoppable
out of the last  games i lost   four of those losses were due to this and i lost them on the last drive of the game
onegames i lost was due to unstoppable running back
i maybe lost two legitimate games out of the seven
not fun at allother things annoyed me
the camera angles are not very well done
even the far camera angle cuts off the sides of the field
also you cannot design your own plays
whats up with thatlastly they have the most annoying thing in sports game
level adjustment bars
how bad is that
i dont go to a golf course and choose to tee off where ever i want
i dont widen the hole to make putting easier
i dont pick up the ball and throw it twenty feet farther just because the course is hard
i play the course as is
if the course is screwed up i just dont play it
its the same way with sports games
also adjusting tackling or speed changes the game completely and when you have to revert back when playing another opponent it will mess me up completelyokay that was the bad
heres the good
its still a good simulation up to a point
the feel of passing is unbelievable
its not like other games you actually have to survey the field unfortunately the camera angles dont allow you to do it perfectly
granted there are way too many interceptions its still the best feel as opposed to previous games where you knew steve young to jerry rice would always worktwo player is pretty fun since theres no computer cheating to screw you up
finally its a smooth game
you rarely see the phantom catches or tackle and players dont go through other players
its safe to say its a very polished crisp well made game
you can see that a lot of time and effort was put into this gamewould i recommend it
probably if youll play a lot of two player i have not tried the online version though i heard there a lot of cheaters who pause right before they are about to lose
if you want a good game where you can just sink youre teeth into it just go out and buy a used dreamcast with nfl k
itll probably be cheapereverquest is a visually appealing game however looks cannot carry a game
everquest suffers from horrible zone mangement
when moving within the city and in between towns you have a  second zone transition phase
while this may seem like not a big deal at first when you are running around doing quests you spend most of your time zoning
its a very poor experiencethe quest system is also poorly done
the quest rewards are terrible and keeping track of what you have to do and where you have to go should really be overhauled
eq includes a quest wizard that lets you select a quest and it will show you your progress however there is no intuitiveness to it at all
you can have  quests at one time and quest management is time consuming and typically poor reward for the effort
on average you get cp copper per quest completed
that doesnt buy hardly anything in the game and the inordinate amount of time it takes running around like an idiot just doesnt make it worth itthe map system is also poorly done there is automapping of dungeons and outside the city zones you have to explore every edge to see anything and there is no notation of where you are it shows your dot but not the name of the region
horrible managementadventuring isnt actually all that bad
a unique system of combo techniques and focus on team environments make adventuring enjoyable and ultimately what drew me to purchase the game but everything else just makes the game too poor to suffer throughsome folks might like eq its not a horrible game but it isnt revolutionary or show any real innovation
overloaded zones they spawn new zones on servers when it gets overloaded so you can have  instances of anatonica  thats just not something you should see from an established mmo gaming company inventory quests just make this game more work to play than enjoythe most tedious time consuming mess ive ever played
evercrack fans will love it
i hate itthe badhuge zone load times same poor net code as eq terrible graphics boring quests spelling errors bad npc acting
the game frustrates and is tedious
your forced to use online resources to locate thingsthe goodreally great animations
nice interface
great sound
neat spell effectsrecommendationgame is not for everyone definitely not for me
if you have huge holes in your social life might as well fill it with eq  thats what they made this game forgiven all the hype around this game i had expected something phenomenal
the reality is that this is a very highpriced but homhum and nd rate effort by sony
other reviewers have pretty effectively and appropriately flamed this title so ill make it quickpros excellent graphics but nothing you havent seen before simple ui average gamer can be up and running in minutes huge gamespace with rich and varied character typescons resource requirements are extreme i have a system that runs doom  well but it gets severely bogged down on eq lack of system availability several hours a day even worse on weekends is maddening especially given the hefty monthly recurring charge of  to get a character to a level where you can actually have fun requires the completion of literally dozens of stupid poorly thought out tasksquests others have likened it to delivering pizzas  imho thats a pretty accurate assessment neverending barrage of sales messages from sony trying to get users to buy into other options but at  month for access i would think sony would be embarrassed to try to get users to pay any more for this lame title  for any game this sad improvementsenhancements should be freenetnet many other options out are out there for online gamers that are much more fun at a lower cost
my recommendation is to save your money and steer clear eqthis game has  levels and you cant save at all and theyre long and you do get checkpoints
all you do is run forward and shoot alians no originality
you have futuristic weapons and you get powerups for them to make them powerful then when youre hit these pods fall out of you and you have to collect them backcheck outninja gaidangta double packmax payne dead to rightsok mib is a very good concept for movies and games but this title isnt the best for far but isnt the worst an for my point of view this is the pros and consprosreal challenging game when you sit in front your tv you must do  things first quit like a looser or move fast ant try to end the level cause theres no way that you can save your progress during the level graphics could be betterbosses i already finished  levels and the bosses are not so difficult but reach them is the pain in the cons the music
oooouuuuchhhh
 some times you will think on turn off the volume the caracters where is tommy lee and will smith the voicessame thing keep the upgrades on your weapons is real difficult when you reach their maximun power is very easy to kill a dozen of aliens but each time that you get shoot you loose your upgrades the save thing why you cant save your progress during the levelso please save yourself  and rent it
or if you want to buy it i sell mine just this is a review of this productmen in black ii alien escape playstation  video game
amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product for which this review may not apply
after reading this review please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for
this is a review that i originally wrote on i bought this game because i likemen in blackand i figured that it would be a good game
i couldnt be any more wronggameplaythe whole premise of the game is this you go from room to room or area to area and kill everything that moves except for the worm dudes whom youre supposed to rescue  or something like thatthere are five big levels broken up into sections which too many semilong load screen in betweenconsidering that all you do in the game is shoot things i really wonder why the programmers didnt give the player an aim button
then again they didnt give a jump button either jumping surely would have broken up the monotony of the gamethe most fun i had in the game was destroying all the cars on the parking garage levels
you dont get any points for it and it doesnt accomplish a goal but it sure was funstoryan alien prison ship crash lands on earth the bad aliens escape and you have to kill them
thats all the plot there is and its probably all youll needive seen the first film but ive never seenmib
however from what i know about it the plot of this game is nothing like it
rather than calling it men in black  alien escape infogrames should have just called it men in black alien escape
that way no one would think it was even remotely like the recent filmthe only aspect of the game that i think is like the film assuming i was able to deduce enough of the films plot correctly from the trailers is a small bit of the ending involving the statue of liberty and a neurolizeraudiovideoin all honesty i didnt pay too much attention to the audio except for the voice actors
they were pretty good but lets face it tommy lee jones will smith and rip torn are the guys we know as agents k j and zed respectively and no one is going to be able to play those roles better
they tried to model the characters and hire voices that resemble tommy will and rip but unless they hired the actual actors and got permission to use their likenesses its always going to look like a cheap imitation  which it doesthe weapon graphics were a little flashy but considering the mibs arsenal i expected more flash from the weapons and wheres the noisy cricket by the way
the environments were the worst
they all look bland muddy washedout and extremely repetitive especially on the spaceship at the end where every corridor looks just like the lastreplayabilityto make up for the short and boring game infogrames threw in a bunch of unlockables to make you want to play the game again
unfortunately theyre simply not worth unlocking
i used a cheat code to unlock everything and heres what youd get a couple training missions of you in one room shooting an endless supply of aliens shouldnt these be available from the start as training for the main game
 profiles of j and k boss mode fight the bosses again profiles of all the aliens in the game all of whom are boring and not in the films except for the manitoba worm guys and a bunch of still frames detailing the making of the game not the movie
yawnto buy or to rentrenti love the terminator movies but i gotta be honest with younot this game  heres whyobnoxious camera in conjunction with the terrible movement controls
i often found myself getting lostdisorientatedstucknot enough outdoor levels
instead you run around bases hotels parking lots asylums etc
you end up feeling very claustrophobic by the rd level or sospeaking of which there are only  levelsthere are three characters to play as but its not like you get to pick one of the three characters before entering the next level
one mission you may be kyle reese the next you might be some guntoting female
 if there is one enemy that you will learn to hate real fast its those annoying flying saucers that knock you on your back when they attack
and then you get up and unless you destroy it muy pronto youre going to get knocked down again
ive only seenfought one t in the game
but you have your pulsed plasma rifle in the  watt range right
remember how easily the resistance killed ts in the future scene in terminator 
no such thing here
you pump umpteen thousand rounds into this t and he finally softens up
then you pump another umpteen thousand rounds into him only to saw him in half
but that upper half is still alive so plasma rifle in hand you pump another umpteen thousand rounds into him
goodness youd think you were shooting a wimpy  or something
it was after that battle that i said forget it this game isnt worth my time
 you dont get to ride around in vehicles
but keep in mind that i stopped at level  of  so im not sure about  or  but i doubt it
 easy mode is too hard
 no big battles like the one at the start of t
instead youre reduced to goingitalone missions with occasional runins with stupid allies
 and worst of all this game just simply isnt fun
its frustrating
believe me i tried to like it but it never happened
you can spend your money on something better than this like the terminator films on dvd special editions if you dont have them alreadyhere are a couple terminator game alternatives you might want to consider skynet terminator these latter two were made by bethesda for the pc if i remember correctlyvarious terminator games for the gameboy nes snes and arcadethe only good parts about this game are the fmvs but id rather watch the movies than this piece of garbage any dayterminator dawn of fate is a pretty fair game but it tries so hard to be a good game but hardware and perhaps even legal considerations just kept getting in the way
dawn of fate tells the story of the events leading up to kyle resses eventful trip back to the past to save sarah connor and destroy the csm terminator sent to kill her and prevent john connor from being born
the game is built around the standard premise of killing terminators collecting technology for upgrades and of course the survival of all mankind against the evil and monolithic skynet
you get to meet general connor justin perry and catherine luna friends and comrades of kyles and you switch characters between missionsits odd that they managed to capture the look of post judgment day earth the battlefields and ruined cities perfectly
everything skynet had all the vehicles the hk tanks and aerial units are all there in gleaming chrome but thats all they captured
the sounds are all wrong
the brilliant purple plasma guns sound like typical game fair and dont have their deep resonant stutter from the movies
even the hks dont sound quite right
its like whichever studio owns the copyright approved using the appearance of everything but said they couldnt use the sound effects
either than or the developers decided to do their own
bad mistake
another flaw is that the techcom soldiers and their weapons arent really representative of the movies eitherall i can say about the character models is bad
kyle reese looks like christopher walken did as the hessian in sleepy hollow stupid hair and all
justin perry looks like he was carved out of stone and i wont go into how unfeminine luna looks
connor is probably the best rendered of the lotmission play is broken up into rd person play starting with protecting connor from an terminator infiltration attack destroying techcoms computers and blowing up an hk tank that has rolled into the top floor of the resistances hideout
in that mission you have to protect a demolitions expert as he plants explosive charges in the massive hotel base is a royal pain because he does nothing to defend himself
instead he stands there passively getting blasted by terminators while you rush around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to kill them before they grease him
later missions involve a secondary story that the programmers must have felt was pretty clever
theyre wrong
as well you must prevent skynet from steeling all the platinum from a federal reserve bankapparently skynet has just perfected the csm series infiltrators but they have also been capturing normal humans and modifying them cybernetic mind control devices
one of these alexander stone blames kyle for the death of his brother gabriel and so has turned traitor joining forces with skynet in order to seek revenge
it is he the player must track down because he has stolen connors battle plans for an assault against skynets main base at cheyenne mountain in colorado
but while you get the plans back you can never actually kill stone
im not entirely sure why skynet would create these hybrids dressed as they are in black and red leather with cybernetic implants visible on them its not like they can blend in like the infiltrator terminators dofinally its the main assault on cheyenne mountain and you fight your way into the very core of the enemys main base blowing up everything in site
the hardest part being the attack on the central computer ai the heart of skynet which is apparently so powerful that it is capable of mind control a process that takes a few minutes while you work feverishly to cut off the computers power source before it melts your guys brain thus ending the gameso its a pretty standard story line except for the silliness of the hybrid part
there are plenty of weapons grenades rockets plasma guns machine guns emp weapons that stun robots for a few seconds pretty basic stuff
the game offers a first person view but as with any firstperson console game control is terrible and youre better off not using it except to look around at the scenery
one interesting function is adrenaline a function that makes you shoot faster and more accurately which enables you to take down baddies quicker than usual
it doesnt last long so its best used wisely
another problem is the dino crisis effect opening doors just to get to another small area to open another door in order to get to another small area and you guessed it open another door
it gets old very fastwhile there are good concepts here some nice graphics the game almost seems crippled in places
heck you cant even walk off a ledge and kill yourself because the game wont allow it
but for the most part it seems to be a halfbaked attempt to tell the same story that bethesda software did a decade ago with terminator  a somewhat more entertaining game if graphically inferior
dawn of fate manages to tell a fair story with repetitive game play go there do that kill this if youve played star wars bounty hunter youll know what to expect
id be interested to see the xbox version just to check if it at least has better graphicsthis game had little to offer in the firstperson shooter fps genre
the graphics are pretty mediocre and the ai is nothing fancythe single player mode lacks any sort of story or development
the different game modes while generally fun are nothing new
the controls are pretty good but the action moves a little unrealisticlly no pun intended
weapons dont require reloading so the action seems a bit overexageratedi havent played this game on xbox live so im passing no judgment in that respect
but as a fps this game suceeds in breaking no new ground
nor does it really push the limits of xboxs potentiali bought this game for  and took it back the next day because i found it to be painfully boring and virtually unplayable online
i then decided to give it another chance and bought it used for   nothing has changed
i should have saved my  bucksfirst off i would like to say that the graphics in this game are excellent but that is where the good ends
if you have this game on pc then dont waste your money on this
it is virtually the exact same game with more cumbersome controls
nothing compares to a keyboard and mouse and this couldnt be more true for this game
the pace and speed of this game is not suited for anything other than a keyboardmouse combo
it seems atari rushed this game out without taking the controls into considerationnow for the xbox live portion which is probally the reason most people bought this game
first of all finding a game on the servers can be a bit of a chore
when you do actually select a game to play you have to cross your fingers to hope that the game will actually let you in
more often than not you will be booted from the server before you actually join the game
expect to try at least  times before actually getting in a gamewhen you finally get in a game besides the lag in  of the games you will almost immediately see that the game is nothing more than pure quotchaosquot as reviewer quotultimatexhammerquot so acurately put it
this game requires no skill
just get a rocket launcher and fire away at random targets
sometimes youll hit your enemy most of the times you wont
and dont even think about stopping to actually aim at an enemy chances are youll be dead before you even get to shoot
the weapons in this game are cool and all minus the sniper rifle replacement however you rarely have enough time to select them and use them correctly due to the cumbersome controls and the fact that this game is pure luck for the most part
you get the occasional gamer that performs extremely well online but for the most part this game is nothing but running around and shooting at anything that moves hoping that someone does not shoot you in the back for the th time
and if this wasnt bad enough some custom levels actually have enhanced laser cannons that kill you in one shot no matter where it hits you
if you thought you died fast in normal games imagine dying as soon as you spawn over and over and over again
no fun at allthe other games on uc like bombing run and capture the flag would be fun because in theory they require strategy
but again this game is too chaotic and random for any strategy to ever be a factor in these games eitherto bluntly put it this game is boringif no skill random dying and ultimate chaos is your cup of tea then you will feel right at home with uc
otherwise stay clear of this game
it wasnt worth  and it is not worth  eitherthis game is really fun for about the first  minutes
you quickly come to the realization that once youve played the four or five available games youve basically seen it all
sure you can choose different characters and different weapons and different teamates but it doesnt really change anything
as a rental game unreal championship is worth a weekend rental but if you buy it you will be stuck thinking about what else you could have done with that okay i have to admit i went into this game with high expectations leaving me a long way to fall with disappointment but you will agree this game is bad
the concept is cool you are an american pow in wwii and you try to escape from your pow campcool
the idea is pulled of poorly howeveryou start out in a small camp which actually acts as your game training ground
you are given tasks from fellow prisoners all of which lead up to your eventual escape
grab the key steal the crowbar steal this ect
the first camp lasts awhile and after escaping you are recaptured and put into a newharder camp
this will go on and onthe controls are poor your guy keeps running when you dont want him to you end up getting shot anf have to start the mission over again
gameplay is boring go here do this come back go out again
i am a fan of metal gear with all of the sneaking and stuff but there is no action in this game
get spotted and you are shot down and noyou cannot break any necks here
the voice acting is horrible with your captors with horrible and cheesy german accentsbe smart stay away from this maybe dead to rights will be good
if you need an espionage game go with metal gearin prisoner of war you play as smarttalking american airforce captain lewis stone
your objective escape from a german prisoner of war camp without being killed by enemy soldierswhat attracted to me to this game was the premise a game whose entire plot revolved around escape not killing not fighting
escape
if youre like me you might think this sounded intriguing or at worth the risk of checking outif youre interested enough to do so be warned prisoner of wars graphics are about two years out of date
the voiceacting is good to embarrassingly bad especially the voices of the enemy soldiers and the tutorial is nonexistant which makes navigating the game at early levels a challengepros cool idea some fairly decent modeling for stone and other characterscons german soldiers have almost embarrasingly poor accents
clunky interface poor console controls repetitive cut scenes etcoverall i would consider pow only average
gaming fans who like stealth based games like thief might enjoy this onei rented it last night and it bites
the graphics are horrible and so is the voice acting
the game isnt even that funmy  year old must have thought this was something different
he has not played with it much and said he does not like it
he has several other star wars games not sure why but this does not interest himit seems to me with very rare exception that for the last ten years  of the star wars games that are released are all basically clones of the old rebel assault pc title
dress them all up anyway you want but when alls said and done youre really playing the same gameyou will have several different vehicles to pilot as well as being on foot but the whole games plot is essentially the same finish the level as fast as you can without getting killed  thats it
theres not a lot of strategy involved past that thats about it
frustrating part is they could have stuck to the mold and still added a little variety
for example how about letting us pilot one of those atats for a little whilethe one thing that i had hoped may be a saving grace would be the animated cutscenes between levels but even they were a little subpar
aside from the animation being at best average there were too few of them
even the ending animation scene was only about a minute or two
i finished the game and thats all im rewarded withill also answer the question that i know at least a few of you have
no  this game will not lend any hints to what may be ahead in the new episode iii and does nothing to advance the plot of the prequel trilogy
they may have been able to sell a few more titles if this game was a little more tied to the plot of the movies
the recently released enter the matrix game as a terrific example to what im talking about
on a side note it was nice though to see an old character from the comic books named ulric qeldroma make an appearanceso as been stated before if you liked rebel assault i or ii starfighter bounty hunter and jedi starfighter  etc etc  then this is probably going to be right up your alley
one the other hand if like me youre getting a little burnedout on this style of play this isnt going to do anything for youwhen you play this game you tell the character what to do and it does it fast enough that you almost think your actually playing but when you use a blaster you cant aim the game does it for you it gives you a choice when attacking of the attack type but if you dont tell the character what to do they will use a weak attack the good thing is you can set it so it wont pause after each attackthough i like this game a lot i found that it is much better on the computer
because of the keyboard the computer version has more freedom and doesnt have to fit all the controls on a xbox controller
so if you have a computer and xbox and want this game go for the pc versionfreezes constantly
the cut scenes have not worked yet and the game will stop in the middle of loading
it skips during action sequences
the level maps themselves are the go here  do this type with no room for original thought or puzzle solving of any kind
the characters were interesting at time but the plot kept jumping in the way
id be in the middle of going somewhere on a level and id be prompted to talk to one of the other characters
i found this game frustrating and monotonous
morrowind is far superior in ever respect
maybe my expectations are too high
maybe i bought a defective copy
what ever the reason im annoyed that i paid as much for this game as i didits a solid full experience but the fact that youre not taking any active role in the fights detracts from what otherwise is a fully realized worldthose looking for a star wars rpg will love this as im sure many rpg lovers will
but after playing such star wars games as jedi academy bounty hunter and jedi outcast i was disappointed that you couldnt just run in and start attacking foes with either a lightsaber or take aim and fire your choice of weapon
rather you can only target and watch as your character slowly exchanges fire with enemies who dont move even an inch in any direction as you fire duck he fires you fire he fires you fire etc
etc
ive never been much of an rpg fan nor a fan of the final fantasy series which seems like the holy grail of rpgs so perhaps thats why the battle scenes disappoint me
not a game worth buying for anything more than half of the original retail priceim a huge star wars fan and i pretty much have ever game with star wars in the title
after rouge squadron ii on the gamecube i couldnt wait for the clone wars which can roughly be described as rougue squadron on the ground
while the graphics are amazing the game play that has made so many star wars games fun to play was lacking in this game in my opinion
the single player missions are fun and the difficulty on jedi knight is extremely tough
i just didnt get into the game
i did not like the ground based fighting game and only found fun flying
the times when you are a jedi are laughable
if one has played jedi knight ii on pc they will understand what i mean
the multiplayer is absolutely horrible
i played it with  of my friends and after  minutes we played something else due to the lack of entertainment and fun
if you are a hardcore star wars fan youll probably like it if you are a gamer looking for a challenge with great multiplayer capabilties get time splitters  and pass on this gamei really wanted to like this game as this franchise is one that talks me back to my pc gaming roots
but i just cant get into the overall animation style for this game and how kiddy orientated the game is i like more maturity from my mmos and this one was way too childish for me and the raiding is just plane lame in this gamei think its important to be properly acquainted with a game before it is reviewed but in order to rate it its necessary to be acquainted with the competition without having been stuck with the product for years developing a bias
incessantly world of warcraft is reviewed ranked and revered as having charm and fun that its competitors cannot touch and that the competitors are only mere clones
but in truth world of warcraft is a clone of many mmorpgs that came before it and other recent games such as guild wars and especially lord of the rings online do indeed have charm beauty and a level of detail that world of warcraft cannot even come close tothere are a few reasons why everyone and his brother dog and fish all play world of warcraft the game has a name that was already world famous for gameplay warcraft which was a realtime strategy game the graphics are very very lowend but with enough color and cartoony charm to appeal to an unusually wide range of ages of players and as such the game targets the broadest common denominatorthat said world of warcraft is not the game for you if youre looking to push a new mb vram geforce  series video card to its limits
theres nothing graphically spectacular here
apparently thats not the point of wowit would seem that wow is about peer pressure and hanging out with friends and being cool and developing biases about a nowarchaic game to prejudge all other viable games no matter their merit as clones
certainly wow has made itself a legend in gaming history
and newer games such as lotro do indeed reproduce a lot of trivial elements that are seen in wow
but its far too easy to forget that wow itself was a ripoff of d mmorpg legends before its own time including asherons call and everquest
in fact most of the gameplay elements in lotro were taken from turbines own original legacy asherons call not wow
only a few trivial touches seen in wow were cloned all other cloned elements derived from other sourcesthe gameplay in wow is decent but the mechanics can be annoying
wow has every bit as many grinding as the worst grinding moments of every ther mmorpg out there
the level of sophistication of the initial quests are rediculous kill  breed of monsters no not those identical twin monsters directly adjacent to them
and wait your turneveryone else is doing the same thinggetting lost in wow is as boring as in any mmorpg
given the outdated graphics and obsolete ai you may find yourself severely uninspired to keep moving
combat situations in wow are unoriginal and actually quite flawed
i dont know about what the other races are like or if you can turn it off but every time i try to use a skill and dont have enough energy my character shouts i dont have enough energy
that is extremely annoying to me
i could tolerate a short and simple musical note or something and would prefer nothing to happen at all
equally annoying is the fact that visual feedback for this is isolated from the skills toolbar other than the fact that the skills are simply disabled  dimmed one must monitor the energy bar at the top of the screen
most mmorpgs have this wrong in guild wars i rearranged my user interface so that the mana  magic blue bar whatever its called is directly adjacent to the skills bar
if wow supports ui rearrangements this would be necessary to me
i havent checked yeti mentioned that the graphics are lowend
this is true they do push systems of  or so but this is  to make up for this theming is very heavybuildings are lopsided players are shaped with exaggerated features and colors are painfully solid solid green flora solid blue sky solid gray brick buildings etc
if you dig that or dont care great
i for one prefer to sink in my chair and inhale the beauty of lord of the rings online with the incredibly detailed sky the flock of birds in the sky the rainbow the very organicfeeling grass the beautiful moon and so on
if im going to stare at a characters butt all day i also prefer to stare at my quaint hobbit in lotro or my beautiful character in guild wars over wows lowpolygon cartoony ogre thug or lopsided humani dont doubt that those who have played wow for a long time are thoroughly enjoying themselves
my frustration is with the fact that most wow players are firsttime players of mmorpgsa fact proven by numbers aloneand they have no idea of how unfairly prejudiced they are about the game that introduced them to the genre when they judge other very fine games
of course they will look down on them
it doesnt matter that they supercede many or all elements of what makes wow great other than sheer quantity of players
people will always be biased for what they have been playing for a long timemy review of wow then concludes with this wow is popular because of viral marketing not because its a spectacular game
is it a good game
sure
does it stack up to other mmorpgs
well if you forget numbers for a moment wow stands on its own but it really does not overcome them all
do i think its worthy of  stars
absolutely not i reserve that for lord of the rings online
 stars
no i was annoyed and frustrated when i tried wowso if your friends or family are playing wow and theyre trying to get you to join them by all means sign up and join the party
but if youre on your own and you have a good gaming pc and you just want to enjoy an mmorpg experience wow is nothing to be ashamed of but i would recommend that you consider the alternativesespecially those alternatives that most of the mmorpg newbies ie
the bulk of wow veterans dismiss as cheap clones
you might find as i have that the dismissal is with little merit and that they arent cheaply implemented at all but very well made iterations of a mmorpg genre that has a decadesold legacyas an experienced gamer and sometime online gamer i have to say i was blown away the first couple of times i played wow
the graphics are super the world is populated by interesting and often funny characters love the dwarves and blizzards support of usercreated interfaces such as cosmos is admirablewith that said i have to say i was also blown away by how awful the support is for this game
after several months of playing im cancelling my subscription
ill be doing that as soon as i can log on to the wow site which has not been up the last  times i have triedblizzard requires elaborate firewall settings to download updates they have been frequent and has yet to address the frequent and irritating lag issues on some servers not to mention the frequent and equally irritating crashes resulting in extended periods of not being able to access the game  something you are paying forrecently  days after sending an email to customer support after being asked to do so regarding a server latency issue i received a response asking for more information
incredible
i had since started characters on another server and not experienced the same issue so i know the server was to blamethe game was not ready to launch and blizzard was not prepared for the massive response to the launch
the myriad of game of the year designations are not deserved
those that enjoy paying to be a playtester should love wow
if you rather enjoy playing games to escape a bit and enjoy yourself look elsewhere  at least for the time beingbefore anyone votes me not helpful bc they disagree with my review for whatever reason let me say that ive been a diehard blizzard fan since  when warcraft  started me down the computer path
so if there is bias here it is in their favor
so on to the reviewthis game is the best i think i have ever played
it is  well massive the graphics are great there are hundreds of quests for each raceclass combo so some tuarenelfwhatever some warriorpriestwhatever and the professions add a new dimension to the game
i think i had more fun mining and blacksmithing then questing for awhile
there is a profanity filter on by default easy to turn off and auction house to sell things to others  the list of amazing accomplishments goes on for milesbut then you try to playblizzard just posted news regarding a hardware upgrade that coincided with enough lag disconnections and game simply crashing to desktop how server hardware accomplished that i dont know but it started happening at the same time  i changed nothing to make the game simply unplayable
the server my main character is on had an person queue last night  minute wait so i went to the server with my alternate character
lockups server rollbacks that make you redo portions of the game disconnections lag
combine massive queues with game crashes and you get to sit there staring at your monitor trying not to scream
tonight i was simply greeted with the authenticating message for many long minutes before giving up usually takes  seconds tops and this is far from the first time
before you think wow what a winer
this will all be over in a week or so just keep in mind that blizzard opened up service to south korea yesterday
south korea  tens of thousands of power gamersso yes the game is incredible in many ways including how much fun it is
but it is a subscriptionbased game
that means you pay to play online
online games arent much fun when you cant log in
take my advice and wait
this game is only getting better and since you get a month free service and then pay about  clamsmonth you dont want to be sitting here paying for nothing like menow i think im going to go play warcraft  for awhilei have been playing this game for half a year now and even though i have had fun i am beggining to question the point of  dollars a monththere are tons of problems with the game that havent been fixed or are being created
for one ironforge is basically unraidable because the lag is unbearable
noone wants to raid ironforge because you cant even move without waiting
another thing killing lowbies doesnt give dishonorable kill points
quite a few times i have seen level  alliance players kill a bunch of level s at the morshan ramparta place where people can pvp in a specific zone but as soon as you leave that zone there might be some level s waiting to murder you
blizzard still hasnt fixed the guards yet so many players stand the chance of being murdered upon exiting the warsong gulcheven worse there arent that many items
after playing so long you soon start to see the same models in the same armor every day
everyone looks the same practically and most higher level players have practically the same armor sets now
i have seen so many people with the dreadmist rainment that it is laughable
if you use twohanded swords i bet you probably have a destinyworse yet the community is filled with younger kids who still dont know how to play at level  i cant tell you how many times ive seen a level  warrior pull  monsters and yell at the group when he dies
there are so many little kids
the new thing seems to be farming kills in the warsong gulch
what many of these kids dont realize is the fact that after you kill someone a few times in one day you dont get any more honor from them
so in essence they are wasting their own time trying to farm killsthis game is not worth  dollars a month
people bash everquest but if you pay  dollars a month you get eq and any other soe game that is online for that same  dollars
this games flaws could be overlooked but the pricing is just too steepthe idea is cool
the game is well thoughtout
i stopped playing because i was doing the same thing over and over againjust got boringthe game is addictivebut just wasnt for meafter deciding to take a break from eq and after reading all the positive reviews i figured i would give it a try
the games quests are very unimaginative ie
kill x amount of x creatures over and over again
the graphics are very much along the lines of nintendo with very little customization available to change your characters lookswow has yet to come out with an expansion
how the players can play the same game for a year and a half is beyond me
they have an expected release date of october  for the expansion but two years is a long time for only releasing their first expansiona majority of the players are younger players that cannot afford the computer to play eq and thus the amount of chuck norris jokes gets very old very quickly
in summary i went back to eq and love it very muchfirst the good
the game is quite pretty and contains a great amount of character an personality
unlike others i kind of like the cartoony look
i like the different styles and voices and environments of the different races
bottom line is the graphics and sound people who worked on this game did a top notch job
thats about the only thing that went right thoughthe game starts out fun enough
the interface and playing is easy and  intuitive so its not hard to play the game and feel like youre doing a good job
the game gets repetative really fast but if youre playing an mmo thats so far unavoidable
instead of grinding on a bunch of creatures for just xp  of the game is sending you on quests that say go kill  of crfeature x aka grinding with a purposesort ofafter a while the games flaws start to become more apparent
there are large balance issues between the classes
the professions are bugged so sometimes you cant advance in them any further and even if you could theyre by and large useless by the end of the game engineering being the exception and cooking if youre a hunter
theres still an inordinate amount of bugs that really hamper gameplay for instance if a mage gets hit when using his ice block talent he will be disconnected from the server
on top of it all the servers are still unstableit might be forgiveable if this was still release but im writing this review after the game has been out for  months
blizzard has taken little to no steps to fix any of the problems with the game instead doing nothing for long periods of time and then introducing new features which either exacerbate old problems or create entirely new ones
the developement team makes no direct contact with the community but instead uses a group of community managers who are just glorified forum moderatorsive been a big fan of every blizzard game so far except diablo  it was terrible until the  patch they released 
years later so this was a huge letdown
the games got potential like i said lots of character but ive spent  worth of monthy fees waiting for them to fix the game and i dont recomend anyone else paying a monthly fee waiting for them to finish developing the game
if diablo  was any indication hold off on this game for another  years and if its still around it will probably be a decent game by thenas a fan of online role playing games mmorpgs i have seen and played countless incarnations of the same basic premise
they all share a lack of story and boil down to mindless monster bashing for levels and loothowever shadowbane was different at least in the beginning
at first glance shadowbane offers players a wealth of opportunities
join or create a guild and then build a city of your own
no longer are players forced to use computer controlled cities as rallying points
shadowbane allows anyone and everyone to easily create their own city
however this great feature is also its curseshadowbane is at heart a player killers dream
for those who dont know a player killerpker is someone who spends their time searching out and killing other players instead of monsters and npcs
those grand cities that you can create can also be destroyed by other cities and guilds
pkers tend to group together for protection and spend time hunting down unsuspecting individuals who only wish to be left alone to build their characters and cities in peaceshadowbane not only allows such activity it promotes it
it does this by unceremoniously dumping low level characters onto the mainlandpopulated by the afore mentioned pkers as soon as they reach a certain level
new players can band together but will still easily be crushed by one or two higher levels ones that wait outside the  safe citieshaving played through the beta and a couple months worth of the release i have seen very little of this change
shadowbanes concept begins as great but ends up failing in the end as everyone resorts to mindless leveling for loot and experience
its purpose is slightly different from all the others though
instead of leveling just to be able to take on bigger and better monsters you are leveling to take on bigger and better playersin the end shadowbane falls short of its goal of revolutionizing mmorpgs and ends up where they all do after a month or two
it sits on a shelf collecting dust and is quickly replaced by newer versions of the same premise
hindsight being  i would have not wasted my time with shadowbane and i highly suggest you dont eitherafter having experienced some nasty behavior from ubi before i decided to download the free trial from their website before actually purchasing the full version of this gameim glad i didthe graphics are old my computer and drivers are not and even as a trial this game was a disapointment
once the avatar was created the progression was boring
i felt like i was playing the original ps version of diablo all over againno thanks  ive moved beyond that stagethe premise  the political manouvers that are possible with online play and the interaction of the characters is fantastic
the reality just isntnow i do enjoy the gameplay and such of this game but i do not like the fact that the makers of this game ubi soft just want moneythey give extra content to players that pay and play morethere are three special races restricted only to players that pay a years worth of monthly subscriptions for this gamenot only that but those  races are some of the coolest races in the game and players that arent sure if they want to play for an entire year and order only a one month subscription cant play these races which makes me furiousthe three races are the minotaur aracoix and the centaur
now the minotaur is right on the box so its a shame that players who actually want to just try out the game wont get to play them
centaurs are half man half horse which is awesome
aracoix is the most amazing thing ever they are birdlike creatures that can actually fly
and ubi soft is only letting the players that order a one year subscription for this game play these races
so if you are positive that you are going to play and pay for an entire year and dont mind if ubi soft spoils the players that pay more and give them free stuff
i am totally  against this and if you like me and many other players dont feel that its fair to give the players extra content which leads to more fun because they pay you more than the average player then stay awayprobably the worst online game ive played to date
i have played for  weeks now and have cancelled my subscription
graphics are quite dated and lagg at times makes it unplayable
oh and i cant forget the server crashes although less frequent now they still occur
skip this title and buy something elseso what does star wars galaxies swg bring to the table that a gamer who spent time with everquest asherons call ultima online and other classic mmorpg titles has never seen before
well it does have some fairly organized noncombat gameplay mechanics including a builtin computerized buying and selling system that acts like ebay for custom crafters
i also got a kick out of the ability to purchase harvesters which dig up incredible amounts of resources on all planets while your character levels up somewhere else
i enjoyed tinkering around with some of swgs noncombat options but that was really the only thing i found to do in the game
at the time i played there wasnt a single jedi in the game but i hear that people are finally discovering after almost a year of play
how to become one
i also hear that in the future the game might add space combat and land vehicles which were a critical omission from the original game which leads me to my number one complaint how can you create an mmorpg about star wars and leave out space
thats like creating a dungeons amp dragons mmorpg and leaving out magic
id like to spend more time telling you some of the pros and cons of this game but it bored me to death after two weeks of play
and this is coming from someone that spent months on previous mmorpg classics
it doesnt offer the mmorpg gamer anything they havent seen before and it probably has one of the most boring hack and slash leveling systems of all the mmorpg titles
swg still has a strong fan base and id recommend that star wars fans diehard mmorpg fans you know who you are and mmorpg newbies give it the old college try but everyone else should save their money
this game might be fantastic after three or four expansions which you know are coming considering it has the same developer that worked on everquest but it doesnt bring anything new to the quickly diminishing mmorpg genre which is imploding from its own repetitivenessgalaxies is not worth buying at this timethe problem with the game is not the bugs
its not the graphics
its not the interface
its that there is not enough to do
theres a limited amount of professions available and to keep yourself interested you have to be a hybrid of professions
being an entertainer just isnt fun
being a marksman or a brawler isnt either
it seems that you have to be a combination of a classes to stay entertained and then it becomes a hassle trying to earn money or find people who can train you so that you can spend even more time hunting repetitive enemies dancing in a catina or scrounging for resourcesi cant immerse myself in this game
some people can
some people are entertained just by chatting in the catina or chilling out with friends while picking off some enemies
i wasnt
there is no direction in this game
while some people might enjoy this there still is no feeling of a goal no feeling of accomplishment in anything that you do
you can join the imperial or rebel forces and do missions for them but that feels isolated and insignificant
the whole world feels lifeless at the momentin other online rpgs theres always something to strive for even if its just leveling up to get that next item or skill
in galaxies there is no leveling and theres nothing else that can compete with that feeling of accomplishment however slight that is present in combat oriented rpgssimply put this game is not fun
for me obviously
give it a try if you want just be cautious and know what youre  dollars is getting youthis game is just plain dumb
there are way too many glitches with animations and character movements
i find myself walking right through some objects
dont buy it now wait until some of these horrible bugs are cleared up
wait until the jedi fiasco is figured out toofor a substantial monetary output you get very littlethe game requires a very high end machine to play on a minimum leveleveryone is a rebel for the most part
destroying the feel of the movies and the bookspets dominate and vehicles we put in rushed and wrong recentlyit is a game for online game folks and not for star wars fansone observation people play this game very seriously if youre not that serious other players will make the game less fun for you
deliberatelyive played with a good group of folks but they seem to be the exception to the rule
i see folks ridicule others especially kids rather then helpgenerally very poor development and support from soe mimicking their other game planetside
i expect players to drop from swg soon in the way droves left planetside requiring servers to be merged and other problemsif you are a die hard fan or a kid whose parents are paying for everything  go for itotherwise you will get little bang for your buck other then some nice sounds hence the second star on a high end machineon a midend machine you will not even get that from what i hear
just frustrations and a lot attempts to tweak your system to get it to workif you are a parent this game is a money trapif you are a player youre going to be dissapointed and wish you had spent the money for your three months trying to get into the game on two other games jedi academy and knight of the old republic some to mindi should make one thing clear before i kick off this review i do not like mmorpgs
i have never played a mmorpg that i liked however i always go into these games with an open mind so understand that this is not mmorpg bias im basing this review onit had to happen sooner or later star wars as a mmorpg
i was very hyped up and very interested in this game for about  or  months
since i harbor such a strong dislike for ever quests i dismissed this game initially as eq in space but as i read on about all the features star wars would have i was generally intrigued
i bought the game on launch day and the disappointment began
the launch day problems were rampant which is to be expected of course since so many people were trying to get in that the servers were overloaded
i was able to finally register and log in about a day after i got the gamecharacter creation was decentyou can edit alot about the character from body type to facial construction
you choose from a few base classes and then go on from there to expand the class and branch off into a more advanced class such as bounty hunter or weaponsmith or commando
what is good about this is that you can take a little bit from every class and mix and match it to design your very own unqiue character
however level progression is very slow and it becomes necessary to teach your skills to others in order to progress
interesting concept if a little flawed
there are no jedis running around yet simply becuse the method of becoming a jedi is a secret which players have since discovered but it is still difficult to do
thankfully this limits the jedi population and keeps balanceas for the game itself it just wasnt really that interesting
the world is huge but devoid of life
lots of quests require you to hump your way all the way across the planet for pathetic rewards and little experience points
other quests require you to destroy objects like dirt mounds or junk piles which creatures spawn out of
whats bad is that these quests cannot possibly be undertaken alone since attacking one of these mounds causes a tremendous group of creatures to gang up on you and tear you to pieces and if you do manage to fend them off there are other creatures healing the object making your effort useless
there are some quests unique to sides if you join the imperials or rebels which is a decent change but its still the same find and kill soandso bring this item here etc
etcitems in the game are all made by players which is utterly ridiculous
there are no shops in the game at all except for one bazaar that holds player auctions
since everyone is making the same stuff the same items appear over and over
there are no unique items anywhere
one of the problems with this is that making weapons and armor is a career for some players
funny but that sounds like nothing more than a job to me
ill go to my real job if i want to be productive thanks
im sure many other players will begin to realize that too and the items in the game will start becoming scarcethe game is just very monotonous but i should expect no less from the makers of eq
sure its fun for the first few hours when youre exploring and getting familiar with everything but the experience degenerates quickly
when i got this game i was hoping to be surrounded by star wars nerds roleplaying their charactersbut i forgot that roleplaying is not allowed in mmorpgs
try roleplaying your character for one minute around other players and watch your text screen fill up with people screaming stp rle playing j nb
and garbage like that
hence the wow im in star wars feeling wears off extraordinarily quickthe realization that this is just another online game and the fact that no one cares that its star wars becomes evident quickly when you see players running around with names like potthead smokey or dobi smkr or lk skyywaalkrrr all of which were names i actually saw
its the idiots like that which completely take away from the game experience
you can barely understand what anyone is saying because everyone talks in  speech or whatever the popular term for it is among the little kids
overall i found the rampant childish behavior and boring pointless gameplay to be a huge turn off
i was off the game  days after getting it
i really really wanted to like this game but in the end the boring gameplay just got on my nerves and the immature players didnt particularly help much either
this game was clearly just very overhyped and i was extraordinarily disappointed
luckily i didnt get slapped with the rather high over  monthly fee since i was off the game in  daysif you want a great star wars role playing game then i suggest checking out star wars knights of the old republic for xbox or waiting for it to come to the pc
its a much better game and well worth the money
since galaxies doesnt really seem to qualify as a roleplaying game youre better off saving all the money you would waste on the hefty monthly fee
a nice try but im not impressed at all
just another runofthemill massive online game ruined by childish players and boring gameplaythis game sucks
you kill and kill and kill and kill and you never go anywhere
the player economy is a good idea but damn if its not hard to find people to buy really good stuff from
the quests never produce decent items and its still got too many bugs
as akbar said quotits a trapquotthis expansion mostly adds features that should have been included in the first release
every decent strategy game out there ships with multiplayeryou shouldnt charge more later for what should be included
a scenario editor also comes standard in many games these days
it cant be difficult to ship a scenario editor with the game
a few more civilizations
wow
great
woohoo
not worth the price
if this had the kind of innovative content that fantastic worlds had when it was released as an expansion to civ id look foreward to it
unfortunately it looks to be simply whats required to finish an incomplete gamewell i must say i was expecting much more
i was never a very hard core civ fan but do enjoy playing from time to time so i decided i might as well check out the expansion pack
but after reading the manual and playing for a few hours i began to think quoti just wasted  bucksquot
generally the problem was it just didnt add enough sure it has plenty of new civilizations but what i really wanted was lots of new wonders and units
instead it only had the new special civ units one normal new unit and one new wonder with a few extra small gameplay features thrown in such as the ability to move units in a stack
however i still was not satisfied with judging my buy as a failure so i decide to try out the main focus of the expansion pack online play
i entered to find only about  games all of which were in progress except for one
i joined and it turned out to be one of those game types were everyone finishes turns at different times
i was quite unhappy with the way it turned out everyone just rushing to finish their turns
after words i tried a normal turn based game which took about  hours until i decided to quitoverall the problem was i just dont think civ  was meant to be online and they just didnt add enough other features to make it interesting enoughthe first time i heard of this game i thought it was a must have
i thought it would be awesome to play as my favorite star wars character
in fact once i got a gamecube it was the first game i got
here are the pros and cons of star wars bounty hunterprosyou get to play as the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxyyou have all the weapons jango has in the moviesit has a good plotconslevels are way to long and hard
sometimes you dont even know what the heck you have to do to advancegraphics could use a little bit more workits only one player
this game would be awesome if you could play cooperativei would suggest renting this game before actually buying it to see if you like it or notthe game is ok now your thinking im a retard since i gave it  and said it was ok it is ok and the reason i gave it  was because it was slow with choppy graphicsfunbgraphics dexcitement blandscape coverall di dont recomend itin beta this game was great because it had pvp in it but when there were a few weeks left of beta they took out pvp
yes the pvp system was super buggy in beta but instead of trying to fix it they became lazy and just took it out which was a very bad mistake
no pvp means a boring game once you reach the highest level cause there really is nothing left to do other than kill monsters trade and talk to other players which easily gets boring
if you have love for pvp like me then get asherons call  or dark age of camelot though those games arent futuristic like this one they have extremely good pvp
if you only want to play futuristic mmorpgs then wait for star wars galaxies to come out
its funny if how they just left pvp in this game then i would have rated it  stars sadly they messed up because of their laziness
this is all i had to sayi beta tested i played i tested some more spoke out on the message boards along with s of others saying it was not ready
then to keep my ff account bought the game
they tweaked messed with and took away yet i stayed
now months down the line i have not played in weeks and it does nothing more then add to the endless amount of junk that comes out of ea as of late
the idea to the game the thought of the game and what the game is are very different
if you enjoy grouping if you like to be forced into having to play with others then you have yourself something you might get into
solo play is really not what this game is about so it does take away from the rpg side of it
the lag is very bad
i ran off cable and dsl both systems with different rates of speed still can not handle the lag that the servers are under
persona and ship creation are good but the bugs the camping and the other mindless problems with this game which should have been released months later then what it was put this game into the discount bin
dont pay to play this junk
other games are comming out that will hopefully add to what this game should have been
check out eb message boards look for yourself at what people talk about before you buy thisi have owned this game for a few years and thought i would pop it in and try it recentlyi remember why i shelved it nowit is a waste of time
the graphics are ok for the age of the game and the general idea behind the game is decent
but the game fails to deliversome things i see wrong with it and it is really a combination of  these that makes the single player boringaircraft are difficult to control and more effort than they are worth without a joystickmaps are unbalanced
playing strictly as one side they are either to easy or to hard
some maps are hard to beat even on the easiest setting
and some  you dont even need to play to win even on the hardest setting ticket point bleeding  you can reduce your opponents tickets by holding so many control points without ever killing them is stupid
what really does it for me is the stupid ai
if you had a decent ai it wouldnt be as bada ai is terrible and unbalanced
your side is stupid
sometimes they stand around they use bazookas on infantry they can barely take a control point without your help and it takes them forever to it
their accuracy is terrible
and one enemy will keep  dozen or more busy for over a minute
they are basically cannon fodder that steals all your vehicles and gets them blown upincreasing cpu time to ai solves the problem to a degree but it also makes the enemy ai a lot more difficult so  it is still unbalancedb the enemy ais are expert snipers with any weapon
i have been perched on a large hill sniping and got hit  from sniping distances with just about every enemy weapon but grenades
even the enemy planes can pick me off on the first pass with guns
the enemy ai is amazingly accurate even at distance
they are also crafty
they always know where you are and can always get behind you or sneak pass you and come up from behind and shoot you
they are much better organized and work together to take all the control points
ie all of your own ai will run to the same control point where they will spend anywhere from a minute to several trying to take it
the enemy ai will  head to different control points in small groups and capture several in quick succession
they will also grenade  your armor in a group and take it out quickly
whereas your own ai will not do this or manages to get killed before they even get closescenerios play out to fast
because of the constant ticket loss bleeding from one side or the other that almost always occurs games are short
you may only spend  of your time fighting
the rest of the time is spent getting to where the fight is and waiting on respawns
it doesnt really let you have a big effect on the outcome of the game
the biggest effect on the game is holding the right amount of control points to cause bleeding or stop your own
you will spend alot of time running around trying to do this
and as soon as you leave the control point  it will be taken over by the enemy again
which makes this a completely pointless task
it would be much better without ticket bleeding
then it would be based solely on kills to win winning by attrition a combo of the above really kills the game
and really lowers the replay value
you will probably find single player to be more annoying than fun bonus ea even fails at cheats
the godmode cheat for this game reduces your tickets to about  of  your normal starting tickets
since your almost guaranteed to bleed tickets within the first  minutes it makes for a very short game
it is sad when they even make god mode boring
i always use cheats after i get bored with the normal game  to add some extra spice
ea really failed with this games cheat codesnote later battlefield titles such as vietnam had improved game mechanics
and some of the problems here dont exist in the later titles
i suggest skipping this title and moving to a later title if you really want to try the battlefield seriesbattlefield single player no gore
a disturbing trend in ww games bloodless war
i guess we cant make our kids think war is cool and send them off to iraq if we let them see war as hell
 horrible enemy ai
either the bots cant see you and you can shoot them in the back as they run past you or they see you from so far away that they appear to be only a few pixels high right as they snipe your head off
it seems that the bots have a higher desire to get to the machine gun emplacements than to shoot a potential enemy
if you stand near some machine guns bots will run past you to get to the guns and then you can pop them in the head
 horrible ally ai
they refuse to push forward
you end up doing all the work with moving your team towards the next control point which means you get to die over and over from lack of support from your teammates
it also means you need to have a large number of bots set up to keep your control points defended
 no quotreloadquot feedback
there is absolutely no feedback to tell you that youre out of ammo
no click
no nothing
your weapon just doesnt fire
you also dont automatically reload when youre out which might be slightly more realistic but certainly doesnt increase the fun factor
you must keep your eye on the ammo counter at all times
 you can pick up different kits but you cant pick up additional ammo for your current weapon
you have to get to an ammo box
 domination type games only the only type of game you can play is domination where there are quotcontrol pointsquot that each team must control to gain or in this case lose points
there is no deathmatch capture the flag rabbit assault or any of the other game types that can be found in other multiplayer fpss
 battlefields only
there is no clearing buildings in bf
you will be fighting on an open battlefield in the outdoors
there are some simple buildings in berlin and stalingrad but the ai refuses to use them
the enemy will always be outdoors
 poor hit detection
ive fired several rounds into an enemy with a sniper rifle and i know ive hit them but hits arent registered
other times it takes two shots to kill them or one head shot
 impossible to fly planes
perhaps this is an acquired skill but i cant get the planes to do anything for me
i end up flying off the map or crashing i cant get anywhere near a target
the ai seems to use them well enough though
 some boats seem to be impossible to exit if youre on them by yourself
frustrating
 disappointing omaha beach map
not even closeafter a while you get used to these problems and the game can be fun with the correct difficulty settings for your battles
it takes a lot of experimentation but it really gets fun after you figure out how to set up the battle properly for the given map and you dont expect much from the ai
the graphics are usually excellent with some minor glitches here and there
 multiplayerevery time i try to play a multiplayer game i get an error message about receiving bad data
i can not join any internet servers
i suspect this is because i have the brand new  version and most other people havent upgraded yet
i have yet to try bf at the lanoverall
 stars
its fun but only after experiencing much frustration and disbelief at some of the poor choice in game design that were made
requires you to learn how to set up the battle parameters correctly to extract enjoyment out of iti tried reinstalling this some  years later to see how many people still play it and the sound for the guns didnt work with windows  ive uninstalled this and said its really time to move on
though if ea would remake this series i would buy thatthis game is great
probably the best game to ever hit the shelves but hope you have a killer pc with lots of ram good graphics card and memory
this game will be very jerky and laggy even on low settings
everything else on it is good the weapons and the vechiles are amazing
just hope you have a very good pcthe game designers did a good job creating a fun game but a huge number of technical issues make this game overly fustratingmy biggest gripe is the copy protection
in a brilliant move that transfers the burden of piracy from the software company to the end user ea uses a network key in addition to needing the original cd
i cant tell you how infuriating it is to try to jump into a game only to be kicked off by the message quotcd key in usequot
some pirate out there gets to play while i who paid for the game suffer the consequences
brilliant ea just simply brilliantbf currently version  is full of bugs
it will play for about  minutes and crash on me two or three times with no error message before i can get through a whole game
one of the included maps crashes on me constantly i have never been able to complete it
ea tech support is not much help either
they suggest running bf from a clean boot without running anything else before
this does help
if i run another game mcafee outlook or internet explorer before bf bf will crash constantly until i rebootthe menu system is horrid
the server browser has very little filtering no favorites and is locked to x
some of the ingame playerplayer options are even worse
if you want to add a player to your buddy list you have to open a text console type gamelistplayers scroll to find the player id number that matches your friends name then type gameaddplayertobuddylist 
then the the server loads a new map you have to do the whole thing over again
the voting interface is the same waywhen everything is working perfectly it is a fun game but youll need a beefy cpu gf or newer gfx card broadband and find a server with pleanty of bandwidth its fairly common to see players jumping around from lag
bf is definately a resource hogi played the demo before the game released and the framerate  on my geforce
then i finally picked it up because of all the hype and it still  ut rtcw and enemy territory run super smooth on my system with the res to x
and from what ive seen theyre more fun
and how can you have a wwii fps with no blood
i dont know how this pos got game of the year
its not all that
pick up wolfenstein or download enemy territory for the best wwii sim experienceso this is what we get after all these years of waiting
an updated version of duke nukem this game looks great it has the same duke nukem attitude but its watered down somewhat
the biggest problem with manhattan project is its rd person sidescrolling view just a terrible backwards idea
it would have been really cool if this game used ravens ghoul ii engine as it stands you need a magnifying glass to see all the action in this game
the save game feature needs some work too why do programmers want to restrict where and when i can save my game
that is very annoying
and if you think you get a lot of weapons to play with think againplus the strippers in the game dont strip like in the previous duke nukems what a ripoffduke nukem manhattan project is a d sidescroller and is the fourth duke nukem game
you as duke nukem must save the planet from the mutants and their cybrog leader
i played the game in the opengl video mode and it runs great directd is also available
it is the best looking sidescroller i have ever played the graphics and sound are great
the single player is quite dissappointing the game is not very long and it is mostly shoot everything that moves and the puzzles are just find the key card
there is nothing new between the levels and it is not a hard game besides the boss in the seventh episode the rest of the game was easy
duke nukem manhattan project is disappointingthis review is mostly for those of you like me that dont have a gamepad for your computer
using the keyboard for this game is just plain awful
i rated this a  because the graphics are solid the sound effects are good the music is rockin and the tutorials that help you learn the game from intercepting passes to kicking are great
but the gameplaying is not
trying to use a keyboard for this game is not a good idea
you can reconfigure the keys but there are so many different buttons to use that i can not come up with a good solution other than to buy a gravis gamepad
the other thing that is annoying was that on defense even if i am playing with  guys in coverage the other team always seems to have a wide open receiver
i have never had a wide open reciever yet even when i have  guys in pattern and they are playing a run defense
every receiver seems to be double covered no matter which one i throw too
and there never seems to be running room either
it might just be the control issue which hopefully will be taken care of when my gravispad comes
if so i will write another review then
but for right now i am not impressed with the gameplayonce again i have been duped into buying a game based upon the advice of socalled consumer reviews only to discover that the game fails to live up to the hyperbole
lets be brutally honest praetorians is a game which is marketed to appeal to the medieval total war fans but delivers a product more akin to age of empires
if you are about seven years old andor have a basically juvenile sense of wonder then surely this game was tailor made for you
with the exception of the even more awful platoon pc game this has to rate as my biggest gaming disappointment to date
the pundits for this mediocre yawner glory over the fact that the game has no resource management thus freeing you up to do lots of scrapping
this is basically true but on the down side the maps are so badly designed that manouvering units in anything other than a gaggle is practically impossible
units will often blunder into one another and become entangled this is not conducive to a happy gaming experience and the battle has not even been joined yet
but this is pretty much the essence of the game
it bottlenecked mapsforce you into waging war between individual units rather than the grand battles of the ancient kingdoms which were set piece affairs on open ground
units are created in villagestowns which sounds fine but once again we are dealing with an abstract depiction  a few huts and structures surrounded by a simplified pallisade and peopled by a few sprites which bustle about to simulate an occupation of sorts
oh did i mention that this villagetown is just slightly larger than a unit of infantry
must have slipped every reviewers mind i guesseven creating units is a puzzlement
just create a barracks and then instruct your leaders to train this or that and voila there they area couple of minutes later
although some units require that your leader sacrifice honour points to createoh did i forget to mention that must have slipped my mindhonour is won in the slaying of enemies
in short there is an artificiality pervading the game which rather than enhancing gameplay reduces it to a farce
the ai prefers to operate with a mob mentality  so much easier than trying to reproduce the model of efficiency and coordination which was the roman legionary system
unlike the total war series which relies upon maps with realistic terrain praetorians has opted for an even more simplified version of age of empires the original one at that
even the camera view is severely limiting because you can only see in line of sight which is not very far in this abstract representation of the real world
the map is revealed  not blacked out thank heaven for small mercies
pulling the camera back to take in anything more than a top down view of a small area is impossiblepretty much like playing the game
this even extends to the lack of ability to angle the camera  something i havent seen in a game like this since i dont know when
pc gamers deserve so much more than a retro update on a much worn out formula given the relative expense of a new purchase   or more for most including this one
in mere value for the dollar i would be hard pressed to say that at half the price i paid for it  that it is a worthwhile purchase
i could go on but just move along folks  nothing to see herei must admit this is my first exposure to the tomb raider franchise
i know it is very popular and i was looking forward to it
quite frankly if things have been this bad all along im not sure where the popularity comes fromthe scenery and graphics are pretty and the camera generally does what its supposed to
but the controls are absolutely terrible
there is no strafe move left  move right function you can only turn and move either forward or backward and there is no freelook
the mouse is practically useless
the control lag is unbearable
if you bring the character to a stop it takes  seconds before you can get her moving again
turning goes ever so slowly
jumping and maneuvering is so bad that its much more difficult just to get the character to move about than it is to play the game itself
frustration ought to be in the task at hand in the game  not getting the controls to do what you wanteven accounting for the fact that this game is  years old compared to other games of that time this game does not measure up in any wayi realize that thirdperson games are difficult to do well but this game is just plain bad
there are far too many games available  then and now st and rd person and of all different types  that combine great balance and control with great environments
as an avid gamer i must strongly suggest against this game dont waste your time or your money
buy a pizza and get far more enjoyment out of ithowever to be fair i cant speak for the folks who are immersed in the tomb raider franchise
they may be inclined to look more forgivingly upon the atrociously bad controls and glitches in this gameeven on easy this game is way too hard
every pass i throw gets intercepted and every rushing play becomes a loss
this game is a reason to get anger management classes
i have never played a more frustrating game in my life
plus midway treats football like a prowrestling match
it is extremely annoying to have that factored in to an already horrible game
if you want a good football game get madden   this game is just horriblewarning this game is not for kidsunreal  for the xbox is a first person shooter fps game
you play a space marine named john dalton
you travel with your small crew of bounty hunters to different planets securing alien artifacts
the alien artifacts are believed to be parts of a super weapon
everyone wants the weapon including power hungryaliens
unreal  is very similar to the famous game quothaloquot but it lacks the intensity and polish of halo
they even included some levels where you fight alongside space marines but the ai
is not very impressive
everything in this game is just average
i felt bored in many of the levels because they required too much walking in an empty world and no action taking place
the voice acting is terrible
the actors sound like amatures reading the scriptprosgood controlsaverage graphicsaverage sound effectslots of weaponslong gameconshalo ripofflong loading timesno coop gameplaytoo much walkingseverly scriptedlacks excitementretarded voiceactingjohn dalton sounds like a dorkmiserable game that uses atrocious checkpoint type saves since the designers apparently lack the imagination it takes to make the game challenging otherwise
this is even worse than most games that use checkpoints due to lack of creativity in that it can set you back very far in your progress
beyond that there are several other aspects that make this game pretty crummythe story and characters are almost like something from one of those made for tv scifi movies
there is the sensitive but tough main character  the hot almost super hero type chick in a sexy outfit with a bad attitude  an alien companion who is there just so that there is an alien companion  and the weeny little mechanic that shows that he can still contribute despite being a spineless geekthe enemies are much less impressive than most other games of this type and seem to run around wildly sometimes for no other purpose than to be a rapidly moving target
and i dont mean this in the tactical way either
they just run back and forth like idiotsalthough there are gobs of weapons none of them are really impressive except for maybe the grenade launcher
and when playing games like this on a console too many weapons can sometimes become a paini have not tried the online game for this and from what i understand that is all most unreal games are worth in the first place
what makes the single player even more disappointing is that a lot of the things available for the online game are not available such as vehicles and even the ability to runthe upshot is unless you want it for the online game or you really like doing the same thing over and over again via brainless checkpoint saves avoid this gameyes folks its sad but true but this game is a very poor port of the pc version
i wonder how the programers could waste the potential this game had on a machine that delivered us a firt gen game like halo
i was excited about this game although even the pc version is a less than fantastic game i kind of liked it
than comes the time for the xbox version and what a disappointment
the graphics are a mere shadow of the pc version
like the other reviewer said the cutscenes are terrible i couldnt beliave my eyes
the graphics are bad for even those who never played the pc version
not that i dont think that xbox can recreate the graphics of the pc version because a machine that can deliver us games like halo and the wonderful pc port of return to castle wolfenstein certainly can do that
ok the graphics are bad but the gameplay is still good right
wrong it feels like the programers didnt pay much attention in porting the gameplay to the xbox control because its very jerky
at least the sound is still good but thats it
i am a huge xbox fan and i had high hopes for this game but all i can say is to avoid itin my opinion sly cooper is the best platform next to mario but dont get too excited because its still a platform
sly cooper looks great and makes good use of the cel shaded graphics
thats probably the best part of the game
the game can be more looked at as a platform on a rail or a combination of d and d
if you have played crash bandicoot you get the idea
in fact sly cooper probably uses an upgraded version of the crash bandicoot engine
the gameplay has a lot of new additions but for anyone who has played crash bandicoot the gameplay will seem very familiar at some pointsthe game has five different worlds each is introduced as an entirely d environment but thats just deceiving
your real goal is to find the doors in which you will enter a mission and be forced to complete a linear dd railed obstacle course
its a little more creative than crash bandicoot where you literally where in a portal room and each of the missions had a door with a label on it
the objective of each world is to gather all the keys that lay in that world
you collect the keys by passing the linear obstacle courses obviously
once you have collected all the keys of that world you can now use them to gain access to the boss of that world
then you beat the boss and move on the next world
think crash bandicoot again only you actually see yourself inside of a van and you see your progress on a map in a cartoon like cut scene this indicates your in the process of traveling to the new world
in crash bandicoot the portal room just moved up to a new floor with all new missions againthe game has awesome graphics and very good dialog
the cut scenes are literally cartoon quality
at times you will feel like your actually playing a cartoon
the game has a story line its a rather weak one but i thought it was surprisenly mature
the story starts off by sly cooper giving you a history briefing about how his whole family was killed by some thugs the night his families jewel quotthe thievious raccoonusquot was stolen
since then hes been on a mission to get it back
i dont remember the last time anyone was killed in the story line of a mario gamei love the sly cooper series but i must say this is my least favorite
the graphics are poor and getting keys get boring after a while
the most fun part is the driving games with the cooper getaway van
cant wait for sly cooper thieves in timei played nfl k before but i gave madden a chance with the  rosters
madden has more features like old school teams practice drills card trades etc but if you just want to play with your buddies on or offline nothing beats the tackles and hustles of sega nfl k series
the tackling is hard in madden theres no slamming or effect on the tackle
its plain
i still cant figure out the audiblein sega nfl k you just press a button to call an audible and a list of optional plays will be displayed for you to choose
in madden nothing appears i guess you are expected to know the sequence of play from the controller buttonsthis is the last time im buying maddenmulti platform games arent good and this is just another example of the same thing for the last  years of madden
graphics are ok but not breathtaking
it seems the only thing that sells this game anymore is the name personally i think everyone should take a stand and quit buying this cookie cutter game
let someone else show what they can do for a while like segawell i played roller coaster tycoon  and couldnt get enough of it
the game play in the roller coaster tycoon series has a feel to it much like any simulation game in that you must try your best to keep some form of balance working in the place you are given
building coasters and then watching people ride them alone with trying to keep your park clean and full of other rides attractions and shops keeps you glued to the screen for hoursthat being said this game really is not much improvement on the first one
the graphics are now even more dated then ever
you cant get a very big close up on the people in the park and that makes things a bit more dull
also the only real improvements i can see is the new scenery which doesnt make much difference in the park rating and the fact that some of the rides are based on rides from six flagsone problem is that if your park has been designated as a payatthedoor park you can not charge a dime for the rides even if you want to
and as stated before the graphics of the game play has not changed at all which makes the game seem like more of an expansion pack to roller coaster tycoon  then it does a new gameso in closing while the game isnt that great if you have twenty bucks to blow and are as addicted to the first one as i am go ahead and get it
otherwise dont bother
i am curious to see if roller coaster tycoon  if they make one will be more entertaining then this gameif youve never played the rollercoaster tycoon series than by all means quickly buy the sequel because its probably one of the most enjoyable games ever
it has a simple concept behind it yet the game keeps you hooked for months
if you love designing and creating this is the game for you as its basically a laymans theme park builder
for those that did play the first game i have a small warning for you  unless youre hopelessly addicted to the first game and its many expansions you probably wont get much out of the sequel
its almost a carbon copy of the first game
some of the rollercoaster building mechanics have changed there are new attractions and you can now play on maps that are realistic portrayals of the popular six flags theme park chain
other than that everything is the same even the graphics which are usually the first thing to get updated in a sequel dont look any different
my recommendation for anyone that is the patient type and wishes to buy this game is to wait a month or two
there are already two expansions for the sequel
games like these are quickly packaged into bargain combo packs and i imagine it wont be long before both expansions are available with the original game at a low pricenothing really new
the first one was better
just new items thats it
the same sounds from the original
and yes if that freakin kid still whines from the first one
wait for the rd version to come out
save your moneythe only thing cool is the new  flags rollercoasters
gets old quicklydont buy this game if youre looking for a totally updated version
its not
its really just an expansion pack  a good one unlike loopy landscapes and the other one which didnt really add much
i really think that you shouldnt label a game part  unless you completely redo the interface plot or some other major part of the game
this was just some nice add ons and tweakingi loved eui and ii and thought that this game would continue the progression of those games
i have been mostly disappointed so far
the ai is very weak the game logic is lacking in many departments diplomacy is one of them and the game is buggy
once you get the basic hang of the game it is not possible to lose as the usa germany britian or russia
havent played italy or japan yet
the minor nations are playable but not worth playing really  i tried playing nationalist spain and turkey and it was boring  i do not really see much replayability in the game except to the extent that you can vary your technological research and get different weaponry to achieve your ultimate goal  world conquest
i just felt that the real depth that i associated with the europa universalis games is lacking here
maybe more will be done with the game as time progresses and maybe the players will mod the game as well but at the moment its going to end up sitting unplayed in its cd case because i think i have really done all thats worth doing with the game
save your money until its upgraded some or until there is a hoi i have this game and only beat castlevania   it is not worth playing because there is nothing to unlock
so dont buy it unless you like bad unmodern graphicsthis is a great colection of games but the fact that you need to have the disc in just to play them is stupid
these are s nes games
its better to play these games as roms with an emulator becasue you can improve the graphics customize the controls lighting or anything you want with ease
plus with an emulator you can run the games in a window or full screen not like this piece of crap package
the two stars are for the great games in this package but the way they were packaged with this lame software sucksfirst off let me just say that i had a great time playing gta  it was a game that could make you do things that you would never dream about doing in your life making you belive you really were a person who did all sorts of underhanded and disatstourous things in liberty city just so you could make cash and stay out of trouble with other gangs
the missions were varied and long the locations of and around the city were very detailed the weather effects were spectacular and it was very hard to put the game down after youd already been playing it for two days
it was the game that shoked the world and brought forth a new gaming era for more mature playersunfourtunatley grand theft auto vice city is almost identiacal to the rd in the series
this could be a good and bad thing for all players let me explainif someone is new to the series they can master vice city just like someone could with the rd game
needless to say that the city in this game is completley different it feels more like and expansion pack rather then a fresh new gameto back this up in vice city there are all of the things that you wish you could do in the rd
for insance you can go into buildings fly more planes and helicopters drive motorcycles and scooters and have a whole new arsenal of weaponry
this sounds cool rightwrongeven though these perks are interesting to the game they just dont make you feel like you are playing a whole new gamealso everything is set in the s from the clothes to the cars to the radio songs which are all real songs from the sdont worry there are still some halarious commercials adn fun mini games to find hidden across the cityand about the missions and graphics
for this game rockstar north has hired real actors that have stared in a variety of movies do the voices for your bosses in the game
this is pretty cool because the cutscenes sound so proffesional
yet the missions in the game are not as fun to play or as varied in styles which can really seem repetive
however the graphics are in a way a let down
there are great lighting effects in the game but the buildings inside and out dont look as grand as in the rdto wrap things up vice city sounds like a fresh and new idea with everything youve come to love and respect about videogames and in a way it is
this game would be great for someone new to the series or for people who dont care if its almost exactally like the rd beside the various perks that make it seem like and expansion packbut for those of you looking for a groundbreaking new game in the grand theft auto series you wont find it hereim a little late to the game because i just got my ps a year ago
it is impossible to rate vice city without comparing it to gta   gta  was immediately engaging the story was cool and the city was interesting enough to actually want to explore and look around for secret items powerups etc
without having to resort to cheat codes for everyting
i must have played gta  for over  hours easily and it never got oldso i now finally got around to playing vice city and it was instantly disappointing
despite what other reviewers have said i think the graphics in vice city are horrible
everything is so ugly to look at and the graphics are so choppy it almost hurts my eyes to look at it
besides lousy graphics the city is really uninspired theres nothing engaging or interesting about exploring vice city
almost right away i thought well okay maybe cheat codes will help
but even with codes the game still sucks
the physics are terrible as well whenever you try to punchattack a pedestrian youll find yourself flailing away almost aimlessly because the physics dont make any sensei dont know what else i can say about vice city it just seems like a really bad mod of gta  and i dont understand what all the hype is about
maybe san andreas will be better since it took rockstar two years to release instead of rushing to market with gtavc
if you must play this game just rent it and dont waste your  yes it was that badprosbigger louder blah blah blahconsgraphics horriblelevelcity design uninspired and lamephysics very poorframerate choppiest game ive played on psi wouldnt play this game if it was freethe game is fun yet its sick and twisted at the same time
its scary to think pulling some guy out of a car and beating him to death with a bat could be fun or blowing off a hookers head with a combat shotgun
im in my thirties so i know this crap is make believe
i am not that sure some of these kids out there are that smart to understand that
kids now a days do some sick and twisted stuff like go on killing sprees at school
the game is fun to me but i totally think its warping the minds of our youth so i will only give it a  for an overall rating but a  for the fun factorgtavice city is great but vice city stories is nothing compared to the others
in this game you play as a radom black military guy and isnt talked about in vice city
overall this is a bummer and i love the regular vice citybut on a console it really loses somethingcompared togta vice city this game is simply an inferior copy
one of the great improvements fromgrand theft auto iiito vc was its licensed soundtrack
also to comparegrand theft auto liberty city storieshad most of the original gta radio with a few new songs and a new channel
for this game they only kept the worst vc channel the latin channel and nearly all the new music outside of maybe two songs is awfulthe gta series has never really been about the story but the laughably bad cut scenes fall flat in this one
it doesnt help that the voice acting is terrible and the characters are almost all annoying onedimensional stereotypesvice city had a number of things like the full map or motorcycles which the original gta did not
so gtalcs with those improvements was a better game
in this game you can swim but it isnt a huge part of the game
honestly this isnt really much of an improvement
if anything the fact that it originated on the psp means that it has a much worse engine than the original ps gamesjust go back and play the original vice city dont listen to this storyim a huge gta fan and always wanted to own all the gta games
i regret getting this one though its insanely boring
just stick to san andreas and gta  or preorder gta vok i do admit when grand theft auto  came out for ps i thought it was the best game ever
but i mean after a while it gets really boring
the loading is slow in the beggining the missions are ridiculosly hard
and the game has quite of a crapy story
i mean after a while of killing people and getting chased by copscmon
what ever happen to people getting addicted to classic games like mario and zelda
now hiphop has taken over the world
i mean the real fun thing is the radio because kchat is fu funny
but after the chainsaws and boozucas it gets boringim glad that in the prequal they put mortocycles
but then the new prequal san an dreas which is taking place in the s they should come out with games that take place in the present
i meant this ones cool and all because they tried to make it look like scarface but cmonin the prequal for the radio there better be some sex pistols the clash the ramones or at least the misfits
dont but this game unless your an idiotthis gam is on of the mos violent games i have ever played and is not reccomended for chilred under  but i was  when i played this game at a freinds house and liked it for a while the weapons are great and it was a great way to relive stress
by going on a mass killing spree
but this game i not as much fun as one would think
but it it deserves the rating it reciviedhello its me again the expert game player
i dont know why many people like this game
first it takes place in vaction city i mean how boring is that
you are driving through churches and schools
but it is kinda fun to steal the popemobile and run over popes and priests
the soundtrack is a little weird like youve got kumbiyah and john denver songs
im gonna conquer vatical city now
goodbye alli did not like this game at allthe only reason i gave it a instead of a is because its based in vice citybut i thought the storyline and the main character was lamei would say pass this upand stay with the original vice cityits alot bettervice city is basically gta with s music and a more involving storyline thrown in
in fact if you took away the s music i think most people would agree that there really arent enough new gameplay elements to justify an entire new gamethis shouldve been a gta expansion pack or more accurately grand theft auto  on sale for after loving monkey ball one me and my girlfriend decided to pick up monkey ball  hoping for the same addicting gameplay on such party games as monkey target and monkey bowling but with a few more stages and such
what we got was a game that somehow totally ruined the franchise
monkey target all of a sudden requires no skill they basically throw points at you and  players going at once
sounds good but it just makes the huge stages harder to see
monkey bowlings still god though right
no
all of the monkeys now bowl drastically differently meaning that if you liked gongon in monkey ball one you now will have to pick a totally different character to bowl like you want to
oh and the one player story mode let me just barf now
amazingly kiddy ish it might as well have been designed by  years olds who like bright colors and the word poo
pick up monkey ball one and leave this sad try at a sequal in the bargain bini was looking forward to this game so bad that it was all i could think about for days before it came out
well i was greatly dissapointed
the graphics are blah at best
the game play is choppy and bumpy
the xbox processor can do much better than this
when are game designers going to utalize the xboxs true potential
this game looks like junk and is not funthis makes me sad
i really wanted to like it
rent it firstthe game has great potential but it just falls short
great physics welldetail classic cars and decent graphics werent enough to save this release
my main problems are firstly that the tracks seemed to be created at random 
meaning that they just didnt make any sense placing corners here and there just for the sake of having turns
whoever created this title probably hasnt ever seen an actual track
even as something as simple as a racing oval was screwed up by having the pitting area on the backside instead of the front straightaway a moot point however as there is no pitting in this game
on top of that there are only eight tracks or so and all of them quite short
second the game can be finished within a day or so
there is about twenty events but you seem to be doing the same ones over and over again to make enough money to buy different cars
all of them which need to be upgraded to even have a chance at winningas i said not terrible
but when one becomes used to benchmark titles such as gran turismo  project gotham racing and rallisport challenge its hard to accept a seemingly casual effort like this onewhen need for speed hot persuit  failed to deliver i turned toward the xbox sega gt  after  straight hours of playing this game in the store i was hookedhowever when i bought the xbox and came home with the game i found that after many more hours of play the game can become very very frustrating
once inside career mode you can buy a cheap car and upgrade it for a slight performance difference
once youve won a few races you can buy other cars or maybe you want to play in the official racesthe official races were a complete mistery to me and after getting my b licence i wish i would have never played them
all the licences seem to do is make the difficulty go up as well as the cash for winning a race
however the rate at which difficulty goes up is not matched by the money
by the time you hit b licence youll find the cpu cars shooting way ahead of you from the beginning of the race and cornering at speeds youd never be able to even though they may have the same car as you with the same specs
this is a very cheap way of making the game harder
the worst part about it is once you gain licences your screwed and cant go back to old licences difficulties unless you start overone thing that you learn early in this game is that research doesnt help much
after researching the best car to buy out of all the cars available for  price range i found that the camero was the best buy
sure enough it ran well in the races about as well as any of the other carsoh and did you know damage is inexistant
no damage modeling in this game what so ever atleast none that i can see
the only form of damage is a meter in the top right of the screen that says how much health the car has left before you hit max damage
what max damage means i have yet to find out since you can race with max damage on just as well as you can with perfect health
also physics are pretty nill when it comes to bumping around with other cars
bumping against another car will make your health go down just as fast as if you plow straight into a wall
yet the car still appears to be untouchedin short i was ready to chuck my new xbox out the window the day after i bought it because of this gamehowever if you are able to look past these problems you will find beautiful graphics and a fair sound track
the game interface is only mediocreyet i pledge my word that on the money i spent on this system i will attempt to see only the good side of this game in which case this game is a small piece of heaven very very smallsowscarfacewill try to avoid repeating whats already been said but quothitman quot mostly hits the right marks but there are numerous times when it feels more like a chore or task than a video game when slogging through the levels  it lacks the tension that exists in such stealth games as tenchu or metal gear solid
an overarching reason for the lack of tension aside from the levels themselves is the main story line the various levels have little to no connection to s main goal to find his padre
why travel all over the world performing numerous missions when his main mission should be just trying to find his religious father
as the amazoncom review states the enemies ai at times is seemingly nonexistent you can walk beneath ninjas up in the rafters without them even turning a head to look down at you as you walk on by
and the game gives more than enough saves to easily make it through levels
some levels are a study in frustration where you spend a lot of time running from one location to another sneaking in one place to yet another and then maybe back again only to commit a blunder such as walking into a room missing an enemy target and then getting killed  or getting hit by an unseen sniper far off in the distance and then have the fun of doing it all over again
its not a bad game but playing it you dont feel like youre part of the world  inhabitsthis isnt a good game
when i opened the box and saw a cd and a slip of paper that was the manual i had a feeling i was in for some disappointment
however i still held out hope that maybe the game itself was great
it wasnt
the game throws you into the mix without any intruction or tutorial and you are left wondering what to do
i took a look at the box again just to make sure it wasnt a puzzle game
the game basically wants the player to figure everything out with trial and error
give this a passno it isnt
not even close
bland story decent gameplay subpar graphics
its not as emmersive as halo ever was
and compared to te red faction series this game isnt even close
nice level editor and multiplayer though i wish it was onlinetime splitters  is one of the most anticipated sequels to a first person shooter that i can remember
i played the first game and was impressed by it
the multiplayer was one of the best to date and the overall game was really good
not unbelievable but good
now we have time splitters  and i am a fan of the first person shooter
its not my favorite type of gameplay but i do like it and i also like it when companies who develop first person shooters do their best to try and mix the style and game play up a bit
it isnt that ts isnt uniqute because it is and its actually pretty cool going through time and venturing into all those far and away lands
the real problem here is well the game is just too damn hard to enjoy
this coming from someone who has beaten devil may cry and metal gear solid on its hardest levels
the first level in siberia and the atom smasher level are two of the hardest mission i have ever played in my video game history
it took me  hours to beat siberia and  yes thats right  hours to beat the atom smasher level
so as i finished up ts i realized that for just being a first person shooter with a lot of cool guns this game is not worth recommending
buy and play it if you wish if not go for red faction  or agent under firethere are some points id like to make clear before i go any further
one its now  so its been a while since this was released
two i only tried singleplayer story mode before stopping more later
three i loved ts future perfecti definitely seem to be in a different corner from other reviewers
generally people love this game
after  levels of singleplayer mode i realized it was piing me off more than providing funlooks arent a problem
unless your a graphics fetishist theres nothing to complain about how it looks even today
not too blocky nice environments smooth frameratethe problem for me arises in the actual gameplay
first i hate aiming with my thumb and prefer a fixed site that moves with you until you choose a zoom sight for say a rifle
this sight is hard to zero in with and almost impossible to use on a moving target
choose not to use aiming mode and who knows where your shots will land
if youre happy thumbing it then it wont be a problem for youbut over and over i found the missions played on medium difficulty to be obnoxious
the save system sucks big time and you too often find yourself playing an entire level over and over again if you mess up
there are checkpoints here and there but you lose them if you have to quit
i dont always want or have the time to play through an entire level
granted they arent horribly long but im the type of player who likes to take his time and look around
if youre the blowthroughasfastasican type it might not be a problem for you
i just put it away in frustration after getting tired of failing several times for no apparent reason on the rd mission the rescue the girls from zombies onethats about the gist of it for me
with other reviews being so glowing it may be that i just dont fit the game
or maybe having played future perfect first ruined it for me
still that doesnt remove the frustration factor from this one
sad that since as i said at the beginning i absolutely love love love future perfect
that game really has it all
if you havent played either this or future perfect i strongly recommend fp but you might want to rent this one if you can find it or buy it very cheapno strategy in this game at
units have horrible pathing and no sort of structure
no support units of any type means it is a rush to build the big bad quick and hope you simply outdamage your enemy
it also has its own rush for resources which is lame
coal stacks are never enough
perhaps battle realms spoiled me with the living resource model but these coal piles deplet way to fast which means you just have to expand and land grab quick every game once again no strategy
awful game with a great idea
could stand to use to a sequal if they actually put in some content rather than that tepid single player campaign which is so insanely dumbed down to get a t rating
the online part of this game is really bad the matching room is a massive step down from things like aom and even red alert it is also incredibly laggy and just a rush for resourcesthe graphics are ok but otherwise i wouldnt buy this game bummer
i already did
i hope this is not what we have to look forward too in homeworld this is not the same as playing magic in real life
if you already have a huge collection of real cards like me you will have to start all over and pay for a bunch of quotvirtualquot cardsget the magic the gathering interactive encyclopedia if you can even find it i suspect wizards phased it out to make people buy this
it lets you play online and use any cards you want  even replicate your real life deck or improve itthe encylopedia does not implement the rules so you need to make sure you play with people who know them
otherwise its much better than thisi cant believe this game
i paid money canadian and when i played it i found out that you have to buy your game cards online
basically your wastingbucks so that you can play a very basic demo unless you are willing to pay moneyus for each virtual deck
there are a few up points in this game the avatars are cool backrounds add a nice touch and so do sounds
but really i hope i can get my money back for this phony gameid have to say if the cards were included in the game i would rate this game a  or  but paying for more on top of the game is just dumbi mean come on this game should be free
you should get it for free then pay for the cards hey it makes sense huh
i cant believe im stuck with something i cant usesyberia is a textbook case for beauty in games but its gameplay really leaves a lot to be desired
not only is the game over too soon but it is far too easy and the puzzles are boring
the characters are fine but the attempted development and maturation of the main character kate walker really was not particularly welldonethe games main problem is that the pointandclick interface just really doesnt work out in this case
the screens are too expansive and kate too small and slow running or not to keep the gameplay interesting and again the puzzles are just not particularly thoughtprovokingnone of this changes the fact though that you will want to explore this beautiful world simply for the reward of seeing everything
its just too bad the gameplay didnt reach the bar the graphical design raisedthe broken sword series marked my entry into the adventure game genre for as a mostly console gamer i ignored a large number of classic pc titles
those games and the longest journey got me hooked and so i thought id check out syberia which seemed to offer much of the same formulabut that common formula of obscure puzzles and prerendered backgrounds was about all that syberia had shared with those classics
the games plot  which in all adventure games is the makeorbreak factor  is completely underwhelming
perhaps it is unfair to compare syberia to broken sword or tlj instead of evaluating it independently but there is really very little substance to this game no matter how you look at itin fact it is only by virtue of a storyline that adventure games often frustrating mechanics and obscure puzzle solutions are even tolerable
without a story an adventure game  much like syberia  is quite unfulfillingi have enjoyed adventure games in the past in particular lucas arts titles like grim fandango and the monkey island series
the positive on this game is that it is beautifully illustrated
but the puzzles and rather simpleminded
the story line is fairly interesting but it also seems to be striving to present some political correctness
your character is young women who is an attorney
i think the creators are trying to make you think of your character as becoming more independent as the story goes along but this is done mostly through conversations you have on your cell phone with your mom and your boyfriend neither of whom do you actually meet in the game
also i expect more from the music of such an artistic game
having said all that i probably will buy the sequel that is plannedthis is one of the few xbox titles i got rid of before completing the game
it just isnt worth a lot of playtime when there are many many more well made interesting games than this one
i guess i should be more specificgraphics  mediocre
monsters buildings etc
appear very two dimensional
bloodrayne looks hot in a skintight catsuit but that is intersesting for about  minutesgameplay  mediocre to poor
method of jumping shooting changing weapons is unatural and awkwardstory  goofy
that about sums it upi definately would not buy this game
as a rental may be fun for a couple of daysi find this game to be okay i am not crazy about the camera and controller setup
i think blood rayne ii makes great improvements in these areasi bought this mostly because i am a fan of blood rayne i wish the movies had been better
i wanted more insight on raynes beginningsso i bought it more so for brand loyalty
i think the game is okay but the second one is much betterblood rayneblood rayne i imagined this game to be kain from blood omen transported to mohfrontline and the gameplay isnt far from it though its a bit grossersexier
to watch bloodrayne grind on her victims as she drinks their blood than it is to watch kain
however while mohfrontline and blood omen i  ii all offered good storylines bloodrayne is ridiculously lacking in that capacity agent bloodrayne must go after  her vampire rapist father who is in league with nazis in  after having watched her mentor get eaten by a huge parasite that was created by a nazi in cahoots with a cajun witch in louisiana psssssssssi think they stole this plot from a stephen seagal flickthe graphics varie greatly from part to part
bloodrayne herself is rendered beautifully but many of the enemies look like they stepped out of a fps from ps
also the difficulty varies alot from place to place which can be annoying the first boss is pretty difficult but then you get a bunch of cake opponents to fight for a pretty long time
i was also dissapointed that the gameplay does not really involve stealth at all seeing as how your supposed to be an agent infiltratingnazi compounds and such
however this game has so many problems that the fact that nazis wait dumbly in their rooms while a crazy rambo inspired vampiress goes on a loud killing spree is the least of a gamers worriesif playing as a hot chick that slurps blood is your thing then i recommend this game
if vampires are your thing then get blood omen ii or soul reaver ii
if playing as a hot chick is your thing get drakan the ancient gates or wait for the new tomb raider
if fighting nazis is your thing get mohfront lineverdict wasted moneythis was the first blood rayne for the ps
it has good graphics controls sound and music
the graphics are low budget
the controls are a little stiff
the sound is great and so is the environmentsblood rayne takes place during world war   rayne is half human  half vampire
she has plenty of weapons to use against the evil vampires
rayne wants revenge against her father for killing her human mother and family
she has a cool attitude and very optimistic
you can kill the enemy a number of ways
sucking their blood chopping off limbs with your blades and shooting them
plenty of moves to learn
there are boss battles along the way
some are easy and others are plain toughthe sequel was the best between the two
blood rayne  had more moves abilities weapons etc
pick that one insteadrated middle of the roadthis game has many clever elements like a game where a wave of zombies is entering this house you are not allowed to leave it and must blast zombies as they enter the room from different doors
the effect is like being able to play around inside a romero horror film to a certain degree
graphically this is an arcadelooking game but its focus is more on its difficulty than story character graphics guns modes or anything elsei am disappointed in the music the title screen techno is pretty nice but mostly the music is either unimpressive repetitive techno or something like danny elfman run through a computer
when youre shooting up zombies and aliens subtlety is not needed
ideally the music should have gotten your blood pumpingwhat i really enjoyed was the level designs some are far betterworse than others
you can go to notre dame and s chicago a perfect dark reference
right next to each other
however i never knew why i was doing whatever i was doing or why and how im able to move through time or change genders as it was more left to the imagination because theres no intro cinema scene
so obviously the characters and story meant nothing to me i didnt have a reason to want to get further in the game beyond seeing new level graphics
the levels themselves are nice but seem more like a wide hamster tunnel than detailed realistic full areas
there are plenty of areas that lead to nowhere and wasted space
theres just not enough to do in a level like the dam to want to go back to play it again and again like goldeneye  moving through the endless repetitive layers of stairs simply on a higher difficulty level w more objectives doesnt thrill mei liked the more bizarre characters but most are military oldfashioned or zombies  theyre all in a tacky cartoonish style baggy pants gargantuan breasts pvc suits and so on in lame psquality models
if you like aliens plasma weapons black leather guns that take up  of your screen techno music futurist settings and so on this should be a hit
i alternated between accepting the game on its goofy terms and wishing it were either more serious goofy or just plain better executed
its fun while it lasts but the biggest kicks i got was from the absurdity references to perfect dark when its hardly anything like either of those games you wont play it nearly as much  more like quake and graphics for levels
i do actually enjoy this somewhat but if this is the best fps of  vgame genres could use a cerebral revolutionary bathim a huge fan of rpgs no matter the genre age or system
i couldnt get into hack at all
i found it bland boring and uninteresting
i might check out the second series at some point if i can get a good dealthis is a weird rpg with a weird plot
bad graphics
ugly environments
the the fighting system is bad
you have to stop
characters are not who youd care about
just a bad gamei enjoy long role playing games like the  hour type
thats why i was intrigued when i heard the mention of the new  part hack series
it had an interesting premise in that it recreates an online world through offline playunfortunately the game is just pure tedium and getting to the end really feels like a chore
all the game is just one endless dungeone crawl between each randomally generated dungeon to the next
your clues are spelled out in the email snippets you gethardly too exciting
youll easily forget the reason youre playing by the th hour or so
especially since so little of the story is spelled out in the st game
why would it be when they want you to buy the next  at  a popmost weapon acquisition which is done through a frustratingly limited inventory system is done through the fun act of trading
and the weapons and armor are so poorly balanced you feel the need to hold on to each piece as one piece holds no clear advantages over the otheri really cant imagine why anyone after getting to the end of the first game having played through  hours of the same random duneons and battled against the same variety of enemies who are only differented by name and color would really want to invest in the whole serieswhen i first saw this gamei was happy that another tomb raider game came outwhen you first begin to have make lara get stronger and it was really hard for me to make sure my jumps were lined up correctlyi think eidos shouldve spent a little more time on making this game
and also the game was way too easy to beatbecause i didnt like so much clearly this was the worse tomb raider game ive ever playedthis game is a huge disappointment because they spent so much time working on it but it still is crap
awful sound and the camera is still the games big problem
its not very long and after you beat you dont want to play it again so you wasted money
dont buy itmy first game i played on playstation was tomb raider i loved it
i played all of them before i played this one
then i tried this one even when i heard many bad things from reviews but still i wanted to see it for myself and they were all right
this game sucked
many times was too slow walking in slow motion it was kind of like metal gear but embarrassing solid snake there were not enough puzzles and the ones it had were boring and repeatitive the design was bad and the graphics i expected more since this was the first tomb raider on ps i liked better the previous games the way she used to move
i miss the adventure like indiana jones and i still remember the other games of tomb raider but this one is forgetabletomb raider was one of the first games i played on the playstation  back in  when it was still called merely the playstation
back then i was thoroughly impressed with the games combination of exploration and puzzle solving gameplay
now the playstation  brings lara croft back for a new adventure and the results to say the least are disappointingtomb raider angel of darkness main problem is that it doesnt give you anything new
its all been done before
sure there are some stealth moves that are now incorporated into the gameplay
but all of laras patented moves are here but they all seem rather passe by modern game standards
lara jumps flips and climbs with her usual flair but its nothing we havent seen before
the controls are often so sluggish youd think that lara was walking in mud when she was performing alot of these moves
it feels as if the game was rushed unessecerily to meet a deadline
the game had been in fact delayed since febuary of  but it seems that all that extra time in development did not help anythe graphics are standard quottomb raiderquot
lara still looks like the same old lara
which is somewhat of a let down
when you compare tomb raider aods graphics to other contemporary ps games such as metal gear solid  splinter cell socomus navy seals and even its explorer counterpart indiana jones you feel that so much more could have and should have been done to beef up the graphics of a game like this
at the very least laras character model should have been updated to give her a more photorealistic look
the streets of paris are rendered nicely but the environment overall looks rather plain and sterile
you dont get any feeling that youre going anywhere special
the action often at times suffers from massive slow down
which really hampers gameplay
running at a steady clip is reduced to a veritable crawli could go on but suffice it to say that this game is a huge letdown on so many levels
the series is now in the midst of changing hands to a new developer crystal dynamics
heres hoping that they can breathe new life in this ailing franchiselooks like this game was put on the market long before it was actually completed
lots of glitches awkward camera angles rough control of movement in general
its a good thing the game allows you to save at any point during play cause youre going to die a lot
shes hard to control and will fall to her death with monotonous regularity yawn
other than that pleasant enough graphics and story line typical tombraider stuff
nothing innovative and would have greatly benefited from a little more work prior to game release boo hoo definitely rent before buying once again this is a game that should rented and not purchased
the game is really terrific and i would have given it a fivestar rating if it hadnt been for major flawno midmission saves or checkpoints
of course you might be thinking big dealof course you also havent played the game yetif you actually purchase this game be prepared for costs exceeding the initial price
for example the cost of new controllers which you will smash in childish fits of anger the cost of a new xbox which you will ruin because of repeated ripping out and putting back in of game and the cost of a new tv which will have one of your smashed controllers embedded in itim all for challenging games games that dont hand the answers to you but this game is a bit on the sadistic side
the total lack of a checkpoint system is just far too frustrating
other than that the game is great
the weapons are sweet and the graphics are out of this world
dolby  surround sound really sucks you into the environments and the storyline is pretty decent
the controls take a little while to get used to but so did halos and we all know how that turned outso take my advice and go rent this game play it first let me say enclave has beautiful graphics
but after playing it awhile i found myself frustrated by my inability to generate my own character or to be able to start out with a character of my own gender female
true later on you can select a new character at each level but after a while i just found myself not caring about playing any furtheri prefer games with a little plot and a lot more diversity at the get go
enclave just failed to grab my interestgrafix good artsy goes with the mood
only good pointtheam and story been done to death nothing new or interestingrun aorund trying to kill thingscontrols slow and awkward cant aim at allaction combat there is no combat system at all
run around swinging wlidly and hope you eventually kill somethingchallenge with out aim or combat system simple weak monsters  are potentially deadly only cheats may helpover all this is two stars worth of game thats allas of late weve seen some movie licensed games be surprisingly good spiderman for one but blade  isnt one of them and is one more game on the list of poor licensed video games
fans of the blade movies like myself will be vastly disappointed here as the game has little to do with the film itself
your objective is to get from the beginning to end of each level while solving tried and true find the switch to open the door puzzles while at the same time going at hand to hand combat with an assortment of enemies
as the game progresses and you earn more and more points in the levels you can begin to unlock blades exotic assortment of weapons ranging from a pistol a shotgun the glaive the silver spinning boomerang type weapon in the movie and uv grenades
as you keep on fighting enemies your rage meter very similar to what was also called the rage meter in sword of the berserk guts rage for the dreamcast builds up and when it is filled you gain access to blades sword to hack up your enemies with
when this happens you can also trigger special kill animations where blade kills an enemy in a semicool fashion and adds a catch phrase to boot
while this does seem like a cool concept on paper the repitition of this as well as the overrused catchphrases by some voice actor other than wesley snipes can get rather annoying and detract from the gameplay
enemy ai has never been dumber and you wont have a hard time dispatching most enemies
the controls are rather stiff and recovery time from jumping can prove to be rather troublesome
the graphics are half decent nothing spectacular but the pounding repetitive techno soundtrack will make you want to turn the volume of your tv down
all in all die hard fans of the blade films or comics may find some degree of enjoyment in this game but all others should avoidi was hoping for something like the first game but the changes are not an improvement they should have kept the same model and just created more content for it i couldnt recommend this a huge disillusionmentok in cds you play as four guys in the military who are friggin stupid
i mean when you compare this to a game likesocom it starts to make you wonder why am i even playing desert storm
the graphics horrible
they are n qualityand the cutscenes are just as bad as the graphics
your teammates not such a big help
when you tell them to hold their fire and a iraqi is right next to them blowing their brains out what do they do
sit there getting shot
the game isnt realistic
when your shot in the face your still alive
sure it helps you but its unrealistic
and when you use an anti air craft missle thing and use it on the tanks nothing happensi was never in the military but dont grenades damage tanks and shooting them in the side should hurt them
but no
if you want to play desert storm invite  friends over
oh yeah the menu screens craptastic
with the horrible presentation bad ai lack of realism and strategy leaves this game to warn people to probably rent it or not out of this game is really cool if you are a fan of john carpenters thing
butit sucks
it has two major flaws that kill the mood of the game the voice acting is terrible and the controls are agonizingly frustrating
also the npcs are kinda dumb not all the time but every now and then which is annoying when your party members have all the machine guns and you have a crappy pistol and suddenly you are ambushed by hoards of enemies
only buy this if you are a hardcore fan of the thing like me otherwise stay awaystay faaaaaar awaythis game got a lot of press when it was new
dark creepy it marked a resurgence of horror fps games and pressed the boundaries of the hardware of the dayas of dec  however it doesnt do that any longer and theres darker creepier better written games out there
as we enter  pm on a thursday night there are only  people on all the servers that my copy found tonight
doom might have a lot to be said for it in multiplayer mode if people were still playing it but theyre notif youre toying with buying this game today buy it as a single player fps and buy it cheap
halflife prey and a half dozen other better written fpses are available in the same  dollar price range
if you can find this game under  and have a deep love of id games go for it
if youd rather just find a good singleplayer game blow that  on something more compellingonce the initial excitement wears off you come to realize that this is a bit bland
every level is the same
every showdown is the same
the scenery is almost always the same
i suspect most of the positive reviews are simply due to the hype this game has garneredreview based on demoperhaps many people go for the appeal of being left in the dark   and it definitely adds to the spookiness factor  but i just found it well annoying of the game youre either in the dark or cant see but a few feet in front of you
its sort of like trying to fight in a box its just rediculousthere is nowhere to crouch down and hide or use any sort of tactics
instead youre just mindlessly running through areas trying find stuff to shoot atseriously you cant use a lightmounted gun this far in the future
considering our current military has this groundbreaking technology it should be available in a future military base on marssorry this game just didnt do it for me download the demo before you blow your yes darkness is scary in real life
but when youre playing a video game darkness is annoying
this is supposed to be the nd century
and the marines cant figure out how to hold a flashlight in one hand and a pistol in the other
no night vision goggles as standard equipment
they dont know how to clip a flashlish to their rifle or helmet
dumb just plain dumb
at least give us the option of playing in darkness or playing in lightwhile i have only spent three hours playing this game i am quite disappointed and wanted to get the word out as fast as possible
on the positive side doom  reminds me of the pc game aliens vs predator  which was scary as a single player game because of the darkness and theme
but avp used the darkness to make the game fun despite the poor graphics
but while the graphics are good when the near constant darkness doesnt prevent one from enjoying them the interface is too classic doom
there is no realistic vision enhancement such as nvgs or even lights mounted on weapons
thus one must go from flashlight to weapons of which there is the classic too many to really carry and back again almost nonstop which is lame in a highscience future based game
monster spawning is also lame as they spawn from cleared areasthe worst aspect of this game is that the creators do not take advantage of even established innovations in fps games such as leaning or alternative fireviewoverall this game is essentially quake i with better graphics but with too much darkness not worth the asking price by a longshot
the monster ai also stinks compared to even quake  although i was fighting mostly zombiesup to this game id games almost seemed to have a midas touch everything they touched turned to gold
many people felt whatever they got their hands on was surely going to win game of the year or at least receives high accolades
as a fan of their games i would have agreed until i got this game and played through itfirst off im going to say that the whole flashlight thing didnt bother me as much as it did others
and various other niggles that other people screamed bloddy murder over i was willing to look past
but there were other things that were quite frankly unforgivableto be honest this game was a good deal of fun for the first few parts
the graphics were unbelievable the atmosphere was great and the story was actually not bad
i figured the game could only get better i was wrongthe biggest problem is that all of the games pros eventually turn into massive cons
the graphics are great but what good are they when all you see are narrow corridors
what good is the atmosphere when you are in constant darkness
i actually had to pump up my monitor brightness because i could never see what was going on the story was the same thing over and over finding pdas and opening a door
thats the kind of puzzle system that wolfenstein d operated on over  years ago but i had prayed would be phased out completely by now
its really a shame because theres some areas of the game that are truly breathtaking
the scenes on the terrain of mars took my breath away but these were few and far between
why didnt id games use more open surfaces
many fans have clamoured the same thingi can sum this game up in two words boring predictable
you walk into a room
you kill everything in sight
you pick up a pda
a monster spawns behind you and you kill it
another few spawn and you kill them
you move into the next room
lather rinse repeat
the problem is compounded by the narrow hallways
its next to impossible to use the bfg or the rocket launcher because youre likely to do more damage to yourself than the enemythe multiplayer isnt even worth mentioning
remember id games are the ones who realized that multiplayer was the way of the future and designed quake  arena one of the best mp games of all time with this in mind
they were mimicked by the unreal tournament and battlefield series
and then they come out with this which scarcely has any worthwhile multiplayer component
why do this
i simply dont understand it
id games literally snatched defeat from the jaws of victoryim sorry but i simply cannot find any real reason to purchase this game
i wasted my money on it but hoped that the mod community would make up for ids lazy multiplayer component but that never happened
if i could go back i would have definitely returned the game
if you must have it wait for it to hit the bargain bin at least then you wont feel too bad about forking over a few bucksthis game requires a super computer
even with my  ghz processor  gig of ram and ati radeon  pro it runs terribly at  x  and  x  the graphics are good when you manage to get the framerate high enough but the action is just dumb
its all finding youre way through poorly lit rooms with monsters in them
plus youre flashlight is another weapon so you need to swich back and forth between the flashlight and the gun
its all mindless run and gun
no strategy or tactics at all
the rag doll physics are horridly unrealistic and unlike the upcoming half life  there are only  or  objects that you can interact with like cones and small boxes and they move very unrealistically when shot or punched
the multiplayer is a joke
 vs  need i say more
my recomendation wait untill half life  comes out on september st
it even comes with the new counter strike
just stay away from this gamehighsgood graphicstons of material the news on the tvs video clips on youre pdalowstakes a supercomputer to runterrible multiplayerbad action that takes no strategyi too eagerly awaited this title and was disappointed
much hype about little content
you may go blind trying to play this one
 percent of the game is played in utter darkness
hearing creepy noises all around you only works for about  minutes than becomes frustrating
it seems that all this darkness means little attention must be paid to the actual graphics
the box graphics are way better than the ones in the actual gameyou run around in the dark until something moans
you frantically try to bring up your flashlight while it draws closer
after seeing whatever it might be you switch to a weapon
then again your back in pitch black mean while your foe has hobbled off the side
forget about firing flashes from your weapons to help you see your target
apparently weapons dont flash at all when being fired in the dark on a mars space station
if you actually hit something it soon fizzles away like a bug in a bug zapper pretty lameif you really want a fun fps of this genre try painkiller and its new expansion pack
it is a much better looking game and anover all better time
pk beat doom to the punch with a much better game
sorry guyseste es probablemente el padre de los fps
si de horror y claustrofobia se trata doom eleva el estandar no solo con su nuevo motro grafico sino x su originalidad y el tema de la vieja escuela de parte de sus predecesores basados en msdos
no puede faltar en tu coleccionhaving a dsl connection of m i wasw shocked to see how slowly online play was avoid games with more than  players on even this high connection
 especially when compared with unreal tournament  which can easily handle  players
but the main solo play game is a lot like halflife even some of the sound effects are the same
its the same old followthepath structure and apart from a few unsuspected scares dont have a weak heart when playing this one has no replay value except for multiplayer  which id recommend minimum a  dsl connection
doom hogs internet bandwidth even more than utk et alid could take a lesson from atari about how to better use bandwidth
utk is exceptional by comparison and is surprisingly playable on k downup speedsoverall its a good game but dont pay more than  for the original and  for the ressurection addon pak so wait a few months
anything more is exploitation of an uncreative product that should be faster with online play
all the players and texturebump maps are on each pc what exactly are they sending over the internet thats dragging things down
looks very nice and is playable even on my lowly hardware see below but it adds nothing to the genre it even goes backwards the flashlight has an infinite power source good griefmy systemabit nf mobo nforce chipset dual ddlathlon xp    cugb ram x modulesnvidia geforce fx video mb ram from bfgsb audigyagain for solo play itll run great at x ultra quality
but for multiplayer get the best downupload bandwidth you can get
cable users note download speed may be mb on a good day but upload speed also crucial for game playwhen the sims first came out to rave reviews a few years ago i promised myself id buy the thing if it was ever released in a cutrate deluxebox format
well this fits the bill so i finally broke down and bought the thingand this turned out to be the most overrated game ive ever played
im sure you all know the theme and basics of the game so i wont bother rehearsing them but i will point out several absurdities that make this game an artificial exercise in finding different ways to accomplish whatever the computer forces you to accomplish
you have to do the same thing over and over and it gets boring
relieving your sims bladder bar by going to the toilet is an obvious example but there is so much other routine nonsense to handle that you find yourself clicking the same commands day after day taking a shower cooking food calling friends over to your house talking to them talking to them talking to them now and then watching tv with them but then having to stop watching tv so you can talk to them yet again in order to raise your relationship score with them
im amazed that so many reviewers called this game engrossing
there are maybe ten things you do in this game and you do them over and over and over
if you dont do these commands your various mood bars will rapidly start to suffer this will harm your overall mood and that in turn will cause your job performance to deteriorate and your interactions with other sims to fail as well
since when is your job performance determined by your mood
thats an example of whats wrong with this game its not really about directing a simulated human beings life its about figuring out the best combination of commands to keep your sims mood bars high
thats very artificial
these commands themselves are also unnatural
you cant sit and talk with someone if youre sitting on a couch thus raising your comfort bar and want to interact with your friend and thus raise your social bar and your relationship score you have to stand up first
but this immediately causes your comfort bar to drop
for that matter your friend cant even sit on the same couch right next to you because the couches arent group activities
your friend has to be sitting on a different couch
also anytime you leave your house your room bar drops precipitously so if youre doing anything outdoors youre not likely to be in the best mood while youre doing it
thats absurd
in real life my mood doesnt deteriorate when im outside playing basketball and it doesnt improve afterwards just because i walk inside my house
you cant ever visit anyone elses house
now and then neighbors drop by to visit often helping themselves to your food and amenities and you can always call someone up and invite him or her over
but no one ever invites you over
so your whole life is spent inside your little simhouse
some of the random events are annoying
i got hit with a miserable clown who wouldnt leave my house and made me miserable too he wouldnt stop bothering me until i called the clown catchers who look like men in black to remove him
the first time it was kind of creative and cute
but then it happened againalmost immediately afterwards
thats just annoying
same thing with the burglar who breaks into your house at night and steals your furniture the first time he stole some stuff i thought it was clever
the second time it was only a sign of how impoverished this game really is
couldnt they think of other random things to happen to me before hitting me with a crazy clown and a burglar twice
acquiring skills is no less artificial
dont even think about cooking anything on a stove unless youve read some cookbooks first because youre virtually guaranteed to start a fire
ive never read a single cookbook in my life and dont consider myself a gourmet but im able to make a simple and nutritious meal without burning the house down
need to improve your charisma skill
talk to a mirror
and talk some more
and talk some moreno thanks
id rather play something else insteadi didnt really enjoy the sims as much as i thought i would since its just like real lifepay bills water the garden watch tv
go to the bathroom eat ect
and for another thing theres not too much depth to the game
all you can do in this version is stay in your house and run the lives of the people you create
to get the most out of this game you are gonna be shellin out big bucks for all the expansion packs
the only good well actually funnything that you can do is kill the sims you made by starving drowning or burning them
there might be some of you out thereits great for people with newer computers ie ones with windows above windows  but why stop at just livin large
they should have put all the eps into one game
i been talkin to all my sim fan friends about how they should make something like this and after only two years
they make it
they made too many eps who ever bought all of them they would have probably needed a whole computer just for the eps
its good they made this newer version but they should have added more than just one ep to the gamewhoevers mad about buying all the eps they can just sell themby the way dont get sims online unless you want to pay a monthly fee every month just for playing a gamethe strays really get annoying running around the house
the objects are cool but dont add much
sometimes the game would freeze and id have to restart the game
ill stick with the regualar simsi own all the expansions except hot date and this is the first in the series that is badly bugged and unstable
in windows  it drops to desktop frequently some sims become completely unusable as certain crashes happen at the same spot for that sim every time
you could lose your entire family if you have  and use this expansionunder xp it doesnt crash but there are still nagging problems the superfast clock speed the one that pops up automatically and you cannot go to yourself frequently stops in midday or midnight for no reason water leaks under toilets and tubs and cannot be cleaned up by the sims though the maid gets it the movement ai was never good but now its even worse than before neighborhood stray pets are a nuisance especially skunks and el bandito racoon though ive had fewer burglars so they may merely replace burglars sims seem to need substantially more sleep than before
i had a steady schedule for my family and now i have lost an hour or so due to new higher sleep requirementsif you have windows  id pass on this expansion rather than risk losing my existing familiesif you have xp i wonder whether the game adds more than it subtracts in problems
the pets are okay and the larger neighborhood is nice i wanted to post this just as an fyi for anybody who fell in love with the original hot pursuit
this games hot pursuit mode is totally heinous
ea really botched it
you cant be the police and chase down bad guys with your buddies over the network
we bought a bunch of copies found this out and sold a bunch of copies totally lame
so just a heads upthis game would have been great back in the s before gamepads it is a game which is played with the combonation of joy stick and keyboard
however it is good for the kids if you want your kids playing games which involve shooting etcim really not impressed
yeah the graphics are good if you have the computer to support it but the overall fun value is very low for the single player mission
its just a bit too easy to kill the enemy almost like using autoaim
how can one shot to the abdomen take a man down so easily
plus you cant control how far grenades are thrown
theres way too many scripted elements in the game for instance if you dont kill this guy first with the rpg then you die
if you dont kill this guy that runs around the corner then the hostages die
its just too scripted and not a very customizable premission setupwhen i first bought this it worked just fine
then a month or two maybe three i took my gamecube to my aunts house and it wouldnt start up
i had to mess with it a little i didnt do that before it started acting weird
when i got home it was completely shot
i highly recommend not buying this
if you dont want to get another dud or a new system a  wii or ps go straight to nintendo and buy thatthis is the same exact game that came out  months ago for the xbox
to prove it the game still uses wwf and not wwe
the roster was not updated so its still the roster from late  there is no story mode road to wrestlemania instead there are championship modes where you need to go through  wrestlers to get a title shot
the raw arena is the only arena and there are no backstage areas
nor is there any real hardcore action because even though there are s of weapons these weapons are helmets tables jackolanterns chairs bandanas and so on
the wrestlers do not bleed at all not even with a code
there is a pretty deep createawrestler feature however you can only create  wrestlers even though this is a pc game
there is no rvd mysterio booker t and so on however there is rhyno spike xpac credible and haku
there are very few modes exhibition and the king of the ring tournament
there are no table matches ironman matches or  man tag matches even though the game lets  wrestlers in the ring at the same time
at least all of the titles are in the game that were in the wwf in  hardcore heavyweight lightheavyweight european womens and intercontinental
the play is very unbalanced such as the rock and the undertaker can undoubtedly beat up kkwik and taka so there is no chance raising a new star
another detail to the game is the new stamina bar where your wrestler will get winded the more he runs and does power moves
so rhyno cannot do gore after gore because he would get tired
with there being a stamina bar there is also a voltage bar which is basically one long bar that determines who is winning and when you can do finishing maneuvers
the controls are unique where you have an attack grapple block and action button
the attack button is capable of several attacks such as hold up and press the attack button will do a dropkick hold down and press the attack it will be a kick or a punch
its the same with the grapple button
the action button can do anything from perform a taunt pin an opponent pick up weapons put on clothes and climb the turnbuckle
the graphics and sound are amazing but what fun is the game if there are no modes to keep you interested inwwf raw finally bought a wrestling game back to the pc
i wwf title hadnt been seen since acclaims wwf in your house in about  or so
however this game did not live up to the expectation of what it should have beeni myself have always loved wrestling games ever since way back in the days of the original nintendo and the games and graphics have come a long way since then and thq where able to whip out the best of the best wrestling games of all time for the nintendo  kicking off with wcw titles and working there way up to wwf no mercy which is still my all time favebut i have no idea what thq have been thinking when they make there wrestling games for other systems why change it and develop a new way to play when there is nothing wrong with the way it is loved best
thq made the classics wcwnwo revenge and wwf no mercy the two best of the best wrestling games but then they went and made wcw nitro which is hands down the worst wrestling game of all time being too arcade like and no funyou would think they learned from there mistake but no they did have some success with a similar but better style of game play with the ps games like smackdown but every one still agrees that the way they developed it for the  games was the easiest to use and preferred way but they did not listen to what the fans wanted and instead combined the awkwardness of nitro and smackdown to create there first title for the xbox which later was converted to the pc this game here wwf rawfirst off there is already a few titles called wwf raw most fans call this game wwe raw now to separate it from the snes classic
first thing i noticed was thq screwed with the moment you start the game they released there first few with the ability to turn the game on and within  seconds you can be playing a match unlike this one they bore you with copyright screens for a minuteok now onto the game the graphics look pretty darn good a big improvement since the n games the wrestlers look cool much better then the ps titles that looked awful
the moves are executed decently some are too quick for my standard but thats just my opinion
the new polygon system is a nice touch to be able to adjust heads bodies and the rest to whatever size you want
the intros look pretty damn good and the pyrotechnic graphics are amazing
the controls are not too bad you can get used to them after a while and the music is as close to the real thing as its gonna getnow the cons
there is no where near enough moves to do in this game
the  menus are atrocious to guide through when creating a wrestler the caws take a back step now with an option to make the crotch upper thigh lower  leg and feet costume to make a simple pair of pants you have to go into  different menus and select each section to do it
interesting idea but annoying they should have kept it the old way or had an option for the preset proper clothingattire stuff in the one selection
the caws have so  much new stuff to chose from but not enough attires you actually wanna usethe matches are a joke there is nothing in this game but  on   on   on   on   on   on  and a so called battle royal that is only  players
a battle royal is a match where you all start in the ring and try to eliminate everyone else by knocking them over the top rope not a fatal four way elimination match what was thq thinking
no cage match no cell no backstage areas no hbk no dx ill let the last  pass as they werent around at the time no ladder match no tlc and whats worse there is a ladder in the game you can pick it up you can set it up but you can not climb up it
the only decent weapon is the table which you can set up and break your opponent through but using hacks on wwf no mercy show that that game could do better still cause the breaking tables in this game are nothing speciali may not have done something correctly but as far as i know there is only one arena raw
no mercy was called that and still had all the arenas to choose from why was it so hard to develop a few extra pictures and stick them on the background of the arenasnow ill list as a wwf no mercy fan what i liked about this game and what i hatedliked wrestler intros pyro effects music crowed undertakers motorcycle is a proper d model he rides in on ability to alternate between titan tron video and players entrance during intros options to change the polygons around option to attack opponent during there intro actually does have some music wwf did not own the copyright to like the undertaker and hhhs theme that they slacked off on buying the rights to in previous games and had them with old themes or gave them the raw theme song can sustain more then  wrestlers during a match at a timehated no commentary unclimbable ladder not enough match types not enough moves not enough caw options every category playing against the computer is too hard even on easy some controls are confusing only one arena no backstage intros show things like motor bikes and ravens trolley yet there not usable during a match or even seen they magically disappear unlockable characters are not worth it nothing special about unlocking hats and sunglasses to pick up and put on during a match can sustain more then  wrestlers in a match at a time but does not have any  on  or royal rumble match to do that with there only seen when interference is selected during the match music is annoyingprobably more no blood cant climb the laddersoverall get yaself a rom of no mercy and hack away with it
this game here is a nice looking game but a dud to play and no replay value
fun on two or more players but frustrating and annoying on one playersortathe quick summary is unfinished rather buggy and far too short
especially compared to the first three which i lovedi  completed the game in about  hours and im not a particularly good player
given that the game has very little replay value its just not worth the money
itd probably be ok as a rental
i find myself saying that a lot latelymaybe i should take the hint
the ingame camera isnt so hot
its a lot better than most but it occasionally got stuck trying to control spyro by remote control  feet away isnt much fun and had this occasional tendency to spin around in a full circlethe framerate takes a serious hit when there are a lot of active monsters or dragonflies on the level
one level in particular cloud  which is mostly wideopen space had really bad problems and the game even froze a few times while i was playing that level
this level also revealed some very painful clipping issues trying to make a long glide to some hidden gems required repeating  the level time after time as i kept hitting some invisible thing or other and fallingspeaking of which theres a serious lack of zoe inlevel save points
there are usually two one about  of the way into the level and the other about 
so if you screw up on the last half of the level yep you get to repeat at least  the level
this makes exploring the levels no fun at all since if you fall off somewhere you have to start way back at the middlethe controls seem awkward and caused a lot of frustration
spyro cant recover from touching something while hes flying as i recall he could start flying again in the previous games unless he ran smack right into an object and using the hover button also totally kills his ability to fly
hover also seems to kill  of his forward momentuma big change from the previous games and i regularly missed jumps by undershootingthe monsters are incredibly wimpy
i never got killed by any of them heck i may never have even gotten hit by any of them
except for the boss of course he wasnt horribly hard but i think missiles that follow you around is almost bordering on cheating and he could fire faster than spyro could recover from a stun so depending on exactly where you were when you were hit it would be certain deathi didnt run into any truly serious bugs but im sure there are several as i saw a plethora of minor problems
that the framerate issues lack of ingame movies theres exactly one besides the intro and ending movies and its totally out of place and the shortness of the game basically scream it wasnt anywhere near finished but we shipped it anywaytheres several minigames most of which are fun to play and some are quite creative but i found only a couple of them were worth playing more than once
the races were surprisingly easy compared to the first three games not a huge problem but again disappointingthe level portals arent named and they look identical for the most part
annoying as all get outespecially if you want to go back to a particular minigame or sublevellets see something nice to say i thought the graphics were pretty good and the ingame voices were fine of what we heard of them as there was very little interaction with other characters in the game
moneybags makes a single token appearance zoe has one thing to say and ditto for the other characters
hunter shows up  times i think the most of any of the other characters
ill give it two stars because i actually bothered to finish it but it really wasnt that good and certainly wasnt worth the money
i suggest renting it insteadi had read that this game was not up the usual high standards of the spyro series
but being a big spyro fan i decided to give it a chance
well i should have listened to the bad reviews because this game is very much inferior to the other spyros i have played  a heros tail for the ps and all of the spyro ps gamesthe load time for being transported to different worlds is way too long and the game itself is way too short
the challenges are less fun movement is sluggish and there are several glitchs that caused the game to stop and forced me to start again
overall it is just a very poorly designed game
apparently the folks at universal interactive are no match for the people at insomniac
the only bright side is that the game does still contain the same basic elements of play  collect gems and dragonflys to achieve  completion
but i would only recommend this to be the biggest spyro fans who have already played the other spyro games and even then you are likely to be disappointedand were not talking dragonflies
i dont think they beta tested this game at all
unlike the ps games this one is loaded with flawsi have only explored  worlds besides the main world and the game has frozen twice the sound has vanished and some monsters weapons extend beyond the horizon and through wallsannoyancesyou have to hear the name of each dragonfly you catch and spyro always says hey its  could be a tad more diversecant skip intro production creditsload times take far too longthere should be an option to turn off the auto help
i dont want to be stopped constantly in the early levels and be told how to do something i know how to from previous games
if this is your first spyro game then turn that onlastly it plays slowi give it  stars because when you do get a chance to play it is fun and brings back the enjoyment of the previous games but it is too painful to playnice new features include new breath weaponssome well thought out puzzlesthe game could have been a lot better
if this is your first spyro experience you probably wont be as dissapointed except for the bugs
rent it see if you liketolerate iti played this spyro game first and found it flat and tedious
everything in it feels like a chore rather than a challenge
it feels like gameplay balance was a secondary consideration if thatrecently i had the pleasure of playing one of the older spyro games for the psx and i realized that this newer game is just a rehash of material that insomniac gave us in earlier spyro gamesbut this ps spyro lacks the charm and gameplay of the insomniac games
it all feels like someone bought the rights to spyro and just slapped together a gameglitchy uninspired and graphically deficient
in fact the psx graphics in the earlier games are almost as good as those in quotenter the dragonflyquot etd looks for all the world like they simply took the models used for the psx and rendered them at ps resolutions
embarrassing
the only enjoyable thing about this game is the musicspyro creator insomniac games has moved on to quotratchet amp clankquot and i suggest that spyro fans do the sameif this is the spyro of the future stick with the spyro of the past for less than the price of etd you can buy all  of the vastly superior insomniac games spyro titlesloved spyro in all the previous forms
while the graphics are pretty they come at the expense of game play
first the game is easy
riptocs revenge had many tricky puzzles and skill challenges that kept the game interesting for all ages
if any of the bad guys kill you in this game you probably forgot to hit pause
also  second loads between screens
and there appear to be at least three bugs in the game where you are racing the bad guys and go from fourth to third to third to third cant win and therefore will not be able to finish the game
all in all it is intersting to play a new spyro game but the flaws are colossal
finish it and break out one of the ps gamesive been a huge fan of spyro the dragon for many years
this is the first release of spyro for the ps and is made by a new companyi had heard many poor reviews about spyro in the hands of this new company
it was made by universal interactive instead of insomniac who wrote the old spyro games
i still have my older spyro games so i played them side by side to see just what the difference wasfirst yes the graphics are better
i would hope so
the other games are from  and before and were for the playstation not the ps
so in this new version the baskets for example are very pretty with their weave and decoration
the water ripples when spyro runs through it the grasses in the water wave
even so curved surfaces arent as smooth and clean as in other current games such as ffx and kingdom heartsgraphics do not make a game though and we found the new spyro gameplay to be  sluggish
in the other spyros you feel like you have an energetic kitten on your hands one that jumps and springs and moves quickly
in this new spyro its more like a baby elephant lumbering along
the sounds dont seem to match up well with screen actions either
there are often delays between when an action occurs and the sound kicks ineven worse though are the serious coding errors evident
im a programmer by profession so i know it can be tough to make a game perfect
however this game didnt seem to get even simple testing done before it was released
there were numerous problems with drawing glitches on the screen causing giant polygons to block our view
and when we tried to play through the display problems it crashed
repeatedlyi really wanted the game to work well
the plot of the dragonflies have been stolen seemed fun
you got to have bubble breath to capture them and lightning breath for other tasks
there were the usual gem collecting and fun enemies
but with the sluggy gameplay and the continual crashes it becomes very tiring very quickly
rent this one first to see if your love of spyro is enough to overcome those obstaclesi grew up on spyro
little eight year old me would come home every day and hurry upstairs so she could play her ps and be a dragon for a few hours until bedtime
when the ps came out and i saw how polished the graphics were i was so excited
doubly so when i began seeing commercials for a brand new spyro game polished graphics and all
to this day i am still full of disappointmentvisually and in theory this game was a great idea
the worlds are gorgeous especially the thieves denyour goal is to collect the dragonflies that ripto has accidentally scattered through the realms via a spell backfire
these dragonflies are needed for the rite of passage for the young dragons spyro has recently freed from the sorceress where they will be partnered together foreveroh glitches how do i list the ways gems from fallen enemies will disappear through the ground causing you to not be able to collect them load times are painfully long
when you go into a new level you have to wait about three minutes before you arrive even when you attack enemies with your breath abilities it doesnt always register theres some sort of depth perception issue when you try to do the platform jumping minigame in crop circle country in one of the tunnels in luau island the level will disappear leaving you stuck in the tunnel with nowhere to go bubble breath has a tendency to not work even when you have a dragonfly cornered when you enter riptos arena you are given no direction as to what to do simply thrust into battle i have multiple glitches in cloud  occasionally when i try to enter a challenge portal i get stuck in it although not necessarily a bad glitch sometimes you can jump right through a breathgate without having aquired that breath ability and play through the levels without a problemim sure there are several more im forgetting this game is overflowing with glitches so much that they overpower the general fun of gameplay
honestly though if you can get it for a couple of bucks its worth it just to have every spyro game in your collectiona number of reviews have already mentioned the worst thing about this game the obscenely long cutscenes
i started to time one of the longer ones but after  minutes i couldnt take it anymore
the cutscenes add little to the game play
mostly theyre gushy emotional diatribes that have some sort of message like give peace a chance or all you need is love or dont poop in the tub
the weaponry in this game was pretty exciting  but you never really used it
despite having guided missles automatic assault weapons and grenade launchers  you spend most of the game with a tranquilizer dart sneaking around
in fact i didnt use the grenade launcher once the whole game
finally the storyline is about as convoluted as it gets
by the end of the game i really dont know whats been going on
with so many twistturns they turn a straightforward game on its headsave your money
this game is too preachy and lacks exciting gameplayrent this game to test it before purchasingit is very different from similar games halo splinter cell etc
although i like those other games i did not like metal gear solidin short it has very long movie scenes i think i had to watch about  minutes of video before playing and the game is constantly pausing to show you other short movies
you feel more out of control of the player than you do in other shooting games ghost recon splinter cell halo etc
the result of the movies and the awkward control is that you dont feel engaged as a playerafter about a halfday i gave up on this one and returned itif you like to get caught up in the plot of a shooter videogame and the action is just an aside then this is probably a good selection
if you prefer action and like the plot as a nice backdrop then you are not likely to enjoy this gamemgs  was a really good game but not as deep as the first one on the psx
mgs substance is basically the japanese release of the game american version didnt have all the extras
you can skate play as new characters watch the movies with different characters and more vr type missions
i am sure those things add some replay value to the game but other than that there is nothing new going on
story is exactly the same graphics are same control and sound are carbon copy of original mgs   if you havent played or owned mgs  then substance is the one to geti really like splinter cellmgs is no splinter cell not even closethe one main problem is the horrible camera angles
just let me play in st person modenext why in the world doesnt snake have a knife
if i had just put a terrorist to sleep knowing hed wake up again in a few minutes id just slit his throat
at the very least toss him overboard toss his weapons overboard or something
and why cant i pick up their weaponsalso whats with the stupid shaking the body to find stuff
why cant snake just go through the pockets instead of having to shake the body repeatedly to try and find something
and wouldnt this wake them up if theyre asleep
dumb doesnt even begin to describe the contrived story line and limitationswasted  hours on it trying to see if it would grow on me
yeah it grew like fungusim not sure why im even giving it  stars but im in a generous moodi went to my friends house to see what this game was all about
well we started with such excitment but yet i grew board of this game really fast
he ended up beating the sol story in  days and i hardly played any of it
he got board of it too cuz he had sol as well
well heres the dealgameplaywell the same except on the xbox you have to hit the left anolog stick to get out of st person view and that makes you not want  to get your cover blown and the game suffers from slowdown which really ticked me offgraphicswhoever said that this took advantage of the xbox graphics is lyin
there nearly the same as the pss or a slight bit worse but anyway they look kinda the same
so not much canged heresoundwell yea the sound is a bit better than the pss and that so far is the first advantage the xbox had over the psvaluewell if you are a fan of metal gear and have every single game like me then you pretty much have this game
the vr and alternate missionsyou can just pop in mgs vr missions and there u go snake talesthey were intruiging at first but they are very dissapointing once youre done sol if you have sol for the ps then its pretty much the same old game just a diffrent system unless you wanted to play as snake very badly but i dont give a overallthis game is very dissapointing to me and my friend
this will not even be as nearly praised as mgs
this is baisicly a port of mgs
i was expecting another great port like max payne but got resident evils directors cut
anyone with a ps and has mgs and thought that substance was the reason to buy an xbox belive me you rather wait till it comes out for the ps unless thatll be a letdown as well
if you have both systems with mgs id rather wait for splinter cell doa xtreeme volyball or halo  than buy this if i were u  my friend wanted to sell it so i got someone for him that brought it
if u have only a xbox then u jes might get this gamethis game may have more songs than its japanese cousin but that does not mean it is better
its completely neutered from the japanese version instead it plays catch up with the japanese versions
this would eventually set the stone to how american ddr versions play catch up to japanese home versions
yes this version has  songs over the japanese versions  the vast majority of the songs here have already appeared in japanese versions so we find this game complete and utterly useless
yes for every one unique licensed song this game has there are about a dozen more found in japanese versionsspearhead has virtually none of the game play quality which abounded in the original medal of honor
the movement of the characters is very choppy even after you cut down on detail in the options menu
this is the case even on the fastest computers just look at the other reviewsthe historical quality of this game is the only thing it has going for it
i have never seen the movie the battle of the bulge but after playing this game i would now like to
also i did not know that the paratroopers that landed in france before dday were coming in under heavy fire
i always figured they just went in quietly and for the most part unnoticed
now i feel stupid for having thought that
so the game does tend to open ones eyes to the horrors of war and what those men went throughactually the primary problem i have with this game is that its too difficult
now before anyone dismisses me for a wimp let me just say that i love difficult and challenging games
but there are levels of difficulty in most games this particular one included
usually its easy medium and hard  or something along those lines
my point is if they wanted a superhard game to show the player how tough war is then they very easily could have provided those difficulties on the harder levels
for me this game has no replayability on even the easy level much less the more difficult onesthe difficulty of this game is not to be compared to other popular firstpersonshooters like the jedi series ghost recon the halflife series or even medal of honor allied assault
those games and many others like them present certain difficulties but after the player moves past the difficult part theres time to catch ones breath a bit
in spearhead its constant action with no time or opportunity to stop and enjoy the game
i realize this is war
but its also a game
in fact its a game first
and these two must be carefully balanced in order for the game to be a quality productthis game is not a quality productthe medal of honour that reappears in this expansion pack looks better than ever with explosive special effects and new blow em away weapons
you also get to fight alongside comrades who can hold their own which lends some authenticity to the game
just as the first was shamelessly modelled on saving private ryan this contains scenes straight out of band of brothers which is kinda fun toospearhead however is even more tightly scripted if that is possible than its predecessor
you cant so much as shoot out of turn if you want to complete your objectives
annoyingly a lot of it also takes place in the dark or in murky landscapesin tandem with this it reintroduces some of the most irritating aspects of the last game such as snipers who are invisible in the gloom and at least one finicky finale in which you have to constantly save just to make it through the scene
lastly it does not include enough of the things that made the last one fun such as rooms full of enemy to shoot atoh and as others have noted here it is very short  too short to be worth  bucks
i got through it in a couple of hours without hurrying and have no inclination to play it againthis will be an interesting review i think they hp games get better as they go along im sure it was an ok game for its time but im not too interested in this game at all st parts of the game  a couple cutscenes too many
 good to catch up notfamiliar journeyers to the world of hp but dont provide a lot of information kinda hit and missfirst controlled levels  really weird i ddnt recognize hogwarts very well controls are kinda clunkymaybe thats because i have played all of the newer onesfirst impression of this hogwarts  well we do know that hogwarts only gets better as the games progress this hogwarts was kinda weird but at the same time was interesting and was filled with stuffspells  learning spells can be tedious and the challenges are a pain
doing spells in general is much too simple but it is geared toward younger people so i cant complainunlockables  kind of a whatever feeling i feel like i just get them and there arent many things to get with them there isnt that wow factor of gaining themquidditch confessions   well its pretty tacky and the surrounding environment is pretty lackluster but the setup of the quidditch match itself has mostly sustained up to hp  hbp and has gotten polished which is good
so good job on that eafinal comments  the chamber of secrets is not very secretive it is quite a dull placespiders arent creepy anymore hogwarts is now a very large house with doorways to gardens and cool statues
for its time hp  was probably a great game  but nowadays technology has mostly shunned this quality and idea of a gamekey since we are all in a learning mood
   happy face  wink facein the long history of pc games there havent been many james bondbrand releases on the pc in fact i cant name any offhand aside from maybe james bond jr
the brand has had a fruitful experience for the consoles including the famous release of goldeneye for the nintendo with the release of a new bond adventure in  publisher electronic arts wanted to create a big crossplatform bond actionshooter that didnt have to rely on the new movie but still carried the name and was released at about the same time
unfortunately they decided to bet on relatively old technology and some strange creative choices to do it at least on the pc version and the result became a rather uninteresting game called nightfirethe player assumes the role of dashing mi agent james bond  here to free the world from nuclear tyranny british expatriots and so on
each of the nine missions precedes a fullmotion animated cut scene that uncovers more of the general plot and details the next mission
more averagequality cut scenes are interspersed throughout the game at various pointsnightfire is a firstperson shooter and shares all the nuances of that breed of game with the same familiar style of control schema albeit with some trademark differences
aside from the variety of guns available bond can switch to a gadget inventory and select from one of those  the gadgets are primarily oneeventtype items
a wristwatch serves as a laser for cutting locks for instance though you couldnt even use it to get the attention of a guardthe other gadget worth noting is the sunglasses which when put on can switch between different shades of the spectrum  handy for locating hidden areas laser traps or through womens dresses
the downside is that you can only use it for so long as it runs on rechargeable battery power not to mention the sunglasses are buggyas stated above there are only nine missions  each have a variety of submissions with their own set of objectives
while the level design is adequate it pretty much pushes the limits of the engine including multiple loads in a single level
the objectives which update as the mission progresses is not very helpful at telling you what needs to be done or even why
only by going through a level killing everything and checking andor destroying everything else can you really figure some of them out  unless of course it happens to be a level where there is a neverending stream of bad guys and there is no clue as to what to doanother problem of note is that a player can effectively win a mission by accomplishing an objective get killed because of something else and still lose the mission as the mission results screen is delayed while the game still runs
i actually ran into this on a particularly annoying boss levelmere mention of the console gamestyle boss creatures is another bad mark
this by itself is not too annoying but the bosses not to mention the situations youre thrust into are painfully stupid
speaking of painfully stupid that would be the perfect description of the games artificial intelligence ai  enough said on thatthis is not to say that nightfire has some redeeming qualities
some of the levels require going into thirdperson mode which is a fun switch
bond can only carry around four big weapons at a time so you will have to strategize in some situations
you can use multiple different methods in certain missions to accomplish the objective
on the very first mission bond can sneak his way into the castle complex through the back way or fight his way throughnightfire includes a multiplayer mode as well
it consists of lan or internet play supporting up to  players with three modes of play combat training deathmatch team combat training team deathmatch and capture the flag
in team games one team assumes the role of the good guys while the other team is the bad guys  and they have different models to match
unfortunately multiplayer mode seems tacked on and a few of the levels are very unbalancedseveral times already ive described the nightfire engine as being stretched to the limit
thats because the developer gearbox interactive went with the halflife engine to develop the game and added in their own inhouse goodies
gearbox is no stranger to using the halflife engine but to release a major title with a four yearold engine at launch is troublesome at bestcharacter models are average if not great and the animations are about the same  though there are some specialized animations as well
the australian secret agent is a blond lara croft ripoffim a bit of a bond movie traditionalist so its hurtful to sit through a particularly hard level of nightfire listening to some technonew age version of a rehashed bond theme over and over again
oh there is some variety and a small bit of it is catchy but enough is enough
the song featured in the intro sequence by the female singer esthero and plays in the background on the menu screens is quite good however
the voice acting for the various characters including bond seems very unevenjames bond  nightfire is a lackluster game stuck in an old engine that probably should have gone through a bit more in the design and implementation stage
aside from a nice opening sequence and a few well thats kind of cool moments ingame nightfire should definitely have its license revokedtheres a reason the price of this game has dropped so quickly compared to its console counterparts  its a horribly subpar conversion of what might otherwise have been a pretty decent bond gamenightfire is a mixture of the most infamous elements of the james bond movies
bond must stop a mad industrialist from nuking the world and has several gadgets and female friends to help him accomplish this
ea takes advantage of the bond licence as the game features pierce brosnans face as bond the familiar bond theme appearances by classic bond villains and other goodiesbut nightfire lacks in several areas
first the cool driving levels found in the console versions have been dropped from the pc version probably due to lack of space
this leaves only  levels which is just too short of a bond experience
the game also seems to require a pretty highend system to runi have no problems running other recent games such as jedi outcast but nightfire still stuttered along even when i set all the graphics options to low detail and the graphics in nightfire dont seem that spectacular in the first place
while i said ea takes advantage of the bond licence this isnt always a good thing
the bond theme appears too often and quickly gets annoying while the voice actor for bond overplays his part and turns bond into the stereotypical cliched secret agent
actual gameplay isnt too bad but nothing special either
the levels are mostly noninteractive small and take too long to load especially the japanese resort level where the game has to pause and load every few rooms completely breaking up the gameplay
finally the game actually copies all of its cutscenes as avi files onto your computer during installation
whats the point of playing the game when we can just watch the cutscenes ea
someone should have thought this out and encoded the cutscenes as an unlockable extra not give players free access to them even before theyve seen the first levelif you have a ps gamecube or xbox get nightfire for one of those instead and not this inferior pc port
if you dont i cant really recommend nightfire even to the most diehard james bond fansi had waited quite some time to play this game since it had been quite pricey and yes i made a good decision to pick it up in thebargain bin
th graphics and sound are stupendous however it is basically impossible to make money
one keeps losing money all the time and i find it to be way to hard
the previous versions had all been improvements of prior versions of the game
to me this was a visual improvment but at the same time the gameplay suffered a major blow
i was so disapointed after having played if for a few hours and then making the drastic decison never to play it againfirst off i have to say the game its self is great
all of the new features are great the graphics are supurb and the realism is unbelievablehowever one possibly fatal drawback to this game is that its already notorious for bugs
this is easily one of the least stable games ive ever played
and check out any sim city  forum im definitely not aloneeven with a fast system mine is a ghz p mb ddr ram mb ati video card and even after doing all of the defrags and disk clean ups that the game recomends the game crashes hangs and displays glitches constantly
turning down shadows cars etc can help but whats the fun in that
while the game and its graphics and features are great this is definitely another prime example of ea releasing a game before its ready and your game play will suffer because of it
maybe theyll release a patch some dayive loved every simcity game since the first and in theory i love this one as well
the graphics are rich and vibrant and the level of complexity is awesome
now for the down sidesthe game crashes mind numbingly awesome
my machine screams with ever game ive played including massive strategy games but playing this you would think my p was a comedore   the game just keeps going down
as for playability it seems excellent if only the game stayed up long enough to really enjoy a full gamethis really needed a few more months of betathis is a game where you need a lot of time and thinking to suceed in
i have tried evrything to get money nohting works
i cheated constantly to build up my city till i could get enough out of my citizens taxes had casinos toxic waste sites ect
even only had  school and hospital for the entire city and made tons of deals with my neighbours
but still im losing money
i dont get it
but a good way of making money is doing different things on different neighbourhoods
like a residetial  connected to a commerial  and thats connected to an industial  swap deals get money the folks jobs arent far away and everyones happy
sort of
the residential lot is the hardest obviously
you need hospitals schools libarys police and firestations parks and so on the easiest  i think is commercial
get a couple of landmarks make sure you have lots of big roads connecting to the residential and industrial lots and hey presto a massive commercial buissnes boom with tons of money
its a good game but if it was that little bit easier in the budgets especially it would be worth playing that little bit longeri wiped it off my system cause it took alot of memory of my computer
now its being lent to my cuzin and im playing the sims  which has a bit of simcity in it which is quite cool
if you had simcity  and the sims  both installed on your pc you can make your own neighbourhood in the sims  but both installed at the same time would just be toooo much for my old computerplease listen to me and realize that this was a very dissapointing game
what went wrong i dont know
ea quotchallengedquot their reputation making this game cause it freaking suckspros graphics everything is more lifelike and seems almost that you can zoom in further than the other simcitys terrain builder you can build mountains hills or make valleys and lakes airport this airport actually brings in people to your city and is no longer a zone
it is premadecons difficulty certainly not for the younger crowd budget im having a lot of trouble keeping money no matter what i have like three toxic waste dumps and a naval base missile tester and still my monthly income is negative
ive raised my taxes and lowered matinence and buses and everything nothing works
major flaw
 zoning the zoning puts in streets that dont line up with other streets and if you delete you wast money because its part of the zone
 overrated look at the front of this game
never will you see buildings like that trust me
i never see blimps or helicopters
overall  i like the terrain builder a lot but thats the only thing better than simcityfinal word i was terribly dissapointed with this game
simcity is just so much better
get it and save some have fun w simcity cause you will not have much fun with thisthis game is definitely one of the most frustrating games currently out for the pc
first of all you need a very very powerful computer to even be able to play it
i have a pentium  computer with  ram and a very nice graphic card and i still got a lot of slowdownthis game is definetely for either a diehard strategists who love complicated games that involve you knowing how to attract people to your city keeping the taxes low keeping the people happy having enough jobs etc all at the same time
very difficult to do when you have your advisors screaming repetitive information back at youthe music is something in its own
it has a wonderful feature that you can access
that feature is the ability to turn the music off
the music has been repeated through every sim city and will most likely be in the next one as well
at least they were smart enough to include the ability to shut off the soundone last closing noteyou know those wonderful pictures of that city with huge skyscrapers on the back of the box and the front as well
well good luck getting your city to look like that without cheatsprepare yourself for this game
its not what you thinki had read all the ballyhoo about it and it was perhaps my heightened expectations that ultimately let me down when i first started playing itfirst of all its pretty much the same game
the core values are the same the way it works is the same not much has changed from  to scyes its prettier graphically  i like to equate it to the changeover from windows  to   but only on a visual level
the addon functions of sc are pretty slim
the game playing changes unnoticeableone of the quotchangesquot is the importation of your sims from the sims
before i purchased this game i had visions of watching my imported sims walk into stores like in hot date in sc and see them go about their daily lives but on a much bigger scale  a whole growing citybe warned this is not the case at all
you import your sims they live in a neighborhood and then proceed to bug the hell out of you about various things theyre thinking
import one and hes a chatterbox
import the six they offer and its a veritable zoo
you know how annoying popup ads are on the internet
think that
its about the samedont even think about installing pipes in your city
theyll spring a leak every two seconds even if you have water utilities fully funded and destroy surrounding neighborhood housingfully funded police stations are lazy
you have to direct them to the crimes and have them pick up the criminals
theres no patrolling with these boysdrop funding a tiny bit for the firestations and theyre out protesting with picket signs
its cute for the first five minutesit seems that maxis has forgotten what was attractive about its games in the first place and is now only after a buck
this trend started with the runaway smash hit that was the sims and followed with what
were up to six
upgrade packages  all providing extras that should have been in their initial game in the first place  or at the very least combined into one extra service package upgrade  six is tantamount to exploitation of its consumers walletsthe same goes with sc
while it is prettier visually its not the blowout wunderkind game youre expecting
get it only if youre a huge fan of simcity or if youve never played simcity before  otherwise itll likely let you down the same way it did with mesim city  was an absolute dissappointment
it was extremely boring and tiringthen came sim city  my favoite with much more enchanced style and didnt look like a game boy game
it was very fun and challenging at the same timenow were up to sim city  first thing which is kind of weird is its name
shouldnt it be sim city 
whatever more about the game
ok i admit my computer isnt really all that great
i have windows xp but with a slow gb hard drive and only a mb memory card
but still all of my programs run fine including sim city  but not sim city  sim city  on my computer is almost unplayable
the game is slower than you would ever expect
it takes minutes sometimes for it to unfreeze
it does take up a lot of computer space but still it runs very choppy
the gameplay is much more difficult in sim city  than  now you have two modes god and regular
also the game is too challenging
the game expects you to have everything just perfect
things cost more making more difficult to play
but not a fun kind of difficult a kind of difficult that makes you want to take out the cd and crack it in half
the game does have its high points though
the graphics are just outstanding and far better than  and if your computer isnt slow it can be kind of fun
but if you see sim city  standing next to sim city  for the same price grab the ever since   years now midways been spitting these games out
theyre decent fighting games plagued with mindless unneeded blood and gore
while there are many gory games out there at least their gore makes some kind of sence
as for this game it makes no sence at all
when you punch your friend in the arm blood does not go squirting in all directions does it
a mediocre fighting title that tries to be orignal by adding blood and gorevisually mortal kombat da is one of the best looking fighting games i have seen on any console only falling in a close second behind dead of alive  on the xbox
the only thing i did not like about the graphics are some of the characters
they are way way out of proportion and look very unrealistic this is very noticable in the women charactersone good thing is this game is that the menus in the game are spectacular the game starts in a hallway and depending on what game mode you choose the screen pans as you are walking down the hall into different roomsthe sound in the game is pretty good but nothing spectacular
here is where the game starts to go downhillfirst of all midway has changed the fighting system which is a good idea but it needs alot more work
each character has  different fighting styles you can choose from during the match
each fighting style has different moves and different button combinations
the first two fighting styles are basically two forms of martial art and the last fighting style is your character with a weapon
while this is a good idea it makes the game very cumbersome i am sure it would take some getting used to so this may not bother you
however one thing i really did not like is the actual game play and feel of the game
to me the characters seem slow to respond to your commands and in the meantime get pummeled by hisher opponent
even after you perform the correct button combinations for a special move your character seems to wait a split second to actually do the move which can get very frustrating especially against an opponent who only does the same cheese move for the entire matchthe same holds true for the monsterie goro motaro opponent near the end of the game
he has this move in which he sucks you towards his mouth and hits you while youre in the air
this brings me to another point mkda seems to have move cheap moves resulting in cheesy wins especially with the weapon
i never did enjoy the weapons aspect even when it was in mk and i feel that they need to be removedanother disappointing thing is that each character now only has one fatality which gets old pretty fast
you would think on a powerful system like the xbox midway would have been able to get in at least  fatalities per character but instead they settled with onefinally one thing i did not enjoy about the game is having to unlock most of the characters
you start of with  some totally new and some old ones that we know
but you can get the others by gaining various coins and going down to the crypt to buy them
basically for every computer player you beat during story mode you get x amount of coins
those coins add up and you can then go into the games crypt and open one of the  various coffins for a various amount of money
the catch is you have no idea what is in the coffin until you actually open it
most of the coffins contain artwork other coins and some are even empty
there are about  or so coffins that contain new boards and characters but they are very expensive
for example to get raiden you need  gold coins
let me put this in perspective if you beat the game with a character you may only get at most  gold coins
most coins you get are ruby and graphite coins which are not that valuable
needless to say you will be playing for a long time just to get one new character
this is not necessarily a bad thing if you dont mind playing the game over and over again but for me i would rather have all characters available or at least not so expensive to getaside from the character situation i found this game to be quite boring
to me it seemed rushed in my opinion it has so many aspects to be the best fighting game on xbox but it has fallen short
i was expecting at least  fatalities per character but there is only one
also the fact that you have to buy new characters is kind of disappointing
even if there were a code to get the characters i probably still would not buy the game because it gets boring so fastthis game is not for everyone and my suggestion is the rent this game before you buy it
which is what i didthis game is pretty bad i used to be an mk fan until they released this garbage
technically its decent but it has no personality and the combofighting system is awkward
i actually rather play mk instead of this because at least that game had the spirit of the earlier gamesd fighters have left this series in the dust i much rather play dead or alive any of themthe idea of the storyline of reign of fire is interesting to say the least and in a video game it should seem like a mindnumbingly fun idea
this ps version of reign of fire however is extremely disappointing and is just another movie licensed game to be added to the garbage heap
you get to drive around in a number of different vehicles while shooting hordes of swooping dragons and eventually after finishing the human campaign you can then choose to play as a dragon and lay fire down on helpless humans
while this all sounds like a fanboys dream on paper the games execution nearly falls flat on its face
the controls are buggy and unresponsive whether your in the human or dragon campaign and while the graphics are great and all there is a lot of slowdown when there is a lot of onscreen action
the little bit of fun that can be had with reign of fire is laying waste to the dragons the control and feel when playing as a dragon feels like your playing as a flying brick and just mowing down anything in site and after a while youll get bored with the repititious and tedious gameplay
all in all fans of the film may want to give this a look but all others should head for the hillsit almost pains me to write this review as i am sure people will hate my review as much as i hated this game
the good  absolutely beautiful game
good animations great worlds
this game is great for people who will take the hours necessary to master the racing in this game
this game could last forever for them
the bad  however for those of us with lives that like to game from time to time for some fun times avoid this game at all costs
it is flipping hard
without hours of practice you will slam into  walls of every race thus insuring your defeat and frustrationbottom line  is it fun
if you have lots of time to master it
i am told you will love the game once you do
will i keep it
i am also told you have no life if you spend it all mastering the fine art of a video game
is it for kids
nope
too hardthis was a gift for my yr old one of his starter psp  games
unfortunately he hasnt played it much saying it is too difficult
even his yr old video game savant brother concurred
guess i blew that one
the  start may me more of a comment on me and not the game
balance my comments by older players thoughts for better analysisi was so excited to finally get this game in the mail
i could not wait to open it and play it but when i sat down and played it i absolutely hated it and wound up putting it down almost instantly
i wanted to love it i tried my hardest to like it i even tried to force myself to like it but i cant do itfirst controlling the vehicles is not too bad the schematics are pretty good
however the handeling of the vehicles is an absolute nightmare
there is no middle ground the vehicles either have a horrible handeling in which you cant turn quickly and bang into walls every  feet or they have too much handeling where you are swerving all over the track banging into walls every  feet from over compensating the controls
and yes i know you have to use the air brake system but who the hell wants to use that through the whole race i want speed not brakes and percisionthis leads me to my second point the tracks
the worlds are magnificient and the graphics are absolutely awesome however the tracks are so skinny and narrow
forget about the control with a good handeling vehicle try navigating the tracks with the pirhana who has the worst handeling its impossible
secondly the tracks are so linear straight and boring
big deal you give me a turn or a jump the least they could have done was make different routes or im not asking for anything as expanseive as midnight club but give me something meet me half way maybe to the point of star wars racer revenge where you dont have infinite directions but there are multiple routes and forks in the tracksthe difficulty of this game is absolutely annoying for a casual gamer like myself
this game is meant for gamers not people who play it on the subway to pass time on the commute
unless you have the time to invest in this game do not bother getting it as it will make you miserable and frustrate you beyond imagination
game makers should make games for everyone not just people who play video games  hours a day
even games like resident evil and silent hill have an easy or beginner mode for people like me and a nightmare mode for real gamerslastly for a game that prides itself on being about high speed crafts and such the game is slow as anything
yes you get to hit like mph on the track but you spend more time banging into walls racing at  mph and sitting in last place
for a game that is supposed to be full of action you see none of it since the action for you stops if you bang into something
really
this is supposed to be fun
the weapons you can get are really cool but unfortunately the one you get the most is the shield i dont want the shield i want a missile
in essence the game is beautifully crafted the worlds and graphics are amazing and the vehicles have very cool designs
that is why i gave it  additional star
the music is a technoey mix which is pretty good too
one additional point on the game speed while the craft is moving mph it looks like you are going mph the speed factor was not done well at all i can walk faster than the craft moves
but please unless you have time to invest in this game and practice and you have the patience of a saint and are a graceful loser than do not buy this game as it will anger you beyond belief
and be ready the opposition always get the missiles and you get stuck with the dumb pointless shieldfor better psp racing cames check out midnight club this can get repetitive after a while but at least you have infinte directions to go in and tons of races and carsfor better racing games in general for ps check out midnight club  mc dub edition star wars racer revenge and twisted metal black not racing but vehicular combat is beyond awesomei know the little fan boys are going to tear into me but i dont care because someone needs to stand up for the casual gameri was anxiously waiting for this game when i played it i didnt liked it
its fun i didnt like the whole thing about you protecting mario and then he cries if the baddies get to him
some parts are like strategically you have to figure out what to do i didnt liked it but it was someewhat funwell i got the game because i thought it would have cute animals 
well if you call animals that call each other names  say you are lame  fight and just plain act rude
then i guess this is the game for you 
but i dont think small kids need to see game animals act so bratty 
i would also like to know why so many of the girl animals seem so stuck up and obsessed with there looks 
i think the game was made by a guys 
i also found it anoying that the store was closed so much of the time the game is ok
but slow and my kids hated it 
also to the reviewer that said there  year old can play because the game was mostly icons 
that is just not true you have to read all the time and write letters 
but when you get letters back they will tell you that you are hard to under stand or you just are dumb
if you just want to kill time then play 
but becareful they might hurt your feelings what happens when you find yourself trapped in a world where animals can speak
animal crossing is that world
animal crossing offers some of the most innovative game play nintendo has to offer but was very poorly executedanimal crossing is a neat little game where you enter a town run by animals
the animals can speak english
believe it or not nintendo actually programmed the game to phonetically sound out everything being said
this means that if you close your eyes you can still understand the dialog even though it has been sped up to the speed of the alvin simon and theodore
all the animals talk like this with various tonal differences
ivan the russian bear speaks with a deep voice while the cat i do not remember her name speaks in a high pitched voice
this is called animalese
animalese is great because of the phonetic speech but can become quickly annoying
there is also a silent voice where text just appears and an option where you get the standard beep tone every time a word appears onscreen
for the duration of my play i left it on animalese to see if nintendo kept the speech  consistent through the game
believe it or not they didthe game has an interesting beginning
before you see your character you are asked questions by a cat on a train
the cat will ask you your name which becomes the name you will be addressed by through out the game
then you are asked what you think of your name
by answering it is a good name the cat assumes you are a boy
alternatively by answering it is a cute name the cat thinks you are a girl
you then receive a chance to correct the cat if he guesses your gender incorrectly because of the option you chose
once you exit the train a raccoon named tom nook will show you to a group of four houses
these houses are possible starting points for you
once you select a house the raccoon tells you that you owe him for the house
at this point you spend most of your time paying for the house rather than having fun
initially you begin paying for your house by running errands for nook
he then sets you free to find your own way of running errands
you must pay nook at least  bells bells is the currency a week
if you do not like being indebt get used to it in this gamethe real fun begins once tom nook sets you loose
you have more time to explore the town
nintendo had the foresight to employ the game cubes internal clock to have an effect on play
the game is in real time and stuff changes even while you are not playing though you should not leave your game cube on all day and night
the townsfolk have their set schedules that they follow
most of them stay near their houses in the night hours but may walk the town during the day time
even the post office changes clerks depending on the time you are playing the game
you must also remember to not play the game too long
if you keep interacting with the townsfolk all day and all night they will not get their much needed sleep and will tend to be very curt with you the next time you turn on your game cube
this can be very amusing but upset neighbors can really impede your progressthe environments are well  portrayed
overall nintendo kept a childlike feel to animal crossing
the graphics are simple and the environments are easy to navigate
the size of the town is rather small so depending on your preference this can either be a positive or a negative to the overall game
i am personally pleased with the ability to customize the inside of your house though you spend so little time inside that it becomes as useless as the room feature in pokeacutemon gs
my only issue with the towns is when you are running errands sometimes you need to run from one end to the exact opposite end of the town
this not only takes time but can get tediousanimal crossing supports the gameboy advance ereader
with the ereader you can add furniture and other items to your inventory
this is a neat idea
personally i enjoy little antics and innovations like this but in animal crossing you can even swipe the ereader classic games and be able to play them on your nintendo if you buy one from tom nook
the ereader cards are an incurred cost as you actually have to go out an buy them but prove to be more like the pokeacutemon trading card game short livedi found animal crossing to be a very repetitive game
you spend most of your time running errands and interacting with the townspeople
this tends to get very repetitive
if i wanted to work on my relationships with others i would play the sims  pc and ps by electronic arts
as for the gameboy advance ereader interaction i find this to be a more costly expense than it is worth
in all seriousness who really wants to go out and spend more money on cards that they will only use for animal crossing then throw away when they get rid of their nintendo game cube
my largest complaint about animal crossing is that by the time i got a shovel i could not use it the way i wanted
if i could have the towns population would drop to  and there would be dirt mounds near each villagers houseoverall animal crossing finds the same replay value as harvest moon
you either enjoy the repetition or you hate it
because of its simple nature i can see animal crossing appealing to players under   for more intelligent players or players who do not work in factories i recommend staying away from this game
needless to say i did not like animal crossingmaybe its just me but im seriously considering the possibility that nintendos animal crossing has millions of people brainwashed
when i read such positive reviews about such an uninspiring game i thought of the old horror flick halloween iii
get the picture
if you dont simply watch h and youll come to understandnow about the game itself
animal crossing was a marketing success but a nightmare behind closed doors for those who felt definite disappointment in the overall release
of course the majority of those who own animal crossing may feel a bit different
those of us who were looking for something more were surely left in the dark
animal crossing could have been a great game
instead it was released with stone age graphics very limited real life concepts and nothing to offer for the more mature gaming communitynot all of animal crossing is terrible
the real time concept was unique and impressive
anything else brought into the same light would be considered a joke
many would like to put thesims and animal crossing in the same boat but the two really cant be compared
thesims has endless possibilities while animal crossing is extremely limited
two stars are given for innovation and innovation alone
animal crossing could have been a game of sheer genius
couldashouldawoulda  blahi will start by saying that my sister is an addict of this game
so is my friend who has not only moved into town but has already payed off and made an addition to his little virtual house
i personally cant stand this gamei have played this for maybe  minutes and that was enough for me
very slow paced and boringthis game would probably be fun to little kids but i really disliked it
very boring and no practice of free will
if youre  or over dont do itfirst of all let me say that this is an amazing game in ways
it runs on a realtime clock and the conditions change from morning to day to night
this is really nice and adds a real boost to its already high originality
this is baisically the sims nintendo style
all the townsfolk are animals and the player is a strange looking boy or girlnow the gc is known for the quotkiddyquot games and this dosent help it
but i dont really care about that so ill skip that parthowever the graphics are seriously subpar for the gamecube
somethings look nice and smooth while the animals and players and just about everything else are boxlike and not smooth at all
however graphics dont make or break a gamethe sound is also subpar but i guess it goes good with the quothappygoluckyquot aspect of the game
it is usually a cheezy piano song or the quottown songquot which you can change to whatever you want
i feel the the sfx are overly used but thats just menow for the biggie the fun factor
youve probably all heard that there are a ton of things to do and you cant really beat the game just keep playing
lots of things to do sounds good right
not in this game
you get to town and are  quotbellsquot in debt for your house the size of a small cubicle
i paid this off in about  hrs
then you can make your house bigger and get another  bells in debt
collect shells and fruit and youll pay it off in no time
then a few new options open up
you can buy a bug net and a fishing pole and a shovel
you can fish collect bugs and dig up fossils and sometimes bags of money
you can either sell your captured insects and fish to the store or donate then to the town hall
sounds fun
not really
fun for an hour or two and then catching bugs and fishing can get boring fast
i rented this for free as a promotion from blockbusterthank god instead of buying it
im glad
after you finally get debtfree you can collect things find fossils and fish and hunt bugs and thats about it
i have only had it  days and am bored stiff with itrent this game maybe twice but dont buy it unless you have unlocked all the activites and have fun with them allbottom lineliterally close but no cigari think this game is great for young children but it wasnt really my thing
although there are people out there that love it
its too time consuming
i love to get a new game and play it nonstop for week or two but this game requires more time
so much more timei am still on the fence on this one
i cant even call this an improvement to the series
at least you can score unlike the  goals in  shots like   let me start by saying this market is ripe for a decent hockey game
ea has yet to put it all together and deliver for ps hopefully next yearok on to this gamethe fluid animations are for the most part gone as well as the majority of digitized faces
in are choppy cut scenes and horribly proportioned faces with one large eye looming as they skate by you will see
the speed burst button and big hit button are no longer the be all end all
now we are actually forced to deke and poke checkhook even though it still isnt very effective
nothing frustrates more than lining up the big hit and your guy launching the other way
what the heck is that
players also seem to skate their own way even when you are controlling them yes even more so now
the create a player is basically unchanged
fighting is better now thank god
no more getting laid out by claude lemieuxin a nutshell this is the same ea game we have seen for years with the run of the mill tweaks
the only reason i keep playing is because ea minutely changes the game play every year and i am always hoping it is better
yet again not this year
still as bad as last year
buy if you must after all there arent really any real hockey games out therei bought this game because if there is one thing i could expect it was that the ea nhl series was always getting better
i was wrong this time
ea took a step back on thisps revived madden it should have done the same for the nhl series
the commentary is bad the rosters i wont even go there shame on you the ai ea has promised better ai every year and i still score at willrosters need to be better updated for  the franchise mode needs to be more maddenized and so do the custome teams
this year i recomend segas nhl k and i never thought i would say thatneed for speed is the only game or family of games that ive played for almost ten years
i still recall fondly the first version that came out on the original playstation
it was such a technical and entertaining breakthrough back thenthe present version for gamecube is unfortunately quite a significant letdown
maybe its because i played it after playing burnout  for the xbox an outstanding arcade racer that packs tons of action with impressive graphics
need for speed hot pursuit  on the other hand feels very lame
the framerate is the most serious problem even on an empty open road the graphics can become jerky
when you have cops on your tail and a couple other cars on the road the framerate can drop so low that the game is almost unplayable for a second or two
this just gives a frustrating experiencethe graphics is also lacking compared to gran turismo and burnout and other outstanding racing games
i dont think its a problem with gamecubes processing power other racing games have better graphics on the gc than need for speed
its apparently because ea uses the need for speed series as a cash cow to hook longtime fans such as yours truly and they just dont invest much in improving the games look and feel
three or four years ago this games graphics would have been acceptable but not in todays crowded racing game marketplacecar physics is also annoying for an arcade game like this
burnout  has the perfect arcade nonrealistic physics which makes controlling your cars and racing so much fun and enjoyable
need for speed on the other hand turns into a rather frustrating experiencein short this game suckssince i have always been a fan of the need for speed series since its inception on the do system i bought the xbox version of this game the day it came out i thought it would have to be better than the ps version right
wrong
despite the obvious lack of playstation  technical capability the ps version is actually much much better
the xbox version plays like a beta of the ps version
it has several mistakes i noticed right away incorrect statistics cars driving on the left side of the road in us locales etc and the bottom line is the xbox one isnt fast or fun and the ps one is
luckily they took back my xbox version and gave me a ps version
and btw only the pc version will have online play unfortunatelyi thought this game was cool at first but after the first week it got extremley boring
whats up with the cars driving on the wrong side of the road
the graphics are ok and the good thing is the custom soundtracks because the games soundtrack sucks
instead of buying this one buy underground i was never a fan of the playstation  controller
i dont like the fact that the analog stick replaced the directional pad
using an analog stick is annoying because you dont feel comfortable with it
ask any older gamer they will tell you that you felt more in control of your movements with a directional pad
with an analog stick you slide all over the place
in addition to that disaster the ps controller also suffers from too many buttons
we shouldnt have to have a degree in rocket science to figure out how to successfully figure out and complete a game
the playstation one had the best controller ever
it was comfortable you were always in complete control and it just looked betteri decided to purchase this game because my links was having erratic results when i purchased a new computer with a gig processor
i hoped that the new game would respond better to mouse clicks
well  thats the only thing i can say good about the game
other than that the graphics are horrible
making an internet connection is next to impossible
it takes over a gig of harddrive space if you install it in its entirety and it will not load your older ls games even though the advertising says it willi would only recommend this to someone i didnt likei have played other lotr games before including the hobbit for gamecube but i couldnt enjoy this gamethe first disadvantage is when you first start the game
a long ctscene plays and every two to three seconds the screen flashes white which causes splitting headaches for people with eye problemsyou also must use a keyboard to play which is extremely difficult i cant even get out of hobbiton without falling off a bridge
the game doesnt support gamepads special controllers that you can plug in to your computer to play a game and if it had the gaming experience would be easierthe graphics are choppy which also tend to hurt your eyes occasionally
sometimes when youre walking around its hard to tell where youre going as trees and such sort of flash bythere are two advantages however for this game
one is that it doesnt take as long as other pcmac games to install and the other is that this game is purely based on the lotr books not the movies so that you feel like you are playing the original adventureoverrall get this game if you are a diehard tolkien fan but keep in mind that there are more disadvantages than advantages to playing itit looks like lots of lord of the rings stuffs are coming out and here we have a game
it looks real cool on the outside but inside is a different dimensionthe biggest problem of the game is that this game has no main dish
what it means is that its kind of hard to tell what this games real genre isits looks like actionbeating up monsters but there arent any real attack combos or sword tricks or any intense moves
and the other one is that battles and sword fights are just too simple
when you meet some scary looking monsters on your way you just place your character facing that monster and just keep clicking the mouse with not much thinking until that monster hits its face one the groundand there are simple range attacks so if you have time you just need to shoot and feed those monsters with arrows while theyre coming to get you and when they get close you just do that simple sword excersice i mentionedand there are magic attacks but most of them are not so effective so you only use one or two for battleand the bad camera view really adds furstration to the gamethe characters keep blocking your way so its sometimes hard to see where youre goingoh lost your health during the last battle then you can find some healing stuff lying around somewhere
and you can find some more after few battles later and some more after battles and some more after battles and more and more and morethat means the games not much challengingand it looks like an adventure game if look at it at a different anglebecause of the weak action
but it just dont look like one because there aint no challenging puzzles or path finding or anythingand level designs just not done with much creativityfinally the violence part
this game is not very violentiveok its violentive sometimes and has some blood but not very real lookingonly few big blood drops goes flying in the airoverall not the kind of game that makes up to its namebut the short movies in the game and charaters talking in games are good but gameplay is not that fun
so wait for two towers it should be betterill try to be nice and start with the goodthere are parts of this game visually that are beautiful
i played it to the end just for that aspect alone
the graphics in all modes whether youre playing as fp rdp or watching a cut scene are very nicereally beautiful
moria was my favorite the balrog and gandalfs fall into shadow was coolin many ways its true to lotr books and a nice way to learn the basic story if you cantwont read the books
also there are parts of the books that you dont get in the movies
tom bombadil as annoying as he may be and narzil reforged being the biggest points
one quirky thingin the cut scenes the characters look much different than the characters when youre playing themwhich is odd
i found it funny that in the cutscenes the hobbits have curly hair as hobbits do but in the game they all have staight hairin fact everyone who has hair has straight hairhere are the major downfallssome of which are maddeningthe gameplay is shamefully bad
did no one test this game
shame on them
first you cant fight in fp mode other than to use your alternative weapon rock bow magick
so youre forced to fight in rdp mode and suddenly the camera angle goes haywire
you cant see who or what youre fighting or suddenly theres a tree or a wall in your way
this is inexcusable imhoalso you cant choose which character you can play and theres no changing the difficulty
you cant venture very far and just look around either  no replay valueadd on that the characters all move like theyre cave trolls on smack and youve got a recipe for disaster
no skill really requiredyou keep pounding away at your mouse
not so much fun or good for the hardwareif thats not enough i found the game to be rather buggy
once in moria gandalf was stuck in a walli couldnt move and had to start over
it crashed my system many times and i have a stouthearted system that even samwise the brave would admirealso there are times when you really dont have to fight anyone at all to pass the level
this is especially helpful when youre frodo since he cant do much of anything
if you just run to the end picking up mushrooms cram and lembas as you go you can pass to the next phase
i did this several times with frodo with the ghosts paths of the dead
 the orcs in moria and the urkuhai just before the end
why bother playing at all
and what about the ring which i think i used once just to put the darn thing on a see what happens
who cares about gaining purity when you dont have to use the ring
the puzzles were laughably easy and the game was so short i was angry that id actually paid for this bundle of junk
its a total ripoff that completely takes advantage of the new generation of tolkien fans that the movies have created
obviously peter jackson had nothing to do with the gameive played more engaging games on a commodore bottom line save your moneytolkien enterprises doesnt need iti only just received this game via ups a few days ago and already i am highly disillusioned and highly tempted to put the game away or sell it to an action genre which is what this game really seems to be more of fan and rue the loss of what might have been a truly fantastic game
i have been a tolkein fan since  long long ago and when i read the hype on this game and how it stuck to the books by tolkein upon which i wrote my college english lit thesis i decided that this was an adventure game that i really wanted to have
at the beginning of the game we find frodo running helter skelter all over the shire doing mundane tasks not found in the books
finally we finish with that and head to bywater very short and sweet and wonder what that was all about
we head back to baggend to retrieve the ring and to hand over the key to mr gamgee which is the beginning of the action genre
from that point on i found that i as frodo was totally unable to get out of the gamgees front yard before i was killed by a black rider after the th death i called it quits and headed heresecondly we have far too many keyboard mouse and mousekeyboard controls and are not given any where near the time to learn all of the controls before the attacks begin and we find ourselves in need of controls that up until now havent even been used in the game
unless you are really an action fan and dont mind lots of controls and have an excellent memory and extremely dexterous fingers i would say  leave this one on the shelfi was one of those people who saw and loved the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring
 the classic movie
i thought the video game would be much of the same
fun great story good graphics and overall just something to spend time playing
well i was wrong
this game is nothing like the movie and in my opinion was a very overhyped game
why
the gameplay its just boring
you start off spending an hour in the shire trying to do various tasks which are rewarded very lightly
for example you have to give the lady whos buying your house a letter which takes  minutes to find usually more
there is no map of the shire no hints of what to do
everything has to be figured out by yourself
so after you find the little paper or letter you walk back to give it to her
but nooooooooo wait you have to find another item without any help and ring a bell because she believe there are wolves in the shire
thats another  minutes if your lucky  minutes if your not
you also have to complete close to a dozen tasks to get your corruption rating up
if you become to corrupted its a second bar above your health you just die
i had to start over several times because of that
so say that somehow you do get all this done get stocked with supplies talk to everyone and are ready to go in less than  hours you must escape the black riders
i did this and it is extremely difficult and yet in parts so easy its stupid
there is always a certain area you can go where the black riders cant get u and yet at the end u must make a run for it
no where to go no where to hide
and the black rider you must at the end escape from is on a horse
well if you get past all that in  hours without dieing your lucky
most people dont
and the whole process is just boring
no excitement no real rewards
i hated the first partwell once your out of the shire you head into a forest
the forest is full of creatures which are all so easy to kill
you must find your  companions who came with u who somehow get lost in  different parts of the forest
this alone took another hour and if your not lucky youll get lost forever literally
once past that you are caught by a willow tree when u are suddenly saved by a fat short man named tom bambaldi or something like that
you must then find  lilies which takes another  minutes
at this point i had died  times had not found anything i liked was bored and was just sick of the repetitiveness of the game
that was my wonderful experience playing this game luckily i rented and returned the next daygraphics this would get probably  stars
the graphics are pretty goood but are ps graphics
it wasnt what it could have been
for example the black riders are in total d and look really cool
but their capes for some reason are flat and are in d
very dumb
you cant go in the water which once again looks very bad
the leaves you can quote run through you can only run through once
and they are very rare only a few for each part of the level
but in many aspects the game was good
you can break many things and thats always fun as they fully destruct
the shire is brought to life well and in many ways this game was fun to look at
but with the horrible gameplay this game could not be saved
sound  lasting appeal well the voice acting was fantastic and the one point where this game was  stars
it was always fun to listen to people talk and the cut scenes are very well done
unfortunantly this was the only fun part of the game
as for the lasting appeal none
it takes  hours just to get a chapter into the story and the whole thing im afraid just bored meif you think you can stand all this then this is the game for u persounally i think a game should start out easy and become challenging later on and let u do something cool and interesting within the first hour
some may like this game but i sure didnt
overhyped and overbought the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring for the xbox ps and pc was a disapointment in my mindhope this helped and i prevented those who would have hated this game from making a very tragic decisionthxlooking like a d age of empires with three separate races almost as different as to be like starcraft age of mythology had potential to be a great gamedespite being an old game of only  gigabytes or so the game ran smoothly with units moving in formation automatically looking quite smooth and small
it is still gratifying to see villagers hit a tree with a few axe hits then see the thing keel over and stay on the ground until its been fully chopped or to see dying units stay on the field gradually disintegrating into corpses then into nothingtheres nothing wrong at all with the engine or the animation or anything
it was fun and highly entertaining
the thing that drags this game down is where all strategy games should shine their brightest combata single greek hoplite takes up  population points with each house providing  population points each town center about  i forget and you receiving a limit of  houses on a map and only as many town centers as there are villages on the map which as as sparingly placed as gold mines so youre never likely to have an army bigger than a few dozen units at a timebut youre never likely to get  or even  units on the field at once
the higher up you progress on the unit scale the more population each unit eats up
none of the units is particularly effective against other units save to bash at them for a minute or so before their target diesthe mixing of mythology and reality in the game is almost seamless but theres still a sense of disbelief to it and when even the most basic myth unit overpowers some of the toughest human units it pretty much becomes a literal age of mythologybattles will be decided mostly by myth units
it doesnt matter if youve amassed an army of hundreds of basic infantry because a wave of colossi or dragons or anubites or a spell like meteor lightning storm etc will wipe them out in minutes if they are in big enough numbergod powers are another thing that are grossly overpowered
while its absolutely beautiful watching meteor strike smack into an enemy base and leave giant craters while temporarily flooding the area with light its a bit much to see almost the entire selected patch of an enemy base crumbling before a single meteor strike or earthquake or whatever
granted you can only use this godpower once per level but who needs to use it more than oncemyth units get progressively stronger as you upgrade and select different gods to worship and gain their respective powers upgrades and myth units but in the end all infantry and cavalry are rendered useless before the might of the myth units
the same problem that plagued red alert  plagues this gamegoods simple yet smooth and beautiful graphics make the game fun to watch a complex array of units awaits those who wish to fight with humans rather than myth units units speak their native languages greeks speak ancient greek egyptians speak ancient egyptian norse speak some sort of scandinavian easy and steady interface makes it userfriendly and not a mad rush for resources or a mad rush for infantry
slow and steady could actually win you the race if youre playing wiselyneutral myth units are a bit garish in their style and size god powers can be used only once which is good for some like meteor or earthquake and bad for others buildings can take a long time to break down requiring siege equipmentbad myth units are grossly overpowered and render human infantry useless once into the midst of the game strict population limits and high unit population cost means combat will be limited and no more than  units can be fielded by one side at a time repetitive nature of myth units and god powers makes replayability a myth in itself god powers are souped up superweapons with an earthquake capable of leveling an entire enemy base of all its buildings save for town centers fortresses and other heavier buildingsall in all it was a fun game to play at first but replayability is not a realistic thought
myth units dominate the game which some would argue they should being as the name of the game is age of mythology but it does so at the cost of human infantry entirely
if myth units are designed to be the elite in this game why bother with so much work on an extensive and quite complex selection of human infantrycavalrythat appears to be my only major problem but its a big onewhile at the mall i was pretty bored of most strategic games
so i picked up age of mythology thinking i would be treated to a great gift
but now i have mixed feelings for the gameit is just like ages of empires
the resources are the same and gathering them are the same
but there is a new one called favor
to buy myth units or certain upgrades you need favor
for the greeks you pray at a temple egyptians build monuments and norse fight
the greeks are basically the regular race
the main one in the game
they are okay but kinda boring after a while
the egyptians have cool god powers and do not really need to chop wood for any reason
the norse are the best they have the best units and can build quickly with their army
while playing online norse always dominate because they build several fortresses right outside your town then attack
because norse build buildings with their infantry they have a huge advantage
but their godpowers are not that great compared to the other racesgod powers are given to you when you advance an age
if you advance to a new age you get to pick a minor god to worship and each god has its own god power
most of the god powers are kinda lame and you can just waste
zeus has a lighting bolt which kills one unit but does not kill main units in the story so it has no point
the only good ones are meteor tornado plenty vault and earthquake
meteor and tornado are the best egyptian god powers because they decimate areas of buildings
earthquake and plenty vault rock
earthquake belongs to the greek and totally destroys every building in an area
plenty vault also belongs to the greek and provides a steady resource flowbut the fighting gets old
the unit selection is awesome but still norse will win
norse have the best units and just rock
egyptian do not need alot of wood so they can be good
greek needs everything and the only rewarding experience is the  god powers i mentioned above
if you truly love ages of empire you can like this game
most missions result in you killing one unit then going on to the next mission and rebuilding your base all over
so the campaign gets really frustrating
especially on moderate where the attacks are constant
in all seriousness if you want to buy this game go ahead but please wait till it is on salei was really annoyed when ensemble said they would be making aom instead of the next quotagequot game perhaps quotage of imperialismquot which would go from the colonial period to perhaps the mids
but since they were making it anyway i thought i might as well try it out
it definitely didnt have the same feel as the other age games
sure you started out with a town center and some villagers and a scout but the d just looks bad
and the sounds werent very good either
and only  races
i was very disappointed
i hope they hurry up and deliver the next age game and make it right next timei find it hard to believe that the worlds most powerful software company is putting out an rts game in  that is this thin
dont get me wrong i agree with the other reviewers who say that aom delivers the best graphics of any strategy game to date
in addition to this id like to add that aom uses system resources very efficiently after  hours of gaming i have experienced exactly zero crashes and plays quickly no more  hour marathons like we had with age of empires
and suprisingly for an ms product the game also has pretty darn good instructions although you really wont need these if youve ever played an rts beforebut this is why i give it two stars very limited selection of warriors and special creatures only two types of horseman two types of footman and four types of mythic creatures on any one side aoe has at least three times as many unit types only four levels for single user random map play and this from a game that advertises on the box quotstrategic depthquot steep limitations on use of god powers god powers not really that powerful and are at best uninspired the games ai that is used to run your opponents is more artificial than intelligent due to the above and unlike many of other rtss this game has very little replay value and thus isnt worth the steep price ms is askingi have never played  or  but from what ive read and heard they have all the parts of this game that i didnt like amplified
i originally rented this years ago in a quest for a new platform in between spyros
it was kind of cute but everything just seemed dull and repetitive
no puzzles missions or anything
just firing at enemies
eventually i got to an area where i couldnt find the way through passed the controller onok folks here it is if youre thinking about buying this game pick up gauntlet dark legacy instead
this game is the perfect example of how video game companies will try to capitolize on anything they can get thier greedy littl hands on without putting any effort into trying to make a game thats even slightly interesting
the combat is monotonous the levels are straight out of the first two movies so if youve seen them theres really nothing to motivate you to try and finish the game
the controls are unresponsive do you need to know anything elseim not a fan of the lord of the rings movies and i still dont know why i accidentally have this game cause the graphics and the fighting system was looking cool
but all of it fails into a disappointmentwhen you put the cd you are encouraged to watch a video clip from the movie you cant skip the cutscenes in this games and they have a long length
you see more of the real movie clips and less of d cut scenes which means that was a lacked effort of the producers of the gamefirst there was this tutorial in this game that didnt help a lot
when you fight with any characters you get knocked down very easily and is just a matter of second until your character is dead then again you have to watch the cut scenes without being able to skip it and start the entire level againother than that all the characters are different but the game play issues are still there there is also a combo system where you can purchase different attacks depending on the experiences you got in the stagelevel
the game is cheap and very linear no turning back just go straight forward and sometimes the static cameras wont help because the game usually overwhelms you with enemies orcs and orcs and zzzzz
the game is still good looking sometimes and is not special compared to other games that i have playedbuy or rent
rent it
dont think that because you are a fan of the movies you will like this gamethe only reason i gave this game more than one star is the graphics which are pretty decent
however the rest of the game is another story
first off it is amazingly short it took me one day to beat it and i was only playing it when the movie i was watching was on commercial
it consists of  quotlevelsquot where the only objective is to kill orcs you cannot adjust your camera angle which leads to very awkward battling and you have to memorise complicated quotmovesquot for instance one was xxor to even have a chance in helms deep they do let you change characters however aaragon is the only useful one i tried the other  but then you have to memorise even more ridiculous movesto sum it all up it is basicly short clips of the movie where they let you play in a few scenes
the total gameplay is  hours max i beat it in i was truly disappointed in this game
however it is worthy of renting for fans of the movieit wasnt that good at all
constantly the same fighting all the time
it doesnt even follow the two towers story line
it follows fellowship of the ringit would have been better if there was a two player mode and a little more to itthe lord of the rings the two towers is not a bad game
if it were  hours long i would give it  stars but the fact is if you are familiar with button mashers like this one this game will take around  hours
it is no doubt worth renting but thats all you need
if youre a die hard lotr fan maybe its a purchase but then again youre still getting the short end of the stick
the game that does exsist however is good
i would have liked there to be more strategy than just button mashing but what the heck its fun
you get all these combos but the funny thing is you never seem to be able to use them
the strategy that is involved basically is parrying with square and retaliating in a drunken mashing way
the graphics are great in every level after the fourth but until then theyre pretty mediocre
the music from the movie is a great addition but the clips thrown together from the movie dont typically make sense together but that was kinda like the movie too
i read the books so i get it but when my brother walked out of the movie he didnt even know some of the characters names since the movie kinda only said some characters name once or twice even gimli and legolas were referred to as the midget and the elf by some family members after the movie
the controls are ok but the combos are really frustrating because the enemies always whack you while youre cranking out a long one
overall the game that is there is good but the rest is unbalanced short overrated and sorry to say a lotr disgraceafter reading previous reviews i dont think anyone over  who is not a lotr geek has reviewed this game
so heres my two cents
this was a great idea
the guy at the game store said its a lot like dynasty warriors
not
not even close
while its pretty to look at and has great cuts from the movie its basically a pretty lame fighting game
terribly sluggish control bogs down any furious action mashing game play
control is very unresponsive for my taste
scoring any kind of combo is trial and error and unfair
it all about timing
i felt like i was playing kengo
i want blazing speed in my hack and slash battle games
timed moves are for wrestling games
sigh the levels are pretty shallow and the camera is fixed
fixed for goodness sake
hey
where did my guy go
bad idea
onimusha does this so much better
the two towers is beautiful to look at but as any serious gamer knows game play is everything
and the two towers is just not that fun
once again someone has made a mediocre game to cash in on a hot frachise
too badif youre looking for a game that puts you into the heart of an hour long battle buy dynasty warriors  or  its far superior
and way more fun
or if you dont mind fixed camera action go for onimusha  or  avoid the two towers
its short and disappointingwhat does durability mean in the rating
replay value
were reviewing video games here people not tonka toyseducational
yeah i learned what a sore thumb feels likerated m for mediocrelatefor the life of mei cant figure out why so many people think that this is a great gamethe sims on the pc is mildly amusingbut it gets sooooo repetitiveget upclean upgo to the bathroomeatgo to workcome homewatch tvgo to sleep now repeat about  times
sadlythe ps version is even worseas a matter of facti could tell early on in the gamethat this was a rushed projecttheres only a handful of diffrent styles to choose from esp
with the accesoriesand hairstylesmost of the hairstyles look really dumb by the wayalso you can only make your sim have a punk lookmohawkgoth make upif your sim is femalewhy
i thought that the sims was supposed to have all these outrageous optionsas for the get a life modeits a total jokethere were some good concepts put inbut the creators tied them together terriblyone of the main problems was that there was such a flimsy stress on the time schedulethe mom would never go to sleep at a certain timesometimes she would sleep all nightsometimes she would stay up and then sleep all dayyou will also be annoyed at how many times she will wake you up at  or  in the morning just to watch tv or listen to the radio
the mom is also a total slobthrowing trash on the floorleaving dirty dishes out and even going to the bathroom in the kitchenwhats even worse is that you have to play this terrible mode of play in order to unlock certain furniture in the regular sims modebelieve meafter hearing mom nag at you for about  of the things that are her faultyoull be quitting this really quick
i dont knowi guess the sims is a game that you either love or hatethis is just my opinionbut i dont understand what all the hype is aboutif you are one of the many sims fans howeveri suggest you play this game on the pc rather than the psthis game is not as great as you might think it would beim just mad that i wasted  on this oneintroductionthe anticipation for this game was building up inside me i get it and gto  i was expecting this to be the best sims ever
i was shot downgameplay i was very dissapoited in the way you move your sim
i was hoping you would actually move him with the left anaolg stick having control over his whole body
not like in the computer game
also in the computer game there are three speed options
  and   you press   or  on the keyboard and it will go that speed
on this game u have to hold down r and it doesnt go higher than   big flaw
when you go to sleep its speed  automatically
i really dont like the fact that you cant build two story houses another terribly dissapointing factor
also i hate having to unlock the stuff in the buy mode
i wish i could just play freely
the gameplay is terrible and i really honestly have nothing to good to say about itgraphics compared to the computer game this is definitely better
when you get in the hot tub steam comes out from it as well as the cooler
there are more face options and the people look more realistic
i definitely feel more in the game then controlling the game
nothing bad to say here but they didnt look amazing so  suits it wellsound ahhh yes sim music
everything is the same as in the computer game
except they speak clearer not that it matters
the music really isnt that bad but gets annoying sometimes
the sound fx are good not greatplay time you can play it forever but you wont want to
not only because the game is bad but because you just start to get bored after a whileoverall i was really dissapointed
i was hoping for more and i think ea games could have made this much much better
go buy the computer games they are waay betterfinal recommendationdo not buy this game
if you really really wanna check it out rent it first
do not buy on the spot i did and its been collecting dust in my quotbad game pilequot
the only good thing about this game is the graphicstheres only one word to describe this game  ea
its coming out on gamecube and xbox new and improved over the ps version just like james bond agent under fire james bond nightfire lord of the rings the two towers and metal of honor frontline did
ps is my favorite system but dont waste your time with one of eas downgraded products for iti bought this game as soon as it came out as im addicted to the computer sims
its nothing like the original sims
the basic premise is the same but the controls are horrible
one of the best parts of the game is to build your own house for your sims
no matter how i tried it i couldnt get it to happen
i would recommend avoiding this game at all costs
theres a good reason why so many people are selling this game in the amazoncom marketplacethis game is sooo stupid because it has the worst graphics ever but there are some good qualities about this game they are that there is a cool two players games
wait correction that is the only good quality
trust me i myself own this game but  xboxdont buy borrow rent dont buy get ourself frustrated some other way that does not cost moneyok mario party is fun
but i think that a  is not good
mario party one was very good two was ok and  was sooo boring and just the same again
i know everybody is going to say oh but this one is diferent is for ngc but is always the same
so if you already have one mario party that will do but if you dont hava anyone but the  for the ngci thoroughly enjoyed the first cameron files game
it was atmospheric the characters were quirky and interesting and the story line was reasonably consistent
it wasnt the best adventure game ive ever played but it gave me a few evenings of harmless amusementas for the sequelit seems incomplete
the story line has gaps there are characters who appear contribute nothing to the plot then disappear what was the telepathic russian countess all about for heavens sake
there are puzzles which lead nowhere  like the coded message found on an enigma machine which turned out to be a depressingly simple cipher and which wasnt used later in the game
the settings were bland and uninteresting the designers could have learned something from riddle of the sphinxi cant help suspecting that it was rushed out in time for christmaswas it the worst adventure game ive played
no
i reserve that honour for jekyll and hyde
it was a close second thoughthe original halflife had a story and it was funhalflife  has no story and after a short while it gets boringyou go through a building and shoot bad guysyou go through a sewer and shoot bad guysyou go through a building and shoot bad guysyou go through a city block or two and shoot bad guysyou go through a building and shoot bad guysyou go through a city block or two and shoot bad guysyou go through a building and shoot bad guysyou go through a city block or two and shoot bad guysyou go through a building and shoot bad guysetcboringwhats the pointthere is no storylinekeep in mind that its not just halflife  but also halflife  episode  halflife  episode  halflife  lost coastbut the above  expansions must be purchased separatelyand they are just more of the sameso dont waste your time or moneyif you want to play this game then save some time by using the cheat codes and just play through it quicklythis is a poor continuationsequel to the classic originalvisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsmy first time playing any of the halflife games
were the others as frustratingly difficult to setupregister 
also this game brought my computerchipp htfsb ramgb ddr cardradeon xse pci express mb to its kneesi have virtually nothing running in the background  turned down my desktop resoution to x
which detracted from the anticipated graphic experience
i know its not topoline but i thought the gameplay on lower setting wouldnt as badslowchoppyjerky and sound problems and the graphics were comparable to games costing half the price
the game itself seemed enjoyable but i guess you really need patience in registering and a  computer system to focus on the experience of halflife   maybe i expected tooso much considering all the hoopla over the predecessors and the buzz about this release 
and at  well i bought some older games to tide me overnew to gaminguntil these new releases that just came out and the  games in total cost less than halflife  each of the thief  and deus ex were more enjoyablegameplay while the graphics were just fine with meim more concerned with gameplay than graphics
with me gaming isnt a cinematic eventhalf life  may be okay for a game thats over a year old
but the problem is that the general public has never played it
its aging fast
when or if it finally comes out it will be rather dated and unimpressivethe other problem is that the enthusiasm for this game peaked about eight months ago and has been in decline ever since
timing is very important in game releasing and i think hl missed the mark by a long shoti hope it will come out and i probably will purchase it
if so i will revise my review accordingly
as for now it is turning out to be one of the biggest disappointments in recent pc game historynot september now  november  we shall see
maybe for christmas this yearfor level setting purposes i have provided my computers basic specs so that you can assess whether your experience will be better or worse than mine hp  ghz pentium  processor with  mb of ram ati video card m dedicated video ram xp home edition service pack  comcast high speed internet connection  meg down k up x pioneer cddvd drive directx with the above specs id expect that my machine is basically middle of the road but that my data connection is faster than most
given the above the following are the pros and conspros best graphics ever similar to halo character has access to extremely cool machines dune buggies airboats etc
 these add a tremendous amount to the game at times more twisted and dark and chilling than doom  the  magnum rocks easy to learn pretty darned stable for a high end game  after more than  hours of play my machine hasnt crashed once please check other reviews as this may not be a common experiencecons its been said a hundred times below so i wont belabor it it took me almost four hours to install the game loading  discs plus going thru the antipiracy steam process  this is three and a half hours too long and is reason enough to return the game for a full refund those with little patience shouldnt even think about buying this title the steam process doesnt end at install  about every  minutes of gameplay the game needs to synch with an online site this can take anywhere from  to  minutes takes several hours of gamelplay to get to cool weapons the backstory is extremely thin and unimaginative  even for an fps
about halfway thru the game the developers try to introduce a more robust story line but it is too little too late very uninteresting and ultimately more of an annoying distraction than anything elsenetnet the game and the company could not possibley have hoped to live up to all the hype they were generating but its a decent fps once you get it installed
id wait a month or two for the price to drop and for the patches to start rolling out before id recommend anyone buying itof my collection of game cube games this is definetly not my favorite
the adventures are not fun as the action and the combat is stale and awkward
the attacks are not coordinated and the enemies are plain
the graphics are ordinary certaintly not anything special
the multiplayer absoulety stinks
with four seperate screens it is absoulely confusing and the fourfold screens are so small little can be seen
a much better action game would be super smash meleei do not like this game i had high hopes for this game but was not happy with it it could have done so much more but pretty much hand holds you thoughout the game
choose something else out thereim sorry but the cfs flight modeling is really bad
i dont mean hard to learn i mean just bad
using what they call realistic settings makes flying an excercise in frustration
i still remember my fisrt campeign mission as a bomber pilot take off in rain at night
no lights nothing you cant even see a taxiway let alone a runway
i made it off the ground somehow eventually the sun came up
i got close to target im supposed to launch a torpedo from a b into an enemy ship
as you can imagine that is pretty close to impossible to pull off especially with the way everything is modeledon a simple bomber intercept mission i unloaded all of my ammunition into an enemy bomber at  yards or less and nothing happened
i mean nothing no apparent damage
im sure i missed with  of the shots but hit with more than enough to saw off a wing and kill all of the crew to bootflying a fighter of any kind at any speedaltitude feels like flying a  if you enter a dive your lack of manuverability means that you will probably pick up so much speed that you will create a new crater in the countryside
roll response is not all that bad but pitch is under modeled on almost all of the planes
there may have been some deliberateness to this because dogfights feel more like gun camera footage than a simulator like il
in other words they may have tried to give an authentic feel by dampening manuvers to the point that things happen in a slower motion that other simulators
i dont think this is a terrible idea but they didnt get it quite right and with the gun damage being so undermodeled you will be frustrated with dog fights and intercept missionsair to ground is a little better although the sluggish controls make pulling out of a strafing run a little too exciting
it also seems like strafing is a little too easy a quick burst of bullets will obliterate an entire supply depot and end the mission
when i say quick burst i mean just tap the triggeroverall i think they could have done a much better job with this game
i like the idea of the big campaign but it just doesnt quite come together and isnt worth the time
this game requires more patience than im willing to give itthis game is crash happy and no patches from microsoftseem to work with winvista or any directxi pitched my copy of itjust could not get it to stopcrashingthings are often very relative in the gaming world
if cfs was actually microsofts first shot at a combat sim it probably would merrit much higher reviews from the simming community and myself
after all the game does boast an interesting campaign engine a good variety of different planes to fly including bombers and prototypical aircraft some nice atmospheric effects and the ability to man different positions on the bombers
of course many of these pros have already been implemented in other ww combat sims of years pastunfortunately this is not microsofts first shot and those of us who have loyally followed their series of flight sims both combat and civilian expect a certain progression with each new release
i myself was extremely pleased with said progression in both fs and cfs
both games i felt learned from the mistakes of their predecessors but at the same time remained faithful to the series
and both greatly enhanced the look and feel of flight simming while not expecting too much from the machines they ran on
this is where cfs fails in my eyesso here are my major beefsgraphics where did they dream up this graphics engine
it looks and feels more like a firstperson shooter than a flight sim
is this really cfs or am i playing counterstrike on a very wacky map
sure it has nice clouds but this game just does not have the visual cohesiveness of fs nor cfs
the virtual cockpits just dont look as good as in cfs
the ground objects are also out of proportion to the aircraft
do a little lowlevel strafing and things just dont look rightperformance my biggest gripe
if this new graphics engine was supposed to provide better performance by utilizing the video card more they blew it
i have a p ghz mb rambus with a ti mb geforce and with no programs running in the background the game stutters  especially when firing the guns
unacceptable
the game just doesnt look good enough to justify such a drop in performancedamage models these were supposed to be greatly improved
if so i dont see it
every plane i have shot down follows the same annoying pattern pour tons of rounds into any part you like and eventually the whole plane blows up
no pieces of wings falling off no tails detaching no engines blowing just one big boom
would someone please go back to  and look at the damage models in activisions fighter sqadron
they did it rightai i am getting so sick of computer pilots that have the uncanny ability  even as novices  to maintain control and maneuverability of their aircraft when you have damaged them when one little hit on your alieron from their guns renders your aircraft unflyableselection of aircraft it was very thoughtful of microsoft to include some oddball prototypical aircraft in their selection but why oh why at the expense of planes like the b do he ju and me
this is europe right
oh and thanks for the lack of compatibility with cfs aircraftyes all my griping makes the game sound a lot worse than it actually is but with all the used copies of cfs ive seen on auction sites and the number of bad reviews its gotten from other users like myself i think its obvious that microsoft has made a booboo or two on this one
lets pray they dont use this graphics engine on fsgraphics  this is xbox of course its going to get good graphics
it does have a wierd camera system at some points but you get used to itgameplay  this game is definetly original ill give it that much but it does get really boring after a while
the thing that really is annoying about this game is that you only get  to beat every level
also you have to find ammo better known as garbage throughout every levelsound  this sound is so annoying that i have actually gotten killed by getting annoyed at the sound and not paying attentionreplay value  you can go back through the levels to get the medals but it gets boring really fastoverall score  if i were you dont get this game
it is for little kids mainly but some teenagers will like this game for a whilelet me start off by saying that i love tony hawk video games
ever since the first came out i had practiced at it and got really good
i had tony hawk  and  on reserve and got them the day they came out
it got better and better
then came   well the graphics are good but that is not everyting
i hate the fact that there is no two minute runs
i like that because i would love to try getting as many objectives done in the time given and even if i did no objectives i would love getting a high score
but in this one u can do all the tricks u want and it will not matter
and u have to find people to do your objectives
and i heard it was rediculously hard at some points
a challenge is good but a game like this is about having fun getting high scores and opening cheats and hidden characters not getting pissed off at a dumb objective
my advice if u have a psgcor xbox buy tony hawk  u will love it
and if u have an older system then buy tony hawk   dont waste time buying tony hawk  its not worth itthis game is a slightly better game then just bring it
the superstars do look awfully like the reallife wrestlering stars
there is finally a diffcultly setting although it doesnt seem to work while youre doing a quotseasonquotthe voice acting is a slight improvement although its jr and the king except for tazz and cole
the story lines are realistic and sometimes interesting
the only gripe i have about the game is an effective counter system
the cpu is as relentless as in just bring it
the controls are easy to pick up although you have to mash buttons to see different moves
i still think the best wwe game is wwf no mercy for the nintendo   shut your mouth does have more wrestlers in it than just bring it dida slight improvement over just bring it but only slightlythis is just a money ripper aimed at kids from the s who have played these
some of them are now rich feel nostalgic about their childhood and must get this game
the ones dont have much money still buy it by only eating once a day for about a weekthe games were ok for my kids but i did not like it i thought it was a waste of money not really much to do in my eyes but they liked itmy title for this review pretty much says it all
the overall design of the game is very creative and imaginative and its definitely not your everyday fps
the d environment is huge and offers plenty of opportunities to explore but the actual game play itself simply becomes torture after a whilefirst of all lets discuss the enemies you encounter along the way
for various reasons you find yourself having to pass through completed areas again and again but when you defeat an enemy and clear out an area its all for naught as the next time you pass through the area they have completely respawned and you have to do it all over again
this becomes tiresome and repetitive very quicklythe game does not have a quick save or save at any point feature however it does have save rooms scattered throughout the game
the trouble is the save room is often some distance away from the boss battles and if youve defeated by a boss you find yourself having to repeat a bunch of tedious game play  just to get back to the bossthe bosses in this game simply get ridiculously hard fairly quick and after about  or  battles it becomes a real nightmare
there is this one battle were you have to use your cannon or missiles to flip a series of mirrors off of the boss and of course the whole time the boss is trying to kill you  and the boss is flipping the mirrors back undoing all your work
and if this wasnt bad enough you have to complete  this process not once not twice but ultimately  times
thats not fun its torturemetroid prime is creative imaginative and definitely a different experience than your standard shootem up but the game play is so tortuous it completely ruins the experience
the sad part is with just a little tinkering such as a quick save feature  enemies that dont respawn and less complicated boss battles this game would have deserved the hype it getsthis is a halfdecent fps
however its nothing short of a mockery of metroid
the gameplay is clunky the graphics are poor highlights are not white light consult any second year illustrator and hell tell you and the controls are terriblei wanted to give a little bit of a alternate viewpoint on this game  i was anxious to get this game due to all the glowing reviews of it
i have not played any of the prior metroid games so i came at this one with a clean slate
but im just not finding this game fun
maybe im just not the kind of guy that enjoys walking around in a robot suit i dont knowthe controls are not natural to me
as you play you switch visors which changes what the controls do
with the scanning visor the center of your view will allow you to lock on to an item and it will tell you what it is
but sometimes you have to hold r then look around then press l while holding r and moving the stick to find out what something is
the combat visor is similar you can lock on to shoot with l but sometimes it wont work so you have to hold r and use the stick to look around then hit l then fire
then sometimes you hold l to lock on then move the stick while hitting b to dash around and sometimes you hold l then move around in a circle while jumping and i could go on here but i think you get the ideai find it difficult to figure out what im supposed to do
on the first boss after you kill it you have some amount of time to get out before the deck explodes only it took me forever to figure out that you have to scramble up the rubble to exit
it was difficult to see that the environment had changedsometimes you have to traverse levels many times running from point a to point b to get something you need to open the door at point a  or you get to the end not collecting what you need and find yourself combing back through the level to figure out what you missed
or you see something you want but cant get it because you dont have the right weapon or ball yet  you just know you have to come back for it
instead of feeling adventurous it comes off as repetitive to mei am somewhat sensitive to motion sickness and find that this is one of those games that does it to me
it is funny how i can play quake iii without getting queasy but this game definitely does it to me
so beware if you are sensitive to stuff like thaton the plus side the graphics are really spectacular and once the game begins there are no noticeable pauses for load times which is great
the map is well done and helpful
and playing as the ball is greatthe game moves fast and  the perspective switches to the rd person
i wish there was more of this to be donegonna get my metroid on yearoll under that wreckage shoot that bad guyjump that ledge bomb that false wallbacktrack  miles wait wait wait whatyea you backtrack alotif you guys have ever played winback that game where the objective is to backtrack half the time this game outdoes even winbackok so the game is basically a first person shooter
it is linear there are seperate paths you can go but you usually will have to stop shortly after because you need a special gizmo or gadgetyou dont really need to scan that much to win even though in the first level they make it seem like you will
basically you shoot monsters find things to make your suit do more and fight bosses for those things then backtrackthe game has alot of shooting contrary to what other people say
you will shoot alot of monsters by rapidly clicking the powerbeam button
eventually i just started using missles because every time you kill a guy he leaves something
well they dont always leave things but usually they will leave a health up or missle up
i think it depends on what weapon you use to kill the actual monsterthe pros of the game are the great environments
it isnt the same over and over again actually the backtracking screws that up
you could of gone through tons of different environments instead you backtrack between like  of them mabye  then there are the graphics pretty good
the weapons are alright i love just pounding guys with missles
the morph ball works well you can use it whenever you want
then there is the help system
usually it tells you when there is a save system nearby and your next objective
most of the time i am not lost but sometimes it tells me to go  miles to where i just came from and i feel like throwing the game in the garbagehowever the cons of the game greatly outdue all the good things
the control is weird at first but once you master it it becomes better
still there are points in the game when the control works against you
say there is a monster shootiong at you from behind
you cant really turn around and keep moving left and right so you usually will get shot a couple times
cleared areas usually leave some really tough enemies that gang up on you and you die
thats another problem the monsters can be really tough
usually you cant just shoot the monsters
most of the time you will have to find a weakness or wait till it turns around and shoot its backthe overall layout of the game is even worst
boss new item backtrack
you will probably fight  bosses in the game
you can get a few energy cell boosters and missle pack boosters
the only thing is most of them require you to go out of your way for them
backtracking isnt that big during the first hour or so of the game but let me tell you something it gets worse
you go to this iceworld to get a speed ball reward then you go all the way back to your ship
if you play the game and get to the speed ball part you will know what i am talking aboutbesides backtracking and such the problem is death
die reload from last save point saved at
the one problem that could of been avoided easily
say you get killed
ok you cant just continue from the beggining of that boss fight you are going to have to reload
say you fight some of the tough enemies reload
say you play for  hours to get a powerup then die reload
i think you understandin closing the backtracking makes the game bad
the dieing makes the game bad
i wouldnt of minded a shorter game with no backtracking
i wouldnt have minded a retry system for bosses
but these problems overshadow all the good things in the game and make it not worth playing
sorry metroid better luck next timeoverallgt starsndagger goodi rented this game from blockbuster
then i started to play
the game started out ok but then started to drop in intrest
this game got boring fast and i returned the stupid thing early it was so bad
my advise get golden sun for gba wind waker for gc or ffx for psthe age old battle between myself and the lizard king continuesat first i thought this was going to be an awesome game because i love the old metroid games but it was all a clever trap divised by that creepy lizard king
last time i knocked him into the lava i thought he was gone for good but i guess it was some sort of illusion or clone
that guy just wont stay down
now he has crossed metroid with a potato and ruined my daythe game is a lame fp shooter that lacks the spirit of the originals
it was like  here
take samus and throw her into some other game that contains space stuff  its ok but no metroid mother brain would be proud of
if you dont know who mother brain is then you probably like this gamei am wondering now who told the lizard king about my love for metroid
maybe there is a traitor in my inner circle
great
good luck sleeping tonightafter being told it was the best game ever i bought this game and was very very disappointed
you walk around lost half the game get an idea of what to do and where to go then get lost again for another  minutes
i am usually very good at harder more complex puzzling games but this one just pushes the limit
 stars for graphics those were pretty goodeveryone was talking about this game by the time i bought it  scores  stars so of course i bought
im asking whythe story is about a mercenary  samus aran
im not very expert in metroid stuff but i knew the chozo   a race  created her to be a warrior
the chozo were quotthe big guysquot with superior technology and stuff until one day some bad guys called the space pirates killed most of the chozo
samus survived
she grew up and now shes  a great warrior
the game is in future of course the planet youll be in is called tallon iv well lets go to the real review graphics ok here i must say the game rules
the graphics are really perfect
the raindrops fall over your visor  when its really hot your visor changes or when its cold i mean this is one of  if not the  the best gamecube graphics ever
one of the best game graphics ever fun this is where the problem begins the game is too hard
you must spend something like  hours to beat it without a walkthrough and you have to walk a lot to go from a place to another onethis makes you really tired the boss battles make your fingers hurt really bad
youll surely be confused about controlling samus
its really hard too
every time i play this game it gives me a big headache
if you think its fun to be with a big headache and fingers hurting then this is your game educative i cant see anything educative here there isnt any blood so dont worry with that violence
well youre just shooting aliens and quotbad guysquot
you arent killing humans or anythingafter all you just might rent it or dont even play it itll let you really downi love harry potter quidditch cup game and i thought this would be an excellent game to buy as well
i found that the gameplay is very easy and most of the game you spend avoiding being caught by precepts or avoiding ghosts that can attack you and you cant fight back
i beat this game in a little under  days and i found most of the time i had problems not fighting the enemies but avoiding the ghosts and precepts
the storyline is pretty messed up and is not developed well and although i know it is a video game they could have made the storyline a little better
i knew the game wasnt going to be very good when i had to listen to harry say quothow am i going to get out of this roomquot every minute for a half an hour and tried to do acrobatics while ghosts knocked me down and couldnt be killed
i found the best things about it were flying around the school grounds on the broom and at the quidditch tournaments
its a fun game to play around with but i wouldnt recommend anyone to buy itthis game is ok  the graphics controls sounds and challenge are middle of the road not great but not terriblethe problem is its too short
just when the game feels like it should be starting boom final boss fight end creditsoh and the final boss fight is confusing and doesnt fit with the movie or the booktake control of harry potter and roam the halls of hogwarts
you learn spells by picking up books
you can assign spells to a button and you have a rememberall which tells you what to do next
the hardest boss in the gamefor mewas the last one within the chamber itself
quidditch is a fun thing to do and who would say no to degnoming the gardeni love the harry potter franchise and mostly because of that i had high expectations for this game
but the reality was very disappointing
this has all the marks of a game that was hastily put together on a low budget with very little user testing
the general design is a completely linear series of missions  do this then do that then do the other thing with no choices whatsoever
and if there is any one task anywhere in the game that you cant figure out then the game is over for you
lack of attention to detail shows up throughout  for example the prefects will scold you and tell you to go back to your dorm but wont let you actually do so
as another example hermione will tell you to do some complex task but only once  better write it down because if you forget the details she will not tell you again no matter how many times you hit the talk button on her or in frustration start pummeling her with spells
i rarely give up on a game but im giving up on this one after about  hours of play
spend your money on something elseit is make for the first xboxbut it was my mistake i guess cause i didnt realize on time
anywayin a nutshell this is not what i expected after playing ac for quite sometime
granted the graphics are outstanding but this does not make up for the lack of gameplay
basically there is nothing more to do than run around hack and slash run around then craft some items to break the monotony
thats all there is to the gameas a  month beta tester i expected more from the game upon release
here are the problems i find and ill try to be as impartial as i can
 the chat interface is still bugged
 the user interface is sub par
 pack space issues are a problem
 pvp and character balance are nonexistant
 lack of content which does not require constant monster killing
 crafting system is tedious gives little reward or desire to even participate in it
seems to be a money sync for gold attained while hunting monsters
  level advancement becomes very slow and tedious after level   you must fight monsters which are your level are much higher which is often quite difficult and you get little experience for doing so
  spell trees are limited since many of the spells just dont work correctly or are so unusable because of their durationrefresh time
many spells are just prereqs on other trees and often spell effects are not even known since their effects are not displayed anywhere
 vaults are very simple and the movies which are their rewards are equally as simple
 map areas are level restricted items are level restricted dungeons are level restricted even lifestones are level restricted
equivalent of forcing zones on people
 game is very repetitive mostly because players little other than kill monsters
 a majority of the beta testers did no feel the game was ready for release because of the list above  but was pushed out anyways due to the common practice of companies releasing unfinished games and expecting the players to recoup further development costsstoryvexxs people are suffering under a cruel oppressor by the name of dark yabu who has enslaved the protagonists race to do his bidding
angered by his captivity vexx lashes out but not without consequence
his grandfather takes the punishment for him and dies in his place
vexx manages to escape and find the astani war talons legendary weapons that fuse to his arms and allow him to fight
he then sets off to overthrow the dark yabu and avenge his grandfathers death
its a fairly straightforward plot that leaves little to the imagination but does its job as character motivation and a source of drive for the game
its certainly not the most stunning epic plot youll encounter in a video game but neither is it the worst to come acrossbattle systemvexxs main attacks revolve around the astani war talons which give him a simple combo and a few other aerial attacks
there isnt much variety to be had here but to be fair the focus of the game is supposed to be the platforming not the combat
the enemies are generally easy to take care of unless you get swarmed
hacking and slashing your way through the levels generally proves to be a timetested formula and while it doesnt require a great deal of strategy its at least functional what did you expect
gameplayfrom the last two paragraphs any relatively competent reader will have assumed that although vexx may not be the next huge breakthrough in platformers it isnt bad
unfortunately while the story and the combat may have been adequate the gameplay mechanics fall flat
vexx controls decently while running and jumping but the controls are riddled with noticeable flaws
as has been stated before the camera is abysmal
it frequently gets in your way and it makes simple tasks difficult beyond comprehension
people who say all platformers have camera problems
have no idea what theyre talking about
ive seen games with perfect camera interfaces and most platformers range from above average to outstanding  yet vexx has some of the most broken ridiculous camera issues ive encountered in a platformer since dawn of mana
my other main gripe is the swimming controls
im not new to video games much less d platformers spyro was the first title for the ps i picked up but vexx simply flounders around while hes underwater refusing to go where you want him to
when you fall from any height into water vexx will immediately go under
why couldnt there have been a button to dive or submerge
was that too much trouble
getting out of water is almost as difficult as swimming in it
vexx refuses to jump when hes floating on top of the water for reasons unknown to me
occasionally when you surface vexx will do a jump
other times hell do nothing at all
i can put up with a lot from video games halfbaked stories bad voice acting little to no character development etc
but one thing i cant stand is when a game forces those things on me as well as terrible controls and camera angles
its almost as if vexx is working against you to make sure you die as often as possible
after trying and failing to get to grips with the inept swimming controls i put down vexx and havent played it since
this is one of the few games that i actually have difficulty playing mainly because of the asinine controls and nothing else
i have a hard time expressing appreciation for games when i cant pick it up and play it without nearly snapping my controller in frustration
there are other things about vexx that rub me the wrong way as well like how if you collect a wraith heart the game will immediately send you to the hub
by trying to micromanage the way in which you deposit the hearts the game oversteps the boundary from helpful to annoying
similarly if you collect  shards and then pick up a wraith heart your shard count will be reset to zero meaning that the work you put into gathering them has now been essentially rendered wasted time
i also couldnt help but notice the lack of direction in the game
linearity isnt always a bad thing and i felt like vexx was one of those games where a simple clearcut platforming style eg
sly cooper might have been better
all in all the game wasnt something i could pick up and play with no trouble whatsoever and it wasnt something that engaged me deeply enough to want to play it eithervisuals characters and audiowhile the graphics are fine and the environments are fairly pleasing to look at there was nothing that grabbed me in the game as being spectacular
there is a slight delay on vexxs movements but the animation is decent and the levels arent completely generic
vexx himself is a silent protagonist much like jak from the first game in the jak and daxter trilogy but there isnt enough character interaction throughout the game to make you feel attached to anything or anybody
i like to be involved when im playing a video game and part of that involvement comes from feeling some measure of fondness for the main characters
i didnt get that from vexx and i didnt stick around long enough to see if there were any drastic changes in the way vexx developed although judging by other reviewers comments there werent any
from what i could tell the audio itself was rather soft although im not sure if it was intentional
its not a very noisy game in general which is something i suppose one can appreciate every now and againoveralli was enthusiastic about vexx at first since ive had a hunger for platformers recently but i was disappointed
the camera is terrible the controls are delayed and unintuitive and the story itself lacks substance as well as character development of any kind
the combat is average the sound is eh and the general experience left me feeling distinctly unsatisfied
whether youll like this game depends mainly on your tolerance for the frustrating gameplay
if youre determined to give it a try or if youre just masochistic then give it a shotbut dont say i didnt warn youwith mario sunshine metroid prime star fox zelda  wario world whos going to have time for this
please acclaim no sequels
truthfully the first level was so boring i didnt care to go further
i know it reeks that you may have payed x amount of s for this game  but dont beat yourself up
just brush it off and buy one of the other games i mentioned above
i can only give a few nods for good graphics sound and idea
hence the  starsgame boy advance players get a treat with the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring
the game is gorgeous
that is when it runs properlyby now anyone who doesnt know at least the basic story of lord of the rings must be living in a cave
hobbits
a ring
a quest to take the ring to safety
evil riders
this game has them allthe graphics are really pretty stunning
the little hobbiton village the forests it all gives you a real sense that youre in tolkeins world interacting with the characters
combat is simple turnbased stuff
you do a lot of messagedelivering and mushroomgatheringnow for the bad part
first the game is very directional
you must get item a from spot  to spot  receive a coin
take a message over to person c get a cabbage
you gather a few coins by raiding your friends homes and then steal their crops
not very niceand when youve found these few items youre stuck
theres no way to find more
if you want a third dagger for your party sorry the vendor only had  if you want to kill more big dogs to get your characters better at fighting nope you killed the only dogs in town
you roam the area looking for more things to do but you are forced to trudge along to the next areawhich leads to the really bad part
just about every single person ive talked to about this game has complained of severe crashing problems
the mines of moria are particularly notorious for crashing a lot but crashes happen elsewhere as well
a crash can easily destroy hours of very tedious backandforth ploddinga good game to borrow from a friend to see if its your type of game but be prepared to save early save often as you get into it a bitmaybe i didnt give the game a chance but i couldnt because i would get motion sick too quickly
maybe its the very bright colors or the highpitched music or the constantly going around in circles but i was hanging over the side of my tv turning green within  minutes every time i tried to play this
i was on the baby easy level too and i didnt find it all that easy but im not a kid
no doubt its probably a lot of fun later on when you get vehicles and stuff but i couldnt even put together the snowman in the beginning levels
to its credit the baby easy level does let you win even when your skills are horrible because i was a huge failure as far as navigating a river and the game still applauded me and advanced me to the next level
and still i couldnt put together the snowman
i am such a loseras penny arcade put it halo has become a quotcultural phenomenonquot perhaps of a level nearing the phenomenon that was halflifecounterstrike
when one is confronted by a game that consistently scores  on most review sites one would expect the game to be revolutionaryhalo is however anything but
the enemies are stupid i dont mean that their ai is lacking but rather that they are programmed to be invalids and cowards and excessively numerous
there were many times where i found myself in a gun turret with my hand off the keyboard holding down the fire button and leisurely offing fifty or sixty enemiesafter youve gunned down about a thousand incompetent fools who yell quotrun away hell kill us allquot things start to get a little boringhalo lacks interesting level design an interesting story interesting weapons or even interesting gameplay
the things that would be quotrevolutionaryquot about halo would be the use of vehicles during combat and the occasional squadbased skirmish
however battlefield  has both of these factors and in greater amount
there were about five different vehicles in halo and there are forty plus vehicles in bfthe worst part about halo was the massive onslaught of weak enemies
instead of battling a few well trained enemies that would offer some kind of challenge you fight against seemingly endless waves of pitiful enemiesperhaps the only thing i found of value in the game was the tactical use of grenades and the ability to only carry two weapons
the latter would have been much more limiting and interesting if there were more than seven or eight weapons to begin withbottom line halo leaves much to be desired
if youre looking for a firstperson shooter with a variety of vehicles look to battlefield  if you want squadbased or tacticalrealistic action counterstrike will leave neither you nor your wallet hungry
and if you want an action packed blowemaway multiplayer game they you should look no further than the unreal tournament series
if you want unispired level design a weak story and microsoft re really really bad physics than grab yourself some haloim sorry but when a game says it is winxp compatable but you have to modify it to make it run on xp then it isnt compatablei had  of the original games and had to do a lot of work to get them working
i can live with that with the originals
but i got the platinum version because it implied that it worked out of the box with xp
it doesntto the reviewer that said that you can troubleshoot it why should we have tosince just about everyone is using xp stay away from this unless you like messing with it
even ign sites dont have a this will make it work on xp patches or fixesgreat games if you can get it to work
if you arent computer knowledgable enough to get them going without worrying about grabbing virus laden programs stay away
i have it  stars because if you can get them to work these are great gamesi am a big fan of indiana jones and the infernal machine and i was excited when i picked this game up in the bargain bin
i installed the game with no issue and i started playing it
the first thing i noticed is they got rid of some of the fun things from the original like the lighter and the chalk
the inventory system is quite clunky and i found i had to stop everything just to change weapons or get the canteen
speaking of the canteen i thought that sort of a ridiculous way to get health
i much preferred finding medkits or medicinal plants and having the choice of buying them at the end of every level
the combat is a lot cooler at least hand to hand than in infernal machine
i like that there are punch combos and such
the way that the enemies can withstand about  slices from a machete is pretty incredible to me however and it got really tedious after the first few guys especially after they began to have guns more often
the controls are really clunky as well especially when you just want to adjust yourself a tiny bit
you would tap a key and indy would swing  degrees
the graphics are pretty good but other than that it is not that great of a follow up to infernal machinethe game play for indiana jones and the emperors tomb is very poor
as others have said there is no save option in this game and the exit and loading screens are very confusing and unnecessary
the camera panning is horrible
you have to move the mouse and the keys to control the character and it takes a lot of getting used to
although the sound and graphics is excellent and i had some fun with the fighting its too much of a hassle to control the characteri will echo what someone else said about the tram sequence being one of the most pointless in pc gaming historyas someone who has enjoyed many rpgs over the past  years i had to see what all the hoopla was bout
well after two days of playing this game im b o r e d
if you are a hug starwars fan then this might be the game for you but if not i would recoment skipping this gamefirst off the ai
is just plain dumb
when you are in a place with lots of people walking around and you are talking to a character watch the people in the background trying to figure out a way around you
most of the time it results in two characters moving back and forth in the same direction trying to get around each other
also my secondary characters tend to get in the way more often than not
ive had characters with blasters run right up to an enemy and then stand there and do nothingbuggy
i got stuck to my wookie
i walked up to him and couldnt get around him couldnt move back the way i had come from in fact couldnt move at all
the only way i was finally able to move was to switch to my wookie and move him then switch back
note that i was never actually touching the other character
ive also had several instances where i get stuck trying to go around other characters and have to backtrack a bit then go very wide around them
also ive had several sequencescut scenes replay multiple timesfighting is as involved as clicking on the enemy
thats about itoveral this game is very well boring
its sort of the episode  of rpg games
it looks like it could be fun but it sort of misses in every way possiblei oncew again wasted my money
this game was to long and in the end i didnt really want to beat the game
i lost interest after the first  hoursthe badthe story is to complex and it will give you a headache
 when your in combat you cant do anything else but stand there
what i mean is that the creators desided to create a star wars version of final fantasy
 the way the characters talk its like there trying to explain their legends
but i got bored so i desided to play halo
the good well the graphics are pretty good
 the people that you talk to in this game dont seem too helpless
i waas thinking that maybe the characters in the game can really help these people
 i love the light saber i have always been a big fan of star wars so thank god i get to use a light saberso in the end i guess i can see why this game is all ready a classic but it didnt appeal to menba live was a great title while it was on the sega genesis but with the ps and xbox and gcube ea sports has lost their minds
in all the lives they have made over the years no matter the system old or new they have used the same engine for all the live titles
this takes away from what the live series could be
nbak and hopefully k will continue to bring realistic gameplay along with graphics and controls
i urged anyone reading this to play sega sports nbak from any year  or the original and then play nba live or  and i will guarantee that you will disown live and fall in love with any of the nbaks
better graphics control and gameplay makes the k series surpass anything ea sports has done for basketball video gamescan you take on the leage and be one of the strongestprosgreat gtaphicsgreat musicfinaly got the point of fast break back in the seriesconswhat the heck i hate the analog controlnow defensive rebounds are automaticin  it was offensive which was better pointers are almost impossible to makeyou pick up way too many foulsoffensivley defensivleycomputersbasicly on superstarjust make me wanna punch my tvits almost impossible to get opensometimes i end up throwing the ball out of boundsea just took another big step backthere is hardly any way this game improved on a bad live   they shoulda sticked with the freaking dpad instead of do analog because now i just aint good at the game no more
if you want an ea sports masterpiece go pick up madden nba street or live final wordsafter all the much better reviews from sites i wanted to play this game so badly only to be dissapointed
live just went bad when it came on next gen consoles
lets just prey to god that somewhere along the line ea will figure out there mistakes and bring back the good ol days where live was the top basketball gamepeaceonce again easports had promised me a completely new game and once again i am left wondering why i even believed the hype
nba live  is at its core nothing more than the same game as its predecessors
however one thing that is new this year is the hyped freestyle control
though gimmicky at first it becomes surprisingly intuitive as you try to pull off the variety of different offensive and defensive moves it allows
for instance by tapping the right analog stick on the controller you can pull off a string of killer crossovers or spin moves to shake the defender
on defense you can reach for the steal while in an intense defensive crouch and raise your hands to defend against a shot without the threat of a tickytack foul
without this new feature nba live has nothing really new to offerthe graphics are clean and smooth but are overall generic
stadiums and crowds look the same and the players cartoonish with exaggerated body sizes and large heads and hands
some players are hard to distinguish from each other unless you recognize their tattoos hairstyle or playing gear
the cut scenes inbetween plays are amusing at first but quickly become tiresome as they are repeatedly played over and over
how many times do i need to see my bench react as if i had been shot and beheaded after a foul
luckily you can turn this feature off
nevertheless i did appreciate the humor and the playfulness in certain cut scenes that really captured the essence and feel of an nba gameregardless of the graphics the player animations are smooth and quick
i dont think i have yet to see the same dunk twice
seeing iverson perform a crossover dribble is pure beauty
watching garnett back down an opponent felt like a battle of epic proportions
there are also a variety of shots to and from under the basket
players will either perform a nifty layup or change their shots in midair depending on the location of a defender
gone are the days of the two foot jump shot that clanged off the rimgame play is my biggest gripe
though the cpu ai is greatly improved this year there is such a thing as being too improved
the opposition hardly misses a shot
threepoint bombs are almost a given and there are way too many dunks as opposed to outside shots
in fact it is common to see field goal percentages in the s and s during the course of a game
though i love how the cpu now runs the fast break consistently as opposed to the previous games in the series the result is almost always a score for the opposition
transition defense is practically nonexistent since the cpu seems to always make the correct passes that lead to open shots or dunks
a little humanity in the cpu could have made things more realistic and less frustrating
steals and blocked shots are also too plentiful sigh
the franchise mode is incredibly bare bones
there is of course the standard player retirements resigning freeagent signings team lottery and draft
player scouting and evaluations would have added some dimensions to the draft as in madden  but they are sorely absent
double sigh
game options are also pretty bare
there is the usual one on one game we have seen in previous games and a tutorial explained by pantyfetishist marv albert using grainy video game footage but thats about iteasports really needed to up the ante this year to compare with the mighty sega nba k series
i was pretty optimistic but again easports resorted back to bad habits by releasing the same game with an added feature here and there
though the freestyle control is dare i say revolutionary the problems greatly outweigh the benefits offered by the feature
again they have released a game that is too arcadey and not enough simulation
though i have no problem with arcadetype game play at least give me the option of enjoying a game with realistic shooting percentages balanced game play and the challenge of having to work for a score
now excuse me while i go play nba ki applaud the effort that went into building this game but they really needed a few more months on itthe graphics look kind of blurry and some of the textures just dont fit right
i liked the sound effectsparticularly the cabinet doors opening and closing in frodos home but the singing from tom bombadil was pretty awful and frodos clumsy dancing made it even more ridiculousthe problem is the combat the stupidity of the enemies and the unforgiveable load timesthe enemies move in ways that dont make sense cant seem to see you unless you strike them and get trapped by little kneehigh obstacles that they should be able to walk over or aroundring wraiths just arent scary at all when a twofoot hedge prevents its efforts to grab frodo
they sure dont seem very motivatedbut the load times are very long and jar you out of the experience
i took this game back to the store and exchanged it for dynasty warriors   dynasty takes about five seconds to load a level or scenario that is about a mile across and has hundreds if not thousands of soldiers and horses in full battleyou play from one end of the map to the other killing hundreds and hundreds of soldiers and even big boss captains that have their own fighting skills
and all of this happens with that one five second load time
you run inside of a castle you fight your way down the stairs you jump on a horse and gallop a half mile to the front linesall of this without a single load timein lord of the rings if frodo is the only character on screen and wants to walk into a hobbit hole it loads for a good fifteen seconds then you want to leavewell there is another twenty seconds of load time
if you accidentally hit the wrong button and walk back in a door you just came out ofits gonna take you a minute before you get your character back againthis is really unforgiveable with the hard drive on the xbox being not being used at all
even when gandalf is in moria he would stand at the door of a room and wait for it to load so it would be black until the graphics loadedthe game is also very shorttoo short for an epic
it took me five hours to get to moria and i was just walking around alot taking my timeany game that costs  better give me alot more gameplay than  hours worthwhen you first here lotr fellowship you think that this would be a good game
well you would only be able to think
this game is atrocious
as frodo youre running around with a sticklater becomes a migit sword and then sting and rocks
puny pathetic rocks
once you get to the forests you have to fight these spiderswell using the stick is pretty much suicide so u have to use the rocks
in one place if u keep throwing rocks they dont move and they get pounded
o yaabout  rocks for one spider  spider down more to go
too long
once you are aragorn which is about  minutes longfrodo about  hours and gandalf about  hour and yes  minutes you can use good weapons and kill these drunk lunatics which isnt the most exciting thing to do with a ranger
you would hope that the cool guy would be longer to play as with fire arrows and a sword that looks cool but its just about  minutes
with gandalf which is the only reason that i gave this  stars you at least fight things that stand which are orcs and goblins and you can use this powerful magic
well here are the major pros and cons
the beautiful graphics are the only good thing in this game that give lord of the rings a bad namepros play as gandalf and he has magiclong gamegood graphicscons  loading times between every door
each loading time is about  seconds to  minute too many rocks to kill  darn spider frodo is the player the majority of the timefor you people who dont care about the loading times and love frodo and roaming in the shire for  hours trying to pick mushrooms and feed pigs this game is for you
if you want real lotr action and if you want to be able to choose your character between different times then get lord of the rings two towers  because that is just a beautiful game
note  as frodo you can use the ring but it isnt too great unless you like to run away which is almost impossible in this gamelord of the rings the fellowship of the rings brings us ever so deeper into the world of hobbits and wizards
the game is design to be a rpg but doesnt deliver
the game lacks aside elements that make a complete rpg
the game could of use more interactivity with the environment more things to dothe game will take you about three hours to beat
and the graphics are not up to xbox par
with that it does include the adventure with willow and todd bonbadil which is a little good addition to the game overall but is forgotten later in while you progressalthough it may lack in dept it makes up with a fun engine supposily a rpg it reminds me of a  platform worriors of might and magic a good game but not greati was one of those people who saw and loved the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring
 the classic movie
i thought the video game would be much of the same
fun great story good graphics and overall just something to spend time playing
well i was wrong
this game is nothing like the movie and in my opinion was a very overhyped game
why
the gameplay its just boring
you start off spending an hour in the shire trying to do various tasks which are rewarded very lightly
for example you have to give the lady whos buying your house a letter which takes  minutes to find usually more
there is no map of the shire no hints of what to do
everything has to be figured out by yourself
so after you find the little paper or letter you walk back to give it to her
but nooooooooo wait you have to find another item without any help and ring a bell because she believe there are wolves in the shire
thats another  minutes if your lucky  minutes if your not
you also have to complete  close to a dozen tasks to get your corruption rating up
if you become to corrupted its a second bar above your health you just die
i had to start over several times because of that
so say that somehow you do get all this done get stocked with supplies talk to everyone and are ready to go in less than  hours you must escape the black riders
i did this and it is extremely difficult and yet in parts so easy its stupid
there is always a certain area you can go where the black riders cant get u  and yet at the end u must make a run for it
no where to go no where to hide
and the black rider you must at the end escape from is on a horse
well if you get past all that in  hours without dieing your lucky
most people dont
and the whole process is just boring
no excitement no real rewards
i hated the first partwell once your out of the shire you head into a forest
the forest is full of creatures which are all so easy to kill
you must find your  companions who came with u who somehow git lost in  different parts of the forest
this alone took another hour and if your not lucky youll get lost forever literally
once past that you are caught by a willow tree when u are suddenly saved by a fat short man named tom bambaldi or something like that
you must then find  lilies which takes another  minutes
at this point i had died  times had not found anything i liked was bored and was just sick of the repetitiveness of the game
that was my wonderful experience playing this game luckily i rented and returned the next daygraphics this would get probably  stars
the graphics are pretty goood but are ps graphics
it wasnt what it could have been
for example the black riders are in total d and look really cool
but their capes for some reason are flat and are in d
very dumb
you cant go in the water which once again looks very bad
the leaves you can quote run through you can only run through once
and they are very are only a few for each part of the level
but in many aspects the game was good
you can break many things and thats always fun as they fully destruct
the shire is brought to life well and in many ways this game was fun to look at
but with the horrible gameplay this game could not be saved
sound  lasting appeal well the voice acting was fantastic and the one point where this game was  stars
it was always fun to listen to people talk and the cut scenes are very well done
unfortunantly this was the only fun part of the game
as for the lasting appeal none
it takes  hours just to get a chapter into the story and the whole thing im afraid just bored meif you think you can stand all this then this is the game for u  persounally i think a game should start out easy and become challenging later on and let u do something cool and interesting within the first hour
some may like this game but i sure didnt
overhyped and overbought the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring for the xbox and ps was a disapointment in my mindoh the lord of the rings the two towers is coming to the xbox on january st
id go for that as its by ea sports has a lot more action and you play through both movies the fellowship and the two towers
thxif you own a ps theres only one wrestling game out there and thats sd
theres no excuse on the planet for anyone who owns a ps to purchase this titleyeah  low is improved from last yearsbut thats not saying much at all
its still complete trashi made the mistake of taking my optimism from the awesome smackdown  and somehow hoping beyond hope this game would be good too
i really thought and hoped maybe theyd make this a decent gameit isntyes the gameplay is a little better
but again that really not saying much
youre still randomly crushing buttons hoping something works
the graphics are cartoonish but decent enough
the whole thing still feelschoppy and uncertain
the logic behind the gameplay just isnt that well done
supposedly a lot of it is based on timing but after being spoiled by sd  smooth and fluid controls where you can actually get something done this hails from the stone agethe sound
well at least on the xbox can you do a custom soundtrack
youll want that believe me
cant do that on any other console unfortunately
its mostly annoying rock music that you would never spend a cent on otherwisethe wrestling intros look and sound a lot better than the first one
thats about the biggest improvement overallthe premise behind this series is amazing but i guess the age old adage is still true if its from acclaim steer clear
what an unacceptable squandered opportunity this game is
i wish acclaim would give it up because i just dont think they can make a really good game
mediocrity has always been the acclaim wayoh well at least i can use sd s caw and make all these guys anyway
the heck with thissd is your hook up
holla if you hear methe idea of this game is to go around and collect funk records
yup thats about it
the game is simplistic and although it does have some nice graphical effects it is overall rather bland and the funky music gets old rather fast
with that said the game should keep the younger crowd occupied for a while though
although i would rate the game on the lower end of a teen rating ie closer to an e i fail to understand why sega would create a game obviously intended for the  and under crowd and then put elements in it that give it a teen rating
in this case it is the standard comic mischief and some  wigglingto everybody who wrote a review before this game came out a heartfelt bleep you
wait till youve played the game before you review itbrute force is boring
plain and simple
despite some very well thought out ideas employed to control a group of characters and a mulitude of different weapons the game has almost nothing in the way of a storyline mission briefings are just intermissions between shoot outs and weapon effects are painfully lacking especially for a game on the most powerfull console on the market todayenviorments are good occasionally very good but they are constantly reused and get old real fastdo yourself a favor save your time and money and skip this onethe only conclusion that i can come to is that some of the rave reviews of this game were written by those who have a vested interest in you buying brute force
this game is nothing special
i swearthe graphics are ok  theyre not at the level of halo splinter cell or orta or ghost recon or tides of war or ok most xbox games
i would say that this game looked pretty good if it was on the ps which isnt really saying much
the environments are kinda bland and the particle effects gun fire explosions items shattering etc
are barely there
the only time i thought the game looked good was using the rifle zoom and during the intro to each level
the character movement is smooth but they look like knuckleheads and the enemies are just goofy
youve seen better much betterthe gameplay is about as straightforward as it gets
its a thirdperson shooter so the rules are simple  if it moves shoot it
the path before you is totally linear which means youll be running along from point a to point b to point c without being able to deviate and explore the environment which looks weak so i guess thats not so bad
you have objectives to complete but those are to either to reach a checkpoint or blow something up
sound familiarall four characters have special abilities but they only use them when youre in control of the character
so if youre playing as the guy who gets extra adrenaline to kick some tail which is the lizardlooking creature the character that can cloak herself to sneak around is getting shot up because you have to switch to her to use the invisibility cloak and when you switch the lizard guy will stop using his boosted strength to kill because you switched characters
in other words the special abilities are ok when youre facing only a few enemies but when attacked by many they become useless
this became one of my biggest issues with the game because the special abilities could have been much more usefulanother thing that drove me nuts was that the position of the character on the screen the one youre controlling is all wrong
if youre shooting at someone above or below you the camera angle is ok but if the enemy is straight ahead
you characters body gets in the way and you cant see whats coming
sometimes you have to run to the left or right just to see whats in front of you  poor game designthe rest of the game is about as mediocre as whats already been mentioned
the weapons fire and voice acting are ok  the weapons offered are nothing new the rifle zoom and targeting reticule are taken directly from halo
nothing about this game is really inspiring and i found myself wanting to sell it about half way through as nothing new was coming alongill admit it
i was excited to play summoner  at first it being recommended to me by my cousin
after the first time i failed the first mission i decided that i didnt want to admit that the camera angles suckedwere badattempts later i was incredibly frustrated that i had died so many times due to simply the jerky camera
this aside the anime like graphics and unrealistic attacks i almost felt forced
and i thought comboes made you vulnerable for a moment
the final guy on the first level with the flaming sword attacks me with a double combo and pauses so as i go into attack he unleases the third part of the combo
the game is jerky and inconsistent
summoner fans i beg you not to play this game or you will be spending the next few weeks in a dark corner of your room wondering where your game had gonei returned this one two days after i bought itthe game is an interesting concept
and its fun for a while
but even though there are quite a few characters weapons and powerups it still wont hold your attention for more than a day in single player modein xbox live mode it will keep your interest up for a little longer not muchthe core problem is that the action is so fast that you feel like success has more to do with luck than any skill or strategy
although your skill will improve you still never really get to feel like youre in control of whats going on around youalso it is totally inappropriate for kids kids under  in my opinion
not just the topless character but the language and movie clips are also often in poor tastefuzion frenzy is a better party gamehalo and unreal championship are by far better action gamesi think youll only like this if you use xbox live which i did and enjoy a sense of panic confusion and irreverence at every moment of a gamehere are the pros and cons of the game ill discuss each after the listprosabove average graphicsmany different weaponslarge game playconslinear game playsave feature is also bsunrealistic game play at timesdifficulty settings are bsprosfrom the start this game looked good
the first mission is awesome you hit the beach and have to fight though the chaos of the situation
the next pro is the number of weapons was great
you get to use several different weapons for each war situation
the sniper rifle is a personal fav
the last pro deals with the size of the game
from what i have read there are  missions so this is not a game that you can finish in an afternoonconsthe first con is that this game is that it does not allow for you to do anything other then the list of chore list from your mission list
so it becomes like a list of chores
the game even has a list of chores that get checked off as you complete themnext there is no in level save feature
so in the longer missions you have to be careful not to die at the end of the level or else you have to do the whole level over again
so you can spend hours doing the same thing over and over and over again
i understand that this is suppose to make the game more challenging but if i have to do a level over  times i will not think boy that was challenging and fun
im more likely to think boy this game 
the xbox has a  gig hd why do developers not create in level saves
it is not like we will run out of hd space
unrealistic game play takes away from the game
you can have the shot gun and sneak up on a nazi
you then shoot him in the back of the head
and guess what
he gets up and starts shooting at you
i understand that one shootone kill would not work in a video game but what the hell
a shot gun blast in the back of the head does not kill a nazi unrealistic
ok my last complainant the difficulty level in the game is total bs
i was playing and came upon a mission entitled arnhem knights
after  times of dieing in the middles of this level i switched the difficulty to easy
but guess what i died another  times
let me give a bit of background to this mission
you have to fight nazis through the streets
you travel along with a platoon of british soldiers
first one would think that having computer led friends shooting at the nazis would be helpful but you would be wrong
the brits more or less get in your way and never seem to do anything but die
so this leaves you to kill the over  nazis plus the two tanks that are on this level
i hate to complain but i do not know of many foot soldiers in world war ii that killed over  nazis in one street battle and also took out two tanks in the processall in all i give it two out of five
so rent if there is nothing else at the store to rent and you need a video game fix
shame on you ea for releasing this gamety the tasmanian tiger jack and daxter chrash bandicoot spyro the dragon ratchet and clank zapper the cricket frogger the recent ones and the list goes on
they are all the same
sure there may be a few differences in style and gameplay but its all the same thing find the items save something collect coins jewlels or whatever and use the same basic jump and attack on a bunch of the same enemies walkin around
ty is simply the new addition to this little family and quite frankly it has gotten very old
the minor inovations arent near enough to put this one up and away from the rest
but if clicheacute adventure games are your thing then  have a blast
but for the rest of us something new pleasefirst of all i got really impressed with the ratings and reviews this game got
but when i play it i always double check to make sure its the same gamefirst of all i live in kuwait where pirated copies are only a few bucks and you find them everywhere
but i respect the time and effort put into the game so i ordered it from outside
original are hard to get in kuwait
i received a box with plain two cds without a proper pack or even a manual
its like when you receive a free cd with a magazine
thats really a shame for a startsecond i started playing the game and not so impressed with the graphics resolution and neither the animation
but thats ok i said its kinda old game perhaps
the mysterious story may be the good thing about it
the cursor itself environment movement and overall playing experience is one of the worst i have faced in adventure gamesthird the unlimited bugs who are seeming to be more difficult to beat than the game it self
i am only in the second chapter and this is the second time i am forced to repeat from an old save
the first save for some reason is not loading
the second time i moved on i got stock somewhere where i can only move my cursor and can click nowehere else
ie i have to close and repeatdespite our all hopes it seems adventure gaming ages are really over
i rarely accept any single hint in an adventure game but with this one i already started reading hints just to move on and see where i end up and then there was the bug that stopped me
i really doubt i will ever continue the game and even though its only  i regret themim torn with this game
like many reviewers have said the voice acting is terrific and the background scenery is very beautiful
and it is capable of holding your attention
however the storyline and gameplay are not that good and i think the developers tried to mask this by including a lot of characters and endless conversations to extend the game and make it seem betterfirst my thoughts on the storyline
the storyline in games like this is crucial because theres not much action and the story is really all that a pointandclick adventure game has to fall back on
however i think the developers were trying to go for a really original story and ended up making one that doesnt stand out among other adventurefantasy games
the premise of two worldsone of logic and one of magicand the battle to restore the balance between them was interesting but it soon loses its zest when the game devolves into the standard collect the four magical artifacts and open the tower blah blah blah
it really seemed like the games creators were trying to make this game out to be more than it really was
the game tries to present itself as some truly majestic adventurebig mystery but it ultimately turns out to be nothing more than a standard plot where the protagonist is the chosen one who must save the universe from the evil guy who wants to rule it with the magical macguffin crystal sword book or whatever object the writers choose
hell it even includes various characters who comment on how clicheacute certain parts of the game are like the bad guy saying something like is this the part where the heroine coaxes the villain into explaining all his plans
very well ill tell you
the game is riddled with such hackneyed plot devices and i think the writers believed they were distancing themselves from these clicheacutes by merely using characters to point them out
but what they were actually doing was drawing attention to the very clicheacutes which they seem to dislike but which they nevertheless included in their gamethe gameplay is also not quite up to speed
many of the scenes are shot from very far away probably to disguise the poorlyrendered characters and as a result it will take you about a minute to traverse from one end of the screen to the other like in the abandoned junkyard scene
though you can skip the often tedious conversations you cannot skip the character movements like if you finish talking to a character and he slowly walks offscreen you will have to sit there and watch him meander his way to wherever hes going
also the game will occaisionally break into a prerendered cinematic cutscene but they take about ten seconds to load and because they are so much better than the rest of the games graphics they seem horribly out of place and usually make for a very distracting interruptionon the bright side if you like adventure games this one should keep you entertained
the magic wears off quickly however and the negative aspects overshadow the positive onesthis seemed like a good game at first but later it became clear that its more like a boring movie
conversations are soooo long that i wanted to tear out my hair  and i like the more storyoriented games but this is waaay too much
it starts out pretty interestingly but slumps down quickly and never returns
graphics and music are really good thats why i gave  stars instead of 
the game is also unbelivably unstable  it crashed so many times that i stopped counting after  i must admit i havent finished it yet so it may even turn into the best games ever evetually but since it crashes all the time i just dont see that happening
the patch is worthless i couldnt even get it to install im not sure if i have the latest version and cannot find out
avoid iti had heard such great things about this game but in all reality i found it very boring
way too much talk most of it irrelevant
i finished the game but skipped most of the really bad dialogue
i would recommend syberia and syberia ii insteadi got this game thinking the multiplayer would be like agent under fires only with bots so i could play alone or cooperatively with friends
what i liked about agent under fire were the following options in multiplayer  speed adjustment gravity adjustment qjet qclaw
all of these things have been left out of nightfire
granted some of the new options are kinda cool such as the remotecontrolled helicopters and tanks and especially the guided missiles but these things lose their charm pretty quickly
i am very disappointed
the movement in multiplayer is extremely slow which is just accentuated by the fact that many of the levels are impressively large
aiming is awkward
in general the gameplay pales in comparison to halo or timesplitters  or 
the single player levels are larger and better looking than aufs but im not really into running around trying to find computers to plant qworms on and such so i lost interest fast
this is a rental at best since even if you enjoy the missions you can finish them all in a few sittingsthis game is extremely bad
the graphics are bad and after you beat it once you dont want to ever beat it again
you are in nd person shooter which is bad and your enemys dissapear after they die which is unrealistic
the multiplayer is the only thing that saved this game from getting a  star
even then the multiplayer mode is mediocre
borrow this from a friend
dont waste your moneyshame on everyone who gave nightfire  stars
this game has the feel of the playstation one
the gameplay is identical to medal of honor frontline which was released some  to  years ago
there are no fantastic graphics
i bought into all the hype the reviewers were giving
this does not contain the quality that halo ghost recon or splinter cell type games have
i almost feel that they should give nightfire away free as door prizes at the cinemas
this game will quickly be on the  dollar game shelf along with bloowake and munchs oddysee
do yourself a favor and do some research
there are some great games out there
thank goodness for xboxi highly suggest that you do not buy this game
the first level is far out cool but the rest of the entire game is you a lonesome soldier against hundreds of germans
the weapons are not cool the game is too easy and the storyline does not follow world war  at all
the graphics areeeh okay but could be much better
i had this game for about a week and already i got bored
plus i beat the game in three days flat so that kinda tells you that its a bad game
and the controls
jeez laweeze
theyre impossiblethe aiming system is terrible and the guns are completely inacuratedont buy this gamewhile this is a good game it dosent compare to the pc one mohaa
go buy mohaa and dont waste your money on this onedidnt work too many bugs and issues with assertions
tried to uninstall and reload many times and got the same resultsi was hearing sooooo much about this game and all my friends were saying how great it was so foolishly i just went out and bought itbad idea
dont get me wrong i do realize why many people like this game but it just wasnt my cup of tea
i like games like halo where you can go rampaging  but in this game you barey get to shott its all about stealth and sometimes you have to cross a like ten foot room but it takes you like  minutes because you cant have sensores see you im just not that patient
although i absolutely hate the gameplay the graphics are amazingcumbersome awkward controls
stiff robotic and unnatural animation
subpar graphic design
it reminded me of a rd person version of the  n game goldeneye more than anything else
i read a comment in the official xbox magazine in their review of the upcoming metal gear solid  substance its good but its no splinter cell
i nearly fell out of my chair laughing
theyre acutally  correct but not in the way they meant it
the demo made it painfully obvious that splinter cell isnt worthy to scrape the grime from under mgss toenails
if you want to play a quality stealthaction game skip this weak attempt and go for the king of the genre mgsthey give you a stealth suit map pda laser microphone night vision goggles fiber optic camerabut they dont give you a friggin compass
its real helpful when mission control says your objective is to the east and you have zero ability to determine just where that direction is
without a referencecompass the map is virtually uselessrun out of bullets
too bad
while neatnick sam can pick up and throw bottles and other trash he is inexplicably unable to pick up or use enemy gunsi bet you feel pretty safe hiding in the dark down a  pitchblack corridor
safe enough to shoot an enemy at the other end of the corridor
good for you hes dead
butoopshis buddy just ran around the corner and inexplicably starts tagging you with every shot
nevermind that you shot your target with one bullet from a silenced pistol youre in pitchblack darkness and the enemy tagging you with  accuracy has no way to see in the darkthis game prides itself on realism
its a real shame that the game itself actively works to destroy suspension of disbelief
i quit after the first missionsplinter cell is one of those games i wish i could finish
the graphics are so beautiful that my friends and i have spent hours just playing the lighting engine the way curtains flow the way you can interact with objects that much is masterful
the gameplay however can often be the opposite
there are a lot of reviews and a lot of ground to cover so im only going to address some key points here
my first draft of this review was also way too long
trust me this is the bare bones details of my reviewmy beef starts with sams weaponry
sams standard pistol is the most useless pistol i have ever encountered in a game especially because its this game
in most conditions the pistol is so wildly inaccurate that by the time youve moved into killing range you might as well just make the effort to go for handtohand combat
other times for no apparent reason you can take down a dozen guards with as many shots
however the game tends toward the former most of the time
this is critically saddening because it ruins so many moments
for example the games lighting engine means shooting out a lamp will darken the room
to get the jump on some enemies shoot out the light and when they come to investigate youll have the upper hand nightthermo vision engage
but have fun trying to shoot that light
your wildly inaccurate pistol and quirky game physics mean it might take you anywhere from one shot to a dozen and agonizing moments of aligning your crosshair until you manage to take out the lamp
my personal record is wasting just under  clips before a ceiling light finally blew out
keep in mind it only takes one hit to shatter any glass in the game
his other quottoolsquot would require some spoilers to cover and are thus omitted
mostly the other weapons and gadgets are excellentadding to that the game revolves around a metal gear solid style alert system which ranges from brilliant to unforgivable
sometimes saving yourself from game over is a matter of being quick and making sure guards dont make it to alarms if they notice you
other times its walking around a corner only to not notice the camera setting in the dark until you hear a blaring alarm and quotgame overquot
restart be more careful lean around the corner to spy on the action oops you caught the camera when it was looking in your direction
game over
retry sneak up whip out your pistol lean around the corner cameras facing away okay now shoot
miss
again
again
three more
the rest of the clip
oh joy game over againand therein lies the big problem for me having to restart so much
at times youll breeze through whole sections of levels with smooth spy precision as though it was second nature
but unless youre very lucky  of your gameplay time will be retrying the same hallway over and over and over because of any number of problems
the game relies on a quotcheckpointquot system where you only get to save when you accomplish certain goals
this means unfortunately you may spend ten minutes stealthily clearing one section only to open the wrong door at the wrong time and get game over before your save
sorry charlie do it all over againwhen youre quotin the groovequot with this game its sheer heaven
the technology is fascinating the story is enveloping and using your array of moves and tools is a blast
however even for a gamer as patient as i am youre going to need serious dedication to finish this game
as it stands this game was utterly unplayable for me past the first few levels one of which took on the order of a full day filled with cursing and various illnatured gestures toward my television to complete
and in the end i will only ever touch this game to play around with the gorgeous graphics and gizmosquoteverquest planes of powerquot was obviously designed to cater to quotuberguildsquot an expression used in the everquest online community to denote player guilds which are rather advanced in skills and prior experience and large in numbers
the single adventurer as well as the casual gamer or relative newcomer will find little to no content whatsoever which is available to them in this expansion pack past a certain point
it is all about groups and large scale raids
solo gameplay in the quotplanes of powerquot zones is next to impossible and that is appparently by design
in fact several player class abilities were quotnerfedquot by sony just prior to the release of this expansion ostensibly to quotbetter balance the classesquot it is far more likely that those quotnerfsquot were enacted to prevent any possibility of traditional solo classes such as wizards and druids from being able to do any effective soloing in the new zonesanother problematic feature of this addon is the overpowered quotgearquot that one can obtain from the highend encounters featured in quotpopquot introducing too much quotuber gearquot to an mmorpg game is precisely what ultimately ruined quotdiablo quot when the quotlord of destructionquot expansion was released
for many gamers the focus becomes shifted away from roleplaying and game content and instead toward greed for items which they can strut and show off to other players
it also tends to make player characters who can manage to obtain those items a bit too powerful which hardly seems to fit in with sonys highly questionable assertions that several prior ability nerfs were done to quotbetter balance the classesquot if anything is true about quotplanes of powerquot its that it is decidely unbalanced in the extremepainfully short on game content all too few and sloppily written quests overly lengthy encounters and a generally poor payoff in the quotplane of timequot endzone are what one can expect from this mediocre expansion pack
whilst it is a quotmust havequot for all everquest players it hardly stacks up well against prior expansions such as quotscars of veliousquot or quotshadows of luclinquot so far as actual depth atmosphere and overall content is concerned
this is also the first everquest expansion set which the original game designers verant international had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with and it shows
moreover quotplanes of powerquot is an expansion pack which  of all players will never see the bulk of due to their being unable to assemble the quotmusclequot required to fully explore the additional zones and adversaries
not being able to see three quarters of a game you pay for is rather disappointing to say the least so unless you already belong to a highlyskilled player guild do not expect to progress past a very superficial point in this addon to everquestlastly quotthe planes of powerquot tends to look and play more like a sony playstation  game than an addon for a classic pc based mmorpg
storyline depth and roleplaying content has been replaced in favour of eye candy overpowered enemies and ridiculously and unnecessarily overpowered items designed to appeal to player egos
quotpopquot is not entirely without merit but depending on what you look for in a roleplaying game you may be disappointed overall
defenders of this addon have often said to me  quotwell sony knows what sells thats why pop is the way it is and thats the bottom linequot naturally i have no problem with manufacturers of pc games making a profit on their merchandise but i see no reason why profits and product integrity need be mutually exclusive conceptsthumbs down overall but a necessary addon for all everquest playerswhat were they thinking
it has little next to nothing to do with the red faction which what was the original was all about
there is no real point to the game
and with all the twists and turns you dont know if youre the good guy or the badand if all this isnt bad enough they make it short
you can beat it in a two day time span
this is not worth  i can assure you that muchwhile the game is somewhat fun it is basically a different game
it only slightly mentions red faction a couple of times
you see a character or two of the red faction and thats about itthe game doesnt take place on mars either
that was half the thrill of the other one
you dont really know what your going to run into in mines that are underground in marsthe geomod in this game is okay but there is a lot of mesh wiring under most surfaces making it impossible to pass throughrent this before you consider buying it
it will save you a heart attack wallet wisethe game works half the time
its loose in its cartridge and will freeze the system if you touch it slightly while playing
other times it wont load at all and requires it to be removed and reinserted several time for it to loadthis game if realy hard
and its not fun you have to play as hummans to unlock dragons
as a human you kill dragons and vice a versa
the game has a bad story and poor camera controls
making it hard
nothing notable about the game itselfthis game will definitely frustrate the gamer who expects more bang for their buck
i never seen the movie but i imagine the game captured it welllets see what we got here for the cubegraphics out not bad but not much detail in the way the characters look
you do get various clips from the movie itselfsound out sound was ok the music and the speech does tend to repeat itself which can get annoyinggameplay out  definitely the games weakest suits
there could have been more powerups
some levels seem stacked against you unless you literally play them perfectlyanother thing that annoyed is the missions that you lead the convoy
that started off fun but there should have been more flexibility
for example if you stray to off the path you lose if one of your men die you lose
again they dont allow much leeway here and this cuts into the funthe storm front level and bullfight which started of as fun levels became annoying because of this
no matter how you configure the pad you are likely to become frustrated with the controlsone fun thing here is that the halfway point of the game origin of the species you can play as the dragon hereclosing thoughts well not much replay value here
all i saw a message about clips from the movie and a music video
a bare bones type of game which is a shame considering its based on a movieits definitely a game that i would rent first and if i really enjoyed then buyhow can you make an m rated game after a crummy pg movie
give me a breaki first rented this game before i had live just to see how it played and i was dissapointed
there were no midlevel saves and it was long and tedious to destroy enemy mechsnow that i have live i decided to rent it again since almost all critics seem to praise this title as the best live game available
i can honestly say that these folks have never played anyother live game such as ghost recon or unreal championship
though online is better it does suffer from the same aspects as the single player mode it is way to hard to destroy mechs
it is a good idea to play through the single player campaign to unlock the stronger mechs and so you can see the stats of other mechs available but it will end up being more of a stuggle than fun
also the enemy can always hear what you say on live which elliminates a large amount of potential strategy but does allow for stronger communication to others
you can press a button to talk only to teammates but very few bother with thisthis game isnt compltely bad though playing mutiplayer and watching  mechs explode in your face is quite entertaining
and there is alot of potential to this title
some improvements id like to see in mechassault would be st person perspective sense of size would be better a health bar over opponents so you can see how much life they have left midlevel saves and voice chat switched so you always talk to your team and have to press a button to talk to enemieseventhough if you ask people online which xbl game they feel is best  say ghost recon many people here seem to enjoy this title
so maybe im not seeing what they are
i reccomend picking up gr with your starter kit and if you have a few extra pennies go with unreal as well
but at least save this one for a rentalive been a on again off again fan of re for some time now
i like the concept of the games but i just dont like the games
re  and every game after it was just too boring
code veronica for dreamcast was the best of the lot in my opinion so that upped my memories of the games a little bit
sadly upon playing re for the gamecube all the truth about this series came flooding back
i rented it for five days played it for twofirst off this game just isnt scary anymore
re could creep me out like nothing since the original alone in the dark
this game however just feels so been there done that
the first zombie i met i tried to shoot and kill big mistake
surprise it killed me despite being pumped with several rounds from my handgun
so annoyed i restarted
this time i ran and that worked
after reading up in some walkthroughs i found out that you spend the vast majority of your time doing just that running
survival horror
i was depressed
none the less i figured id give it a try
for two days i ran from everything in sight
i tried not to chuckle at the horror of it all and kept running
even when i finally got the firepower to fight back a little the game had lost appeal
and of course i use the word firepower very lightly ammo is rarer than gold in just about any re game out there and of course youll never get a useful unlimited hand to hand fighting tool except for your worthless survival knife
why cant your character effectively shoot them in the head
just give me some dang weapons and the ability to use themi really cant see why anyone would enjoy a game of this type
i cant see the appeal to anyone but the most casual gamer or hardcore horror fan
my advice avoid this one completely
if youre a big re fan rent it
but dont buy it without trying it first or you may regret it rirathcomafter playing this game i was left with the feeling that they are running out of ideas
the fact that you are forced to control two characters is innovative and at the same time detracts from the resident evil experience because you are no longer alone which is part of what made previous titles in the series so scary
all around its just an uncreative game
they attempted to make up for lack of good puzzles by throwing tons of enemies at you which you of course dont have enough ammo to kill them all so youre going to take a lot of damage
rent this one at the mostresident evil zero did not live up to its hype
graphic wise i think its great but gameplay can get boring at times
some parts meay leave you stuck looking for puzzle answers instead of having some action
if you havent played any resident evil game or eternal darkness then i suggest that you play ed first before playing re just so you could appreciate a good game
 another note when you dont make use of bullets effieciently the game is pretty much over while on the other hand in ed you can always use magic swords maces ecti got this gadget dingydoo for  bucks at blockbuster and thought it would be a good deal
i figured out why this game was only  dollars
i didnt get a complete set of the donkey kong thing
i got  cards but  were just dang repeats
so i cant play that
the cards cant be scanned easily and often take about  tries to make it actually work
the pokemon cards you scan through only gives you info you already have on the card and the animal crossing cards are useless if you dont have a gamecube
manhole stinks because it is no fun
and yes it does work on the gba sp some people say it doesnt but i guess they just dont have an sp or used it on their gamecube without one of those link cables
so you either cant play something cant play something fun or look at information that you can get by looking at the stupid card
but with a price of  at blockbuster i have no choice to give this stupid piece of junk a worthless i have grown up with xmen rogue and wolverine are my two favorite comic characters
i have over  years worth of back issues and i am still hunting down issues i have yet to getgood xmen games have been few and far between however
sega had two great ones the super nintendo had a half decent one by capcom and of course ever since then every game with the xmen label was a fighter game which is kind of sad because id love to have a d action or platform or even rpg with the xmen license
the capcom fighters have all been great fast furious button crunchers with great collision detection sensitive blocking and over all tight control
activisions mutant academy series has been pretty lackluster in comparison but the series third installment showed a great deal of promisei had ruled out the ps version some time ago the decision was between the xbox version and the gamecube version meanwhile i had been reading many unfavorable or lukewarm reviews of both versions
eventually the gamecubes extensive game play options won me over
the gcn version has things like time attack mode and such not found in the xbox version while the xbox version has one character not available in the gamecube version ultimately i shouldnt have bothered the games graphics are downright horrible these are not the xmen
even worse patrick stewarts professor x aside the voice acting is so terrible i cringe even play with the sound on my tv muted
these are not my xmen
i wonder how hard it would have been to hire the voice actors from the original cartoon series like capcom did
more importantly collision detection is sub par blocking is futile because no matter how hard you hold back youll take the beating and this aint no button masher
you must enter precise movements to get anything to work something that seems archaic in todays fightersdont get me wrong this games a step in the right direction for activisions series but its not that big of a step
while its better than the previous mutant academy games it still falls short
whether you have a ps  xbox or a gamecube steer clear of this one
like star wars good xmen games are few and far between
at best be smarter than i was and rent this game firstxmen next dimension is a somewhat enjoyable game
any xmen fan will be happy to play as over  different characters ripped straight from the comics with powers intactall characters have multiple outfits and are highly detailed
the graphics overall in the game arent outstanding but theyre decent enough
the special effects on the powers are the icing on the cake standing out above everythign else in the game
the environment is interactive and players can be thrown through floors cielings windows and walls to new areas of the levelthats about it for the great features though
probably the most troubling aspect about this game is the fact that it has virtually no sound effects whatsoever while you fight
you spend most of the time watching you characters throw punches and kicks at one another with only the music going and occasionally you might hear a punch connect or a character groan in pain
otherwise there is complete silence while you fight
im not sure how that slipped past the quality assurance testers unless they were all deaf
i thought it was just the xbox since just about every xbox game seems to be plagued with sound problems but it wasnt
the game just lacks sound effectsanother troubling aspect is the difficultynow im not one for easy games in fact i hate games that are so easy you can blow through them in a  minutes sittingbut next dimension transcends the boundaries of high difficulty
i havent played a fighting game this hard in a long long time
and while a challenge is certainly welcome there is a definite difference between challenge and insanity
the difficulty in this game unfortunately falls into the insanity category
while you probably wont have to cheat your way to victory the only way to assure that you win is to spend hours in the practice mode with every character
since you are forced to play as different characters as the game progresses in story mode you must know how to use each character
and even thenthe game can become so frustrating at times that its best that you turn it off and put it on the shelf for a few days
it can be fun at times but most of the time succeeds at being terribly difficultthe control is pretty badand the clunky junk that is the xbox controller does not help matters
special moves are straightforward but difficult to perform because of the responsiveness of the controls
if you have a special kind of gamepad from a third party developer use that instead
they typically have better dpadsoverall the game just seems rushed or incomplete
the lack of sound effects the crazy difficulty and the lack of options and bad control just harm the games fun factor
there is plenty to unlock and there is a decent story tagged along on the game but in the end this game is mediocre in every sense of the word
it will only appeal to diehard xmen fans such as myself
if you are interested in the game give it a rent
you might like itits not a horrible game it just couldve been alot betterthis is barely passable to be rated as a gametheres good reasons why games and comic books should not mix and this is one of themin the game for some characters the player cant do some of the moves as good as the cpu and the moves do not respond to the dpad on timeand there are several glitches in the game as well for instance as i was in practice mode in some arenas the player or opponent can fall threw walls or in some areas where there are big holes in the floor where you can actually walk on them and not fall or get trapped in a wall
and as if that was not bad enough they did a pore job on the blocking move it too dose not respond on time
they have where you can reconfigure your controls on the game yeah a lot of good that dose
but you still dont have the blocking move to where you dont have to strain the hell out of your fingers just to do one stupid moveand as for the affects its a joke and ill give you an example in the game blood roar extreme the lighting in the game looks far more real as to xmen storms lighting balls they look more like balls of yarn
and there fighting stances are just flat out bad
some players can float just over there heads witch doesnt make sense because not only that you cant really hit them anymore and it gives your enemy an open shot at youto sum it all up xmen next dimension was just another sloped together slapped a label on copied and ready to make a buck off of it
they dont care about making a good quality product
just as long as they get your money
and did i mention that you cant save your progress in the gameorginally the idea of an xman title had a strong appeal
however this games lack of fluid movement and disappointing game play quickly became a frustration
the animation is choppy at best
while the characters had potential they just didnt come alive
also the load time between stages is abismal
finally the chacters werent well balanced
i would definately think about renting this game but avoid purchasing iti remember before i actually bought this game i had only played it a couple of times at a movie theater
when i got the ps version about a month ago or whatever i was really excited
i popped it in loaded it up i tried to find mega man   characters huh
looks like  to me
i felt disconcerted
then after a while i discovered an option called secret factor
and i saw mega man in thar and went huh
hes a hidden character
funny because i couldve sworn he was ready to access in the arcade version
so i had to beat the game get some points and i bought mega man
i was happy for the moment
then i was able to get captain commando and m bison and cammy
so i played some more got some more points i went to try and find felicia and morrigan and they dont show up
i play t some more an hour later they still arent there
another  hours later yawn im going to bed
on a final notethis game isnt necessarily the best why settle for this game when you can just play darkstalkers or power stone
anyone that says this game rocks could be mistakenthe original is a little better and more fun than this one
please do me a favor people and reconsider if you should so desirethis is the most broken fighting game of all time but it has namebrand characters so i can see how it got popularas a fighter is it worthy
not reallyit survived on names onlyif it were generic characters it would be a low rated gamethis game is highly flawed
theres a huge misktake with the game this game is on the bluebottom disc format cdromif you are unsure what that means let me explain
playstation  games are on two different formats dvdrom and cdrom
on a cdrom the bottom of the disc is blue and the cd is lighter than a dvd formatwhen any playstation  game is on cdrom format the ps will have problems reading the disc
this is because the disc is lighter than its dvd counterpart causing the disc to wobble when spinning in the ps
this causes loading problems game failing to start and often damage to your system
you read about this problem a lot in game magazinesits unfortunate marvel vs capcom  is on the cdrom format
the gameplay is great actually
however  of the time when you turn on the game it wont start guaranteed
it says quotdisc read errorquot  unless you want to restart your ps four or five times just to start the game this game isnt worth the moneyi know what some people would say there is a solution to this
there is a solution actually but its risky
one solution to make the cdrom disc heavier for ps to read it properly is to put two equal pieces of tape side by side next to the center hole
theres a risk to this though
what if the tape is too light
that means error on ps
what if the tape is too heavy
that means an error also
besides who wants to put some tape on their games
its not worth itlook in the lowerleft hand corner of the games cover the picture on amazoncom
theres a tiny quotdvdromquot logo
unfortunately this is misleading
the game is not on dvdrom format
i dont understand why theres false packaging labelsi know all this because i ordered the game off amazoncom brand new
when the game arrived i put the game in my system
guess what
the ps wouldnt read the disc
my ps is fineall other games work properly
i had to restart my system around five times to get the disc workingif you must buy this game but it on dreamcast or xbox
please stay away from the playstation  version unless you are tolerant of restarting your ps four or five times just to get the game started
be warnedcontra shattered soldier features somewhat interesting graphics the lighting and color is good but character detail is just a tad watered down and tiny
standard gun blasts and explosions round out the sound effects the hard metal music isnt done too well a more ambient or industrial rock track or orchestral music would have been more well suited easy controls are a plus here but just not the replay factor
with all that said this is probably going to be one of the better d games youll see on any of the current console platforms
but that is where this also falls short d games are great for retro collections or even for original content but in this case a konami greatest hits would have been much more fun with all the contras castlevanias etc
this game would have benefited from an upgrade to d like capcoms maximo for ps or like nintendos metroid prime for the gamecube
contra collectors should pick this title up but dont expect much
for casual gamers who want a buttton hitting shootemup frenzy thats different try gungrave for the psi was addicted to contra as a kid
on the old nes there was hardly a better game and i spend hundreds of hours on each one fighting shooting blowing stuff up
i was so excited for this one i could hardly stand it and i didnt care if it was d  in fact i wanted the game to be exactly the same as the old ones
i bought the game put it in and started to playthen i got bored
fast
i couldnt believe it
i played for about  minutes and couldnt take it anymore
i shot some stuff but it just wasnt fun
one of two things happened
either this game is horrible compared to the old games or i just plain grew out of contra
i hope its the formerthis game is hard but in a frustrating way
i dont recommend buying this gamerent it once and you will be sick of it before its due back even if youre a diehard contra fanit has a coop mode but neither of us were that into it
we played it for a little while but just gave upive observed lots of mixed feelings for this game
at the end of the day i think theres some confusion over the target audience for this game
details shall be discussed under the gameplay headingthis game gets a star because it proves one simple point customizing video game women is more fun than customizing video game cars
however both can only hold ones attention for a limited time cars for about  minutes and women for about  minutes
anyway down to the game play
there is no story at all
the story was definately an afterthought so im not going to even consider it
if you have really poor reflexes enjoy playing handheld games or are a fan of computer games you will really enjoy playing the actual volleyball matches
people who like portable gaming will casue it involves smashing buttons and people who like computer games will cause you really only need to use  buttons similar to using a mousethe computer seems to fluctuate randomly between one computer being incompitent and the other being proffesional which is the most fun to play against to both computers being lousy which is ok or both being so good you can consider it cheating which is no fun
that about sums up this gamethis is volleyball
the actual volleyball part of the game is when i hear the title xtreme volleyball i want solid gameplay but you get none of that
and what makes it extreme anyway
sure the bodacious babes are a big plus but the gameplay relies on just hittin the ball over the net with  buttons and hoping you get points
i just felt the lack of interaction
heck tecmo didnt even bother to apply the scoring rules to this volleyball game
only a and b buttons are used
there are basically only  things you can do on offense hit the ball up in the air for your partner then spike it over the net
fun
um not hardly
the computer basically decides the matches and who wins
there is no strategy involved its just game for looks and busty babes nothing more
this is tecmo the makers of ninja gaiden and doa hardcore
anyway then after a boring day playing volleyball you have to go back to the lame island mode and waste time going through useless and boring places on the island
you try to earn the love of other girls by buying them swimsuits and gifts
why would one find this enticing
im sorry this game sucks
sounds like a harsh description but if it wasnt the redeeming factor of the sweet graphics this game would be a total disappointment
is it the worst volleyball game ever
no
but when you pit it against the quality of segas game on the cube its just further proof how bad the volleyball engine really isthe graphics are amazing though
the ladies look better than ever and if they were real id defintely want a few dates
its actually the same engine tecmo used in dead or alive  for the xbox
youll recognize one of the beaches being taken directly from the  and it looks amazing
seagulls flying in the background warm sand curdling your girls feet and the ocean hitting the sand over the horizon
there are also new beaches jungles and islands to play volleyball
once again lush scenery fantastic animations and great graphics are nice but when the gameplay sucks who cares
for the guys that bought the game strictly for the babes they might appreciate the gravure system as tecmo calls it
on days when you want to be alone with your girl you can take her somewhere alone on the island and just look at her basking in the morning sun
youre thoughts of being there with her might be fun for awhile and mind you it is ultra realistic
you can zoom in on her change the camera view and take her to different locations
for added visuals you can also give your girl a nice tan and hook her up with countless bikinis
you can buy tanning oil in the accessory shop and you can watch them over time get a lush golden tan from the sun
if you want to keep them healthy you can also buy sun block
sigh
this sucks
ill say it once and ill say it again visual splendor alone this game rocks but the game sucks it really doesim about to commit an act of treason against men everywhere
im about to give doaebv a negative rating
but i honestly need to
this game as advertised only serves as eyecandy for perverts and a waste of money for gamers everywhere much like the xbox system itself
now dont get me wrong there are definitely some good things about this game
the disc makes a nice frisbee and im sure there are some great posters out there but beyond that it does little in the way of providing a good gaming experience
but then again so little of the xbox games do anyway
i suppose panzer dragoon orta will probably be their one and only breakthrough but beyond that they have little to offer and will thus go the way of the sega dreamcast
there is one truly great thing about the xbox though it makes a truly excellent doorstop
happy playingwithout a doubt this is a very beautiful game
great graphicshowever what i really expected from this game was not just spectacular and sexy graphics but a killer game engine that would overshadow other beach volleyball games on any system just like dead or alive  had excellent gameplay for a fighting game and spectacular graphics
unfortunately this is not the case
the gameplay comes down to pretty much push one of two buttons
even the camera isnt up to the task
more than once did i have to dive for the ball off screenif you are a fan of the characters get the game
if you just want to look at halfnaked girls buy a magazine or look at the screen shots here
if you want to play good volleyball look somewhere elsethis game is only marginally entertaining for about  hours
the volleyball quotgameplayquot is only two buttons
the casino is incredibly boring
the graphics are nice but so what
how long can you look at cartoons in bikinis
the hugest most glaring failure of this game is that there are no character endings ie there is no goal to achieve in this game
you dont even have any real incentive to play volleyball at all except to break up the monotony a little bit
i cant believe this game was actually made and marketed
mines going back to best buy immediatelyif you buying this game hoping to play it on an xbox dont bother
it will not play and there is no update to make it play
i cant really rate it because of this problemthis is one of the werst games ive ever played
the game play is horable
o mansry to the fans of this game this is just wat i think i would not sug jest you buy this game it is a waist of moneythats all for methis is a very mediocre game based on the book
you will probably enjoy reading the book much more than playing this game
if you want a quotlord of the ringsquot game i highly recommend quotthe two towersquot which is much betteractually rent two games because youll finish this one in under  hours and wont want to play it again no replay value whatsoever
theres enough to keep you fairly entertained for that time period but boring battles lame bosses and an overall lack of challenge will make you wish you had looked deeper than that official tolkien product
another complaint that i have is the lack of autosave at the end of each mission
the fact that this game so religiously follows the book and works some of the minor passages into entire levels saved me from rating this game a this game is perfect for people too lazy to read the first book in the trilogy but who want to see all the stuff that got left out of peter jacksons first lotr film
even so my advice to you is this save yourself some moneyby going to see the two towers instead of buying this game
youll be far more entertainedwith the looming release of the blockbuster in the making next installment of the lord of the rings film series it was inevitable that the license would be delved into video games
the recent wave of lotr licensed games have ranged from great lotr the two towers for ps to godawful lotr fellowship of the ring for gameboy advance and here we have the lord of the rings fellowship of the ring for the ps
contrary to what you might think this game has more to do with tolkiens first installment of the books than it has to do with the film
you can control frodo aragorn and gandalf at different parts in the game each of which has similar regular abilities and some special exclusive ones as well
graphicly speaking the game is half decent as is the sound but the control is so frustrating and the camera angles are outrageously bad
half the time youll get killed just because the camera angle wouldnt let you see the enemies right
not to mention that once you strip away the lord of the rings license youll find that the game is really a simple hack  slasher with a hot license attached to it and nothing more
all in all even hardcore fans of the lord of the rings will find something to be disappointed about with this
my recommendation is to skip this and pick up lord of the rings the two towers for the ps for some real funi really liked how they did it based on the book and the movie it was fun to see the shire and the local pubi thought the graphics could be alot better
rivendale was a rippoff because the water didnt move  demensionalthey threw in random levels and charcters which i didnt like
i hated the fact their voices were not the actors in the movies
spoiled it
but it came very fast nd well packaged
i would highly recommend this seller
just not the game
oh nd there were glitches at the endsuperman the man of steel seemed like a super game at first
it controls well has decent graphics and has all of supermans powers
however i didnt even finish this game since it got so boring and repetitive
it had great potential but every misson feels the same and they all are
they are all basically quotgo to point a and destroy those robotsquot
and after you destroy those robots in point a it makes you go to point band over again
you can fight villans though
if you are a hardcore fan of superman comics and stuff you may enjoy this
but i can say that i didnt
it could have been so good too
its the most authentic superman game ive ever played and probably the best one ever
thats not saying very much though considering supermans dark videogame historyim a huge superman fan
you know the bit read the comics since i was a kid absolutley love the movies watch the tv series etc
thats why downing this game is such a let down
this game is only for people who wont believe anything with the quotsquot can be bad until they try itlike me
first off i wouldnt recommend this for the younger audience namely because of the difficulty
the game pretty much just throws you in the game and gives you quick messages like quotoh yeah
heres how you do thisquot
the controls are controller breaking frusterating
you confront ten enemies at once and find yourself getting shot by all while trying to manevuer to get a lock on one
unlike the pss superman shadow of apokolips flying isnt half as fun
ie
no cool christopher reeve arm movements no loops no  degree flyroundsyou fly forwardreal fastsometimes you turn
the character models are terriblepeople ingame look like bulky blobs with little expression
and who did the dialogue for this game
i dont remember superman ever shouting quotholy kryptonquotif he did im sure he was under the influence of something
honestly unless you love superman and just have to find out yourself dont buy this game
if you want to play a good superman game go check out the pss superman shadow of apokolips
sorry supesbut this game was a let downhere is a case of a great game gone bad to the console
at least you can choose from  different boards or themes
however the game quickly becomes redundant watching your piece move the alloted squares
even though you can speed through the walking it still is quite boring
trading and building are almost impossible as you cant read the streets on the screen that allows you to do that
overall spend your money on something elseive always been a big fan of board games on video consoles
monopoly party was next on the list and while it was fun the first few times playing it it does get old fairly quick
the npcs if you choose to play with them are very predictable and annoying at times
i also found myself getting bored and clicking buttons to quicken the pace at times primarily because the animations can take a whilesome members of my household enjoy competing with each other for high scores but the computer goes no higher than 
heck i can get that in well under an hour of playing and by that time i am too bored to care
ill probably throw this game on once in a blue moon to kill some time but thatll be about it for meto me the appeal of suikoden  to so many people is one of the worlds greatest mysteries right up there with roswell stonehenge easter island and jfks assasination
why did so many people enjoy this game so much
my theory is that someone switched the discs in my game when i bought it and that i was actually playing a fake version of suikoden  that really really really suckedwell at any rate ill review the game that i playedsuikoden  is terrible
it is one of the most boring games ive played in my life and i played all the way through it
up to the very end i kept telling myself that the game must get better based on the reviews i read
yep right up to when they started rolling the credits i promised myself the game would get betterit didnt
elizabeth r powells review is actually a pretty good description of my experience though i would disagree with her contention that hugos plotline was worth playing
it wasnt
the worst part of the game hands are the game triggers those events that happen when you enter a certain place that triggers the game to progress
some of the game triggers are so random its ridiculous
sometimes the game doesnt even tell you what you need to do next like the chapter you spend recruiting people and you have to talke to everybody in all the towns you visit
i spent countless wasted hours running from screen to screen trying to figure out how to progress that damn game baffled because apparently i was supposed to know i to go to some remote corner of the castle to speak with some character ive never even met before
how in the world was i supposed to know to do that
and of course the overly high random encounter rate coupled with the boring terrain and terrible music made the whole experience dreadfulthe story hardly makes up for the game either
in fact if the game had good gameplay id probably complain about the boring storyline
the uninspiring characters make you think konami game designers flung darts at a personality chart to come up with their charactersall in all not even worth a rental
but i do implore you if you are the least bit curious about the game based on the other reviews reviewers bribed by konami no doubt conspiracy i tell you rent dont buy the game
dont worry im sure you wont mind if you dont finish it in timethe story is interesting enough i suppose but do i ever hate the battle system and the forced camera angles as you move around
the battle system and the camera angles ruined the whole game for me i couldnt play itand having a donald duckesque character as my body guard really doesnt help me take this game any more seriously
i am a huge fan of suikoden  and  and this game ended up disappointing me to the point of wanting to stay far far away from any new suikoden releasesim about  hours in to the game
graphics are horrible you have to read all the dialog there is no dubbing of any kindthe areas you explore are lineara  year old could navigate these areas
whoever developed the maps should get fired
the story is excellent but they make you go through it  times
gets boring
this is one of those games that i had to put down and come back to out of boredom
i would not reccamend this game to anybodyi was thrilled with the idea of this game
i couldnt imagine playing a game like contra iii on a bus or at an airport or wherever
id probably start screaming and putting random people in the crippler crossface or something and eventually getting sued only to tell the judge i was playing contra iii and he would say the defendant has pleaded contra iii case dismissed
contra iii had that kind of effect on you in a good way
unfortunately this game has that effect on you in a bad wayfirst of all its worth noting that the overhead levels of contra iii were replaced with a couple levels from the sega contra game
okay thats fine
oh and also you can only hold on to one gun at once and there are no bombs in the game
ehh alright so its more of a combination between contra iii contra hard corps and the original contra
oh and the gameplay controls are ultrasensitive and theres very little margin for error
and the screen seems way too small to fit the impossibly insane amount of things going on
now im really getting annoyed
and i think thats the right word for it
this game is annoying
annoyingly disappointing
its only redeeming quality is the superb presentation and graphics and maybe for letting your closest enemy play it while telling him hey look its contra iii and its portable
really
sweet
five minutes passsaid enemy throws gba at my face as hard as he cani was so elated to find out konami was releasing a new version of the snes classic contra  for the gameboy advance
to my disappointment i didnt find myself having as much fun with this version as i did several years ago on my old  bit machine
my biggest gripe is that the game walks the fine line between excessively challenging and unenjoyably frustrating
what were the developers thinking
you can no longer toggle between weapons rather whatever you pick up is what you shoot with
this wouldnt be a major issue if certain weapons werent useless in certain situations
there are also no more bombs so you better pray you have quick reflexes to get you out of those super tight spots
aside from the difficulty issue the only other major flaw is the archaic passwordsave feature which is totally inconvinient for a portable game
everything else is actually ok
the game looks just like the old snes version and has aged quite gracefully making for a really nice looking portable game
controls are tight and alleviate some of the stress from the frantic learning curve
if your looking for an insanely hard shooting game and i mean insanely hard for those long car rides by all means contra advance is a perfect choice
for those looking for a game that is a little more enjoyable and rewards skill rather than luck you should go somewhere else and for the old contra fans pick it up used for some old thrills then pull out your snes and really put some time into the old gamei recently borrowed this game from a friend
while i dont like first person games id heard that a little ways in it became mainly third person and had some awesome battles
i thought quotokay ill suffer the first few levels and then be treated to some great actionquot
well i was wrong i was tortured the first few levels and then only somewhat amused when the switch happened
i hardly even play st person games and can tell a good one from a bad one and this is bad
also the controls in both perspectives use the control stick and the dpad heavely
how on earth can i use both at the same time
this ones for star wars fans and fps lovers only
despite some cool battles in rd person it just wasnt that funi wont go into the games other aspects as the other reviewers have done a good job desbribing the story controls and overall gameplay
what i will touch on is the awful character animations and overall mediocre graphics
maybe im just jaded from playing splinter cell but the characters here are laughable especially the death animations
the ai is also pathetic
more than once did i have at least  to  stormtroopers run from me in terroradd in the frustrating puzzles plus repetitive music and you have a game that i found to be barely playablegraphics  this game has great graphics but it doesnt use the full power of the xboxgameplay  if you want a good fps then just get halo
if you really want this game get it for pc
if you get it for pc my friend says you can get thirdperson for guns and everything
if you get it for xbox you can only get p mode for the lightsabersound  you dont really hear much sound except for the gunshots and lightsaber swingsreplay value  their is pretty much nothing to make you play this game again except multiplayer
the multiplayer is pretty boring
btw i have never gotten the internet to workoverall  gets old after a whilethis will not be a comprehensive review kids
i just wanted to throw a few things out there that were unfortunately not included in video game mag reviews but then again no one from lucas arts is paying me for ad space ya dig
i played the pc version of jedi outcast at a friends and really wanted to pick up a copy on my way home that day  it played well and looked sweet
that didnt happen due to work and school schedules and by the time i had any time to play a few new games this puppy was out of the xbox  woo hoo
i was stoked that i could play this game in the comfort of my living room using a controller that works with my larger hands
another bonus was reading several publicized reviews stating that the xbox version was every bit as good as its pc partner nopethe graphics for the xbox version are kinda sad
no theyre not atari  bad go little yellow dot go
 but both lucas and gates should be smacked silly for not utilizing the graphical prowess this machine has
the only conclusion i can come to is laziness and the assumption that hardcore fans will buy any game with the star wars license which seems to be the case if youre played many of the early sw pc games
ech
if you ever saw the difference between the pc and ps version of max payne then you know what to expect
its a shame reallythe gameplay is not so great either
for a big chunk of this game youre playing a lackluster fps at best
i really wanted a fast and furious shooter that took place within the star wars universe
what i got was a lame fps with goofy puzzles that annoy more than entertain such as just trying to figure out where youre supposed to go finally figuring that out but now you cant open the door you know you have to go through and then spending too much time backtracking to find the switch that you wizzed past that opens another door somewhere else that leads to yet another panel that allows you to finally move on
this would be more interesting if there was action involved to break up the hunt for the hidden switch but you killed off everyone on this part of the map within two minutes
snooooooooze
i really really wish that someone in the various reviews i read had mentioned that there was a large puzzle element involved and that theyre pretty lame
if this game had been released on n way before goldeneye it would have been pretty cool but were way past that now
and good luck if you get stuck with a friendly character that is tagging along for that levelmap
theyre really good at getting themselves shot and if you try to run ahead to protect them you either get wasted or they run in front of you and you waste them  game over
repeat
making it to the point where you can use a saber is really not worth it imho
i only made it that far to try and justify that price of buying this game new  waste of time and a big mistake on my part
the multiplayer is kinda fun bc you can throw a ton of bots on the map with both weapons and sabers
its chaotic but pretty much any other game with such options will blow this one away
there are a lot of maps and game types to choose from but again the game doesnt look that great and you always have the feeling that you should be spending your time on something more deserving like pulling nose hairs or waxing the carpetif youre a diehard fan this game may still be worth it
you will see familiar characters and the sounds are all the same but you should demand better
this is a licensing deal and not much more
the xbox port was either rushed or no one cared  either way we lose
please rent this first if youre still curious or if you live in cincinnatinky there will be one more used copy on the market very very sooni loved the shinobi series and its games were amazing thus far but this one doesnt really live up to its predecessors and on top of that its difficulty can rip a metal grinder into shreds
i liked the fact that the main character spoke in japanese but anyways to the important part here most enemies are exaggeratedly hard to defeat and not even the original arcade shinobi from  was this punishing when it came to defeating enemies and that is saying a lot since i actually like the original shinobi arcade game and the revenge of shinobi sega genesis installment
while i dont mind a bit of challenge i definitely dont find being ripped to shred every time i play the game in seconds with that obnoxious game over screen my idea of fun
no thanks i think im going to just replay super metroid thank you very muchafter seeing this game on tv commercials  on gtv games tv on digital cable ch i decided to buy this instead of renting first which you should not do
anyway the graphics are looking  bit genesis and the gameplay is just like a typical sega genesis game
i agree with the guy below falling in a pit is gaurenteed more than your satisfaction with this game
you can tell this was a rushed project
the cutscenes are the highlight of this game they were cool but the graphics during gameplay 
the enemy ai is worse than ninja turtles  gta they might as well be mannaquins
the obstacles were harder than the enemies
the first boss is a helicopter which is lame
i highly recommend way of the samurai  devil may cry  instead if this game
dante will be able to run along walls in the upcoming sequel
rent this before buyingif you want to play the ultimate shinobi game go to the used game store near your house and pick up revenge of shinobi for the defunct sega genesis
believe it or not this game has more depth and dare i say it better graphics and sound 
than the new ps versioni never got past the second level of this game not because it was too hard but because the game is insanely boring
every bad guy in the first stage is exactly the same and there are no other challenges except to stab and slash your way through them
the first boss is ridiculous and you dont even get to dispose of it before some woman comes and helps you outthen when the second stage started and it looked exactly the same as the first stage with the same enemies and backgrounds i said enough with this
revenge of shinobi had creativity unique challenges wellthoughtout levels good music excellent graphics and more none of which this version has
perhaps if the creators of ps games would spend more time on gameplay and less time on cinemastyle scenes between levels that no one ever watches anyway wed get better gamesthis game is way to hard and repetitive
your sword eats away at your health if you dont feed it
the graphics arent that good
the levels look alike
hard to master the controls
the story is stupidif you cant handle a full on rant dont read this or my golden axe beast rider review i did a few months back
so here we go shinobi ps or shinobi  if you are a casual gamer dont bother with this game its very difficult
it has to be said dn you sega you have to bring back an old franchise  like how sega has been ran since they went rd party have fed it up  the story is pretty good but shy controlls ruin it bad camera angles the controller freezing up i have to skip levels which makes me miss out on a pretty good story  its about this ninja hotsuma who is trying to stop this group from resurrecting this sorcer most of his clan have been killed  tokyo is on the verge of collapse because of these new creatures called hellspawn
other than a good story this game is epic fail to what could have been a epic game
to sega shinobi golden axe  sonic all kicked a on the genesismegadrive  how about you play the original genesis games simon jeffryabout a year ago after hearing loads of repeated mumblings concerning this titles difficulty and as someone who loves a challenging game i decided to purchase this
boy was it waste of my im not really much of a stickler for graphics but i will say the games graphics were decent
in terms of presentation this game fails at everything environmentwise
to go into the previous statement a little further i will say that the games environments are all very shallow and lacking in creativity
i cant tell you how many times i saw the exact same dull environment design throughout my limited playthroughthe subject of gameplay is the sole reason why i gave this game  stars
devil may cry debuted on the ps in  with hack and slash gameplay that was engaging deep and rewarding
fastforward to close to the end of  and we have shinobi a game with an inexcusable extreme lack of depth and repetitive soulless gameplay
i cant tell you how fast this game bored me with the same  combo combination unlike devil may cry you cant vary your slashes or work your projectile weapon into your combo
i could even accept that the sword constantly drained my health as i idled but that fact added nothing in terms of feelings of tension or incentive to keep playing
in addition it was kind of cool to pull of those multiple kills at first but after i did it the th time in one level that feeling of excitement lost its luster fastnow i played about  levels but after that i could go no more
i must again reaffirm it has nothing to do with difficulty but this gameplay just led me to keep asking myself so does it ever get deeper
does he get newer abilities as he progresses
does it ever
and it hit me like a rock when i realized the answers to all my questions was this no
its for this very fact alone that i really dont think ill ever beat this gameand thats it a very short review for a very narrow game
so as a recap for interested parties this title is for those who dont notice gameplay that never varies and never gets deeper as well as those simple minded enough to be wowed by fps graphics
for the rest of us however theres to many games out there are actually fun to playi remembered playing shinobi the original arcade version when i was a kid and it was the first game i ever beat
that was a great feeling and ill never forget that
i was really looking foward to this and i bought it the first day it came out
all the other reviews are correct after level  it got repeative even the graphicsand really difficult
if anyone decides to play this i recommend gameshark codes youll need them
i like challenges but this was more frustrating than a challenge
i was very dissapointed with this they couldve done so much better
this game i wished i waited till the price went down definately not worth the  but i went ahead and bought it anyways bad mistake on my part
some will like this and some will notfrom a long time shinobi fan i am very dissapointed in this game
its a pure action game with some cut scenes to highlight the hacking and slashing you will do throughout
combos are intresting way to rack up points and power up your sword but when you fight so many enemies at once and they block all frontal attacks its gets very annoying
you end up jumpingdashing around everyone to try and get behind them but then the camera only does an adaquate job of keeping up and you lose half the enemies behind it  meaning attacks from the side you cant seegraphics are pretty nice for the ps but its definetly showing its age
the textures do get pretty bland and unimaginative though
running through a city with pale purple neon lights and almost nonexistant signs or moonlight or interactable objects besides a few boxes and vending machines is boringsound is average no tunes stick out in my head and i usually forget its even playing after ahwilestory is medicore at best  not really even worth mentioningcontrols get the job doneeven though i own all the other shinobi games on home consoles i would have to recommend this as a rental
go pick up one of the genesis titles for some better platforming actionafter the other  spyro games on the ps and how awesome they were we got this one after
when i was younger i was excited but now that im a lot older my opinion has changed about the gameprosstill the old school spyro gameplay  collecting gems collecting a key item in this game it was dragonfliescan shoot bubbles ice and thunder my personal favorite instead of just fire nowhas all the abilities from the past spyro games so you dont have to necessarily reobtain themconsonly one world with  levels  if you count the home worldthe  levels can get dull and hard to find especially if youre missing  gemthe minigames are kind of boring and repeated over the course of the  levels except in the luau level with the drums and the jungle where you had to climb that massive towerthe game gets laggy in a speedrun stagethe bubble breath is really useless only used for catching dragonfliesthe wing shield is also extremely useless used in one level to get one dragonfly plus the hit redirection is backwardsmoneybags is only met once in the entire game and its in the first level
you only need to pay him  gems and thats it
gems arent used in the rest of the game except for  completion and you dont get the gems you paid back like you did in the other gamesthe final boss is kind of hard at first but really stupid once you figure out the pattern or just go on gamefaqs and find out how to kill himthe game took less than  hours for me to beat
it is really shorti honestly thought this game couldve been a lot better being on stronger and better hardware than a ps
they did pretty good with the gba version that came out before this one
i dont see why they couldnt follow itin conclusion dont bother with this game unless you are a major spyro fan or if you can snag it for  or lessas you guys probably know i am an avid fan of crash bandicoot and spyro the dragon
the ps enries were really enjoyable for all ages and helped define my childhood and preteen years
however as usual when a franchise is given over to different companies there is always a dip in quality and this is a prime example of a game that the developers didnt have that much time to work on
this is the same case as the first rocky game for the same console generation along with sonic  tomb raider the angels of darkness  the nes version of action  and it beyond any doubt shows
here are the aspects were i feel this game could have improved on had the developers been given more time to refine itgraphics  i know this is more like a personal preference thing and it matters the least but to quote the angry video game nerd to some degree on the transition to  bits the graphics are even cheesier and more cartoonish but not the worst i have seen
in contrast take a look at the original ps trilogy  bits less but x more appealing to the eyecontrols and gameplay  i admit that it is nice that spyro has virtually the same moves as its predecessors with a few new ones such as wing shields and different breath abilities and it isnt the worst controls i have experienced but it feels a little bit sluggish while the original ps games feel more fluent
plus using the bubble breath to get the dragonflies is more tedious than using your ice breath to get fireflies in season of flameload times ps  just like crash bandicoot the wrath of cortex the load times are pretty long considering that they were released when the ps was in its earliest years
at least the gamecube version and the greatest hits revision sped up the load times though maybe increasing the disc speed on the ps may help but i havent tried it yet on this gamemore levels and worlds  they planned on having more stages and worlds for spyro to traverse in and retrieve the dragonflies but they really had to cut corners due to a very short amount of time to make this game
because of this it is really short and only worth it for a rental out of curiosityglitches  as you guys probably know every game has glitches no matter what
sometimes people like finding glitches because of what the nerd pointed out in his game glitches video such as finding errors that the developers missed or exploring outside the rules
however it becomes a problem if the glitches get in the way of the gameplay and not activate upon command which is what the ps version suffers from
for example the cloud  stage crashes and the jurassic jungle layout may disappear just to name a few
at least the gamecube version fixed the fatal glitches and left in the harmless ones like swimming through air and phasing through the gate shadowcat style for exampleand last but not leastresolve the cliffhanger from year of the dragon about gnasty gnorc and ripto teaming up on another attack against our main heroes
just solely adding ripto on stealing the dragonflies doesnt have that much dept in execution and isnt worth it in the long runhere is another nitpick that i want to point out
even though pamela hayden returns as bianca is it me or was her microphone messed up during recording
this is because her voice was a little bit squeakier than its predecessor for some reasonhere is also a saving grace
once again the stewart copeland music was excellent as usual
i recognize his signature music style anywhere
he is wellknown for being the drummer for the band known as the police and did a fair share of film scores and the first four console games of this series during a hiatus with some notable examples being rumble fish and tvs the amanda show as well as a few mistakes like good burger and highlander  the quickeningin conclusion it isnt the worst game i have ever played they at least tried with that amount of time they were given and the gamecube version is an improvement over the ps but it still makes you wish you were playing the ps trilogy insteadenter the dragonfly has good graphics and fun gameplay but it is not going to be a challenge for experienced players
the characters are often fun and silly and they constantly bounce up and down in an annoying manner
there are nine levels and each one has some sort of challenge portaldriving a tank racing against the clock or rivals sliding down a slide etc
spyro uses fire ice elctric and bubble elements
he also can use wing shield charge and horn dive
for those that do not know it focuses on puzzles and challenges not on combat like the legend of spyro series
overall while it is relatively fun it will probably be shortlived entertainment for experienced playersthis is just not a very good game
its something to do if you already have it but if you dont own it dont buy it
if you want something like this id suggest getting spyro a heros tail
its similar but they did a better jobthe story involves ripto taking all the dragonflies and scattering them all throughout the different levels of the game and spyro must get them back
ill admit the game can be a little fun at times
there are a lot of dragonflies to find mini games to play
there are also a bunch of gems to collect if youre in to that sort of thing though i dont recall ever actually needing them except once in world 
spyro also has a variety of different breath attacks like ice and lightning which is nice
and theres a variety of levels like the jungle or the thief hideout or the cloud level
my biggest problem is this game doesnt seem very wellmade
it just feels at times like the people who made it didnt care
and if they didnt care i dont really eithermy first issue is really more of an annoyance
i dont get why the dragonflies try to escape from you
youre trying to help them and spyro must chase them down and use his bubble breath to capture them
it can be quite annoying trying to catch the darn things and take a while
did princess peach run from mario
no
did princess zelda try to escape from link
no
why do the dragonflies feel the need to fly away from methe game can also be glitchy
i heard the gamecube version isnt as bad and the loading while slow isnt as slow as other versions and i never had big glitches but i had them
once spyro got stuck up against something and kept moving like he was running and he wouldnt stop
i pressed different buttons and i tried to pause the game and leave the area but couldnt
finally he suddenly stood still
i think there was another time he did something similar when i tried to get him to talk to someone
often times the ground disappears in one part of world   theyre not a really big deal or anything
its just these things shouldve been fixedand maybe im nitpicking but i think the voice acting is often not that good and the character design seems just odd
the characters are just always moving and bouncing and looking all over
they almost look like theyre stretching sometimes almost
its just bizarre
it almost feels like they were left somewhat unfinishedso while this game can have its fun moments i really wouldnt waste any money on it
theres just a lot of little things that add up to me having a big problem with it
i just really get the feeling the developers didnt care and i dont want to play a game like that
i will admit something though
i think this games version of sparx is adorable despite not being able to understand him
if they couldve shown the same creativity and thought as that maybe it wouldve been a better game
like i said get spyro a heros tail instead
its similar but nearly everything is done bettermore sonic re releases
i think weve played sonic  and  if we wanted to by now
same with sonic an knuckles and the rest of the junky games you get on this disk
its not worth the money unless you see it for  dollars at a garage salepanzer orta is yet another game release from the new sega and like many of segas new releases this game was hyped beyond belief before its release but ultimately pdo turned out to be mediocre at best much like toejam  earl iii jsrf gunvalykrie etcthe potential for this game to succeed was staggering
with the fine legacy left by the sega saturn trilogy and hot off the heals of the fantastic pd saga i expected pdo to turn out at least on par with what the saturn versions had to offer
instead we get gameplay very reminscient of the early pd games basically linear excursions through graphically impressive levels with mind numbingly lengthy boss battles
the desire to replay the stages just isnt there and when they constantly throw boss battles that take up to  minutes to complete im not exaggerating heretheres a timer counting down your boss battles pdo just gets old and stale rather quicklyyeah yeahsega threw in a host of challenges and unlockables in teh pandoras box including the full version of pd but i didnt buy an xbox to play  year old sega saturn games ive already played to deaththe story is rather bizarre and the minigames you play in the pandoras box at first seem to have no connection whatsoever to the main game it gets clearer as you go on but the trial and error nature of these challenges will turn off many gamers
instead of turning out to be an epic game on the xboxone that would be talked about for years like the saturn games pdo has basically become one of those games that only the hardcore players will flock to and has quickly fallen out of sight and has rarely been mentioned sinceif this is what sega has become today then ill be very wary of any new releases from them in the futurei thought this game would be good but i was very dissapointed when i played itconsterrible graphicsenveriments need worked oncant see your guncant tell if enemy or on your sideproscoop modeyou can pick what type of soilders you want with youthis game is quite well done but i did not enjoy playing it because it is so slowpacedgameplay in the games campaign mode you have two teams with  members in each
there are  missions you have to complete and three different difficulty settings
there is nightvision and lots of different weapons
the problem i found with this game is it is way too slow
you spend a lot of time just running around and not actually shooting anyone which i find boring
i have not played it on live but that may make it bettergraphics the graphics were a huge dissapointment especially on the xbox which is supposed to have superior graphics to the other systemssoundthe sound is quite excellent but sound alone is not something to buy a game onreplay value i think this game might have pretty good replay value but i cant say  because i havent had it that long
the capability of playing it on xbox live will definently add to this replay value but doing the same missions again and again could get boringoverall i was disappointed with this game but that is probably because im not a fan of slower games
if you are someone that really likes something very realistic to the military and dont care that there isnt much shooting involved this game is probably for you
if you dont like slow games or games with little action i wouldnt reccomend it but you can always rent it to try it out
i hope this helped you outif your looking for a good simulation of a military force moving around under your control and killing bad men then do yourself a favor and buy socom navy seals
there is nothing this game has that socom doesnt nothing youd want anywayin ghost recon your always in st person
thats fine but show me a gun and a couple of hands at least
when you shoot bullets come out of nowhere and move in the direction of your target
absolutely no sense that your the one firing a weaponto boot the gunshots sound horrible
again if youve played navy seals or medal of honor you will be disappointedthe whole thing of being able to jump from one man to another is only confusing at best and lends nothing to being able to control the groupwhile navy seals had some flaws like the fact that your other team members are completly incapable of throwing grenadesin single player mode anyway and you sometimes have to repeat commands twice or even  or  times it is still a far superior game in every sensei would give navy seals  starsghost recon barely gets away with im pretty open to most games in fact i dont find too many shooters that i dont enjoy and to top that off i really enjoy more quotrealisticquot gamesunfortunately ghost recon fails in nearly all environments excluding online playyou see in single player you run around mostly in forest type terrain you cant actually see any enemies because there are too many trees and the graphics are so poor that you cant barely distinguish a bush and an enemynow here is the huge problem you have  other teammates all controlled by ai unless you switch to them specifically they  of them run through the level on a predetermined path and easily kill all their enemies without stopping
the  guys that run with you are gauranteed to see the enemy and kill the enemy before you ever even realize they are there remember you cant see anythingthis game has a superb concept but just completely lacks in its actually gameplay its annoying and boringif you are an intense online player this game will provide tons of action packed fun on xbox live but by all means avoid it for the single player missionsif you are looking for realisticsemirealistic shooters try out conflict desert storm i and ii both very fun squad play in first person stealth action great weapons great squad dynamics etcinstead of writing a full review i dont think it is worth the time i will give you some words that describe the gamedumbsloweasyshortcornystupidunoriginalin other words while at a local store for  hours i was able to complete the entire game
in my words go get a real gamemetroid fusion is a classic d side scroller adventure
you walk around a maze and jump up and down to complete each objective on the way blasting away aliensmutantsugly videogame characters
i appreciate its ease of controls vs castlevania the latter requiring you to press all the buttons at the same time
the graphics is also among the best ive seen and finally visible on the sidelit screen of the sp
but games like this are pretty boring after a few minutes and if you are good you can beat it in a couple hours with little replay value
try renting firstwell folks lets lay the facts out on the table
evolution worlds seemed promising from the start
the characters were pleasant to look at and they each had a unique and interesting personality
the plot seemed intriguing enough and i was happy to go explore mag launcher the main characters house and pannam town
everything went well until i actually had to go to a dungeon to do some adventuring
gaaaaack
it was very monotonous and annoying
each floor of the ruins looked the same and all the baddies on each level were yes you guessed it the same
believe me whoever created the floor plan of that place had no imagination at all
after i completed my assignment there was another extensive cut scene which once again drew me into the plot
i thought quotmaybe it isnt as bad as i think
probably the next dungeon will be totally differentquot
wrongo
the next place was even worse than the last considering there were  more generic floors to visit than the last place
id say to you quotdont waste your time on this game
if you want a good rpg to snuggle up with on a cold winters night you wont find it herequot
however if you must go out and rent the game youll regret it very quickly
but heaven forbid dont buy the game youll soon find yourself crying next to your gamecube yelling quotwhy
why
quot and im sure none of you feel like having a mental breakdown this early in life
trust mepros fancy matrixstyle moves the game is severely discounted voice talent is from the tv series frequent save games simple controls to pull off a variety of movescons very very repetitive uninteresting storyline between sequences pulling off the fancy moves doesnt really get you much new ai is poor
far too easy to stealtily take down the enemy game world is far too constraining
there is far too little to do when fighting the boss you lose the ability to use your weapons and health packswhen this game came out i was a little warynot sure if i wanted to be disappointed but unable to not rent it
sigh
difficulty confirmed
even when you get the hang of things you never really do
everytime you think you have it the next scene has more and bigger badder enemies
that would be fine if there had been some training in the beginning something to tell you how to fight combo sneak successfully
its pretty straight forward you follow a path climbing and burning your way to your goal
which of course you cant see very far ahead
thats everything wrong without the stiff mechanical gameplay nothing new story and speedchangesreally if you must try this as a fan rent it
by the time its due back youll be plenty frusterated
its games like this that make good games like this never get made
i guess well never get veronica mars the gamei recommend the buffy game instead
major buffy fanthis game is ok if your looking for a shooter on the cube but there were much better later recon games and other shooters that came out later
get metal gear for the cube instead
you get a much better game that is also collectibleghost dogs of moon lake is not the best addition to the nancy drew series although not the worst either
the game contains some neat features like a hidden speakeasy and one of the largest networks of passageways in any nancy drew game
however the game can be very frustrating at times with a forest maze which nancy must continually navigate as well as annoying puzzlesthe story and charactersthe game begins with nancy visiting a friend who lives in a small cabin near a lake
nancys friend however has fled the scene to escape from ghost dogs which seem to be attacking the house
naturally there is more going on than meets the eye and nancy must dig into the past to uncover what is really happeningthe story is decent not incredibly intriguing but certainly not bad
i wanted to finish the game to see how everything turned out so that does say somethingunfortunately the characters arent particularly outstanding or interesting
there are only three suspects and one of them a birdwatcher is particularly annoying and unlikable in generalthe atmospherethe setting takes place in a wooded location around a lake
besides her friends property nancy can take a motor boat across the lake to a visitors center as well as a general store
im not much of a woods person so i felt the locations in general were below average for a nancy drew game
however i did appreciate the speakeasy and the large number of passagesan incredibly frustrating component of the game is exploring the forest near nancys friends cabin
it is set up like a maze and it is easy to get lost
a map is provided but it still can be very frustrating
nancy must navigate this forest numerous times throughout the gamethe music is decent alternating between cheerful to quite creepythe puzzlesmany of the puzzles in the game are annoying especially for someone who does not enjoy puzzles in general
the game wasnt good enough to make me want to spend time to solve the puzzles and i relied on hints for most puzzles throughout the gamein closingi would not play the game again
ghost dogs of moon lake has nothing particularly outstanding about it
the annoying maze and puzzles make the game which is only average to being with subpar
if you are an avid collector of nancy drew games then youll probably want to play this
however if you are just starting the series forget about this one unless it is below slick exspensive joystick
by the way you have to make sure the scencor reads the joystick for it to work
anyways i had the batterys go out on me in the middle of a flight
so my tip to you is either have back up key board keys for flying or get a new joystickgood pc gameshalflifecstrikebattle field  the ultimate war gameyou can drive tanks boats jeeps motorcycles planes carriers etc
helocopters toolook for a few hours the game is fun if you enjoyed it on the pc actually i completed the game on pc but somehow the controls dont add up to the addictive playability i had expected
glad that i sold the gameproblem of the game is you cant save only inbetween levels
this means playing over and over a level and each one is quite big so a replay of  level takes half an hour easilyeither rent it or buy it for max  and sell it for  some weeks later  i didnow a days just about every portable device psp ps vita gameboy color android iphone ipad ipod have some kind of camera device you can use to take pictures record video even save them to a memory card
some take good shots some arent as goodthis device is no exception
the gameboy advance has its own camera you can use to take snap shots of yru friends locations or whatever you are into
the device fits purfectly on top of your gameboy advance not designed for the fliptop gameboy advance and you can hold it just like a camera
the camera can swivel from one to face you or you can have it face away so you can take aimed shots
the package comes with a serial com port cable a special cap for the lens that helps reduce sun glare when take pictures outside and software on cd to help you download the images to your windows pc
here are some of the concerns you may want to consider before buying this item
it will not hold a lot of shots and the pictures are of low quality shots
it requires a watch battery to keep it powered the gameboy advance does not supply it power
sadly most pcs dont support the serial com cable that comes with the device
does not come with a game but does allow you to somewhat edit your photos on the gameboy advance
the software is designed for windows xp will not work on vista because of the old technologyoverall its not a bad idea but the fact that the power comes from a small watch battery is not the most brilliant idea to put on a camera especially since people who use the camera are only going to use it for fun not to keepa nice device to have but you are better off getting a real camera that can actually store pictures as well as keep them stored rather than depend on the battery life and hope the battery doesnt die
also you will have a hard time trying to use the cable it comes with when most pcs dont have that kind of serial com in the back of your pc
not all pcs have one anyways just keep this in mind and then consider if its worth the headache
a nice camera but has very limitationsi grew up playing games in arcades and at home on my atari   i thought buying this game would bring me back to the fun i had as a kid
it didnt
the game itself is fine however with the upgraded technologies graphics sounds controls of todays games these just dont seem fun anymorea lot of people are going to disagree and thats fine
this is simply my opinion based on  hours of game playthis game is horrible
the first few hours are awesome and youll think its fun
that charm soon vanishes and all youre left with is a boring older duller version of kingdom hearts  as far as gameplay goes anywaysthrow in some cheap watered down version of sim city and there you go
oh and the building of townsyeah mind numbingly boringeverybody says this is like zelda for ps
i say they must be smokin something awesome because this is nowhere near zeldadont buy into the hype its false and youll waste moneyoh ick
did everyone who wrote a good review for this game forget to mention that you have to survive the game on only  hp
the only way to increase that is to find an item that is less then easy
theres almost too much to this game i can see why people spend over  hours on this game im only   hours in and im already exsausted by the nonsense
peeui started this game today and i loved the first game when it was new but this one just isnt up to par
theres no way to dodge anything
try jumping to the side of a rolling turtle and it follows you
same goes for fireballs both of which are just stupidly unbelievable
ive died at least  times on just the third level of the first dungeon because of fireballs
you also cant block fireballs and even if you do block other things they cause half damagealso when i first turned on the game i was thrown into a battle against  or  robots and just told the button commands
thats incredibly hard to do right out the gate
i died the first time just trying to get used to the controlsthe first dark cloud was great and i enjoyed playing it
this sequel started off great then began to deteriorate after the long game playthe controls were easyno issues with the playthe problem is the game began to become more tedious and slow when you get further in
the inventions were difficult to find and some of the pictures to take were impossible unless you look online for a walk through or purchase a clue book
you can create powerful weapons if you new the combination and what pictures to take
some pictures you would have no idea what they are unless you were the creator of the gamedo you know what an electric sesame is
a stove that looks like a fireplaceyeah how could i not know thatadvancing in the game may be confusing since the clues are vague again you may need to look online or use a cluebookthe ending was ridiculous
you have to defeat two characters after the first you go through several underlings before you face dark cloud
the whole thing can take about minutes if you lose you start by fighing the first boss
the whole process was tedious and diffiuclt for any gamer
i like a challenge but this was beyond and you cant save between the fights
worth buying it but dont pay more than 
you will only play it once that was good for meas the title says i do hate being a critic because i couldnt even make a game in qbasic but this game is annoying it will tick you off
first of all there is no fury or edge to this game
the soundtrack is awful and doesnt go with the game at all
there are flaws to this game with are rediculous
first of all if you hit a rotting wood crate going mhp it will not cause you to go flying  yards it will break
second of all you get a pixel off the track and this annoying screen comes up and tells you to get back on the track in  seconds
it will distract you it will tick you off
this game could be great but it needs work and i hope version  corrects these problem
please spend you money somewhere else or at least buy this usedi should have really given this game one star but as my tag line reads the cut scenes are top notch
well acted well written and a fantastic view of the world the game is trying to illustrate these cut scenes are some of the best i have ever seen
however if you buy a game for the actually game playing avoid this one like the plague
the character animation is really poor it is too slow the player has no control over the tempo of their character and the on screen information is nonexistenti read the ps magazine write up of the game and the designers were talking about how they thought that this game both provided insights into the world of crime found no where else and brought a level of maturity to gaming that has not been seen before
in my opinion and the opinion of ps magazine these were slights against the grand theft auto series and in this case they were slights that do not reflect reality
this game may and let me emphasize may be better than grand theft when it comes to cut scenes but when one looks at the rest of the game the getaway is a sad pretender to what its designers hoped it would be
if you are looking for a game to buy go out and buy gta  or vice city do not buy the getaway you will be very disappointedokay maybe my view would have been different had i not played vice city beforehand but i have and so the getaway gets a poor review
the cutscenes are topnotch almost hollywood quality and i hate to say this but having the fword just makes the game cooler
the pros stop there thoughgamepley is awful
the main character moves slowly and awkwardly
cars handle realistically but that doesnt mean they handle in a playable manner
i do like how the cars run poorer and poorer as they get more and more damaged but the damage itself is unrealistic
the camera is awful never in the right place
controls are bad as well sure you have autoaim but you basically just have to hold down r until everything is dead because there is no telling what it is you are shooting at
i could go on and on but the fact is that i dont care enough about this game to put it down i just want to warn you gamers out there
im going back to vice cityone of the most eagerly awaited games came to our screens and consoles not with bang but with a burp
it seems that team soho have decided to take a few steps back in the modern day d actionshootemupdriverdrama by releasing something that is more than a few notches down from what they should be capable of doingfirst of all there are no camera angles in the car other than rd person driver view
no rear view or side views or interior views which is a total shame since it seems like the game engine could actually handle it
why bother creating a realistic map of london if we cant look around a bit or even see the police cars that are chancing us
seriouslyso okay we will forgive it maybe if something else happens like the ultra cool combo movements we have been hearing about but alas max payne style character animation has been thrown out the door for something that looks like it has just popped out from afraid of the dark 
the character does two cool movements period
these are breaking necks and acting drunk when all shot up
okay very cool but i think i paid some money for a game herethe cut scenes story and character animation are not bad at all but i would rather watch lock stock and two smoking barrels than this
i really wanted to play the getaway and when the action starts and you begin driving you have about three minutes fun and then it all starts to get very repetitive
the car smash physics controls and damage are great but it is still a few notches down from what you expect dont expect any stunts or overturning in the getaway either because it is simply a bit boring
a few ramps here and there would have made all the differenceokay so we drive and then we reach the place where we are supposed to do some shooting with sort of around the corner style shots and taking hostages as bullet shields before capping them because they have served their purpose
cool
for awhile and then you find that the actual control of the character is like a  bet
sometimes it works and aims and you can shoot and sometimes the enemy is running through a wall or you seem to have targeted him even though he is standing behind a wall and then someone you where aiming at vanishes into a wall and then you say to hell with this someone get the getaway into product testing fast
and this is the moral of the storyteam soho have clearly put themselves under pressure to release a game for that christmas period
well that is fine with me and if product stability is put second to xmas sales figures then fine but to be quite frank i feel that i will use caution with team soho releases
all it would have taken is a little more testing a few fixes here and there and then we would have something to boast aboutdrivr and vice city had bugs but where playable this one is totally notfirst off this game features the most downright ugly hero youll ever seethe controls are sluggish and annoying
ammond runs like a thunderbirds puppet and it becomes a feat in itself to simply move aboutcant run and shoot
very innovative
when you stand still the baddies shoot you
go figurein this realistic game our gormless hero cant open doors jump over foothigh blockades or jump at all and recovers from shotgun blasts to the face by leaning against wallsthe game isnt fun in the same way gta is the car chase bits are deathly dull due to the fact that youll crash into a car or pole every ten seconds
the cops cant pull you out of your car either so its more of an endurance test than a challenge just keep ploughing alongthe regular cars barely move at all only the lexuses and sportscars are worth jackingno camera angles in the car sections so mission briefs like bring the triads to our hq and make sure that they follow you are nonsensical as you cant look behind you
no onscreen maps or info either
or ammo counts for that mattereverything is so big on the screen compare the feeling of space that you have around you in gta with this
in gta traffic and baddies can be seen approaching whereas in this they appear right on youagain the leanagainstawalltogainenergy system
even the non playable characters comment that youre standing around like an idiot
sorry love cant help itglitchy graphics
a friend of mine encountered a horde of giants in hyde park who shrunk to midgets once neared
is perspective reversal common in the uknegotiating stairwells cause ammond to perform a very camp jig
cant the man just bound up them with dignityand so on and so oni will list the reasons why this game doesnt add up
first and foremost controlling the character hammond is almost impossible
he runs slower than my grandmother and as he loses health he runs even slower
he cannot run up or down stairs he tends to prance up them not kidding
the characters use the f word in every cutscene which is just stupid
when your player gets in a car he cannot drive more than  mph for some reason regardless of the type of automobile
you cannot shoot weapons out of cars while you drive yet other gang members can shoot at you from their cars
in outofvehicle gun battles on foot auto aim is sluggish and often unreliable
when you get shot you have to limp to a wall and lean there for  seconds to regain health which gets annoying when gang members are shooting at you
controls are horrible and the weapons selection is very limited shotguns mps and aks are the most powerful weaponson the positive side  the getaway has incredible graphics and takes place in a virtual london downtown area that is almost a replica of the british city
real brand names exist you can see popular fastfood places and clothing stores which adds a lot of realism
all the major london landmarks are in the game buckingham palace trefalgar square big benparliament tower of londonmuseum london eye etc the traffic ai is very impressive and there are many more cars on the streets than in the popular gta gamessummary graphics and cityscape are very realistic but the sluggish play control makes the game very annoyinggame developers are constantly trying to make games more and more realistic
now we have action games that are more like watching movies  cheesy bmovies  but theyre just not fun and they slow the pace of the games to a crawlthis insatiable quest for realism is even bleeding over into simple games like wheel of fortune where your game is interrupted every other second by computer contestants spouting stupid platitudes or by vanna white appearing to grin at you and show off her necklace which looks like a belt buckle on a chainand what the heck is vanna white doing hosting the show
where is pat sajak
vanna sounds like shes reading from a book titled things pat sajak might say and her inflection gives us a clue as to why her acting career didnt take offthe game play is tried and true but it does seem like you spin more bankrupts and loseaturns than the computer players do
i was also infuriated by the way the computer players constantly buy vowels as soon as they have the money  just like the real showthankfully you can play with one or two players and no computer contestants a very smart move from atarithe graphics are fine nothing too flashy
i like how the camera is constantly zooming in and pulling back on the wheel or the board
the sound is adequate and as previously noted annoyingsome of the other options included are useless
i tried to take the contestant exam and after a second load time i was presented with a puzzle
i solved it and was told i had gotten  of  correct then i had to wait through another second load time before puzzle no
 came up
intolerablei also noticed no differences between the quick play and the normal game except the fact that my name was player  instead of dennis
overall if youre a wheel fan youll like this version
believe it or not i had a version of this game in the s on a floppy disc that played better than this one  but as ive said before simpler most of the time is betterfirst off i appluad infro games for making  great career mode
i love the different options  stats
it keeps you in the game
you really want to get that top spot
your name in the paper is nice toothe downfall is the gameplay
it severly lacks
the cars have no sense of speed which translates into a boring game
going  isnt fast for a race game
how can a group so focuced on realism not add more speed is beyond me
the sounds stink  the crowds cheering sounds muffled
the worst part besides the lack of speed are the graphics
they look like a ps game
that wouldnt be so bad if the game play was tight
i agree with another reviwer about the analog controls being slow  sluggish
buy this game used if at all
its not worth the money by a long shotfor me this game has aged badly
stuff that might have been ok  years ago was just frustrating to play today
clumsy controls few checkpoints little ammo time consuming to switch weapons or use a med kit in a hairy situation
i played the majority of the game before i just got tired of starting levels over and over
maybe more modern games have ruined me for this kind of challengepros  good fight animationsreally captures indys wild drunken fighting style
i also loved how indys hat would fall off after  he would get punched many times
good choice of weaponsa nice touch is the ability to use weapons dropped from your enemies
musicjohn williams classic score is integrated well during key points of actioncons  mediocre graphicsthe textures are muddy
so much so that i had to increase the sharpness level of my tv just to make sure it wasnt causing the problem
again xbox owners get leftovers from a ps ported game
horrid frame ratethe game stutters all over the place when there are more than two enemies on the screen at once
horrid collision detectionindy and enemies will magically teleport through walls and floors
blocky player movementdespite the good fighting animations indys movements tend to skip a few frames
uninspired cut scenes using ingame graphicsthe cut scenes would have been negligible had the graphics engine been more than decent
whatever happened to cgi moviequality cut scenes
rigid voice actingthe actor playing indy sounds exactly like harrison fords tired drawl
however he also sounds like hes reading the script rather than acting it out
the same goes for the other voice actors
repetitious level designtheres too much emphasis on jumping from ledge to ledge and swimming
bugs bugs bugs i hate bugsthe game tends to freeze every once in awhile which is inexcusable
lucasarts quality assurance department should be fired
 out of weve had enough of these kind of games already
buy def jam vendetta insteadi m sorry but this game was one of the worst games i have ever played
you just start the game by going through levels using the powers but your not as aggressive like in kirbys super star now that was a game
every time you get hit you lose your power
it is mad annoying
the story of the game isnt explained until you beat it which doesnt take long at all if your good at adventure games
this was a poor excuse for a kirby game
there was no story and kirbys powers werent the same and cool as kirbys super star
so i dont reccomend this game i had to find out the hard way how bad it isi knew this game wasnt worth table scraps and i was right
the game is way too shortthe bosses are too easy and the ability to have combination copies is nowhere to be found
the only credit i could give this game is the nice graphics
evrything in it doesnt even come close  kirby crystal shards
id recommend kirby nid for kids  and underbut perfect for the inexperienced gamer or a little brother or sister
there are puzzles and bosses that are super easy
i rented it but i wouldnt buy it
rent it and see for yourselfnot too challengingi do not like this game because its hard depressing and not fun
as wario you look for lost treasure beat bad guys so on
bosses super hard this game is frustratingwatio world is effectively a throwback to the bit era of d side scrolling platfomers
unfortunately it is not a patch on any of them
the emphasis is on tedious button bashing
instead of quickly dispatching your enemies as sonic might do with a quick bounce on the head glandchallenged wario has to knock seven bells out of them first which makes the pace slow
with the much better viewtiful joe out on the shelves wario world is the worse platform beatemup by far
strangely its fans seem to really like it
i can only think that they havent played streets of rage or indeed any d platformer of the megadrivesnes erathis game was really fun at first
barcelona is fun like the city of amn in baulders gatebut thats all that there is to this gamethe people that join you just follow you around
you cant interact with them or control and develope them like ice wind dale or baulders gate
if you want a hack and slash get dungeon seigeif you want a real rpg with a plot get bgiithis game is pretty annoying in many waysthe combat is simply clicking on people and watching them unil they diethe magic system is poorly thought out and playing as a mage is very tedious because the simplest spell costs too much mana yet spending massive spellpoints barely increases their power
heal heals  points of damage at level one and  at level 
npc tagalongs are useless in combat because they are destroyed with amazing ease by enemies and there is no way to bring them back and worse than useless since they like to run around and lure lots of monsters to youonce you get out of barcelona there is really no questing just more hacking and slashing
even this might be ok if it was more involving you just watch you guy hack them to pieces and occasionally run away
the spells are pretty useless in combat and hard to select anyhow so you do not end up using them muchthere is no marking of exitsentrances etc
even after you have been through them so that walking around is very tedious and annoying at higher levels especially since in the first half of the game you will be going to the same places in the sewers over and over
finding all the entraces to the various levels takes careful attention to detail tooanyhow i think this is the last black isle game i will buy maybe i will get baldurs gate iii if such a thing is ever made or fallout  but only from the ten dollar clearance rackdull dull dull  this game is really not up to the standard we have come to expect from black isle and interplay
primary headaches  inability to pause and target enemies during combat
makes archers and magic users just about useless boring quests  the kind we expected in the early days of roleplaying
games is not the most stable i have seen either
all in all you are better off going back and paying an earlier black isle gamei bought this game and was hoping for a fun rpg experience
i thoroughly enjoy almost every rpg type game i play and i was really excited about this one
my fiance and i both bought copies so we could play the multiplayer version as well
we instantly had problems installing and loading the game we each had to uninstall and reinstall it once in order for it to work
we have highend systems since we both work in the computer game industrywe finally got them both working and we started playing
the character generation is pretty fun  i give them points for that
its complex and interesting i enjoyed making my character
so then we do this getting out of jail quest and get a spirit and that all is interesting too
finally we get unleashed in to the game and thats where it all goes downhillfirst thing is youre in this gigantic town and you basically have to talk to everyone
i enjoy this part of rpgs but in moderation
we spent about  minutes talking to different npcs then decided to go find something to kill
we immediately got our butts kicked by some critter i cant remember what
my fiance quit at that point and i decided to go back to the town and talk to more npcs
i get one to give me a quest  go find this guy and talk to him yippee
so i go find the guy he immediately calls over a bunch of thugs they kill me game overat that point i quit because playing a game is supposed to be fun not frustrating
i dont recommend this game i think its a waste of money
there are so many good games out there
try dungeon siege for a much more fun rpg or even the dampd games like temple of elemental evil and pool of radiance
also morrowind is much better than lionheart
any of those would be a better choiceim at a lull in between playing the newer releases and decided to pick up lionheart on a whim
even at a fraction of the original cost i found this game virtually unplayable
while the premise is original i found the subject matter distasteful too much focus on the inquisition and the graphics tiny outdated and the character avatars really really uglythe game had an unfinished quality and i found the combat at the beginning way too hard
entering into dungeons my character was immediately mauled and killed
there is almost no tutorial and no learning curve for new players and hardly any place to get money or weaponsalso i chose and built a female character i was surprised to discover that her voiceset sounded very male
errill have to give this game  stars
the game had promise but needed about another year of development
black isle has produced betterwhen i first read about this game i thought it would be one that i could enjoy
i am an rpg addict
this game however was not the rpg it promises to be
very boring mini map has no waypoints to help you along and some of the quests appear to be broken
this game no longer spins in my disc trayi thought the game would be sortamaybeokay decent in game play
i really just wanted to play a bmx game and goof off a little
plus i was curious about the xxx
hahajust avoid this game all together
the game mechanics are terrible the missions are very hard because they dont navigate where youll need to be and its a lot of work to unlock the videos
the missions dont make any sense or have any logical order for a story
its easier just to type in the cheat codes to unlock the videos
the videos arent even worth the hassle at all anywaysi mean it is possible doing tricks and riding around within the game but its very limited
there are areas where you cant even access because the game just doesnt allow it itll respawn you away from that area which is stupid
whats the point of restricting an open area of the game mapplus the voice overs are highly repetitive and annoying
you do have a soundtrack which is nice and the songs are pretty good tooeh im returning this game tomorrow
there are much better bmx games out there and for xxx rated content just search for it on the internet
its  for dang sake
hahathis game really is dumb it has funny moments and you cant go wrong with strippers
but its a game more for voyerism than actual playabilityunfortunately i can not share the enthusiasm of my fellow reviewersthe game has a lot of good sides
the graphics are beautiful
asides from the character interaction with the plants brushing up to plants or pushing them out of the way this game features some of the best plant jungle and mountain settings ive ever seen in a game
mission design is also ok although not greatthis game has one big problem though gameplay
i do not consider myself the worlds best fps player but i also aint the worst
normally i play fps games on the hardest possible setting
this one i played on quothardquot which is the second hardest setting
and still i was so frustrated by this game that i decided not to finish it half way through which is a first for mei mean dont get me wrong i like that there finally is an fps game where it is not unrealistically easy for the player to kill the enemy and where the enemy doesnt have an unrealistically hard time to kill the player
but in this game things are outrageous
it is almost impossible to kill with one shot while the enemy seems to be able to do that all the timeto give you an idea of what i am talking about i am in a scene where i need to enter a tunnel
i have a machine gun and i already know that there are several vietcong just beyond the tunnel entrance
so i beging to lay down fire and empty the whole magazine on the  of them
and guess what at least  of them survive entirely unharmed every time
and not just that
but they turn against me run towards me while i am still firing pull up their guns to aim i am still firing and kill me with a single shotafter a number of attempts i finally make it into the tunnel clear out everything that is in there and pick up a semistationary machine gun
since i have played through the scene several times already i know that more vcs will be waiting for me at the tunnel entrance
so i position myself close to the entrance and ready my stationary mg i hear them talking and come closer so i begin to fire
the  of them run into my fire
i hit them with all head and body shots
a whole amo belt worth of heavy fire
yet not a single one of them goes down
instead one of them raises his gun and kills me with a single shot
and i am even in a prone position and mostly taking cover around the bend of a tunnelgive me a break
vietnam certainly was tough but i refuse to believe that a vc walks away entirely unharmed after taking  or more bullets to the headoh and what makes things worse is the savegame system which only allows a small number of saves around  typically in each level
so you will play through the same stupid situations over and over againalso the team mates are just plain dumb
they are ok when it comes to fighting the vc but they move around like complete retards
in a game that features a lot of tunnelfighting it just isnt ok that your team mates block you from moving back or forth
this happened to me a number of times
all you can do is go back to the previous savegame
arghthanks but no thanks
this could have been one awesome game
technically it certainly is
but playbalancewise someone took a lot of shortcuts
a bit more testing and finetuning would have turned this into a  or  star game
i play a lot of fps games and gameplaywise this one comes in deadlastthe game arrived well into the time window promised but in better than expected condition
it looks barely used
and i might know why
first a quick bio
im  years old
ive been gaming since pong came out
so i know a little about video gamesdead to rights is lamethe graphics are ok nothing to get excited about
the pss abilities arent even slightly pushedaudio is decent
perhaps the best feature of this titlestory is weaker than a lifetime movie of the weekcontrols are somewhat clunky feeling and not intuitive
it took a while to learn the basics
even then the pov can be more damaging to your progress than the enemies you are easily dispatchingreplay value
nonesometimes i wonder about video game reviews
this is definitely one of those times
maybe its just me but this game was horrible
people say it was fun it was cool and it looked great
and it might have been all those thingsbut it wasnt enjoyable
in fact it was hardly understandable
there was very little story to the actual game and when it does rear its ugly head its only strength is the graphics
the story is presented in such a way that every scene seems to be intentionally ambiguous to the point where you begin to wonder if theres a large section of the game you may have missed where they actually explain the story rather than present more questions
no explanations are given for anything short of theres a princess that needs saving and youre stuck with the job
the voice acting is just horrible and the game play isnt even all that funmuch like the popular onimusha series this game features customizable weapons the diskarmors each with different magical abilities and elemental alignments
theres even an optional dungeon nearly identical to onimushas dark realm but id discovered it by accident and found no reason to actually go through it
i beat the game within four days with no difficulty and even after beating it i still didnt understand what was going onif youre that drawn in to playing the game look it up on youtube or borrow it from a friend if you can first
dont be fooled by reviewsthis game is hardly worth the  i paid for itrygar the legendary adventure is a very fun game with beautiful graphics and a vast variety of attacks but unfortunately those are the only real positives
first of all the game is just way too short
it can take under four hours to beat it
because of that some of the adventure elements dont really fit in
you have to play the game four times in order to get all the mystic stones which isnt really worth it considering that more than half of them are useless and that it really isnt as fun to play the game four times as the designers hoped it would have been despite the different difficulty levels in each replay
among other problems with rygar one is that the story and voices are just awful
of course not every game takes itself seriously when it comes to story but the atrocities in this one are just too much
whats also lame is that from the middle of the game on most of the environments look more or less the same
youre always around some red or brown hot mountain lava field or something else reddish or brownish
the final area was also way too short and pathetic and aside from the bosses there are only a few kinds of enemies most which are smaller than you arenumerous things could have increased the value of this game
first they just should have made it a lot longer preferably at least within the  hour range keeping the difficulty around the games hard level
this would have allowed for a greater variety of environments and enemies and it would have left room for all the mystic stones to be in
many of the mystic stones also should have done cooler things than what they did
there actually is an interesting back story to the game if you read some of the texts you pick up but the current story is executed just too poorly to accept even for a game you know wont take itself seriously
the presentation could have used vast improvement
in short rygar the legendary adventure is a disappointment because it had stunning potential that just didnt have its best brought out
lack of ambition most likely held it back
the negatives outweigh the positives enough for me to only be able to recommend it as a rental
hopefully the tentative sequel if made will be betteri got dead to rights hoping for some great shootemup action
and while i got that in bucketloads its only rarely engaging
the story plays out like film noir and has a hardened cop called jack slate who really belongs in an s action movie investigate his dads murder only to end up being framed for various crimes and in the middle of huge conspiracyand so the game has you blast and fight your way through prisons mines airforce bases dockyards factories cliffsides nightclubs construction yards hotels and out of control airplanes all while accompanied by your faithful dog shadow the games best feature
it feels like a cross betweendie hard vendettaandresident evil as you seem to do nothing but shoot generic bad guys from start to finish
it becomes incredibly boring and is only slightly redeemed by a few intense shootouts
there is the occasional fisticuffs but the mleacutee system is poor to nonexistent and there is no skill involved in defeating your opponent outside of button mashingplus the graphics are rotten
the cutscenes look right out of a mids cdrom and the gameplay graphics may look adequate but have a very jerky habit and the camera system will drive you crazy
and the voice acting is quite bad too with the exception of a few lively characters
the guy who plays jack slate sounds as bored as a living human can possibly bei cant rate this game particularly high
find it somewhere cheap if you must otherwise its not the best shootemup out there and i suggest you invest your time and money in something else
the series tookoff however and was followed bydead to rights ii sadly not available on the gamecubedead to rights anddead to rights retributionno idea what the title actually meansgraphics csound bgameplay blasting appeal cits supposed to be really hard
if youre up for the challenge then try it but if not then forget itthis game is one of the reasons why i dont even own a ps anymore so jus hear me out for a minute
when the first came out i bought a copy and i was lucky to find out that the first game had alot to do and the physics of the fighting moves you unleash on enemies was fantastiv but this game was a total blaargh
first off the graphics look worse than the first
it has only been proved with ps that they have some out of date game engines that they recycle for ps games
thus making the game just look like a horrible demo
i dont like this game in my opinion just concentrate on the firstthis game is awsomedevil may cry  was very goodand number  is even betterits just the right amount of difficultyand loads very fastu can even buy tecneques
i would of gave this game even more stars if i could but it only let me put this is the best game everthe gothic thriller taken to new hype
and in that last sentence there is one word that does not belong gothic
dmc  is essentially shinobi redux
there is no story no mystery and little more than pressing the buttons to acheive movesprosi strain to find any
but disc lucias quest is a little better than dantes
still has all the cons though she reminds me of bloodraynecons lack of a storyline of any kind
the camera angles are so bad that most of the time you are lost or dont know what you are fighting
dantes modeling is from a far distance and the combat is rhetorical at best
it mimics shinobi in most aspects
theres the empty city deranged tanks and even copies of those hated dogs from stage a
the swordplay was taken directly from onimusha  onimusha  its that obvious
but in this gamethe sword will get you killed
its all guns no glory
dante is slow
he runs through the city in a crawllike way and it takes forever to get from one place to another
the beginning takes a lot from tomb raider and is quite pointless
you dont know where you are in this game and theres nothing to find
it takes forever to powerup and theres not enough enemies in a single mission to get you the orbs to powerup
the attack method is not similar to the original and the matrix stunts wont get you the high demon rank
graphics
twice the graphics huh
the graphics cant hold a candle to onimusha  in gameplay
the cutscenes arent anywhere near onimusha  or and there is a scene where dante slides down a pipe  similar to final fantasy x though far less impressive
the main gameplay is reminiscent of bloodraynethoughnot in its leagueok i gave you  reasons for the my point
capcom has been in a frenzy to produce so much this past year and ahead with resident evil zero re  remake and re  the company has given us high quality games such as the onimusha series the original devil may cry and others
this leads me to believe that this dmc was overhyped and underdevelopedthis wasnt intended as a bash review and i didnt want to write it in that way honestly
i looked forward to this game for so long
my suggestion is that you rent this one first see if you like it and during that week rentalsurely you can pick up the game if you are into it
im sorry fellow gamers but the hype doesnt fit the game
this is not devil may cryits a confusing mess
it is not gothic not dark and holds no bearing to the namesakeill probably get a lot of unhelpful votes from the hardcore but im in the top  reviewers feel free to check my rank and i wont steer you wrongrobert eldridge first of all it keeps repeating itself and it never stops
you keep killing the same creatures over and over again
this is a boring game their is really no point in making this game
dante bairly says a word for the full  hours
that right folks this game is  hours long
most of the best gamers in the world will beat it in  hours
the story is terrible and i am not looking forward to the third installment if there is going to be onenot even close to the original devil may cry this one really lacks story
after you beat the game which took me  days not even playing it alot during that time youll be thinking thats it
the camera angels pretty much suck that seems to be one of the main problems with all of the dmc games though
i shouldve waited till this dropped to  but i liked the first one so much i figured it would be worth the  but it wasnt
this is definately a prime example of a game not worth the hypewhen the first devil may cry was released the public was blown away
dante was cool in everyway he had bad ass moves even more bad ass weapons and just new how to give the baddies a hard time
devil may cry  was looking to be the breakaway hit that surpassed the first in everyway
however it almost falls short in evry single aspect form the forst gamethere only two points that have improved in devil may cry  the  first being the controls of the game they still say much the same very fluid and easy to adapt to
i also found it a nice change to have a second playable character
the problem with this character is that her moves are almost exactly the same as dantes she just moves a bit fasteras for the storylinewell there really is no storyline
the first devil may cry was great because not only did you get to obliterate hoards and hoards of baddies but it was all packed to gether with an excellent storyline
once you finish this game you feel like you actually know less about who dante actually is because the storyline is extremely confusinganother adition which could have come off as either a good or bad thing is that the level size is much bigger
unfortunately in this game it is a very bad thing since you spend most of your time brainless tapping the button that fires your guns
as a matter of fact when you get to the flying bat on the roof top the only way to hit it is to continously mash the fire button and since the game has auto aim there is no strategy
the whole point of having both a sword and guns is so that you can use them both and in this game you will find yourself using your guns much more than your sword
this also makes leveling up your sword with red souls pointless since most of the time your not using itim not saying this game is completely empty of any entertainment there are shining moments when you find yourself creating huge combos and yes you still feel like a bad ass sometimes
if your looking at this game because the first blew you away you may just want to rent it because the game is extremely easy and you will probably beat it within five hours of picking it up
if you havent played the first one and your thinking of buying the second
dont
buy the first one rent the second believe me its not worth your money to buydevil may cry was a classic with great gameplay and had lots of stylethisdoesnt
i will make this a short reviewthe game had good visuals like the original but was lacking on good story and was waaaaaaay too short and too easy
devil may cry was easy to learn and was a bit of a challenge but this was just complete bulltoo easy and waaaaay too short
this is nothing like devil may cry overall i have to give this out of  starsgame is lacking in a lot of places and is just painfully bad
no were near the original devil may crythis game has lots and lots of flawsjust wait for devil may cry  comes out cause hopefully it will be waaaaay better then this at one point in devil may cry  dante tells another character devils never cry however if dante laid the money down to buy this game the coolest character ever made said playstation magazine might actually cry
the saddest part about this game is that capcom took a sure winner with amazing potential and took a huge step backwards with this sequel
to fully see why this game is literally soso you have to look at the positives and negativesthe bad beyond the horredous story never truly fleshed out when it is and why dante showed up the biggest fault with this game is that it is extremely short and way too easy
i sat down at  in the morning on a day off and by  pm with a few breaks i had finished every nook and cranny of the game including the lame diesel costume changes
perhaps diesel gave capcom money to help finish the game
thats about  hours of playing without cheats to find everythingon two discswith the gameplay dumbed down and with a story of almost porn quality you would think other aspects of the game would make you happy
unfortuantely youd be wrong
to begin with theres the blasted camera
many a time i cursed dante as i could not see the action since the camera would not move
capcom please make the camera moveable with the right analog stick
in one level i got stuck behind a pillar of light and could not see where the enemies were or what i was attacking
ughthe enemies not much variety here and you know theres something wrong when they bring back baddies from the first game that was annoyingthe graphics they are exactly the same as the first
barely a step up
thats weak
also the music is monotonous
except for the power up screen the musis stays the same for the whole gameagain i have to emphasize the script and the voice acting are very badand somewhat rehashed from the first gamewhere are the awesome weapons from the first game
i loved upgrading the gloves and cool sword
in this one you can upgrade but it doesnt really do muchis there some good yes but not much
this game is great for blowing off steam since all you do is blast baddies the whole game
while there is alot to be annoyed at throughout the game it can be fun especially trying to build up to s level combos the only place i found something challenging was trying to get the combossome of the bosses are well designed
not necessarily difficult just pretty to look at until the level endsi was a huge fan of the first dmc and i thought this one would be great but i have been very disapointed by this game and capcom should be ashamed for putting out what feels like an extremely rushed game that takes a great character and premise and sullies it
poor dante is probably sobbing somewherebottom line you can rent it if you dare but do not buy this gamelets be honest
judging by the trailers and magazine ads the sequel to the playstation  smash hit devil may cry it looked very cool
and it was the day i got it and the strategy guide
wall flipping and multidirectional shooting was very fun and easy to pull off
unfortunately it wore off soon enough and after a few months and beating the superior first one on both difficulties  i realized how shallow and disappointing dmc was
ignoring the confusing and laughable storyline even the gameplay is watered down
the game plays likes it on the easy automatic difficulty of the first
and dont be fooled by the other difficulties
the only real challenge lies in the dante must die or lucia must die and even so its nowhere near as challenging as the first
you get  different swords but your first one serves a better purpose than the other  despite what the guide says
and they lack any kind of personality and level of coolness like ifrit or alastor
guns consist of your trademark pistols shotgun submachine guns which is in my opinion the worst set of weapons to have on here  and a rocket launcher
now due to the open levels which are pretty dull most of them youll practically be using your guns a majority of the time instead of the swords and that sucks
the nd disc is the other characters story lucia who is almost like dante but a little better a little worse in some aspects
she doesnt have any guns save for the bowgun
she carries swords sticky bombs and throwing daggers
the best thing about her is you actually have to use her melee combat moves over her projectile weapons unlike dante which is the opposite
like i said earlier wall running and jumping is cool but it serves no purpose whatsoever
it just there for decoration
voiceacting is even worse than the first with dante spewing out the most generic oneliners ive ever heard
now for all the horrible things ive said about this bland sequel there are a few redeeming qualites
one is the graphics are quite good and the cg is great
there is a ton to unlock like secret characters and an endless dungeon
and both lucia and dante arent all that bad to play as
hopefully theyll get it right in devil may cry  dantes awakening which looks infinitely better that this and reclaim the fun and cool factor of the first
i give a terrible  out of  tis a sad day indeed
this is sean david signing offuntil thensemper fi carry onif you loved the first dmc then stay clear of this stinking attempt to gobble up your money on the success of the first
the balance of weapons is off the difficulty is a joke and there is no real reason to want to play further than an hour into it
no attention to detail basically it falls flat on its facedevil may cry was hailed as one the best action games of all time when it was released
it combined detailed d graphics with the frantic action of d platformers and topped it all off with a sinister gothic theme
unfortunately devil may cry  is only a shadow of those things
the gameplay remains very similar to the first gamebut the story enemy design dialogue and weapons all seem slapped together without much thought
the main character is still dante but he is also accompanied by a female playable character named lucia whatever happened to trish
the areas are now much more wide openwhich is fitting for a urban setting but most enemies just let you pummel them to death from afar
it lacks the sense of urgency and danger that was present throughout the first game
everything just has a rushed and unbalanced feel to it
its a shame capcom let this happen to a series that showed so much promise
if you are looking for a good d action game i suggest rygar or shinobi instead or the first devil may cry if you dont already own itdie hard vendetta seems like a cool idea at first a game based on the die hard movies as a first person shooter with an entirely new storyline
however it ends up as a disappointment to anyone who has ever played superior firstperson shooter games like timesplitters  or any of the james bond games
the graphics of this game are the worst i have seen on the gamecube
gameplay graphics are ok but the cutscene graphics are absolutely terrible
why even bother with the cutscenes
the storyline is ridiculous but that wouldnt bother me if the game offered more in the gameplay department
controls can be very frustrating falling from what seems like very short distances can take away more life than you expect
but even with these frustrating controls the game turns out to be very very easy
you could beat it in a day if you want
however there are some cool things
talking to individuals you come across can be very entertaining and helpful
some of the objectives you pick up on your missions are actually pretty fun
the autoaim is not as annoying as it can be in other firstperson shooter games
in short id advise you to rent this game first
it is certainly not the best or most entertaining shooter on the market
the language in the game is very strong as if they added many excuses to drop the fbomb just because they could
if youre a diehard fan of the die hard series then you might want to check it out
if not you probably shouldnt botherthis review is not intended to thoroughly downplay the qualities of this game
the graphics are stunning  unlike anything ive ever seen before
the music is great especially the opening sequence which would have worked magnificently on the silver screen
i wont go into story details you can get that easily enough
but fellow tronfans this game just isnt worth it
the gameplay is fun only to a degree
its addictive certainly but only in so much as you keep on wanting to see that payoff cut scene which sometimes come and most of the time do not or that grandiose image or situation that has a big connection to the hit film  which lets face it is the whole reason why were playing this game in the first placealso there is no payoff at the end
i watched the ending animation clip and thought thats it
thats all youre going to give me for all this trouble
for make no mistake about it this game is a lot of trouble
i played it on easy there are also medium difficult and insane levels and it was tough
after awhile i felt like i was just being challenged for no reason and my character was wandering around
it was like reading an page book that could have been condensed to  pagesi think most people who bought or will buy this game are doing so mainly because of the unique opportunity to explore the tron universe
the gameplay is just an added bonus
unfortunately with this game the universe youre exploring occasionally looks like the film you saw as a kid but overall its been revved up with extra icing and eyecandy and less actual substancei think the game could have been a lot better if it had looked much more like the movie
or perhaps if there had been gameplay scenarios like the movie
yes there are a few
for instance your primary weapon is the memory disc that frisbeelooking thing and there are lightcycles galore
these things earn this game two stars from me instead of one
perhaps we just werent ready to jump immediately into the st century
maybe they could have divided the storyline into segments one key chapter of the game taking place in the s perhaps right after the film takes place one in the s and a climactic finale present daythose are my two cents worth
and i hope for the sake of a possible sequel that they echo many of the desires of other fans as wellbeing a huge fan of twisted metal black i could not wait to purchase and play war of the monsters both games are made by incog
i was ready for another highly creative and fun game that i could not put down
boy was i disappointed
the controls are frustrating the camera angles are extremely frustrating and confusing
two buttons are used for attacking and your monster has the ability to grab various objects and use them either to throw or club an opponent which is at first interesting but soon becomes boring
i was hoping that the game would somehow incorporate the tmbs scrolling of various weapons do i want to blast the enemy with zoomy or use environmental to zap him with a blimp
but i found the attacks and fighting aspect of the game to be boring and routine
even the monsters super attacks are uncreative and bland where is the creative attacks like sweettooths special attack
the environments are cool but not as large interesting or moody as tmb
the gameplay quickly becomes monotonous and routine
the bottom line is that it contains none of the fun elements that incogs previous game twisted metal black had and i found myself bored with it after a day and a half of playingincog was in production of this game and true this game does have some good graphics
true the game includes several different monsters with different abilities
however many faults lie in this game
the singleplayer is dull and tedious where the computer ai is cheap and very cheap
true this cheapness may work in twisted metal black in singleplayer but then again you have shields that surround the car as you escape whereas in this you dont
you can get stabbed in the back quite frequently with an antenna
in terms of multiplayer its okay but then again twisted metal black is far better
overall this game is a weekend rental at best
incog please stick with twisted metal for the sake of your fansnot much to say about this game
i disliked it
boring nearly all the time and not quite original
soundtrack is just as badi liked the first red faction alright
it had a lot of things going for it while the story may not have been the most original the way the story unfolded was fun to watch and participate in
the geomod technology was fine and it provided several options in most areas as far as how to get to the next room
the multiplayer was a blast and all the mods people were coming up with were fun to mess around withit wasnt the best game in the world but it was better than most and it had heartbut this this game is an insult
the story is nonexistant the ai
is terrible the weapons are unnecessary its not too difficult to kill anything with any gun and it is one of the most linear games that ive played in a while
everything that happens in this game happens because its the only way it can happen
there is no room for skill strategy or fun in this game
its truly nothing more than a mindless bullets and blood shooter
thats fine and dandy but the way the developers have tried to pawn this off as something else is ludicrous
first off there is far less use of the geomod system in this game not more as the prerelease reviews stated
and what little use of it there is is completely pointless because there arent very many hidden areas or alternate routes that can be found by geomodding through the walls like there were in the first gamesecondly the box hints in rather dodgy language that there are multiplayer type games to be found here
but there are none
sure you can play deathmatch and capture the flag with rf but not online you can only play it with a bunch of poorly made ai
bots
what a gyp
why bother including a multiplayer part of the game if you cant play against other people
ridiculousif youre wanting nothing more out of a game than pointless blood and gore with a plethora of huge honkin guns to kill enemies that move with the intelligence of the old contra enemies and fake multiplayer against bots that either run around like idiots or camp like boy scouts then this game delivers in spadesif however your taste in games is a little more shall we say refined then wait please wait there are a few titles coming out this year that seem promising most notably deus ex invisible war the sequel to the most intelligent action game ever madeheck anything would be more thought provoking and challenging than red faction   its not worth the plastic its pressed onbetter than unreal
maybe
as good as a current fps title
no way
the game is too short and blowing holes in walls gets real boring after a while
this game looks good however and the parts where you get to pilot tanks and hovercraft is pretty cool but the first game had a better longer storyno big deal
i deleted the game half way thru just got really boring without quick save option
having to replay loooong segments time after time killed the fun
graphics seemed a couple steps back from the first red faction whats with that
i have been enjoying older games for the nostalgic experience but ill move on to rf guerrilla and see if its a bit more evolved
seems quick save is becoming a rare option in newer games
whats with that
cannot recommend this game even at im split on how to rate this game
the strategic aspect of the game is great
i enjoy sneaker games and thief is supposed to be the gold standard
but i could not play this game
i installed it and ran it and then after the first mission i gave up
the graphics are too datedwhat did it for me were the trees that were low polygon oblate spheroids
after farcry thiefs graphics just dont do it for meif you like classic games thief should be good but the dated graphics were a deal breaker for me
if only someone could graft a current game engine onto the game and update the textures and modelscapcom had a good thing going with the bof franchise
i never played the first  but iii and iv were great games
this last installment all but killed it
first and foremost the best thing about breath of fire any of them was the main characters ability to transform into a dragon
its what set the bof games apart from the rest
is it present in dragon quarter 
well yes and no
its there but you definately wont be using it
theres a gauge everytime you use the form it drains the gauge
theres one big problem
the gauge cannot be refilled
nothing  and yes i do mean nothing will refill it
when it drains completely you die
when you think about that along with the fact that the last boss can only be defeated in dragon form   well what we have here is a bof game without dragon transformations
theres a ton of other things i hated such as the gameplay game flow story etc
but the dragon thing ticked me off the mostthe bof series has always been gooduntil it hit the psthis game is flat out horrible
the battle system is not only difficult to get used to but when you finally do get used to it its not fun
the storyline is complex to the point where its confusing and just too much work to try to keep up with
the dialog being boring doesnt help muchso avoid this like the black deathpros  interesting battle system interesting storycons save coins save coins save coinsyou know i was enjoying this game
its not the greatest game ever made but it has an interesting battle system and a goal to look forward to
but there is a terrible flaw in order to save the game you must use a save coin
these save coins are not buyable items  you randomly stumble upon them through the game and they are scarce
how scarce
i played through five hours of the game defeating five of the main bosses near the very end and then died against the next boss
i was unable to save any of this progress because i did not find one single save coin during this time
i think i should repeat that
i was not allowed to save the game through five boss fights and five hours of gameplay
i dont know what kind of clown thought this was a good idea but they should not be allowed to work on video games anymore
i dont have five hours to piss away just to lose it all because of absurdly poor game designmy point is dont play this game unless you think you can play an entire game without dying once because you cannot count on being able to save your game
total bsresident evil  is easily one of the most fun and enjoyable games that has come out in the past decade
it scares you enough to keep you on the edge of your seat but the difficulty level is set exactly right so it doesnt get you frustrated
not to mention that both of the playable characters have two missions and once you complete those there are several different gameplay modes rewarded to the player for completing the missions
this enhances the games replay value quite dramaticallyso assuming that you have played this game on the original playstation i bet youre wondering what is different about the port offered on the gamecubewell disappointingly enough not much
the re port is just that  a port
naturally however the gamecube is a much more advanced system capable of handling much faster polygonal rates shading texture and load times
the overall look is a bit smoother but not enough to make you say wow
more like hmmminteresting
the blood is not so polygonal and the characters are a bit smoother
if there really is any difference in the load time it is minimal
the controls are about as good as the original  pending that you can get used to the game on a gamecube controller
the cmvs are not changed at all
nothing smoother nothing overdubbed nothing brighter or duller not faster or slower
this can either be a curse or a blessing for you depending on how devoted you are to the original cmvs as the cmvs are identical to the playstations in every wayso while i cant really justify owning a copy of resident evil  for the gamecube i would recommend it to anybody who has never played the game or does not have access to the ps version of it
resident evil  is a great game and it continues to hold its value even to this day
if capcom would have just done the same thing for re and re that they did for the original i think we would have probably the best series in history on our hands
however capcom got lazy and decided to port the rest of the titles
too bad so sadso to sum it up if you currently own resident evil  for the playstation save your money because the gamecube version is really not all that much betteroriginal game rating and contents  lazy gamecube port rating  final score on the rerelease for the gamecube  the concept had seemed interesting ever since the first dynasty warriors game hit the shelves but it wasnt until now that i tried actually playing this gameas with all other oneagainstmany fighting games  like final fight or the granddaddy of them all double dragon  the computer basically keeps trying to get at you from the back to disrupt your moves
thats fair game and to be expected
what i hadnt expected was that you would have a game camera that steadfastly refuses to look where you want it to
sixty per cent of the time im swinging at enemies behind me when i cant even see them because the camera idiotically stays in its own angle so that when youre battling a particularly powerful enemy he could all of a sudden land someplace you cant see and youd have to run around begging for the camera to go back to a rdperson perspective behind you so you know where youre going
also the degree pan when you execute a super move only serves to disorient your controls
maybe these camera problems serve to fulfill the game designers feeble fantasies of being filmmakers but in a game its just irritating
the fighting quotsystemquot is pathetic  lots of button mashing in all directions
most of your combos are useless because youre receiving attack from all sides so you end up using one combination over and over because anything else would be suicide
so i played through the entire quotshuquot story by doing one combo
yeah im passing levels but its monotonous as hellas the amazon editorial review noted theres also a lot of running around in this game
the programmers love designing level maps chock full of dead ends forcing you to run all the way around to get where you want
even on horseback it takes friggin forever
and then theres the games charming tendency to magically make three powerful enemy platoons appear right beside your commander whom youre supposed to protectif you happen to be launching an attack against the enemy base at that time and cant find a horse good luck
oh yeah and the enemy can do the ol quotblock you to deathquot
i had cao cao cornered with only  per cent of his health left and all he did was put his back to the mountain hold down block against all my eight bodyguards and myself and waited for five minutes straight until troops from his side appeared right beside my commander and took him out in a flash
this was  per cent through the level
call this funive been able to advance very well through this game but its really not a good gaming experience
and im willing to bet dynasty warriors  is just on the horizonwith the exact game mechanics
koei has made it a habit of releasing the same game over and over without making any real improvements on sequels so i seriously doubt i will ever play another dynasty warriors game againi love the gameplay but the graphics are even worse than dw
i cant go through that hardship anymore
xdthis is a pointless release
the vr missions arent even fun
theres not much to say about substance other than that itspointlessthe graphics arent bad or anything
this is actually like a mod and not a new game
youd rather be better off without this gameit has a few extras and minigames improved graphics and fixed bugs
overall its just the same game
dont buy it unless you got some green to burni loved mk and wanted to love this but sadly i was disappointedsorry fans but i must pass on tao fengits sad since so much work went into this titlehope the next one goes betteri loved silent hill  and silent hill  i didnt mind silent hill at all either but this one just seems like konami was trying to get male fans and give them something they want  an ugly chick in a miniskirt going around in a dark grousome atmosphere and find it sexy
i disliked this one for this reason
the gameplay i didnt enjoy either
so this one was out of me
i own the game and prefer the other  this one was the crappiest of the lot
dont bother with itwhat with all the excellent reviews of sh  floating about the web i decide dthat my previous star review clearly didnt take all aspects of the game into account
so i went and bought a walkthrough guide took three days and completed everythingand im sorry to say i now think less of heather and her ensemble cast of cliched characters than i did beforesh  is a game only to be played by fans of the series and even then only if those fans can get it cheap
it follows the story of heather a young girl thrown into a nightmare world of androgynous ambiguous creatures and hellish ocations in the search for who killed her father
of course there are plot twists but only those of us that have completed sh  will understand them fully  and even then theyre about as predictable as a wino with a  bill outside a liquor storethis game is all mouth and no trousers  or in game terms all graphics and no substance
i guess that criticisms against the ps  are fairly levelled then when people say sonys developers arent concentrating on originality anymoresh  on the ps  is a magnificent title and despite the nowpoor graphics still packs a creepy dramatic punch full of melancholia and tense atmosphere
silent hill  ps  is an opus going far deeper into the psychology of fear than many films and novels do and show exactly how affecting a survival horror game ought to be
it wasnt actionheavy but was all the more affecting because of thatsh  does none of the above
it takes some highlyaccomplished character models throws them into anonymous backgrounds that lack character and originality poorlydesigned and rehashes some of the bestloved levels from the prequels as i remember sh  had  hospitals listed on the map  why are we still stuck in the same one now
and really pointless characters
where are the endearing innocent cheryls and lisa garlands
the morose powerfully enigmatic angela oroscoes
the magnificently disturbing james and mariasmissing
and what were left with is heather consummately annoying douglas hopelessly underdeveloped as a character and claudia a cult member whose total lack of reason and sense of purpose is matched only by the weakness of the games explanation of her raison detrecontrols do nothing new survival horror in this incarnation will always be a slightly flawed system but does the job just fine
sound is good too with the voice acting being of a slightly higher standard than before
shame the script is so awful theni have played silent hill  repeatedly
i will not play silent hill  again
five times through this mess is enough for anybody
if youre into gorgeous graphics without any substance or atmosphere knock yourself out
if youre looking for something a little more mentally challenging get fatal frame  or wait for silent hill very poor indeedi was looking forward to playing this game because i greatly enjoy the tv show
but like someone before me mentioned it was too easy  i finished playing it in about  hours
there are too many hints and the clues are blatantly placed even if you arent into the game and you just want to win all you have to do is drag your mouse over various areas and wait for the mouse pointer to turn green collect the clues and then it all comes automaticaly together
spoon fedi do think however if it was too hard people would get frustrated with it
but for fans of forensic shows or even someone who has basic knowledge this game is a breeze
which is frustating in itself because you play the game anticipating it getting harder with each level and that just doesnt happenhopefully if they make another version of this game theyll take some time and think up more complex plots that require greater deduction in order to winthe road to rome is an expansion pack forbattlefield bf
it covers the italian campaign
it comes with  new maps and two new armies french and italians
these armies can only be used on certain maps
the expansion also has an assortment of new weapons and vehicles which again are only for use on certain maps
these includes for the americans m grant medium tank and m gmc tank destroyermobile artillery for the british the mosquito bomber and the pdr stationary at gun for the italians the m carro armato medium tank and for the germans the sturmgeschutz tank destroyerpak stationary at gun and the bf  fighterbomber
two infantry assault weapons include the british sten smg and the italian breda modello  the maps are fun and fairly well balanced
i would also note that even though this is very old title there is still an active multiplayer community
i was able to jump right into a multiplayer game with no lag
however there are very few servers that actually play the expansionsthe biggest question is really is it worth getting
if you already have bf i wouldnt bother unless you are a diehard fan
but if you are looking at getting  bf then getbattlefield  world war ii anthologywhich comes with this expansion andbattlefield  secret weapons of wwii expansion packor getbattlefield  the complete collectionwhich comes with both expansions andbattlefield vietnambuild through power build through peace and build through pure frustration
this game is so complicated that its a drag to play
first of all ill start by saying that the graphics look spectaculaire
secound of all it takes for ever to do any thing in the game
youll try to explore manage a growing empire and build a thriving colony over many many days of playing
youll constantly run into money problems and to this day i still cant figure out how to set traid routs
dureing this game you will rarely get attacked on land and your traid boats will conatantly get harrsed by pirates and your enemys
this game looked good on the rack in the store but when you start to play it youll relize that the game isnt that great
if you want a good stratigy game get strongholed or age of empiresi got this game as part of neverwinter gold
i have heard nothing bad about neverwinter and with a second expansion coming out i bought neverwinter gold since it was the same price as neverwinter
i finished neverwinter night last weekend
it was a great game
i love every part of it
it is the best representation of dampd in a computer game since the early daysbutshadow of undrentide is seriously lacking
first you start out being trained as an adventurer
my character was twenty second level by the time i start this add on so i would hardly say that a player of that level would be in that situation
it seemed like the creators wanted this to be a separate game using the same game engine but decided on an add on instead
this can be the only reason for the next flaw which is they dump the hench men from the original for a new set which are seriously lacking the depth of the original ones
i only raise this issue bc bioware brings back the original henchmen for the next add on hordes of the underdark
so why else would they make this change in the middleso in short this is a fair enough game if you buy the neverwinter gold edition but do not waste you money on buying it on its on
it is simply not worth the money
i gave it two stars since this add on has my favourite prestige class the blackguard
buy it from the bargain binthis expansion will give you a five new classes only two of which are worth playing the blackguard and the arcane archer are fun
the other classes are inferior to most othersb a handful of new monsters
the madusa and the basilisk were a good addition but i was hoping for a lot morec a handful of new spells most noteworthy are the bigbys giant hand spells
when will prismatic sphere be added
its the best spell for wizards and sorcorersd a few minor rule changes such as the removal of level requirements for the use of magic items this never should have been added into the game in the first place and is right out of diablo e a new campaign which is much better than the original campaign
if you like playing solo its fun but not as fun as playing onlinef the editor has been upgraded
secret doors and simular objects are much easier to add into your dungeonsit would be nice if these fixes and addons could be gotten in a free patch rather than a  gamethis game had a lot of potential
i was ravenous as i tore open the packaging only to find out that i had spent  on a subpar game
while at first the martial arts and gunplay was exciting and hooked me it quickly got repetitive and boring
how many times can u watch the same animations over and over before it gets dull
plus there are glitches aplenty
deleted games and hours spent stuck in walls are rampant
i give it a  because of the first few hours and because of the real cinematics incorporated into the gameeveryone has their own idea of tasteful and tackyrundown shabby lacking style dowdythe developers of this game took a great idea and made a few bucks off it
had they put a little more effort into the look and feel of the game and possibly the story they could have made a lot of bucks off itas it is it looks like a console port and plays like a console port
the graphics for all the hype are hardly cutting edge and the gameplay is buggyhalfway through the game instead of asking quotwhat is the matrixquot i was thinking quotwhy am i botheringquot  the only reason i kept playing was to see the filmed cutscenes and even they were lifelessget this game when it goes in the dollar bin
otherwise dont waste your moneyif one good thing can be said about enter the matrix its that the wachowski brothers were a major creative force behind the game
a  page script and an unprecedented  minutes of original cinematic footage was produced so gamers and movie watchers alike could learn the story of ghost and niobe played by anthony wong and jada pinkett smith
their time on the big screen was limited but their experiences in the game supplement the matrix story and fill in gaps the movie left out
the concept is pure genius but the finished product ends up a failure because its just not fun to playfrom the start of the game you get this unnerving feeling that developer shiny entertainment was in over their head
the game engine itself has subpar graphics considering its high system requirements and the number of bugs are atrocious more on that later
i knock off another star for the bloated  gigs of hard drive space this game requires
running music and cutscenes off the cds could have saved a lot of space but were not given this option
hard drives are cheap but this is ridiculousafter spending the halfhourhour necessary to dump this behemoth on your hard drive youll find yourself starting out watching a movie clip involving ghost niobe and their cynical ship dwelling sidekick sparks
the clips are faithful to the movie and to their credit shiny added well done computer animated cutscenes of their own
your first mission involves infiltrating a post office to pick up an important package
from this point sparks whines about the difficulty of the mission as he does throughout the game you choose whether you want to be ghost or niobe and the game beginsas you proceed through the post office prompts flash on the screen which provide tips on performing various functions such as controlling character movement and performing special fighting moves
it would have been nice to simply hit a function key instead of esc select option scroll down select tip etc an extremely linear game youre subjected to following a green arrow at the top of the screen which points which direction you should be headed punching and kicking cops and security guards along the way
after reading twenty tips and punching and kicking  security guards as you follow your little green arrow you find you have returned right back where you started
in fact youll run in circles three times just to complete the first level
in another level you run from one end of a level to another to flip a switch and turn a conveyor belt on
halfway back you get a prompt saying someone turned the switch off
as a result you have to retrace your steps and repeat the process all over again
other levels have you climbing staircases all the way up to the top floor of some factory running to the other side of the room then climbing staircases all the way back down again
this mindnumbing backtracking is a persistent problem throughout the gamecharacter movement is mostly annoying
yes you can slow things down to the now famous bullettime and hit special key combinations to perform cool moves but heres the problem
it takes a lot longer to perform these moves and youre subjected to so many faceless nameless cops and security guards that its quicker just to run up to them and mash buttons until you knock them out and move on
considering lost health restores automatically by standing still long enough its easier this way too
even more problematic the game tries to think for you when youve got your guns drawn and you end up firing at stuff youre not even aiming at
in one level i was supposed to destroy three control panels
i stood pointing directly at them at point blank range while my bullets were wildly firing in every direction other than straight aheadbugs are prevalent
youll run into clipping problems heads and arms appearing through walls and unrealistic gameplay issues like a door or elevator not working until youve killed every guard in the room
in one level i got to my objective a telephone before everyone was eliminated and found myself completely unable to continue the game or even move away from the telephone
best i could do was shut down and start over
sound issues are a problem for those with eax and cutscenes are lower in volume than the sound effects
youll find yourself playing with the volume knob a lot
at times the game muted my sound card for no apparent reason at all
a patch addresses some but not all of these problemsmost laughable are the socalled driving sequences
pretty much the only difference between playing as niobe or ghost completing these levels is an exercise in frustration
as niobe the driver the view is limited and the controls are sluggish
as ghost riding shotgun with a shotgun niobes driving is so bad youre safer keeping yourself inside the vehicle
strangest of all are the other cars on the road violently gyrating left and right even at a complete standstill
youd think they were filled with horny teenagersafter about an hour of this inane running killing running killing and following the little green arrow just to watch the next cinematic it dawns on you that thats all there is to this game
out of sheer boredom i entered a cheat so i could avoid the guards and get through the cinematics
even the current hollywood fad of girlongirl liplocking monica bellucci and jada pinkett smith couldnt keep me interestedall this said i still think the wachowski brothers had the right idea
if the right developers id valve ea monolith were involved this could have been impressive
unfortunately shiny entertainment couldnt hack the matrix and neither should youhope the review helpedproscool moveshave some deleted scenes of the movieuse hacking to get more featuressuch as getting new messagesconsa waste of space cds  gbs the controlls are complex the mouse sensitivty are different  the speed of selecting sometime is different from viewing and sniping the graphic sucks and everything is all darksometime the game froze at the menui play alot of games and when i read about how etm sucks i thought how bad can it be
well its the worst i hav ever seenits almost a rip off of the game max payne
if you get a chance to buy this game pass on thatplanetside for the pc is first person shooter where you wage war for territory and enemy bases in futuristic alien worlds
planetside can only be played online there is no offline mode
no practice mode offline either and this is really disappointing
then you need to pay a game fee
if you bought this game retail it comes with a  days free play after that you have to pay a subscription fee month if you wish to continue playing
planetside is not for the casual gamer because the game offers so many options you can be a medic engineer pilot assault soldier heavy assualt sniper spy and more
you can choose from three different factions and they all of similar soldier types but feel a bit different
youll be shooting with weapons found in most fps like the shotguns rocket launcher machine guns pistols sniper rifle energy weapons and some neat gadgets
the alien worlds earthlike are humongus
even your base is huge and is easy to get yourself lost and confused
running on foot takes forever so you need to ride vehicles to travel faster to battles
if you dont have a vehicles you can ride a shuttle which arrives every  minutes
or use a warp gate
the battles are very awesome seeing  players having a real war lasers bullets and missles flying everywhere
the real problem begins with lag even if you have a powerful pc with cable internet it lags like heck
then there is game crashesthis game is so glitchy and full of bugs that they keep making the game crash even with patches
lastly the game feels repeatative because the battles never end
when you take over an enemy base you are then supposed to defend it and then the enemy comes after you
there is no ending no victory screen or fmv no stats to give you satisfaction
so after a short while the neverending battles seem pointless completely ruining the game experienceprostons of optionscools weaponsexcellent graphicsexcellent sound effectsexcellent musichuge battleshuge worldsconsno offline gameplayno single player game modetons of game crashestons of strange glitchestons of lagwaiting  mintues to ride a shuttleeasy to get lostcomplicated interfacebattles never endgame becomes pointlesspaying  a month toplay a glitchy crashhappy gamethe good point is that the concept is not bad but the actual game is
bad controls glitches in the program bugs make this game frustrating to play
very disapointed with this gamewhen i bought this game i was like cool its a game about a pirate controlling an island
its got ok graphics
i never played the original tropico so i couldnt tell you the differences
i played the game for about  hours
the only exciting part i found was sending the ships out to raid areas when i played there was only one place to raid funny thing is they would never run out of people or be smart enought to move to another place means not realistic
you would never see these raids
if you build too fast you would run out of captives
very annoying
the whole fear thing on the captives doesnt mean anything
i never lost one captive
you could buy it or not its up to youthis game gets real old and slow after a day or two
i want more from a game that what this isfolks if you were going to purchase primal to fill that adventureexploration gap in your ps life save your time and money
while primal did add some interesting twists on explorativegothic gameplay it still falls short of being a title worthy of hard earned cash
interesting and often beautiful environments are a plus here but the figthing system is lame and repetitve and the puzzles hardly merit mention
there is no sense of addictive fun or excitement in primal
 the stop and start brawls with easytokill monsters gets old really fast
this game is mostly comprised of clever cutscenes and too much walking aroundin this game you play as jen a heavy metal girl whos boyfriend has been kidnapped and taken to the demon realms
jen is taken to these realms by scree a gargoyle and told that she must restore order to the realms in order to save her boyfriend
there are four of these realms and the graphics are very good the environments are very creative and theres a lot of exploring to dothe first realm is mostly a forest at night though there is also a city coliseum underground caverns etc
i didnt care for this realm too much its very mazelike and i spent the whole time having no idea where i was supposed to go or what i was supposed to do when i got there
the second realm is underwater and youll spend the whole time swimming
its also very tough to navigate as you have to go from place to place and its a big puzzle as far as how to get there
at least the mission was straightforward you have to achieve a number of objectives one after another
the third realm was by far my favorite you travel through an incredibly gloomy village and eventually wind up in a marvelous castle
it was worth it for the scenery alone
the fourth realm was soso its a bunch of underground volcanic caverns and youll spend a lot of time trying to get from one place to another
the challenge in this level is fun thoughprobably the biggest problem with the game is the combat  its the most basic button mashing imaginable
just press r over and over and over
by the end of the final boss battle i though the middle finger on my right hand was going to fall off
you basically get one weapon on each level and use it throughout so theres absolutely no strategy when it comes to combat
though to be fair in the third realm you could run away from your enemies then get a powerup from your gargoyle pal kill one enemy get another powerup repeat until theyre all deadthe story is another problem  you start out trying to save your boyfriend but spend the whole game trying to restore order to the demon realms which doesnt seem to have much to do with the original story setup and left me feeling totally uninvolved
they should have just ditched all the boyfriend stuff and instead come up with a different setup that would have made more sense and been more relevantoverall good graphics and characters lots of often frustrating exploring and repetitive combat
its a pretty game and some portions of it are certainly quite fun to play but overall the bad outweighs the goodi bought this game back in april of  and beta tested the game in its third stage
today august of  i cancelled my account for the game
this game just failed to hook me
people everywhere say this game has the power too keep you glued to your tv screen for hours sometimes days
i can honestly say after playing the game that i never once felt this magical game pulling me towards my tevelvisondrawback  price the game is very expensive
first off you need your sony network adapter a fresh sony memory card yes this game takes up mb of the mb on a card the game itself a usb keyboard and an online subscription to everquest
thats a alot of money for most people and the subscription makes many people stop playingdrawback  gameplay in order to enjoy this game you need to find a group of people to play with
this can only be done by typing messages in hoping that you can find a group
it takes on average about  minutes to find a sutible group
and if no one is online at the time you are then the game is usless
once your in a group your in for some serious fun
you walk around the virtual world looking for animals and people to kill
once you find one you go up to it and press x over and over again
about  times
then it dies and you gain about  xp points
it takes about  million to obtain a new level
yeah it is gonna take awhile
there are around  levels and as you progress the animals get tougher and you get more xp points and it takes more xp points to level up as welloverall this game is a stressful waste of time
you just do not get the same high that you will get in other games
i do not recomend this game at allgraphics sound replayibility online yesmultiplayer nook folks
listen up
this is a hardcore pc gamer talking to yai have been playing everquest for about three years on the pc
its a great game and still has newcomers and serrious players that join in the fun
i personally am not a huge gamer so i dont spend that much time on stuff like that however i know a good game when i see one
i harassed my friend for ages when he first bought the ps version of the game and then i went over to check it out for myselfmost of what i found was devestating
theyve had what four or five years to make the graphics better for this game the worlds more expansive the connection compatability better yet all they do is an immitation of an otherwise great pc game
face it eq is four or five years old
during that time span they could have definately improved the game instead of using the same engine and making different quests
if you own the pc version shun this game forever most console gamers probably wouldnt enjoy a game like this anywayi got this for xmas and i cant get into
its extremely hard to hit and extremely easy to field
all the bells and whistles for extras are nice but i found the game play difficult on the offensive end and too easy defensively
perhaps i should spend more time wit but i think ill wait for a newer improved baseball gamei would urge all active xbox gamers to rent this game prior to buying so that you can save time money and frustration
while some of the features and options may be temporarily entertaining the limitations and annoying factors will add up quickly and cause you to turn this game off in disgustbatting the batting control for this game is about as frustrating and uncomfortable as you can imagine
no matter what batting option you choose the timing and the set up will never fit your gameplay
you either hit a foul ball pop out or strike outthats itrunner on base the controls for base running are ridiculous and the player mentalityawareness is inconsistent and unrealistic
when you do finally get a man on base be prepared to cringe as he fails to tag up even though you didnt direct him to advance ugh
you will not score many runs in this gameannoying comments derek jeter and various old managers will screw up your timing by giving you a quothelpfulquot hint right when you make contact with the ball
seriously a suggestion box will pop up in the middle of the screen and interrupt whatever is happening in the game
even if you turn the comment option off the comments will continue to appear
very very annoyinggraphics overall the graphics could and should be much better
the pitching and batting stances are nice but these images are just a small part of the entire game
the crowd homeruns fielding etcthese are just a few of the many areas that need to be enhancednice things i wont completely dog this game title as the pitch control the playbyplay announcing and the stat upkeep is impressive
unfortunately those are the only nice things i can come up withbottom line if you buy this game with hopes of purchasing a quality baseball title that is fun and competitive then you will be severely disappointed
this is a one time rental onlywhile a lot of effort was put into this games graphics stopmotion animation and story the game play is very dull
cars are slow
the fighting controls are weak
even civilian ai is screwed they kept driving through the streets like normal despite the fact that a massive gun fight was happening
overall it just wasnt funi loved the showso i got the gameit is funny for awhilebut the same moves and oneliners quickly wear on your nervesthe game ends very quickbut whats really bad about this game is  the so called unlockable quotbonusquot characters to play asi was under the impression that you would unlock more celebs to play asthat is not the case at allyou just unlock stupid fantasy characters like frankenstienwerewolfmummyalien etcalso the material they used to poke fun at the celebrities seems datedas if this game was meant to be released a couple years backgotham games couldve also added better celebrities to play as and mutilatei think it wouldve been funny to see someone like brittney spears or eminem getting impaled or beheadedbut instead they give us busta rhymes and carrot top
take this one for a rental if you are really boredbut please do not buy this onethis game isnt worth the priceactually its not even worth  if it was given free to youthe characters are a shamethe choice is very restringed not many character at all
you finish the game in episode mode in like  minutes or less only  episodes  fights each the same people fighting on all the episodes since there arent different characters
the game is boring and lame too short and the locked characters are a joke no celebrities
fans will be disapointed casual players will be disapointed it doesnt do justice to the tv programbeside the referi and the hosts its not even about the programim so disapointeddont waste your money on this game unless you just want to collect i and say   i own celebrity death matchs game even if its an awful game which is the only thing i can do with it now
the grafics are good though and some of the attacks and  fatalities are pretty coolbut its still not worth the botheri started playing this game today and have completed it no more than an hour later
so you can probably guess already that i am not going to be giving this game much of a positive reviewcelebrity death match is the game based on the old mtv animation show
i used to like the show back when it was on tv so naturally i thought to myself how bad could the came be
i tried to base my purchase off of reviews here on amazon but they are so up and down and lack so much information that i hope the information people need in future will be answered hereas you can probably guess its a celebrity death match inside a ring where two celebrities square off against each other until one of them is dead
so far it sounds good to me as there is plenty of celebrities i would love to rip apart
once the game is loaded you are presented with very few options
you have the tv mode which is a selection of  shows to start off with each containing  match ups or  fights in which if you complete all  rounds with your given charactercelebrity you will unlock hidden characters
once you complete the first  shows which again are only  rounds long you unlock up to  episodes and many more celebrities and new arenarings to compete in
secondly is the option for a death match which is basically just exhibition where you can fight the computer or play  player to death
the next option is to create a celebrity which has some pretty bad things to choose and just not enough to keep you interested in trying to create anyone with the lack of cloths and styles you are presented with
the create a celebrity is pretty much a waste of time as you can only compete with them in exhibition matches and never in the shows
lastly is the options option
adjust game difficulty and sound and commentator volumesgameplay could have been so much better but it lacks in giving you a feel of complete control
its a cartoon style offthewall fight to the death so think road runner and coyote type of moves and finishers
playing in the tv shows is lame because you get  matches and the characters you play as are chosen for you not by you
it only took me about  minutes to complete everything and unlock everything and replay value is pretty much nill
the controls of your celebrities are lacking
you press either x triangle o or sqaure to preform a move you can also use the direction pad and press a button to do a different move
your l and r buttons are for blocking and taunting and a finisher and some moves are done by pressing  buttons together
there is no run button nor a irishwhip button which you think would be standard in this sort of gamefor the most part when checking out what moves your celebrity has by the time you have done all  of them youve pretty much beaten your opponent senseless and its time to finish the match
matches can last as long as you want to avoid your opponent but going in for the kill you can do it in under  seconds and they will have barely fought back
usually you just figure out what move does the most damage and just keep hitting that button
there is no strategy needed its pretty much  percent above being a button masher type of controlwhat leaves this game lack luster in replay value is that you can only have the one match type just one on one
there is no tagteam  on  triple threat  on  on  tornado  on  on  on  or any other combination of match ups
i didnt expect it to be like wrestling games and feature cage matches or hell in a cell tlc etc but i at least expected some sort of match options where i could select something other than  on  what where they thinkingthe celebrities you can choose are decent celebrities but there are so many more that where on the show that could have been included that would have made it so much better to have seen as part of the line up
where is mtvs  duo beavis and butthead
the show became popular by having wwef champion stone cold steve austin on the show but even he is not in the game not even a generic rip off to avoid copyright nor can you even make a bald head in create a celebrity modespeaking of create a celebrity mode i mentioned what little you can choose regarding looks but another thing that is lame is you can only choose  sets of already premade moves one of a boxer and one of a brawler
why
i cant make a character and choose to have him fart off a move like others in the game
lame lame lamegraphics wise the game is what you expect check out screens from the game they are just your typical polygons of the time and they look ok i supposesound is something that makes the game pretty boring not so much the commentary but the lack of background music during fights because when the commentators arent talking it sounds like silence and really takes away a lot from the atmosphere of the gamei never played the ps version of this game but least that game had codes to unlock everyone instead of wasting almost an hour of your time unlocking all the characters and rings in this onethe characterscelebrities in this game are as followsanna nicole smith  uses her boobs alot as attacks and squirts milk out of them funny at first boring after a minutebusta rhymescarmen electra  uses saws and things for some reasoncarrot topcousin grimm  whodennis rodman  has some cheap attacksfrankensteingladiatior nick commentatorjerry springermarilyn mansonmiss cleomr

dont even bother to try and create them you wont get a good likeness
you cant even create height weight or muscle typesi hope i didnt leave anything out and i agree with gamepro magazine this this game is a  out of ten
this game is not the worst game ever made but its pretty disappointing
if you could rent it for a dollar it would be ok as you paid your dollar and would pay them another dollar to take it back
but i bought this for  and i feel  ripped offevil dead a fistful of boomstick is nice looking game with some great lighting effects and extra touches like leaves blowing in the wind
downside its really really darkbruce campbell voices ashs dialog which should please fans of the evil dead moviesthis game is boring so boring that its hard to play long enough to get to some of the games more interesting elements like the selection of different weapons or the ability to cast a few spellsif you want to play this game i suggest renting it first
shooting and slashing zombies can be fun but after a while it gets really boringbefore actually playing it i was planning on buying it anyways because of all the good reviews it had gotten but thank god i played it at a store because it really didnt please me at all
in the stealthaction genre no game and i mean no game at all can even come remotely close to the entertainment that the metal gear solid series provides
the gameplay in splinter cell is quite unique but there are weird things that you have to do like when you pick locks you may be stumped sitting there for  minutes trying to figure out how to pick the thingto say ive seen better does not do my feelings justice
in fact i think that ill go dig out my copy of metal gear solid the first onei have to say i am a big fan of the splinter cell games but with the new ones out this game just seems so hard to play
and the lack of a save option can be frustrating at times
a lot of times
if your craving some classic splinter cell you may find it a better idea to get the classic hd trilogy for the current gensi really can not believe the  star reviews for this game
i can only assume that it gets an extra  automatically for being the sequel to the quot game of the yearquot as sierra is so fond of advertisingim a big fan of the homeworld series and enjoyed the two previous installments greatly so needless to say i was quite looking forward to cracking open hw
the demo wasnt exactly inspiring i wasnt really fond of some of the modifications that were made to the games basic formula
namely the inclusion of unit quotsquadronsquot and a more emphasised quotpaperrockscissorsquot balance scheme
even so i managed to talk myself into shelling out  bucks for the game dohdespite all the quotits too hardquot comments floating around i was undaunted i dont mind a challenge
unfortunately the challenge in hw is afforded mostly by a test of how fast you can click your mouse and navigate around the nicely updated interface
a typical campaign mission in hw consists mostly of you constantly trying to repel a ceaseless barrage of enemy ships while trying to complete both your mission goals and without sucking up every single resource unit on the map before you get thereim giving it  stars for the following things  graphics sound design and an at least moderately fun skirmish mode
everything else in my humble opinion is just nonexistant
i shudder to think how well a newcommer would fare in hw i consider myself a pretty decent rts gamer and i still find it a frustrating experience
not to mention there is only a single campaign rather than one for each faction i hope this doesnt become the next rts trendin short hw has everything going for it except what matters  gameplay
i play games to relax and enjoy not to be irritated and driven out of my mind
very disappointed i hope relic lets barking dog studios who did hw cataclysm handle the next installment of this seriesi bought this game the day it came out i think i played it for a while that day and stopped playing it for about a month
just today i started playing it again and i remembered why i stopped playingi guess the biggest flaw is this game is hard
for some reason it seems that pc games only have two settings these days easy and impossibly hard
this game is definatly the latterthe units in this game are evolved around the old silly theory that one unit is strong versus an other type of unit but completly helpless against some other type
which always seemed rather stupid to me
a  m machine gun was designed to be an antivehicle weapon
does that mean its completly useless against personnel
uh noit just happens that its more effective against personnel because of its obvious overpowermentso in the game you have to figure out what the enemys strengths and weaknesses are and exploit them with the appropriate unit
howeverthe enemy rarely has just one type of unit in fact it usually has a pretty well rounded force
so you have to create a well rounded force yourself to deal with them
however the enemy is much faster than you and can pick and chose your ships while youre trying to make sense of the battle
it amazes me every time how surgical the ai is when it comes to wiping out your force
youll have a large well rounded group one second then notice the enemy is targeting solely one type of unit of yours
once that unit type is gone youre force is essentially crippled as it now has a large hole in it that can be easily exploited
it amazes me how the enemy can target those single unit types in a group of  other ships when you can barely even see what types of units are in their groupsadd this to the fact that the enemy also has unlimited recources and ships and you have a rather frustrating puzzleevery mistake you make is cumulative as well
you cant just barely win a battle
as youll go into the next battle with basically no units
you always have to find a way to win the battle without crippling your chances for the next battlethe battle really does not give you much time to think either
you have a research capability to improve your unitsbut youre rarely given a single uneventfull minute to figure out what you want to researchthe graphics in this game are pretty stunningi guess
i run a high end computer  p  gig ddr ram geforce ti   mb ddr ram and the graphics are still extremely choppy in partsits ok if you zoom all the way out but if you zoom close into the ships everything becomes choppy and the game slows down significantlythe story completly escapes me
i read the little overview of the story in the manual and i still have no idea what the game is talking about
i never played the original homeworlds so sue meoverallits just another game i have around that takes up spacethis game was on my top  wish list for games i wanted
i could not wait for it to come out
now that i have it how dissappointing it waswhen i first got lords of the realms  i played it the first day for  staight hours
it was my first taste of real time strategy and started my conversion from puzzle games to rts and fps games
with realms  it took all of the good things from realms  and got rid of them
you can no longer control the resources you collect like rock trees and your food
you now place a vassal on a vacant plot and you get either gold or food
thats it
you also cant raise an army
the only way you can get an army is to place a knight on a vacant plot or buy mercanaries
but if you dont own enough land you can only have so many knights or you will not have enough money or farms
if you are short on farms your army will abandon you
the longer your knight is on the board the more men he will collect but it takes a very long time to collect a very small amount of men
you used to be able to control your lands easier and make your city grow then raise an army
but not nowthe most irritating thing is fighting
if you go to an enemies lands and take out his farm if you dont leave an army back they will instantly place another vassal for a farm
even if you take out their castle you still cant take over their land until you do more damage to their landthe next irritating thing is the armies
you can kill all of the enemies armies which leaves his plot open
he will then place another knight to replace his beaten knight and then attack you and somehow he has an army twice your size
i beat one enemies knights completely  straight times and he still came back with  large armies and force me from his land
not sure how that happened as i went through every knight of the realm and never found a large army once
when an army takes damage their color changes
when they get to red they are discouraged and they disband during the fight
so how he can keep coming back is beyond me becasue your army needs time to healand the last irritating thing is the battles
it seems like every time i go to the battle screen another army attacks my lands
that is because there is no pause in the game when try to fight the battles yourself
if you let the computer do it for you you lose alot more than you should plus you dont get to play the game
there needs to be a pause during battles so you can enjoy the game more
you also cant build siege weapons
you have buy siege mercanaries
not cooll at allthe games doesnt totally suck
it is challenging although very repititious and the graphics are pretty good although i havent been able to see the intro movie or any other cutscenes even thought i downloaded the patch
not sure whats up with that but that is about itif they plan on making another they better go back to what worked for realms  amp  and incorporate it in realms  otherwise this franchise is dead if it isnt alreadyi remember years back being on the official lords bbs and being one of many to warn the developers not to make this into an rts game
in fact i begged pleaded cajoled coaxed warned the devs that turning lords into something it wasnt meant to be would be a huge mistakethen i recanted
i thought well maybe something neat and newll come out of this effortnopemy first gut instincts were right and so were everyone elses who at first asked and then demanded that lords be kept a turn based game
but as luck would have it the marketers won out
and the development team were required to crank out a piece of crap real time strategy game
that and the music stank
i mean it sucked big timethe only redeeming factor was that the battlefield graphics were okay
that is until the armies actually fought one another and then you saw a cascade of of swords and clumps of computer generated soldiers fighting over the same twosquare feet of game territorythere was barely any management involved
no creation of troops
no empire building
no nothing that made the first two lords and lords of magic games incredibly fun to playit was all goneman oh man oh man
and to think that i me personally sent off some of my best gaming ideas to the offshoot company that was formed after impressions games closed its door for a medieval themed unofficial sequel to lords of the realm  a little game entitled stronghold and that game went off to earn millions
that as opposed to lords and its alleged independent minded developers who shirked my ideas of tunneling or hurtling dead animals over a wall via catapult or allowing hunters to be part of armies
pitch mixing of wall types for castles etc stronghold had it all
stronghold the battlefield version was what lords wanted to be but the developers didnt know itafter i passed on my list of ideas to one of the key employees i figured well theyll look it and throw it in the waste paper basket
but maybe theyll get a little inspired by one or two
well truly great minds think alike or i just got lucky in that they happened to choose the same ideas i was thinking of again stronghold triumphs
lords
not so muchstronghold spawned an expansion pack
three expansion packs in fact
tons of websites with user made maps and two d accelerated sequels
lords
again not so muchso what did i find redeeming about lords
well truly i did like the tactical maps
i didnt like the music
i didnt like the game play itself in either the strategic or tactical side of things
but i did very much like how the tactical battlefields were rendered
those were truly impressive
but the sum total of the game
nowell stronghold thrives
but the lords series seems to have permanently laid down lance and shield
and the whole tragic thing about this is that it didnt need to be soi remember the most apparent truth about creativity is that only creative people artistic people can contribute to a creative effort
not business people
business people are borderline sociopathic if not fully sociopathic
they have no sense of pleasure empathy nor right nor wrong
where the artist has all these things and morethe people at sierra and activision shouldve listened to their talent and creative fan base
but for whatever reason they did not
and those that reaped the fruits of heart felt labor succeeded beyond their wildest dreams
i was part of that
i got no money for it
i got no recognition for it
but the developers knew me back then and i was more than glad to contributehowever in retrospect i sure could use the money nowbut regardless if you must buy a copy of lords of the realm  then buy one of the real cheap leftover used copies
otherwise dont waste your moneythis product was a waste of my money as it did not work properly
it deleted my saved data all on its own
i am not happy about itthis game is boring
you can onlty expoler hoen and theres not a lot of pokemon form the other games
you cant connect to the other games and after the elite foure thres nothing for you to do except cath all the pokemon
you cant even travel to fight people in jhoto and kanto
thats why i liked gold and sliver but this is stupid
you still have to make due with only four moves not six or five but only four moves
and some of the new pokemon is ugly and even some look alike
also in the pelterbug forrest cath two slakouth because you can trade one for a pokemon i cant pronounce in peltaburg city
in peltaburg city you have to fight roxanne
she has a lv
 geodude and lv nosepass
nosepass uses a attacked call rock to mp it reduces your ablie and doese damage
use berries if you have them
if you have treecko there is a guy in route  that gives a tm called bullet seed
teach that tm to treecko
bullet seed is a grass move that attacks   times
it doese crital damage to rock and fighting pokemon
if you dont have treccko another good poke for the gym leader is dustox
level up a wrumple to lv and learn confusion
and gust at lv
at slateport if you defeat all the trainers in the shack you get six sodapopruby really disappoints me
the game is boring and has no replay valuedont get me wrong leaf green was so much better than thisyoud probably have more fun playing the other games just skip this you wont be missing out on muchthis game is horrible
im basing this off of actual gameplay
since i am anbiased gamer i can say that this game series needs to end
the creators think that adding new pokemon will save the series
well it can not and will not
adding new pokemon and a few new perks just is getting boring
also there is basicly no stradegy whatso ever
its like the stronger of the two will win and nothing else
its sooo boring looking for people to battle and just walking around getting badges is old toopokeacutemon has come a long way to here but its losing its touchin  a popular trading card game was brought to america from japan
it wasnt until  a game for gameboy was released a game similar to the trading card game become the greatest pokeacutemon master ever
soon  was here and to go along with red and blue yellow
then later on down the road in the new era of the st century  and  came gold silver and crystal
the storyline was exactly the same as before with wierd twists
now we have ruby and sapphire
its the same
dont waste your moneya long time ago when zelda first came out it was a lot fun
the graphics were really cheesy but still a good time
now the graphics are still cheesy but the game is terrible
theres nothing worse for a game when you cant speed up the conversation and theres a lot of it in this game
it is one of the most frustrating games ive ever played
i think this is one game you should rent first before buying because it really is frustratingupdate july  im playing this game again after many years and oh my what a big disappointment
it doesnt hold up at all
a big name zelda title is supposed to be the greatest day next to christmas
wind waker admittedly does a lot of things right but the trade off is that it does way more things wrong
where to begin with this messlets begin with the dungeons
all of them are boring and colorless in appearance unnecessarily overlong and confusing to figure out
its not like in the d zelda games where sword cutting action is combined with creative puzzles these dungeons are  puzzles and  action
having to run through gigantic nearlyempty rooms with eerie music in the background doesnt qualify as epic either
nice try nintendo
the two dungeons that are most unforgivable are the water dungeon tower of the gods and the one that involves having to babysit er team up with a female bird lady character named medli and help her through the dungeon earth temple
even though link and medli work together it still feels more like babysitting
while the dungeon puzzles are honestly thoughtprovoking and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment upon figuring them out these two dungeons are the reason im not going back to this game ever again
do you really want to persevere this kind of torture again
these arent the kind of puzzles you ever desire to repeat
not when they take forever just to get through
even if you were to attempt a speedrun through these dungeons the tedious nature of grinding through puzzle after puzzle assures you wont be speedrunning at a pace youd preferthe water dungeon is probably the worse of the two but then again maybe not
i wasnt stuck on it nearly as long as the earth temple but on the other hand the obstacles i faced were probably a lot worse
the best way to describe the dungeon is like this the first half is occupied with flooded rooms where the water raises and lowers approximately every  seconds and the second half is all about a series of tedious statuepushing puzzles
when i say the water goes up and down i mean exactly that you have to wait for the water to rise or lower because link will then be able to swim to a platform or room within reach
this is all totally required on the part of the player if you actually want to complete the dungeon and of course thats why youre playing the game
you have to deal with the moving waters
in one unbelievably horrific room you have to light a torch and jump across a series of perfectly lined up crates floating on top of the water
oh but thats not all
if you miss youll jump in the water which means your flame will go out and youll have to relight the torch and attempt to move across the crates once again
and you have to line up the crates when the water temporarily recedes so theres a proper and accurate path for links jumping
if not for ocarina of times water dungeon this would unquestionably be a strong contender for the worst dungeon ever madethe other dungeon i mention involves the female bird lady character medli where you have to do a series of tedious tasks that involve lifting her up and carrying her around or shell get stuck behind
shes also often needed to pick up and fly around link to high or faraway platformsplaces and the main theme seems to be taking your shield or medlis shield and reflecting the light that shines through ceiling or wall cracks in order to break open more passageways chests or secrets giving you access to the next area
your shield is basically used as a weapon in these instances
at first it seems creative but you have to do this same task over and over again and since each room serves more as overlong puzzles youll be stuck in this castle for hours
i guarantee it
wouldnt be so bad if the enemies such as those highpitched screaming skeletons that freeze link in place were more abundant instead of scarce
the one thing that really annoys me is that you have to play melody commands to activate medli a certain way
you have to do this so many times not just here but throughout the game that it totally overstays its welcome after a while
its out of place in a zelda game
just because link played the flute in the d games does not give nintendo the right to stretch out this unbearable mini musical story for all its worth in the sequels
overdone boring and unnecessary
in the wind temple you have to guide a little mechanical propellerlifting chickenlike thing called makar at least it looks like a skinned chicken dont you think
to higher areasplatforms to activate blocks and other things
the fun wears thin when the realization that you have to do this same task over and over creeps in
a poor attempt at designing dungeons nintendo
shame on youyou already know the next problem im going to mention since its been said a thousand times by now
the actual sailing to get from one island to another takes forever with little in the way of doing anything interesting along the way
the sail boat moves incredibly slow and even though sometimes you might talk to a helpful fish for advice and discover treasure chests full of rupees trifocre chartsshards or heart container pieces along the way and even a boring rupeecollecting mini game involving a boat race later on none of these things make up for the tediousness of waiting and waiting and falling asleep
and waiting some more until your boat arrives to your destination
ugh
you can control the boat anywhere you want but its not like theres a whole lot to do
i realize a lot of people dislike the bird flying in skyward sword because it takes a while to arrive to your desired island in that game as well but at least its more heroic soaring and adventurous watching link riding a bird and closing in on an approaching island
here with a sail boat it just doesnt deliver the same kind of excitement
though granted the peaceful serenity of the nighttime sailing is pretty cool especially when you glance at the moon and stars above and i even like when danger occasionally occurs such as swarming sharks and cannonballs later on because it adds a bit of suspense
i mean youre on a mere sail boat and here comes danger
this isnt as threatening of a situation as you might be thinking howeverseveral of the errands you do in town are so bad it makes me crings just thinking about them
having to snap photos of a man and woman when theyre together or when a man is putting mail in the town mailbox
really annoying
starting up a ferris wheel
delivering love letters to characters who dont even deserve to be loved
chasing school children in a hide and seek game so you can impress the school teacher whos nothing but a snotty high and mighty unappreciative nobody
she only cares about money and being glamorous and is someone that in reality id avoid like the plague
the picture rearranging games you sometimes discover on the walls of one or two rooms are really annoying too and not worth the reward for completing them  rupees if i remember
theres a few other instances of errandrelated annoyances some of which are requirements
the one where you have to crawl through a series of crawl spaces in mazelike fashion is confusing since every room looks exactly the same but thankfully this area is short and the other one where you have to figure out which doors with a flame above them leads to your prize at the end feels like yet another waste of time but again its shorton the flipside i can name three mini games that are awesome
the auction bidding is the most noticeable one
its fairly realistic and pretty fun too especially the tension you feel after you make a high bid and you nervously count down the seconds anticipating if anyones going to top your bid
the battleship mini game is really fun
i could probably spend  minutes on this game alone
the guy in charge of the battleship game is the worst human being ive ever seen in a zelda game
completely unfunny
and the leaf parachute game where the object is to float across the water and strategically use the tornadoes to elevate your height so you can reach the finish line is the best of the bunch
these are really entertaining gamesthe boss fights are alright though most of them are quite easy to take down
in fact other than ganon theyre all easy to take down
maybe the strategies were fairly complex back in  but these bosses are too simplistic and boring these days
the one where you have to battle a gigantic bird on a rooftop is way too reminiscent of the ridley fight from metroid prime
even his attack and flying patterns are similar
the only difference is that youre using a sword instead of an arm cannon obviously since this is a zelda game
ganons first battle at the end of the game is basically a  dimensional version of the moldorm worm from link to the past but a much faster and harder way of damaging
this part of the fight offensively requires luck to defeat just hope youll be standing near ganons weak point ready to strike when he speeds by
a final boss fight should always be strategic instead of lucky
the celshading graphics were the topic of conversation back in the day but now they look sort of dark uninteresting and overbearingly cutesy
link and zelda have ugly eyes and heads and their bodies arent pretty either
some of the characters such as the pirate named miss tetra are really awesome but fail in comparison to the greater variety and diversity that link to the past and skyward swords character selection presents
the miss tetra storyline takes a drastic horrible turn later on when ugh
i cant spoil it
all potential pertaining to the pirate storyline falls apart once this happensthe enemy combat usually consists of being able to walk up to most armored guardsblob creatures and a few others and slash them to death with your sword
some of them require the leaf bow and arrow or bombs to destroy however
even though dealing with them is really easy we cant overlook that its also really darn fun
usually the guards darknuts dont pose much of a threat but sometimes you will have to prepare to move link out of the way of a lunging sword attack
this is usually in the later half of the game
it gets especially dangerous when theres  or more darknuts on screen
you may have to execute some stellar sword trickery to escape
i love that one super spin attack that enables link to spin around with his sword like a hurricane for  seconds and basically eliminate a room full of problems or at the very least severely damage everything in sight
its awesome
like i say above the melody button commands are awful due to this being a requirement way too often
you have to do this in order to change the direction of the wind so your sail boat can reach the island of your choice
having to frequently command a melody to steer your sail boat to another directionlocation gets boring after a while and as i say above doing it in the castles gets especially tiresome and reduntanti like some of the items and weapons link uses
the rope is a nifty way of swinging across branches to reach high or faraway areas and the leaf parachute offers a similar function
i love the impactful beauty and effects of launching ice and fire arrows at a target as well
the bow and arrow is a dangerous weapon as youd expect since its zelda where the bow and arrow has always been crucial for survival
this weapon is especially helpful and frequent in wind waker it seems
these items and weapons really bring out the adventurous surroundings
the game is overall very generous with the rupees as well
youll be collecting them by the bucket load
they have yellow and purple rupees which adds up your amount rather fast
silver rupees hidden in chests under the water can reward you with  rupees and orange rupees give   red rupees are back worth 
blue and green ones too
insanely generous
unless you havent been collecting them youll probably have close to  by the final dungeon
the swinging of the sword flows remarkably well
theres no confusion in how you want to attack an enemy either
your sword wont ever let you down in the heat of a battle nor will links movements
the game encourages you to walk right up to enemies and slice em up
if you dont well they seem to back off and wander around the room for a while giving you plenty of time to make preparations for another attack
simply put enemies usually arent as relentless as you are which may be a good thing since it means the game is hardly ever overly difficultwhat i hate however is the overlong fetch quest concerning the triforce shards and the charts
you have to find both the charts and the shards in the open water which can take several hours of searching
youll be sailing around for a while but an even bigger problem is that its unnecessary to even have such a quest after all the hours of boat sailing that has already taken place by this point
this entire quest is overkill and i despise it
im not too crazy about having to refight the bosses again at the end of the game either
this time the colors on screen change to black and white perhaps a way to make the adventure feel more intense and when you land the final blow youre simply transported back to the dungeon to take on the next boss
its strange to say the least
theres no feeling of satisfaction when you defeat them once again
then again like i say above theres no feeling of satisfaction anyway due to the bosses being easy overall
though i suppose it works in a reminiscing over previous encounters kind of way which illustrates how far link has come since his sister went missingintroduction of miss tetra near the beginningwind waker encourages more exploring than sword combat so be prepared to spend more time exploring for items and treasures and less time fighting
this means exploring many and i mean many empty islands with nothing but grass high cliffs and trees everywhere
many of these islands contain caves or holes where items and chests are hidden some of which provide decent atmosphere i admit
after all falling in a big hole and landing near streams and being surrounded by high mountains is a unique feeling of adventure
however there are two particularly offensive rooms near the end of the game where you keep falling through hole after hole about  of them total fighting  of the enemy varities youve already encountered which may be cool and serves as a nice combatoriented mission but feels like a clumsy way of making up for the lack of combat you experienced up to this point
like nintendo just tacked this section on to make up for the distinct lack of combat throughout the game
id bet anything that these two parts of the game contain more than  of the enemies in the game overall
why not spread these enemies around the dungeons and the islandsthe music however is incredible
perhaps the best soundtrack ever in a zelda game
the soothingly beautiful credits theme is amazing beyond description but my favorite is the fastpaced jethro tull or renaissance like theme music that plays whenever you arrive to a mini boss
its diverse enough to be classified as a progressive rock song seriously
just listen to how awesome it is
other songs are really melodic and fit in appropriately and excitedly with the heroic theme of the fairy tale locations the zelda series is known for
oh and perhaps my favorite part of the game the dramatic and uneasy music you hear whenever you encounter an enemy
its suspenseful and makes you feel paranoid threatened and overwhelmed by the upcoming danger
its awesome
theres even some perfectly utilized sound effects while this particular theme is playing giving off a feeling of mystery and uncertainty
i dont particularly care for the annoying sounds link makes though
he should have remained silent
at least we can breathe easy knowing the one ice section later on is short because link sliding around sounds like a baby animal being massacred by a group of wild barbarians
oh and speaking of which these ice and fire dungeons shouldnt technically be considered dungeons since theyre only one or two rooms long
it literally only takes  minutes to complete themoverall go with skyward sword for a better d representation instead
that game better represents the zelda formula on all counts especially graphics storytelling and overall epicness but not music though wind waker takes the crown there
wind waker just doesnt provide much in the way of substance or pacing
the triforce chartshard quest is a big extremely overlong letdown almost making you not want to finish the game
how many times have i wanted to give up on a zelda game due to boredom
never before
the islands should have been closer together too
this would have helped trim down on the unnecessary length of the gamereading some of the reviews posted before i got the feeling a number of these reviewers didnt actually finish the game
i agree with them completely about the first half of it its fun its pretty
the graphics control system and gameplay are all very good
and for the beginning the story is excellentwhere i disagree is in the rest of it
the second half of the game involves amazing amounts of guesswork and very little encouragement making the game lose most all of its wonderful momentum
i started out overjoyed and having fun then it all drained awayevery time i started really enjoying myself  in a fight a jumping puzzle a dungeon crawl i ran into something that just got in the way of it
most often it would be something that was tricky to figure out and then you get that proud feeling when you do but then doing what you figured out proved tedious and aggravating
i was ok with the sailing i liked the graphics i liked the story and i liked the controls but this game was designed in large part by a sadist
ive heard reviewers say it was easy a lot of it is but the parts that arent are not difficult because the puzzles are complicated theyre just designed to be just hard enough that knowing what you have to do was less than half the battleive played every zelda game made theyve all had nasty tricky puzzles but this is the first one where the puzzles are harder to complete than to figure out
last time i checked the point of a puzzle was solving it not writing down the solutionthe story is all right most notably because it is different from every other zelda game made before
the unique flavor adds a lot to it but the story remains pretty sparse considering the amount of legwork between plot momentsi have to say having played through the entire game and gotten through every side quest that its good aspects are seriously hurt by its overly irritating nature
plus one of the characters you have to rely on very heavily not only empties your purse but is just damned obnoxious good old pal tinglepathetic and unworthy of the name legend of zelda
when i saw screenshots for this game prior to its release i was up in arms as were many people and ready to avoid this game like the plague
unfortunately many people seem for some unknown reason to have been won over by the game after its release i however found the disappointment of playing this game to be exactly commensurate with my expectationsi decided to give the game an honest chance i thought just look at it as ocarina of time with different graphics and different levels
sadly the only thing carried over from oot were the horrible controls funny how technology advances and nintendo still cant manage to achieve correspondence between controller inputs and character actions oh well though one could stretch a point and say that oot did introduce gratuitously bizarre new elements to the zelda world the goron race comes to mind but tww takes this to such an extreme that i cannot forgive it for its eccentricities as i did oottww is boring and embarrassing
boring because the story has virtually no connection to the prior zelda games so the hardcore fan really has to make a mental leap to even consider this as continuous with the other games
boring also because the game starts out with sheer tedium it took what seemed like forever to get the sword only to lose it in the first level
and the game actually starts out with a gerudo fortresslike level where one must evade detection
one would think that shiggy would start the game out with the most fun and pleasant puzzles he possibly could to encourage immersion in the game before challenging the gamers patience but the worst trials of my patience came right at the beginning of the gamethe game is embarrassing because it is extremely immature in a way reminiscient of majoras mask
im not sure if its just the way the japanese design games but the bizarre childish characters and graphics were very offputting
while im on the subject the graphics are terrible
there is no sense that this is a zelda game its a cartoon
there is certainly no sense of darkness in the game either something every zelda game before this has had
the game is very lighthearted and giddy and yet tedious
excellent combination for boring me to deathi kept playing hoping for a break to the boredom but it never came
i stopped playing this game and have no intention of coming back to it
adventure of link was good enough as a game that i finished it but this game is just terrible
stay away unless you want to be a miyamotobarning fanboythink back the fall of  when the blair witch project was released
the elitist movie critics were in a fullfledged campaign to convince the public and themselves that the movie was the best thing since citizen kane
back in  so much praise was showered on the film that the voices of dissent were drowned out and ridiculed
then a funny thing happened time passed
like the rest of the superficial hollywood crowd the elitist critics have moved on and this has allowed people to freely rethink the movie
now its hard to find anyone whos filling to admit they liked the blair witch project
why do i mention that
because the storys nearly the same when it comes to the near universal praise of nintendos wind waker gamesince wind waker is a zelda game and since the zelda franchise is amazing the wind waker must be amazing too right
right
unfortunately no but equally disturbing is how the gaming community answered yes to that question
they went into a fullfledged campaign to convince themselves and the public that this game deserved a pedestal next to link to the past and ocarina of time
only now years after its release do i hear consistent complaints about the game
below is a list of problems with the game the sailing aspect of the game takes up at least  of the adventure and it is extremely tedious
nintendo didnt even attempt to streamline this process
you can literally set your direction put the controller on the floor and sit back and watch the minutes pass as link sails along to your destination
in order to further extend the playtime of sailing the user is forced to embark on numerous miniquests where many must be performed numerous times through the game
the most annoying are the fetch quests where you dredge the ocean floor for items
yawn are we having fun yet the game consists of only a few dungeons and some of them are extremely easy
important aspects of the game were replaced with timeconsuming fetch quests from the ship the game has an unexploited storyline
i can think of numerous examples of storyline elements that seem like they should conclude in something big but completely fizzle out
between this and the lack of dungeons i am convinced this game was rushed to market i might as well say it the graphics are terrible but otherwise fit the overallquality of the game
the link model is the worst a massive head massive eyes and eyebrows that somehow float over his hair
at least you spend most of your time staring at the back of links head before release we were told that the npc non playable characters were going to be far more advanced than others weve seen in the past
i have no idea where nintendo got off promoting that idea because they are identical in sophistication to those in oot and just about every video game ive played
they certainly arent as interesting as those from majoras mask and ive just grown tired of games where you must constantly switch between the game and an item selection submenu
metroid didnt need this and neither did star fox adventures
id love to see nintendo incorporate something that would minimize this behavior in their zelda games
the problem is especially bad in the wind waker because an entire item slot is wasted on the sail fighting nonboss enemies is extremely easy
just ztarget and swing your sword for a few moments and the green a button icon will change to a green star and flash
press the button when this happens and link does an incredible feat of acrobatics and destroys his foe
it looks awesome but you quickly learn that this ability makes it extremely easy to fight nearly anything
it also makes the game feel like its playing on autopilot and you are just a bystander watchingso this is a review for those interested in twilight princess
whether your itching for a zelda fix while waiting for tp or have played and enjoyed tp and want more zelda ive just gotta warn you that wind waker is not worth the troublethis is the worst zelda game of all time for all nintendo systems
it just doesnt have the charm of the other zelda games
it gets really old and tedious spending all that time sailing across an ocean
somehow sailing across an ocean and link just dont match up
it doesnt stand the test of time like the other zeldas
i played through all zelda games all the way through
heres my favorite zelda games in order  link to the past  snes
ocarina of time  n
legend of zelda  nintendo
majoras mask  n
legend of zelda   nintendo
windwaker  gamecubesorry folks nintendo got it wrong with windwaker
hopefully theyll redeem the magic of zelda with twilight princessi decided to pick this game up but was disappointed
i was expecting alittle more action death coolness but it wasnt there
it was pretty little link prancing around with a little dagger getting the bad guys
if your over  years old i wouldnt even bother
though the fact that it is link with a sword and a well made battle mode i give it  starsseeing the incredible reviews here i went ahead and bought the game to satisfy my scifi gaming urge
i was like the game is older but has great reviews and the screenshotsvideos looked good enough
but i should have listened to my inner voice trying to warn me that there must be a reason that this game never got a expansion or sequel
even though i got the game at a really low price but after playing it for few days i regret even spending that money
anyways here is what ails  doesnt ail meconsrepetitious to the nth degree
you do get to visit different worlds but other than a scenery change the missions are the same over  over
you pretty much fly to a waypoint dogfight with pirates or attack other ships maybe destroy a spacestation sometime you can also mine or destroy a derelict ship to get upgrades for your vessel but in the end all these missions are just variations of the basic premise of a spaceshooter on railsif you want to be a trader or pure mine or find some other noncombat way to advance your character that is not really possible
the game is designed in a way that for you to progress beyond star systems you have to complete part of the required storyline as well as have certain threshold of money
that is only possible via doing combat missions of the main plotsidequests otherwise you will not have enough money or enough progression to move to the next zone
so in all this is atheart a pure action space rpg they are also  npcs at best in the game who you will meet all over the galaxy saying almost the same dialogue and handing you over essentially the same missions just worded differently even though you will be visiting different planets sectors etc
you really cant travel anywhere other than preassigned rooms where the above mentioned npcs gives you newer missions making the game feel confined rather than openworldpros graphics of spaceships stations planets etc
are impressive and holds well even to this day you can upgrade your ship with armaments equipment or buy better ships overtime which gives a decent rpg feel to the game the cutscenes though repetition abounds here too helps propel the story and gives the game that quintessential rpg feelin the end this is a ambitiously conceived scifi rpg yet a poorly executed game
i actually came here expecting a eve offline but alas its more of a action rpg that is designed for people looking for immediate gratificationedit i got my hands on xterran conflict and its the space sim that i have been looking for a long time
if you are looking for a openended single player space simulator rpg with incredible visuals or essentially a eve offline than check out egosofts xseries gamesand that gets old pretty quick with the relatively small universe
i think everyone should just face what this game is
its a repetitive boring gameplayless wreck
you spend more than half the game flying from place to play hitting the f key to jump in trade link after trade link
calling this openended is a total joke
there really are only three things you can do you can be a fighter trader or pirate
the most interesting of course is the fighter
you get missions to do but unfortunately every
single
one
is go here and fight these ships and possibly a base and turrets
you can always buy better ships and the ludicrously powerful hidden ships but doing missions nets in a pitiful amount of cash so youll be forced to start the game being a trader
being a trader defines mediocrity
you travel from place to place clicking buy then clicking sell at another place
this nets the easiest cash so you can buy a better ship of your choice later
the next step up to a flying joke is being a pirate
choosing this occupation serves no purpose
the point is to destroy other ships preferably trading ships and taking their cargo
the cash you can receive this way is pathetic and if you choose this everyone will hate you and you wont be able to dock many places
since the whole idea is to destroy trading ships and hit that button that tractors in cargo this gets old reeeaaaal fast
you cant even dock on the other ship and hijack it even when disabling them
if they decide to make a sequel there absolutely has to be a more personal ship something you can wander around in and for heavens sake it has to be bigger than the teenytiny ships you get even the supposedly massive trading ships are pathetically small
i would also love to see multiplayer done better it would be a godsend if you could board and hijack other ships as a pirate or just to climb aboard someone elses ship or dock on a trading ship to get a free ride somewhere and to act as a deployable fighter escort
rather than acting as a ship it should be more as acting as a player one that can contribute to other players
anything would do
being able to assign roles to people on ships particularly trade ships would be wonderful
a deeper systems management would be great someone to worry about the engine powers and to fix any malfunctions someone to worry about the weapons and the power they sap up and someone to worry about steering
to think about the huge amount of things they couldve done with this game its sorry to see how short they sold themselves particularly considering the development time
next to worthlesskung fu chaos is the game where there are really weird characters fighting each other
i got bored of it in just a few months
basically the game is about when you are trying to get a position of a fighting actor or actress by the director who has been a complete failurethe good things about kung fu chaosthe selection of things to do instead of just fighting you have adventure mode and also a fighting time where you fight about  minutes and see how many people you have killed for the last  minutesthe creativity the creators did a great job of making up places where they would have auditions
falling down a escalator then explodes and all of that kind of stuff
it is very cool what they did with thatthe bad things about kung fu chaosreplay value basically replay value means how long you will be willing to play it
this game has a bad replay value
i stopped playing it in a few months
i found another game and started playing that insteadthe controls when you first play it should be a little bit diffucult about how this game is supposed to be played
instead there are so many controls that you dont know what to do
it took me a good week to understand the controlsthis game is alright for the price
so if you like to play a good fighting game for a few months go right ahead a buy itthis game is pretty silly
i mean its alright to rent to kill time or something but other than that this is for the younger kids around ages  to  id say
or if you have a bunch of family members in the house that are in to gaming its something you can all get into but other than those reasons there is no reason to buy this gamece jeu est pas mal ressemblant a la version de dremacast  pas grand amelioration graphique
aussi le probleme est que l on dois payer us par mois pour jouer en plus de devoir etre inscris a xbox live
ca fais cher pas mal pour un seul jeu
je ne le recommande pas a moins que vous soyez un grand fan de ce jeuthis game is very fun on the dreamcast and gamecube and still fairly good on the pc
i imagine it would be on the xbox as well sadly i dont know because it literally cannot be played without some heavyduty legworkwhen this game came out it required an xbox live account
this wouldnt be a problem except that live for the original xbox is gone
and unlike the dreamcast and gamecube versions you have to be connected to live to even boot up the disc to the main menu
even offline play requires a connectionand when it was working youd be paying around  a year to play online combining the cost of live in the first place and the purchase of a month licenseyes there are workarounds but most involve a modchip or require you to have a linux box
the only one which works at all needs an old xbl account on a memory card or the hard drive itself which are becoming increasingly hard to find considering that no new accounts can be createdi was wondering why the xbox version of this game was so cheap and now i know
thanks to some very poor marketing and design decisions by both microsoft and sega this game is literally impossible to play for about  of xbox users
it isnt even compatible at all with the xbox please unless you know youll be able to play this spend the extra dough and get the gamecube version or the dreamcast if you dont care about splitscreen and episode ii
this is almost worthless even to collectorsthis game has nothing to do with robots and cops
besides robots and cops do not mix
plus if its a game then its a bad game
i hate getting taken by cops and i hate kiddish robot toys
and this is a flawy gameamazon us doesnt list the pc version of this game
but its pretty much exactly the same anywayfirst off i hated how hard it was to stay alive in the first level
i went searching for codes on the internet and surprisingly there is no codes faqs walk throughs help guides nothing
ignore a code that says if you pause the game and type best kept secret it makes you immortal
it does not work at alli managed to find a site that had a download to run during the game that gives you max energy power and ammo invisibility
found at  download that trainer thing
i give it  stars for working flawlesslynow that i couldnt be killed except when i got squished in a thing i was free to test out robocop
i thought the game was pretty good
i played a level each day cause id have enough by the end of each level
i loved getting to level  and confronting ed
the graphics are decent d stuff
the quotes are amusing for a while especially when you kill a good guy and robo says sowwwwwwreeeeehowever a few of the levels i really grew tired of
playing out like a duke nukemdoom kinda game it kinda got annoying on a level down in a mine where you have to destroy all the boxes before a certain door will open
a map would really help navigation out instead of wondering around till you wing it
the levels are too big to become instantly memorable so that you know where everything is in future
sometimes theyre just confusing as hell or annoyingcontrolsthe controls arent that bad
you use your mouse to aim and shoot
the right button can be changed i used it to open doors
you use your arrow keys to move
and various other keys do different things like a zoom feature
or press  on the num pad to make robo twirl the gun around
can you do that dad
graphicscompared to similar sort of games like duke nukem goldeneye wolfenstien ect this ones nice on the graphics in its own way the d graphics look awesome on some stages others there quite boring
tho some stages have had more time and effort put into them
in some stages sometimes you can shoot various things like lights signs cars and things but on other stages there just a graphic
ed looks great but there are some things added for the hell of it i think
i didnt understand what a giant rat in a sewer was about
its like someone developed a rat on their computer and decided to put it in a game just to see what it would look likethe videos look dodgy
im ok with it that theyre just to tell the story
but they looked like they where made and then there was no room left to add them to the game after it was completed so they got compressed to hell to fit on the discsounda lot of people complained about the sound of this game
i didnt complain about much of it
i didnt take much notice of the music the quotes where amusing for a while
but in the end i was just playing without the sound on
it doesnt help with anything you need to dolevel overall the game was ok until the last level
for starters it took me a few minutes to work out what the hell i was supposed to be doing
it seems robo freezes in spot while you wait for the bad robot to climb into his diplodocus neck robotic machine
you cant skip this bit which sux for this reason once youve killed the robot by standing in the middle and shooting at the red things on the neck when its shooting its lasers at you the robot dies it plays a video and then you have disarm the bomb going off in one minute
you walk to  different machines and choose which code you think deactivates it
if you get  wrong the whole lot restarts and you have to do them again
i thought i might find the correct codes out first write them down and then restart the level and get them right
but nope
after waiting boringly for the robot to start up i finally got back to the bit to disarm them and what do you know codes arent the same
that really sux when you cant finish the game without luck on your side
there is no skill i could find to it other then a good memory you just have to be lucky to get through it
other wise the clock runs down and robo says oh s and the whole city blows up
yet some cop is still alive to say i wouldnt want you on my team go back to the police academy then you have to wait too long for that robot to start up again when you start the level again and for me i have no patience i want to get into these things instantly not be made to waitoverallthe game was fun to begin with
i thought it was cool
that was until i clocked it
and realised it has no replay value
once you beat the game there is nothing to do
why it lets you save it after youve beaten it is beyond me cause all it does is lets you see the crappy second ending of a tv report and then goes back to the main menu when you load your saved game
whats the point of that
you can go back and redo missions you didnt get all the stuff for and maybe when you do that and get them all  complete it unlocks something
but quite frankly i dont care if it does or doesnt im done playing it
once i beat it i had no desire to play it again
it was cool while it lasted but nothing to redeem it like other shoot em ups have had
plus something other then walking around shooting wouldve helped the game a bit
like driving boating flying something other then  levels of the same thingsomething that i heard about this game was that they had ignored the movies part  and  and said this was like they hadnt existed
this was the follow up to the original movie
honestly i couldnt tell at all
i didnt see anything that looked familiar at all apart from ed and anne lewis of ocp
so ignoring the fact she got killed in the sequel is reason enough to say that stuff is it
pros decent graphics fun quotes huge levels good controlscons sux without the cheats to stay alive levels can be too big to be bothered navigating no replay value no ending after completion no multi player mode not enough levels needed something other then just walking and shooting all the time needs more guns no spike that thing in robos handi dunno i dont wanna sound harsh but ive played better games
it seems like the path of the superhero games
you read some great prerelease articles then when the game hits the shelves its a major disappointment
 the gameplay is difficult to get used to its like youre in murphys head and you got this gun sticking out from the bottom of the screen
you pan back and forth and when your sensor picks up a bad guy even if hes in a building you gotta aim pretty fast and waste him before he shoots at you or someone else starts shooting at you otherwise your vision turns into a bad tv channel and youre toast
keep this with the batman dark tomorrow gamei previsly got a game boy advance for christmas and also with it came a set with a rechargable battery pack battery pack light and headphones
if the game boy advance is  and the set is  just buy that
it works just fine for me and my aunt save  bucks
the sp isnt going to have seperet games for it so why bother
save  bucks and by the advance and the setthanks again for the sp now i can play all the old games i had
thanks again for this item
the only reason why i gave it  stars is because it wont charge so i might have to get it repairedforget game boy
theres a much better system coming out this month
that can do better than playstation graphics using a graphic chip made by the creators of radeon  and  do mpeg video display jpeg and play your mps bluetooth can be used as a powerful palm meaning wordprocess spreadsheet and so much more features a mmcsd and a sdsdio slot as well as a usb port allow you to use the internet emailetc
can vibrate with gameplay can use emulators giving you access to hundreds of classic snes and genesis games which no other system can do has a bigger than gbasp screen already backlit and has neverwinter nights and tony hawk pro skater  as launch titles
its called tapwave zodiac
check it out
 copypaste it to your address space i think its about time nintendo got some real competition in the handheld department and this looks like a unit worth giving a chance and the only way it can stick around is if you give it support
its nowhere near as sloppy as ngage it has shoulder pads it has a screen thats horizontal and about twice its size it can do better graphics and sound and it doesnt try to have you hold a tacoshape mobile phone to your head like an idiotthis is a very cool item i have to admit but i already have a regular game boy advance
me personally am not going to buy it cuz i have an advance already why spend  for just a cooler look i dont mind the regular advance
i say wait untill the price drops to buyps
go  freewebscomtroyscoolsiteive only played the first  boards so far
however thats enough to know this game is worth only  not the shooting action and killing action are fairly bad
when you shoot you dont get the sense that your doing the shooting
it feels more like your pushing a button on a controller which is activating an animated gun on your television screen
the same is true for when you hit someone shooting them
when you hit a bad guy they just fallno dust blowing off of their jackets or blood
if you played and liked medal of honor or the oldies like  goldeneyenor perfect darkn then you will be disappointed
i consider realistic gunshotsa sense of recoil and power coupled with good sound effects to be the most important element of a good st person shooter if that is bad then there is not much worth playing forotherwise the graphics were just ok  nothing to right home about
controls were decent learning curve pretty short minoverall this game brings nothing new to st person shooters
it would have been better if released in may   if your thinking about buying this i would definately rent it first or just dig out goldeneye from your archivesim assuming the pc version is a whole lot beter because i keep seeing rave reviews for the pc
if you play this on ps and are raving then i would guess your only about  or  years old and never played the games mentioned above beforewolfenstein is a legendary frachise
first appearing on apple before the time of the macthen atari dos commodoreid software picked up the ball and wolfenstein d became one of the first fps first person shootersleading into doom quake and the rest is historytides of war is an incredibly ugly flat lifeless colorless and borish game
the graphics relative to other xbox games of its era simply do not measure up
very dissapointingquake engine
not the bestthis game has way below average graphics and sound
it has no real storyline
its like an old doom game which were alright then but should be much better now
the replay value is nothing great
avoid this and go for any tom clancy stuff or halo or many other shooters over this one
what a dissapointmentforget game boy

its nowhere near as sloppy as ngage it has shoulder pads it has a screen thats horizontal and about twice its size it can do better graphics and sound and it doesnt try to have you hold a tacoshape mobile phone to your head like an idiotmaybe i didnt get far enough into the game to be blown away but what i played was boring and frustrating
the controls were difficult to use and after expecting something amazing the gaming event of the year i was very let down
the visuals are great but thats about it
if i wanted great visuals id go see the filmat first i found myself throughly enjoying enter the matrix but after just  or  missions i realized that gameplay consists of a simple pattern walk into a room kill everyone there next room same thing end level
sounds like alot of games but enter the matrix really just doesnt have enough to it
the cutscenes between missions use the actual actors so the game is really good for filling you in on the parts we didnt get to see with reloaded sadly though thats really the only thing the game  has going for itif you really like the matrix its deffinetly worth a rental but a purchase
id have to say no
it gets boring very quickly not worth your  bucksprosengaging fun cool looking combatsweet weaponscutscenes with the actuall actorsconsno real substancelags at times on pc and even on the consolesfar too shortway to linear no real environmentsit has always seemed strange to me that japan dominates the video game market both commercially and creatively
all of the major companies originate in the land of the rising sun
completing a game rewards the player with usually a visual feast and without exception a credits roster filled with japanese names
now im sure there are several great games that i dont know about born and nurtured here in the great  but it is a fact that although americans consume a vast amount of this sort of digital entertainment we actually produce very little of iti write this because one of the most hyped and anticipated games of  enter the matrix was developed primarily by an american software company shiny entertainment and the end result is well quite dismalfor the most part
the game has sold in the excess of  million copies as i write this yet the popularity stems more from its connection to a certain film franchise than anything exceptional about the actual productactually i take that back
in couple ways enter the matrix is a visionary unprecedented first for video games
the wachoski bros filmed an hours worth of story exclusively for the ingame cinematics and these really are the games shining point revealing background information for the matrix reloaded and in some places adding substantial character development for the lesser players of the story
enter the matrix also contains an interesting hacking feature where one can tap into the fundamentals of the game change stats watch movies unlock multiplayer ability etcbut as for the actual game itselfwellpros focusbullet time fighting a very cool technique where one can slow the action down and gain an edge
the one and only feature of the game that is smooth and enjoyable additional story for reloaded a movie i personally loved  watched three times in the theater
the fmvs are of the same caliber as the movie though with a lot more talking and a lot less action with two notable exceptions seraph and the ending trailer decent voice acting and a nice soundtrack being a mix of don davis compositions and current breakbeat artists like hybrid crystal method rob dougancons poor graphics
comparisons to the ps are not far off and given this games budget it is astonishing how cheap and rushed they sometimes look
the characters are blocky move like robots and overall are poorly rendered as opposed to their reallife counterparts
the background details are flat and uninteresting the weapons in the great hall a toylike plane etc
and the ingame cutscenes are downright embarrassinggood camera angles weak visual representation poor gameplay
this is the real sticking point for me
of the entire game i only enjoyed playing one level the chateau
the fight levels tend to be overly long and repetitive airport post office sewers and the objectives for the missions range from dull get from point a to point b to thematically stupid rescue companions like ballard who later takes on seraph without much difficulty
driving and sniper sections are exercises in frustration due to the unbelievably awkward play controls loading times
why
its not as if this game is breaking new ground or even pushing the envelope in terms of graphic density level length and so forth
the rumor of some missions being shorter than the actual load times is correctoverall enter the matrix is a tremendous disappointment
given the opportunity the story of the matrix presents there could have been so much more than the halfbaked result
my suggestion rent and record the movies and wait for the upcoming games which will hopefully improve upon this demo effortok yeah this game looks great yeah it has good controls  yeah the moves and combos and slow motion stuf is all cool
but
the fact that every level is the same thing over and over again is totally boring all you do is beat up and kill cops over and over in each level it gets a little old after a few hours of that
every once in a while you get to fight an agent other than that its pretty much just beating cops up and shooting themthe game is way too easy as well levels are too short and the story is not interesting
every once in while you get to drive a car around and get away from cops and you guessed it shoot themthis game is only entertaining for about the first few days then it just gets repititiousworth a rental but in my opinion not worth buyingi am a huge fan of the first and second sequel to the matrix
this game was almost a complete disappointment
the first thing that really sucked is that you dont play as neo or even morpheus or trinity
now you tell me how you can make a halfdecent matrix video game without our favorite characters
the slow motion features were pretty cool
some of the levels were really bad but some were alright
the game is pretty fun to fool around with and beat a few times but the storyline is terrible
its like a little bit of matrix reloaded but changed around a lot to make it bad
i thought it was very disappointing but if it wasnt called the matrix video game and it was another whole thing i would like it much moreive stopped playing it three days in
while the environments and sound were nice the character graphics were pretty bad
the movement of the characters was suspect and im not just saying that because i hate games where i have to use the thumbstick to move my character at least in vice city i get the option of using the directional pad vs the thumbcracking joystick these characters moved pretty uglythe targeting system was nonexistent and illogical the driving portions of the game atrocious and the ingame movie footage while superior and meaningful not worth the hassle of gettig form one piece ot the next especially at the price most people will pay for it getting it out the gate
the hacking section was a good idea but in the end fairly pointless
unlocking the multiplayer was cool until you realized that the characters you coudl fight with in these new environs didnt have the quotfocusquot bullet time feature enabled so they just did regular kicks punches and throwsall of which by themselves was not up to industry par in a game with this much buzz
being able to do real combos would have been nice as opposed to the smash the buttons and see what happens fighting engine were pretty much subjected toill be returning my copy because of the games many bugs ps versions have been freezing while playing niobe about halfway through and there is an incessant sound echoing in some of the cutaways and because of its atari pitfallesque replay value
what it does right it does very well movies the focus feature but when it misses it misses hard
practicaly all of the gaming elements that are the real reason why you bought the game have been done better in other games
its pioneering in scope and license relativity but the game  the reason why people are sitting in front of this thing  failsto ataris credit this game was a bit fun
you could do neat little tricks like cartwheeling while blasting away your enemies cool hand to hand combat moves and of course do it all in slow motion
but the fun ended shortly just like the gamethe game quickly got repeditive
there was only a small number of moves in your aresenal and once you used them a couple of times it got boring
and like the fun the game stopped as abrubtly
i finished the game in one afternoon then found out you could play as another character which was stupid anyway because the gameplay with different characters was only mildly different at best usually only a different setting and then beat the game again the same afternoon
the multiplayer was boring because it was only hand to hand combat which got old fastoverall the game is somewhat amusing for about a day
not much more fun after that
theres no replay value iun the game not an ounce
and to top that off the coolest thing you can do is run on walls at r e a l l y s l o w s p e e d s  honestly atari can do a little better than thati wanted more out of enter the matrix
not some simple kiddie game rated t for no reason
i awaited for this game in the gr gamerevolution where i work mail box so i could snag it
but i snagged stuff
the game runs level based like usual and gives you two options for players ghost or niobe
they each have the same missions except for car parts
any way the graphics are poor for the gcn
the focus button is the only cool part of the game
the like of different fighting skills is making the game boring
you dont even get to keep your guns every level
they should look at turok evolution for help with that
all the missions sound hard but tend to be too easy even on hard
shooting people or beating the stuff out of them is cool but lacks
some enemies even get stuck in the wall
ghost got stuck in the wall
that is weird
to die just stand there and throw grenades at the ground
you cant die because the swat
cant shoot
well have fun watching wour mash of polygons run around
scare you laterok this game was fun
easy to get into
every technical aspect of this game was extremely flawed
the movies were laughably horrible the clipping was bad graphics were not good
the gamecube version requires the swapping of discs after about  hours of play
the unlockable multiplayer dont read this as a good thing was so bad that it literally came down to whoever mashed all the buttons faster won every time without getting hit
the levels ranged from the eerily easy kill everyone to the frustrating protect good guys to the downright evil run from agent smith
no the run from agent smith level is not cool
if you even get within a few feet of him he slams you to the ground repeatedly until you die
the last few levels flying the logos are the worst part of any game in the last decade
i seriously wonder if any of the other reviewers bothered to play this game before reviewing it
this game had definite potential
given another six months im sure the guys at atari could have come up with a real gem but this game is worth a rent for the scene in which monica belluci and jada pinkett smith kiss
nothing morei am very pleased that i rented this game instead of buying it
im not too big of a matrix fan
i thought the first movie was great and i thought the sequel to be kind of a flop
the game enter the matrix in my opinion follows the second movie down the same dissatisfying path
to be fair the graphics are great and the kungfugravity bending gameplay is unprecedented and fun to watch
the action moves you can perform play like some of the fight sequences in the films
unfortunately the action combos and the wall walking gets old really fast
after about an hour of doing the same martial arts combos and jumping over bullets i began to grow bored with the gameplay
i found myself doing the same thing over and over follow the trails shoot the same guards do the same moves
there is no variety in this game
you fight and easily kill dozens upon dozens of generic swat cops and security guards
you easily get an autolock on your target jump through the air and shoot them over and over and over level to level to level
gameplay is much too linear and the lack of any sort of rush coupled with the same recycled orchestral music playing in an endless loop left me wanting more
the game didnt convey any real get up and go
just the same bad guys for you to kill in different rooms
in summarypros great graphics great gun and explosion sounds exceptional gameplay as far as manipulating the environmentwall walking bullet dodging etc agents are intimidating and fun to fight clever interposing between gaming and movie clips gives you a better understanding of the matrixcons poor lighting and shadows total lack of variety from level to level recycled enemies and recycled musical score resulting in monotonous levels of easy shootemup gaming unchallenging combat interface enemies are weak and predicatble lacking any sort of surprise tactics or skills equal to your ownif youre a fan of the matrix and are just dying to get any sort of matrix fix before the next film then you will probably make this game work for you
if youre a first person shooter fan looking for anything to bridge the gap from now until halo  maybe this title will keep you interested for a night or two
 its no miracle in action gameplay
allow the river of hype this game has generated to float to the wayside with the rest of the garbage
worth the rent not the buythe girls jada and bellucci kiss
that is cool
once you see that just stopjust to let you know how awful the controls are on the xbox version the fire button is the little black peripheral button
no not the triggerthat little one you use for your lights in halo
god
the genius who configured this mess ought to have his shins slapped by baseball bats all day long
this whole game is about as responsive as a plastic sled on gravelbut the chicks do kiss
that is and will always be coolive loved the first two movies of the matrix and got this at a swap meet for a couple bucks
the reason im playing it so long after it open was because many scenes tie directly into the movie
we dont see the whole story in the movie but had to play the game to get why something happened
i dont like this because that leaves two sources to go through to get the movie
the game was rushed to market and there are many and i do mean many glitches and bugs in game
many levels are just your characters walking through a hall way but heres the kicker
the game controls are old school
one analog stick controls your character
that leaves the camera in automatic and yes there are times you cant turn around to fight an enemy behind you
there are some glitches like the sewer flashlight thing that can be worked around
you cant move forward without the it
yet you cant pick it up
shoot some rounds off of your mp
the waypoint arrow is slow and deceptive
it doesnt point to where you really want to go and when you get there resets to another location entirely
the games graphic and content is okay and the cutscenes adds to the experience of the movie
i am very frustrated playing this defective game because of the research online to find ways around the bugs
one review in a game magazine said it best
the only thing complete about enter the matrix is that its a complete mess
yes it isit gets bad
not just bad but monotonous
there is little variation in the game and as far as fps and other shooters i have seen this is a messdriving the cars is difficult
there are endless shootouts and running and running did i mention running
through long levels that just become so boring you could fall asleep
there is little variation in the levels the lighting is bad and the sound is dismalsparks your operator is so whiney and cant act very well
jada pinket is hot and fun to play 
the rest of itthere are glitches and the so called clues and fillins to the movie the matrix reloaded are so nominal nothing you could have figured out yourself that you dont really miss anythingi am surprised at the warchoski brothers
this game is so crummy and buggy and the story is so dull and disposable
you wont miss anything if you dont play this one
not a thingpros bullet time music gets you in the rhythm of the game blowing up cars in the car chase sequence is a fun distractioncons repetitive cannot strafe
how do you dodge bullets in bullet time if you cant strafe
 graphics on xbox is very poor looks like they took the lowest common denominator of graphics and just cloned it for each platform rather than chosen higher resolution textures or applied antialiasing bullet time effect does not show up in cut scenes camera gets in the way of the fight scenesrecommend playing bloodrayne instead and enable bullet time all the time
you get much more satisfaction of seeing bad guys getting diced up into tiny little bits in slow motionsomeone got me this as a birthday present  and im glad i didnt spend the money on it myself
if you really really like the matrix im sure you will enjoy the game but it is pretty easy and the plot line is almost nonexistant
some of the slow motion moves are fun  but they get old after awhilebottom line  save your money for something betterthe matrix
a great movie
a grand movie
enter the matrix
find the exit quick
fortunately you can be told how bad this game is you dont have to see it for yourself
this game is a dissapointment
the movie was so great hype surounded the game it came out people were fooledbad graphics  glitches  bad control  bad gameif you have twenty bucks then simply buy a tom clancy game splinter cell ghost recon or for ten bucks more get halo
but please please save your trouble and stay away from this game
please dont be fooled
and if you dont believe me rent itwhat i liked  at least the graphics were goodwhat i disliked  wheres the fantasy drafti cant edit players which is particularly  helpful for young prospects
thus hank blalocks ratings will stay around  in other words hes useless while blue jays ss chris woodward has a power rating of  he may have  career home runsa player will either post ruthianlike numbers or he will be completely inept
with the devil rays i played about  of my games up until the allstar break and aubrey huff posted  while the rest of my team managed a batting around  with only  more home runstry to create a player and you quickly realize that there is a  character max
for first and last names i was left with rocco baldelithe dynasty mode could be more ambitiouswithin the dynasty mode there is a rookie draft where the only power hitters are second baseman and the center fielders are slower than the catcherswhen pitching the fastball is rarely effective unless it is out of the zone
this is quite an anomaly considering many pitchers can touch  mphi recommend renting the  version before buying
i certainly will as this game sucksthis game is hard
there are  missions which are bland
as for replay value in single player mode it really isnt there
quotbut you can stealth killquot there is little motivation to stealth kill once you get then you get a new ability
there is really no story whatsoever
it also gets a little moronic when you have to fight a bunch of undead
pretty soon you just stop fighting real people
it is kinda retartedas i said just now enemys are stupid
the ai is terrible
then the monsters my gosh the creativity partment is lacking
demons are terrible at doing anything
then there are a bunch of wooden robots
what
wooden robots
apparently wooden robots die when you slit their wooden throats
its almost as if the creators got bored because i did
the stealth kills are alright thoughenvironments suck
the game is pretty much stealth kill ahoy
sometimes it is a little moronic when enemys give up after  seconds of searching
seriously
they will literally stop looking for you after a couple secondsafter you do some bland areas the game isnt so bad
it is still not a worthy investment though
let me break it downprosstealth killsninjascooperative modeconsbland levelspathetic story linehorrendously moronic aistupid badguysive played all the other tenchu games to date and this one is definetly better than the second one they tried to pass over as a game ahwile back
but it stops there  there is nothing really new here at all
this game is very similiar to the first tenchu in many aspects but not new in many at all
controls and sounds are pretty close  with some new powerup moves and ways of rewarding the stealthier ninja playersone thing i can not stand is the fact that there is no savepoints in the game
you screw up in the middle of a level or how about falling off a cliff at the end of a level and you can just kiss your min of perfect stealth kills goodbye cause you get to start over from the beginning oh what joyif you liked the first tenchu  this has the same basic formula and will not dissapoint
if you like for developers to expand on ideas and actually try to improve their games look elsewhere
this is a graphics update and story change from the first tenchu in a nutshell
decent game great idea with the stealth kills but bad design descisions for the player to enjoy themselvsgood graphics great concept great story immersive gameplay  all of this completely ruined by terrible uncontrolable camera angles
to me it wasnt worth the  dollars i paid for it on ebay
all they had to do was fix the cameraunbelievablethis is not a review that is going to compare this quotgamecubequot version with the quotpcquot one
this is about quotthe simsquot
lets face it its not for everyone
i realize that there is a huge audience for this type of game
and i tried and tried to be apart of that audience
i just cant get into it
why do you have to control an icon instead of the actual characters
the game even with the quoticon controlquot would be better if you could get close ups with the camera
why click on a radio or tv
you should be able to walk right up to it using your anolog control stick and simply pressing the quotaquot button
i can only assume that with the massive amount of memory it takes to create a game of this magnatude is in fact the reasons for the complaints i have about the inability to control your characters in the way i mentioned above or have better camera options
i didnt like the option to remove the walls
this option was created due to the bad camera angles
its like lets have a button that makes the walls disappear so that the player will be able to see their characters at all times
im not digging that at all
i also think that the quotblurquot is tacky when your characters derobes
with all that being said and a few unmentioned problemstwo stars for quotthe simsquoti have rarely if ever played a firstperson shooter this bugridden and thats too bad since the actual gameplay while its nothing original is pretty good even if the plot is seriously lacking
but you can only find so much enjoyment from a game that kicks you to your desktop whenever it feels the urge or forces you to endure horrendous scenery glitches
what could have been one of the years sleeper hits in the genre is wounded by its own severe lack of polish despite all its beautiful graphics realistic physics and its awesome assortment of weapons
out of the box quotdevastationquot is devastating and you as a gamer should never have to pay to beta test
wait for the next genre offering to come along instead  there are plenty looming on the horizonive played myst games and scratches and although the first  myst games were without the degrees turn myst  and  had  degree turn in the game
the reason the first  myst games did not have  turn was that they came out in the early s
this game did not have that and i was expecting it to have it mainly because its a recently new game that probably came out last year or so
another thing is i just didnt care for this so i returned it for a refund
sorry to be the only one here who didnt pick up interest in this oneatmospheric and spooky at least at first
i like this kind of game but found that i certainly didnt have to try very hard to uncover clues and solve mini puzzles even before the real mystery presented itself
before i knew it half the game was solved with very little effort
i thought the story and setting were intriguing though the ending was a bit abrupt and unsatisfying
i enjoy a good lengthy hunt so was basically disappointed with the ease i was able to piece together the overall mystery and solve it
this may have something to do with the small area avaialable to search since the entire setting is fairly confined
though i rarely judge a game by its length alone i must say that just as i was starting to get interested in the mystery and characters it was over i honestly couldnt believe it
some of the inventory items werent even necessary to finding the intended clue
im not completely disappointed but think ill just pass this on to my ten year old who may have more fun with itthis game is probably the first and probably worst of the still life series of games
i can find a better way to put this
the graphics are very good
there are no graphic glitches
but that is probably the only good thing that can be said about this gamethere is absolutely no suspense
you can easily figure out who the possible culprit is well in advance of the revelation
but we dont even have to go that far
for one thing the conversations are so long and boring and sometimes pointless
in other words there are plenty of things that the player can talk about with certain characters but none of them lead anywhere
you will figure out in the end that you just wasted your time for nothing
the other thing is if you figure out midway through a conversation that it is pointless you cant end it quickly and get out
you just cant get out of the conversation and reload the game to an earlier point
that is so damn frustratingall this is very much unlike the later still life games
there the conversations were short sweet and straight to the point
nothing like that at all in this
the ending of the game was rather vague
they make you wonder what exactly they are implying there
it could be any number of things
in other words again the closing scene was also not a straightforward one
the only thing that is really clear to us is that  spoiler alert beware  hellouin is proven innocent and he and mcpherson are having a conversation about what some people will do for power and wealth
as for bebe handing over a copy or possibly the real head of the baphomet to that lunatic loisseu it is unknown what they are trying to point to us thereand please tell me why bebe does not have a french accent while every other french character in the game does have a french accent
she is clearly a frenchwoman who had never left france yet she speaks american accented english perfectly
all this makes you wonder if they made this game in a hurry
i gave a full five star rating for both the still life games
i cant possibly give even three stars for this game
it surely does not match the standards of those two games in my opinion
this game is worth playing once
so rent it if possible
dont buy this game unless you have a lot money to wastei was captivated by that game for a couple hours when i started playing then i merely played it because as an adventure games fan i had to finish it and at least see the endthe atmosphere is pretty good and the story is ok if youre not sick of games involving the templars
if it werent for the canned unskippable dialogs i would have given this game  starsafter buying this game i went back and read the negative reviews more closely and it seems to me that they are generally correct
i have loved x games since i played the first civ but this game leaves a lot to be desired
i get the impression that the designers were really focused on having a good ai which is nice but along the way they left out a lot of other things which was not so nice
galactic civilizations seems much more like an experimental prototype for a later more sophisticated release rather than a fully developed game in its own rightone thing that is completely missing is the ability to improve your territory
this is normally a big part of x games and i never really realized how important it is to game play until now
during the course of the game you colonize planets and each planet has a simple quotquality scorequot that generally varies from  to  all planets of the same quality rating are exactly alike in game terms you dont have some planets that produce a lot of trade resources other planets that produce a lot of minerals and so on
they are all just quotgeneric planets of quality xquot i think this might have been acceptable maybe had this game come out in  but for a game released in  this is just not sufficient in my opinion
the interface is also not that great sometimes it would be nice to able to use the keypad for maneuvering your ships rather than the mouse
however they didnt include keyboard shortcuts for commands so you have to constantly switch back and forth from the mouse to the keyboard or just give up and use the mouse constantly
also the game lacks many customization options for example you always play against the same  alien races no matter how large or how small the galaxy is and you cant turn off quotfeaturesquot like random effects that can have a huge effect on the game
there is no multiplayer option which was puzzling a couple of years ago when civ  came out without multiplayer but is almost unbelievable now
finally despite all the talk about the quotnoncheating aiquot the fact is that the computer players start out knowing the location of all the good star systems while you have spend quite a few turns stumbling around trying to find good spots to colonizealtogether i rate this as something of a disapointment a good ai in search of a gamei used to be a fan of uo but now its just not worth it the gameplay still keeps its goodness and thats why i gave it  starts and not  but the servers are getting worse and worse and now its just not worth paying  bucks a month for a game that is laggier than diablo  dont get me wrong this is a good game with good gameplay and great fun but the lag is destroying it
if they decide to fix the servers i will bring my review up to a  if they make the game free but keep the laggy servers then i will only change it to a  because that would prove that electronic arts are just too lazy and dont care enough about the players enjoyment of the game to fix anything and they would have basically just give up on the gameif you want a free online rpg with less lag then get diablo if you want an mmorpg with little lag then get asheerons call asherons call  or dark age of camelotas a rather big fan of comics especially x series this is just another in a long line of disappointments
i have never found a marvel game worth the  you shell out for it
if you really must have this wait a few months or find it used
i gave this  stars because the graphics are pretty nice but thats where that ends
if you are a hardcore fan then maybe this is for you but if not just wait or go get something elsei got thinking it would be a great game to play and to be able to control wolverine
its not
sure you can use your claws but youll find yourself not using them most of the time so you can regain health during combat
you see there are two main ways to regain health on this game finding health icons and pulling your claws back in
when your claws are out it does a little more damage to the enemy but you also wont regain your health
the combot controls are sloppy and hard as hell when youre facing multiple enemies
you basically tap x or whatever attack you want to use over and over and hope youll get a stab at them which is very hard to do
its also hard to jump away from the enemy which is also very frustrating
when you hit someone enough times strike will appear at the bottom of the screen
at this point you can ko
them if theyre weak bu if theyre strong youll probably end up losing the fight
youll die over and over again in the same part and get frustrated and if youre like me just put down the control and leave the game alone and never play it again
the graphics basically suck
no other word can describe them
they look like something from a nintendo  game
this game had potentioal but not enough belief in it from the creators
i hope they make a pyros revenege but make it goodthe original splinter cell on the xbox simply blew me away with its aweinspiring graphics and gameplay
the gba version is a bland d side scroller that doesnt even come close to th of the fun of the xbox version
the graphics has some kind of industrial overtone that just looks awful and sam fishers missions just look ridiculous in a d environment because the stealth factor just isnt there
the gba version is also quite short so if you absolutely have to play the game rent itfrankly i am surprised by the lack of disappointed buyers of this software
this is the second action replay ive purchased from datel the other being the action replay max for ps and this is also the second time i am supremely disappointedfirst ill say the good things
this action replay is tremendously more friendly than the armax for my ps
while it is impossible to enter new games and codes on the armax or hell even codes for games that are already there it is very much easy to do so on the gamecube ar
the second is that the interface allows for easy accessand thats pretty much it
thats all the good things i can say about this package
my first problem with this ar is that there is no easy way to enter codes
if you make a mistake then you have to use the cstick to go back but the damn thing moves ridiculously fast
the other problem is that if you hold a then the letter you inputted will repeat itself
why put this in
there is no code to which this would be a useful featurefinally my second and worst gripe is that there is no convenient way to input codes
i am not one of those guys who buys a cheating device and is content with the codes already there
i am an avid gamer who looks for the best possible codes so i am constantly typing codes in
the problem here is that some of the best codes are extremely long
for example the resident evil inventory editor code was  line long and it nearly killed me to put it innext the other problem is with the included memory card
it is completely unstable
when i first used the ar i was so happy that putting cheats in actually worked that i made the horrible mistake of forgetting that i was dealing with datel
by forgettng this i had also forgotten to back up all the cheats i created
so what happens
the memory card gets messed up and i had to reformat it thus losing all my cheats including the  line re code
i kept in mind what happened and decided to reinput codes for ssbm debug codes of course
what happened
i forgot i was dealing with datel again
what i was going to do was backup the codes after i was done inputting it
well when i was done i immediately turned off the gamecube and turned it back on with the lid opened so i can backup on two other memory cards
my day was completely ruined when i discovered that the action replay memory card needed reformatting againfinally my last gripe is that datel has the worst code hackers ive ever seen
they have simple codes like infinite health unlock everything and stuff like that but nothing truly special
by special i mean codes like the debug code
for those of you who dont know debug codes allows you to have complete control over a game
for example in super smash brothers melee you could use a debug code to play six players melee
and here is where the problems lies
you will never see datel input codes like that
this is why i recommend people to go to other action replay code sites such as gscentral or action replay central
dont bother using datels website it is slow and uselessoverall datel is probably content with what it has because it has a complete monopoly over the cheating device market on the gamecube
there is no codebreaker here to challenge its dominance
gamecube players are stuck
datel also released the action replay max for gamecube most people dont know this on their website but it sucks just as much as this one
the only difference is that it has newer codesi honestly wish that pelican would release their awesome codebreaker device on the gamecube but currently there is no plans for that
i recommend the action replay only because it is an excellent device to bring out the most out in any game but i also recommend getting the max drive with it
the max drive will update your cheats quickly
of course this product is also made by datel so who knows
not to mention it is also wildly expensive
if you plan on not buying the max drive then for the sake of your sanity save your cheats on a regular memory cardi went out and rented true crime after i saw its commercial
i have to admit the commercial made this game look like the next and maybe even greater than grand theft auto  i had false hopes
true crime is terrible there is no reason for you to buy this gamefirst off everything is way overexaggerated the figting the shooting even the gameplay
some of the moves you can do in fighting are a little bit too matrixesk
and its always the same thing run into a room fire off a gun fight with the leftovers
and when youre driving the car you can goup on two wheels who can do that
on top of that you fight a dragon and i quote from a gamerhow is fighting a dragon true crime
and hes right in no way does fighting a dragon have to do with crimetrue crime is one of those games you beat once and then leave it on the shelf to collect dust
there is no replayability because all of the suprise is gone also it just gets friggin boringoverviewfun  this game is very redundant and quite boring after a little while of playgraphics one of the best features of this gamesadly
all because you can drive over  miles of lagameplay  a little on the stupid side as i mentioned before too repetitive and the camera angles screw you updifficulty  fairly easysome parts are harder than othersoverall this game is not worth  i doubt it would be worth  this game could have been awesome but it seems like the makers lost sight of what they were trying to do after they made the first  minutes of the game
nice concept crappy deliveryif your interested in a game like this i reccomend grand theft auto this game can be comparred gta vice city but no helicopters or motorcycles and the music could be better
but the storyline makes up for it the classic cop seeking the truth to what happened to his father
the guns also are good the upgrade are ok and the fighting is fine
but one draw back is when you are fighting a major boss you cannot use your guns
the best part is you cannot die
but if you are looking for a replacement for gta this is not your game
if you want a roaming game or just a way to releive tyou stress go on a killing spree this is your game
the senless violence and language aside i do not really understand how this game revived the rating that it did
there is no blood in the game expect for the final movieeveryone including me was thinking that true crime would crush the afforementioned titles but they were wrong
dead wrong
in attempting to seamlessy blend in elements of max payne dead to rights and grand theft auto they forgot several thingsstory replay value and controls
the replay value consists of playing as snoop dogg
whoopdestinkindoo
the controls while arent the worst kind of controls they definitely should have been tweaked better to outmatch gtamp or dtr
the driving isnt bad but it certainly not going to beat grand theft auto
the fighting is very weakdepending on buttonmashing more than skill and the moves are extremely slow unlike dead to rights which requires actual skill
and finally the shooting
the aiming is cumbersome and will require patience and a keen eye
plus it rips off both dead to rights and max payne with the slowmo dodge but fails to outdo either one
also is it just me or does every pedestrian fight like theyve spent time in a shaolin temple
believe me youll be in tears when youre getting kicked by winos and martha stewartslookalikes
the soundtrack is supposedly made up of rap songs
im not a big fan of rap or snoop dogg
however only the rock songs are the good songs on here
now aside from all the nitpicking ive done there is some good here
the shooting system allows you to pick up  guns at once for example you could have an m in one hand and a shotgun in the other  which is kind of fun
one thing the driving does have on gta is the ability to aim inside your car which is neat too
the graphics are pretty good
the voice talent consisting of christopher walken michelle rodriguez and michael madsen is interesting to hear
unfortunately the bad outweights the good
if youre smart youll either rent true crime or go and buy max payne dead to rights or gta
they may be slighty older games but theyre definitely a lot better than true crimewhen i first heard about this game i was expecting a gta rivalry but what the heck this game turned out not that good at all the main character says the dumbest things and the gameplay isnt even that greatso if you like gta i cant guarantee youll like this but its still a fun game
the graphics are pretty much the same as the getaway
anyway youre playing the character of an annoying asian guy whos mean as hell and somehow passed the psych evaluation test to become a cop
the game is definately a knockoff on the whole gta series yet its not as addictive or fun
the gameplay isnt really a freeroaming thing its set up like the getaway with levels where you can free roam but you have a certain place to be you just dont have to go there which is what i prefer to do
since youre a cop random crimes will pop up on the map such as rape gunfights carjacks illegal street racing
these are the most fun since you are free to do what you want when dealing with these crimes
a car chase might lead to a wreck and then youll be chasing the perpetrator on foot down the sidewaks as he shoots back at you hitting innocent pedestrians making the police experience very entertaining
theres different ways you can deal with criminals such as holding up your badge
they might drop their guns but if theyve already downed a few uniform cops theyll probably ignore it or run
you can also take your guns out and shoot a warning shot into the air
at this theyll either break into a run or surrender
one interesting and innovative feature is that while driving you are able to shoot out of the window ahead of your car at the car youre chasing
this usually leads to popping the tires and then going for the gas tank
also for incar and onfoot fighting you can use bullet time to focus as the fighting is pretty fast and its easy to get quickly shot to death
one of the gimmicks of this game was that it was a fighting shooting and driving game
id have to say the worst would be the fighting mode since its just too annoying during the story mode
you could just pull out your guns and shoot the people yet you are forced to fight them
one of these instances is a very pointless fight in a hobo house with hobos that are harder to fight than your brother who knows kungfu
the driving is probbly the second worse since its so unrealistic
i heard that the damage would be really realistic yet when you hit a tree you dont even slow down
it just fades away
the shooting is really cool though since you can go to a semifirstperson mode with bullettime and aim at a person possibly just disabling them instead of killing them outright
well the game would be at my house if it was cheap but it really isnt
this xbox version lets you put in your songs and it is actually cool to hear your music play at random during fights and driving
buy at your own risk i take no responsibilitysonic is not all about the speed
i wish the developers of sonic advance  had understood that
the sonic games for the megadrivegenesis were all platformers that relied as much on exploration and tactic as speed
there were hidden treasures to be found to reward you for exploring the welldesigned levels as well as considerable challenges facing you on your way
sa feels more like a roller coaster ride a fun one but ultimately thats itthe basic level in this game is thus
you start with a countdown to go
 at which point you take off at lightning speed unless you try to stop
its impossible to explore
even if you try to take but a few steps to explore for hidden treasures you usually wind up triggering a hidden springboard that propels you down the nearest slide thus far out of reach of your previous area
how are you supposed to find anything in a game constructed like that
the levels are designed with speed in mind not gameplay
i have turned the time limit off just so i could explore the very first level for a port to the special stage
and after almost an hour of searching id finally had enough
that was just the first stage too imagine how hard the other ones must be to findthis game is all about the speed
its quite obvious
the faster you go the bigger a bonus you get at the end of a level
all boss fights take place while sonic is running and i admit that that is where the speed is an innovative feature building on the first robotnik boss battle in sonic  knuckles
for every other robotnik fight you rescue one of your three companions cream the rabbit tails and knuckles the echidna whose character is completely negated by having him been duped by robotnik again
the short cinema screens after each of these battles are a welcome touchin fact where sonic advance  shines is in its style
there are a lot of interesting courses my favourite is an ice world with a city in the background set during the night
there is also a fascinating hitech zone and of course robotniks death egg whose battle is the toughest before getting to the final boss
the music is quite good but not inspiring or memorable enough to compete with other sonic soundtracks
the final boss battle consists of all of robotniks battles in one go plus a very final master robot battle which in a completely contradicting fashion brings you to a full stop
its ironic that the games final boss should finally wipe the grease off your shoes but therein lies the challenge suddenly you must revive your precision instincts from the sonic classics
you might say its too little too late thoughthese are the games best points
sadly sonic advance  doesnt allow you appreciate it to the fullest because it just hurls you on at too much speed for you to be able to
its a game ultimately lacking in any depth to be really rewarding to play
speed is not what made sonic great and his games cant sustain themselves solely on that  sonic advance  is proof enough
the previous title sonic advance has a far better idea on what made sonic greatfor the graphics capability of the gameboy advance and the quality of sonic games that origionally appeared on the sega genesismegadrive this one was badly put together
just like the first sonic advance this game has you running around loops and slopes so much that you hardly run into any of the adventurous level layouts that sonic team so well thought out when creating sonic games for the genesis platform
im an advanced gamer and i found myself dying way too often in this game mostly from running sonic into bottomless pits
this game is a passmy family and i loved the movie finding nemo and i finally got around buying this game for my son age  the other dayunfortunately he has had to call me into the room repeatedly to help him get through some of the levels
he gets frustrated and visibly upset surely all that adrenaline isnt good for kids
and it was making my heart race too
most of the sections hes on level  involve a race of some sort or going through d platforming mazes think crash bandicootsome of the graphics are truly excellent but not for small children
there are scenes with bruce the shark chasing and trying to eat nemo and dory as you navigate them through minefields and in the sub
the music sounds pretty threatening toopersonally i love ps games aimed at kids eg
ice age  curious george the spyro series etc
 but this game is repetitive and aggravating
fighting against the current for some of the games makes it difficult and frustratingwhich is decidedly unfunwhat r u guys sayin out there someone said in this review game that it was dumb i only bought it cause raw  and  i hate microsoft blaa blaa blaa
shut up kid other kid said that it was soo fun awesome best wrestling game ever nooo u stupid kid nooo noo no you guys dont know what your talking about this game was worse from raw part  for god sakcs the guys dont even look like the people off of tv raw  had better graphics cause they acauly look like em in raw  atleastdont get me wrong raw  sucks blows one of the worst games ever but raw  is worse u cant walk up the ramp sucks
i dont even know how to climb the cell
plus it looks all cheesey anyways
the camera veiw not with that now its turned like it is on tv i understand there trying to make it real as posible but the camera veiw sucks like that in a wrestling stick with the original camera veiwand my god please fix the controls and the secials and the meters that your staes go up all  of them r at the bottom  plane out dumb plus the kid that says microsoft sucks is a dumbass
why r u on the computer then its microsoft jackasshey i say stick with raw one even know that blows too
im not usully like this in a review but this game sucksssmy name  is charlie v look at more of my reveiws at need for speed back yard wrestling wwe smackdown  wrestlemania x games that r cool like thatok im gonna keep this simple this game is a waste of money raw  looks wonderful but it plays like dog poo
those giving this title  stars and over must not have played the thq n wwe games or are simply giving this game high stats for the characters and some decent models
this game is loaded with horrible glitches
its almost hard to believe that thq allowed this sloppy choppy game out the door
when the computer has a player down theyll repeatedly proceed to do a routine number of stomps and pins the players character is left stunned for a few moments after being pinned so theyre basically left lifeless to the computer
also on tag matches when the player has an opponent pinned their partner will often at times leap into the ring and stomp the opponent down on the mat pinned breaking up the pinfall
seasonal mode was a good idea but was executed very poorly
the player is given choices to make during matches but very few of them are carried out with the exception of resting during matches and end up  unsuccessful
with no dialogue or voiceovers with the exception of the chanting from the crowd and the refs the game just doesnt make the player feel like theyre in total control of the action
i often at times spotted my enemies intefering in my matches only to later find them helping me along to win the match
also when the referees count for the pin they take an eternity
creating characters is pretty fun there are some wonderful outfits and designing arena lighting for characters is a blast along with custom soundtracks for theme songs the player can create a ton
as of to date raw  may very well be the best wrestling game on xbox however thats not saying much
the game feels very rushed and when all is said and done raw  is simply a disappointing game that had high hopes
best if settled for a rental
however if desperate to own a wwe game on your xbox its probalby best to own a used copy of this game or wait impatiently for a better installment to arrive in the future on the xbox
the games just not worth fifty bucksthis game is a waste of the wwe license
while it couldve been a good game anchor decided to use the license to sell an unfinished gamethis game is just bad plain and simple
i dont want to list every bad detail because itll just hurt my brain to write it out
ill just give you some big failures awful story mode flawed gameplay very lousy game music slowmoving wrestlers and extremely stupid computer opponents
theres a way more list of bad things to be listedthe only good thing about this game is its graphics
theyre nice
thats it
nice but no where near as good as smackdown here comes the pains graphicsits no surprise that this game dropped to  bucks in a few short weeks
ill let you know this the price drop does have a meaning this game is awfulthe game star wars attack of the clones swac picks up where star wars episode  left off  a massive battle filled with droids and clones and jedi
the story goes on from there to tell of the unearthing of a sith artifact that could destroy the republicin the game you play as obi wan anikin or mace samuel jackson
there are a variety of vehicles to pilot hover tanks landwalkers droid tanks speeders and assault ships
and while all of that may sound like a lot  the game actually feels pretty constricted
through most of the game youre doing the same three things straffing firing missles and occasionally zooming in on targets
the exception being on  missions where the emphasis is on racing in your speeder which is pretty coolalthough the cutscenes are pretty nice the rest of the graphics are subpar
the sound is pretty much straight from the movie but youll get annoyed at hearing blasters all the timethis game is a fun little distraction
i beat it in about two days on the medium setting  which is not a long time at all
so if youre a big star wars fan check out this game at your videostore and save your money for a better gameme and another friend were a little tired of playing halo online and needed something different to play
nothing ive found so far has been able to beat halo
i saw this game and was interested because it was a star wars game
the back said that it was multiplayer so i picked it up
i soon learned that multiplayer doesnt mean that me and my friend can play this game together on a split screen
there were a couple of multiplayer games we could but not through the story mode and not online
why go through the trouble to put just a couple of multiplayer arenas on this and not make the whole game  player compatibleso i tried it online to see how it played
i was not impressed by it
it seemed mostly that the person that could hit the fire button the fastest was the winner
no real strategy
seemed bland and seemed to be missing something
it was the same feeling i had when playing mechwarrior online
it was fun the first couple of games but just had no substance
ive probably played over a thousand games of halo online and i still find it to be a fun experience
at least you have to think and use strategy a littleas for the story mode
it was pretty bad also
the graphics seemed ok but the voice acting was pretty bad
also i could have really seemed to care less for the story
the whole game just couldnt hold my interest
really wish i would have waited for it to become a bargain game before i bought itthis game has absolutely no replay value
theres nothing more to do after you beat it unless you count the xbox live version which you shouldnt because that itself is pretty bad
you are able to unlock a few things like new multiplayer stages videos and a quotcd playerquot songs from the game classical music mostly
the videos are just the ones from the game though and although theyre xbox quality theyre really not worth it unless youre some extremely hardcore star wars fan and cant miss out on the storyline
if thats the case i feel for ya
if not get a different game or dont blame me if you find yourself trying to sell it right after you beat it which doesnt take long at alli realize mine is not a popular opinion but i think the silent hill series is the weakest of the more popular survival horror games
i love all the fatal frame games and most of the clocktower and resident evil games but something about silent hill to me was a promise unkept
it was rich in atmosphere and very little else
quite a bit of pounding these mutant creatures to a pulp with a plank too
sure there are clues and inventory and you need to work out a story but it all seemed so secondary to the chilly atmosphere generated which eventually wore off
in my opinion it lacks substancei was actually pissed i spent money on this
the movie was good even though i hate tom cruise  but this game was just crap
this was like a wanna be metal gear
honestly the very first level shows how much this game is lacking
the weapons were crappy and the whole game just overall supplied nothing
wasnt original wasnt fun and sadly the graphics were junk
sorry kids this games no goodi bought this game expecting a ghost recon type game with better graphics and more options
i find however that it is not much like ghost recon at all
gr requires tremendous patience and success is largely based on equipping your team properly and mostly positioning them in strategic locations
with gr you can move almost anywhere you want and attack targets from any angle
in ghost recon you can control any player but in rb you are stuck with domingo chavezi find that rb is more of a shoot em up type
enemies appear seemingly out of nowhere and you have to shoot quickly
the choices of where to go in this game are much more limited you pretty much just follow down the assembly line and shoot who pops up
in ghost recon one enemy bullet can often kill you but rb is more of a health meter type gameas for the graphics i was sorely disappointed
neither enemies nor your team look very real and they all move with a skittish toofast shamble that looks really odd
play ghost recon look through your rifle scope and study the detail on your fellow soldiers
you will see camo patterns triggers boot laces camelbak etc
try that on rb and you will see a black shifting mass with a playdoh facei do like the huge weapon selection and is something i wish ghost recon had more ofmy final summation
maybe it is a fun game but its not what i was hoping forhey i nevr played this but roomers told me that the first one was better on evry system and some stuff wasent good
figures its ps tipical ps when will they ever learn xbox is better redemmer on xbox is way better sorry if i spelled the name wrong
people said it was short soo i know thats its better then way ward every one at my gamestop said that and so did my magazines my magzines gave a like a  out of ten and way ward like  out of ten haaa ha  lol
thats funny stuff and they said the graphics werent  as goodso get redemmer on the xbox its more money cause its better plus theres a hot girl on the cover its alot better then this sure it may be short but the first won was too long and too hard if u save with one life u keep that next time u load the game and if u play two player co op mission mode u share the lives too hard and too long i got rid  of it today cause i stoped playing it
i always forget about hunter redmmer and way ward for some reson when im at the store they just slip ym mind but if i coulndt find a game and i had  bucks redemmer is way worth it not way ward controls suck on way ward too i heard the only thing way ward has thats better then redemmer is the title name its easer to spell and say but thats it folks
i give this two stars cause it sucks
v naa for lifeyou can make your own game in d  not this is not final fantasy x looking but it is basicly just rpg maker  in d which is not saying much there are new features but if you play rpg maker  you know what your basicly getting but its in d ce jeu est trop repetitif  tout le monde sur xbox live prennent la meme auto et c est repetitif
considerant qu il y a pleins de jeu d autos et pour moins cher je n acheterais pas ce jeu
les graphiques sont pas mieux que d autres dans mc
j aime pas ce jeu car c est tres noir et on vois pas ou on s en va et tout le monde use les cheat code
je ne le recommande passorry fellas
im a extemely hardcore dbz fan
i cant believe i dont appreciate the game
the only times i play this is if i got like  mins if im waitn on som
ill start this up
play it for the mins and they shut it off until im so desperate to play it again
the only reason this has  stars is because of all the characters
it was fun to actually use kid trunks goten  the hidden pan  supreme kai
and all the other characters that werent included with budokaione of the worst things about this game are the ki beams
they are a little tiny energy ball
even when i unlocked the secret super hyper spirit bomb i think they could have left out the hyper
the super hyper spirit bomb usually killed one hit
but the big bad super hyper spirit bomb was still a small little orange energy ballanother bad thing i know it isnt that big a deal but it was just hard to get used to the voices
they werent from the english shows
they used the japenese voices
it just felt weird to here goku talk and sound like kid gohan from the showanother bad thing is when i unlocked the ultimate ssj thing for gohan was that i had to press like  xxoo r r gt lt gt lt   square square
i had to do that in like  seconds
just doing it one time gives u a blister
and i think they could have been more creative with that ssj thing
i mean
gohan just looked like a normal super saiyanalso when i unlocked ssj vegito
he was called ssj super vegito but he looked normal
when he transformed into ssjthere was no ssj or  for him his hair turned red
what is up with that
graphics control    err what was the kameamea
x x o r l l r in  secssound   errr i cant member
if there was music i tuned it out
voices stunkcharacters   oh yeah
i love gotenks ahwahwhhahatotal for this game on a scale of     took me a long time to decide between   and dont buy this unless you are a dbz psycho that steals cable tv just for dbzgot the original japaneese version of this game a long time ago its not that bad of a game as the name states its  dbz characters including everyone from goku to super majin buu no kid buu
basically  characters from each of the dbz seriesgame is a simple d fighter with a basic d background
unless they totally redid this game and given the price of  they probably just did a quick translation its nothing to write home about
each character does basic kicks and punches with some special moves here and there and all characters have a variety of projectile attackscharacters can levitate or fly or fight on the ground and you can toss projectiles if your opponent is either above or below you
pretty simplefor the price this game isnt too bad
chances are if the kiddies are knee deep in dragonball stuff they will add this to their collection so thats ok but there are better games out therefighting feels pretty basic and it doesnt take long to figure out how to block just about anything the bad guy throws at you
theres a buildup mode where you take a fighter and as you win fights you level up and get stronger with a longer health bar
you can take your fighter to your friends and duke it out with their fighters
kind of tomagotchieskjust remember you get what you pay foralso depending on how much this game has changed there should be a code to unlock  extra characters
young goku from dragonball mr satan akahercule and  others i cant remember as i write thisi dont play any computer games but i thought this game would have been the bomb on the box because it recieved such great reviews for the pc
hmmm i was completely wrong
this game is really hard and i dont think that the xbox controller makes the situation any better
i think that strategy and puzzle type games are better for the pc because you can at least use a mouse to aide your playing
if the xbox had a mouse available for some of the games i think that this would have been a really sweet idea for the xbox but since the controller has enough flaws as it is i think this was a bad decisionsorry rct shoulda stayed on just the pc i only give this game two stars on the xbox for effortim a big fan of theme park simulations and these can be fun even on consoles
i have played theme park roller coaster for ps jurrassic park operation genesis and this gamethis game which includes the  pc game is the most detailed park game on a console
however the graphics just arent up to date and it is especially frustrating to manuver the camera to see what is going on in certain angles
also the controls are rough to use because there is no keyboard
between the squinting and the tough controls this game just isnt much funi did not have these problems with graphics and controls with the other two console theme park games
theme park roller coaster in particular was fun and had an easy to use interface
unfortunately that game was easy and kind of limitedid probably recommend jurrassic park operation genesis among existing console theme park games although that game is also easymaybe we can hope for roller coaster tycoon  to be ported to xboxill admit that this game is surprisingly deep
many characters a somewhat decent story line unlockables
its a clean and smart fighter through and through
but its repetition and stingy controls bite me every timewell deserved for a d on rails fighter but not for everyonesoul calibur ii for game cube is a buttonmashing fighting game that is adored by nongamers and despised by gamers
the story mode is the worst story mode of any fighter in which you fight the same characters over and over across a long map of dungeons and areas
it is more busywork than it is fun
the moves are executed through buttonmashing with the exception of a few throws that each character has
only my nongamer friends like to play this game as it only involves buttonmashing and not actual skill
i let them beat me at this game whenever i have parties and invite them over because to win at this game would mean i have to play this game with my entire group of nongaming friends
of course i can win because my hand is something like  times faster than their hands or more and i thus can buttonmash much faster than them clobbering their characters one by one until my arms and hands are buffed out with my veins popping out
plus i enjoy seeing their astonished faces when they beat me because they know that i am an actual gamer
it is glorious in that they feel like that they can accomplish anything now since they accomplished such an incredible feat in beating me
my true gamer friends despise this game
all in all link is welldesigned in d and can whoop any other characters butt especially after he gets the fairy sword however thats not enough to keep the game interesting for gamers but nongamers seem to adore itthe best part was some of the extra challenges in this game
the rest of the game unfortunately was awfulthe cutscenes and some of the gameplay graphics arent all that great
some of the story missions can be fun but for the most part kind of boring or way too hard
and in the case with the bruce missions just downright annoyingi wouldnt recommend this game at all
in fact theres another hulk game out there that really lives up to what a hulk game should be and its not based on the recent movie incredible hulk ultimate destruction
almost fully destructive environments more unlockable hulk abilities and not only that but its fun to play
just roam around destroying things and increasing your abilitiescombosthis game honestly sucked like the movie if you liked the movie then buy this but the graphics is bad and the gameplay is fakelooks good decent sound effects
bruce banner however talks way too slow and sounds like he rides the short bus
anyway i got bored with it in about  minutesyou got to be kidding me
it took  years to develop this game when it carries the same basic principles as the first halo
atleast gta series is different in many aspects as apposed to this boring title
first off the game is way to easy
hardly any changes in overall game play
this game is  hype and  joke and  fun
second ive run into graphic and image overlays and significant stutering during game play
graphics are improved but still very much similar to halo   i was able to find this game for  at a local computer store
its not worth it
maybe  or possibly a rental but certain not for a purchase
if you look passed the hype the game is nothing more than halo  packaged as halo   with this joke maybe the rumors are true that ms may back out of the gaming environmentnext to fable this game was the disappointment of last year
go back into a few video game magazine archives and look at what these guys promised us but didnt even come close to delivering onthe game is so terribly flawed and mundane that it makes the first one look even better than everand to make matters worse they went all hideo kojima metal gear on us and made us play as one of the covenant
this is the second dumbest idea in video game historynext to of course kojima making us play as not solid snakethe multiplayer is cool for about ten hours but after awhile youll be longing for the comfortzone provided by the original halo and if youre like me you may weep at the thought of what this game could and should have beena painfully average game atbestbut definately not halo overall
 for fun only because of the multiplayer modesi loved halo
from the moment i picked it up it spoke to me like no other game ever has
and ive been playing video games since pong
for  years me and my friends would spend every weekend playing online using xbc
even with all that game play it never got boring for us
normaly when i play a game and beat it it then goes to the shelf to sit next to the rest of the games to collect dust
even games that are fun to play online have never kept my attention for more than a couple of monthsso when i tried out halo  i was vastly dissapointed
i felt like i was playing another sega of the unreal franchise
master chief has new low gravity jumps
multiplayer now has gravity pads
you no longer take damage when falling from up high
part of the strategy of halo multiplayer was using objects to break your fall
the new weapons that i will talk about shortly make for a much faster game with a spray and pray feel to it
i thought i was buying halo
had i wanted unreal i would have just bought unreal
part of halos charm for me and many others was the fact that it wasnt unreal or quake
it was a skill based shooter that stood on its owni had a few problems with the campaign mode
it was very dark compared to halo
i dont mean sinister just dark
not very many bright sunny days in halo  it was rather short
and they did things with the plot that i could have done without
but even with this said it was alrightthe major problem for me is the multiplayer
the multiplayer is where replayability is a huge factor
when my friends and i played halo for  years we didnt sit around playing the campaign over and over
the main problem are the new weapons
they have removed or changed every single weapon in the game
the weapon that made halo what it was the pistol is no longer
this wouldnt have been all that bad but no good substitute is offered
they said that they did this for balance
but when everyone has a pistol there isnt a balance or overpowered issue
after all you need some weapons more powerfull or you might as well just only have one weapon for the whole game
now they have a sub machine gun as the mainstay
its a very weak weapon with a very short range
so instead of playing and shooting and having fun i now have to chase people down to get into range
that or wait around for a couple of minutes for a decent weapon to spawn
the plasma rifle no longer freezes an enemy
the physics of the rocket have changed and the splash damage has been reduced
the grenades have been toned down to being almost worthless
even the sniper rifle is a little different
there are a couple of new mid ranged weapons but at mid range youll be lucky kill your target in a full clip
the new weapons worked fine in multiplayer but dont translate for multiplayer
by making such a severe change in the weapons they also made a fundemental change in the game play
it is no longer a mid ranged shooter it is now a short ranged shooter
this is another reason it gives halo  that unreal and quake feel
halo  offers duel wielding where you can use a single hand weapon in both hands
this was a novel idea and tried with other games before
the problem i have with it is that most of the weapons seemed toned down to force you to use duel wielding
you cant swing a dead cat around without hitting some ammo for a duel wieldable weapon
but any medium range weapons youll be scrambling to find ammoand there are a couple of new vehicles
they are fun but my problems are in the changes to the vehicles we already had
now you can board vehicles and they take damage
no more shooting a person out of a warthog as it drives by with your flag with your spawn weapon
now you pretty much have to blow the whole thing up
good luck
and well timed grenades no longer flip them over or stop them
now youll just do some damage to it instead as they drive by
and a persons shields are directly involved in when the vehicle is destroyed
you could shoot a rocket launcher at a wraith tank and wait for the persons shield to recharge
well after  rocket launcher shots you would think it would be ready to explode but no
running someone over in a vehicle is much hard
i have hit people head on and simply bounce them off my vehicle about  feet without killing them
boarding a vehicle is a novel idea but a good player wont get into range of youi could go on and on and on
all i have to say to end this is try it before you buy it
they had  million preorder sales on the first day
not because halo  was good but because halo was good
those  million people hadnt even tried the game
i too was one of the unlucky
i fell for the hype and thought bungie would make a quality game worthy of the name halo
i was wrongthis game is a matter of comparison
its sp compared with its predecessor is complete garbage
you get about two levels in and you start to wonder why you are still holding the controller
if you want to keep up with the story then play the sp game and pay close attention as it is rather complex
if you dont plan to get h and finish out the story line then you probably wont have the patience to finish the gameas for the mp it is better than the first one
which is not to say it is good as the balance factor is terrible battle rifle plasma pistol rocket launcher and sniper rifle  thats it the only worthwhile guns in the game roughly in order of importance
the only more unbalanced online shooter i have played in recent memory was 
well 
halo overall it is only valuable as a segue between halos 
otherwise avoid it its not worth the timeafter playing the game with my cousin and reading the online reviews i would have to say that this game pretty much sucked the big one
omg bungie what the hell are you thinking putting this game out there after we the buyers had to wait  yrs to play
i mean dont get me wrong the graphics the voiceover and the weapons were awesome
but the ending
come on now i saved up big time to get this and had preordered months in advance to receive the game of the year please
the original halo beats this one in to
also i didnt like playing between the convenant and as master chief
pick one side and stick with it
they should make it like this first play as master chief then after beating the game as a human give the option to play as the convenant or maybethe flood
oh bungie if youre reading this make an ending that the gamer will like and not one the blowsi was one of the many that preordered halo  because i enjoyed the first one so much
about me and seven of my friends bought it at the midnight release and went to my buddies house where we played it all night and my friend and i beat the coop storyline around  or  the next morning
there were some things i liked and hated about the gamestoryline if you played the first one the storyline is lacking and really straightforward
you play the hero fight against aliens and save humanityearth whatever
for the second one when they released video clips it made it sound as if the aliens found earth and are attacking it and you master chief were turning earth into a crazy urban war between humans and aliens
its been a long time since i played the storyline actually the night of its release was the last time but you only end up fighting on earth for the first one or two levels i use the term lightly as halo has no real levels
then you end up going into one of the alien ships or something like that
you also get to play as one of the aliens which i found to be rather fun but also a played story gimmick as this has happened in other games as well
the ending was very dissapointing as it just left you hanging and wanting more and hoping there was actually more to the story left
bungie could have done a better job and made the story more developed and the game a bit longergraphics ive read a lot of reviews saying that the graphics are awesome but i didnt see a great deal of difference between halo and halo  however i also didnt play either game with hd cables on an hdtv
they used the same engine and just added what seemed to me a polishing effect to the levels and characterssound i love the music to halo and i was happy to hear the music back in halo  also the human and alien voices are fun to hear
the multiplayer firefights and single player firefights are wonderfully done as it helps to make you feel like youre actually there in the gameweapons i was dissapointed in the weapon selection as there seemed to be no imagination to what they did with them
humans have a sniper rifle so lets give aliens a sniper rifle
humans have rocket launchers the rocket launcher now targets and follows enemy vehiclesnice
so aliens need a rocket launcher
the plasma rifle was given an unneeded change as it no longer froze your enemies in place to circle around them and hit them in the back which made the rifle now another useless weapon in your arsenal
i enjoyed the sword in single player but in multiplayer was a very frustrating weapon to fight against
in single player the sword ran out of charge after so many hits but in multiplayer it lasted the whole game which was a very annoying thing
if youve ever played halo  multiplayer you know what im talking about
the pistol was toned way down but with few updates they gave it some power back but was nowhere near the horror like the first
grenades were the most and saddest thing they changed in the game
i loved grenades in the first one and ended up using them more than anything in the game
so when i played halo  the first time i couldnt wait to throw my first grenade and when i did i literally freaked out
master chief dropped the grenade right in front of me and when the explosion happened i was still alive
they turned master chiefs powerful throwing into a toss or drop and the explosion of the grenadewell lets just say i might as well have been throwing waterballoons at the aliens with the damage that one of those did
the last thing they did was duelwield which was a nice feature but the balance of duelwield and other weapons was crap
the duel thing couldve been left out and was a much overhyped featurevehicles like i said with imagination bungie seemed to be lacking in that department
humans have a tank and a warthog so lets give the covenant a tank and warthog
i know i know the covenant tank was in the first one but could you drive it
nope
i liked the fact that vehicles now could be blown up and that you could kick people out of the vehicle and take it or if you were crazy like me you could jump in a warthog with an opposing team driving it thats always fun
i do wish they would have given you the option to turn vehicle damage on or off
in multiplayer you would destroy the warthog and a few minutes later they would have a brand new one waiting for them so that was annoying too
the last thing they changed that i didnt like was i couldnt run over people anymore well you can but its a  in  shot that youll actually do itphysics engine i hate the physics in halo  one thing that made the original halo so fun was playing warthog basketball in blood gulch or blowing up a ghost over the middle of sidewinder and watching it flymultiplayer multiplayer is chaotic and can be fun but  of the time if youre not playing with a friend it is frustrating to hear people cussing you out making really annoying background sounds etc
the addition of team chat only wouldve been really nice
most of the upgrades they did to the multiplayer levels were nice and done really well the name changes werent really necessary though
i liked the setup for the xbl matching i just wish that the players had more control over what levels weapons radar and such would go on during the game instead of the premade matches that counted to your ranking that you ended up playing over and over and over and over again
also the hacking and modded xboxs that you would play sucked too that was neither bungies nor microsofts fault but did hinder the fun of the multiplayer experiencevision change for the longes time i couldnt figure out why halo  seemed visually different than halo  one day it hit me i was playing multiplayer and was running around getting pwned as i usually did in halo  and i realized the levels were closer to me than in the first one
i realized the developers went for a tunnel vision view instead of the periphial expanded look as in the previous one
in halo when i walked around i had a periphial view and the levels looked so much larger and massive
in halo  however they give you a more narrow view and make everything seem closer for a more unreal look by unreal i mean like the unreal seriessingle player exploration this is one of the things that made the original halo so awesome
my friends and i would spend countless hours in the single player mode going to areas we really werent supposed to go and do things that were absolutely fun and crazy
you could actually get online and see things people would do and it made it all the more entertaining
in halo  they controlled the areas that you were not supposed to get to by putting skulls or i think in one level there was a huge ball or something
that made me lose the appeal to actually go and explore the level like i did in the first one
now the developers want me to go find these hidden places that i wasnt supposed topuhlease
so to sum it all up the cons seemed to outweigh the pros for me as an avid halo  fan
the lack of vehicle and weapon imagination physics engine change tunnel vision with the short and dissapointing ending storyline made the rush of halo s release makes halo  an average to below average first person shooter experience
halo s multiplayer is fun with friends and the added detail in the levels makes it more tactical and visual treat
if youre looking for a game that has a good story and imagination this is not the game for you but if you just wanna play a fun shooter with some friends its not to bad of a gameit only gets  stars from this dissapointed halo faneverything that was great about the first masterpiece of halo is destroyed in this game it has lost all of its creativity and should have never been released
it has hard hard controls basically redicouslously dark places and its just highly over rated
do not get it this game sucks
the only things good about it are  being the covenant and having better graphicshalo  the sequel to bungies much hyped halo is here and its being hyped
but i will be true so i didnt like this game
there i said it
hate me fanboys
heres whyon the  side great multiplayerif you have xbox live youll love this game
great soundthe music and sound effects are perfecton the  side bad graphicsi bet youre ready to slap me but they arent really that impressive and during cutscenes they often glitch
bad gameplaydualwielding is a ripoff that you will never use due to not being able to throw grenades
there is also a major imbalance in difficulty
easy and normal are pathetically easy
heroic and legendary are mindbendingly difficult
really bad storyim ready to cry
i fought through wave after wave of covenant and flood and all i get is a cliffhanger ending for my troubles
come on bungie
the game was short enough you couldve easily ended the story and moved on to a new series
this is all a plan to make me buy the xbox  isnt itoverall while halo  has great multiplayer it fails at delivering a decent singleplayer experience but it does do what bill gates planned
xbox  will suceedhalo  perhaps the most over hyped sequel of all timethe game fails to deliver on anywhere near the level the first halo didsure it adds a few nice features but it takes away far more and some of the old bugs are still thereitems can still slide under others and mysteriously vanish
marines now sometimes vanish even in mid combat and not by being destroyedthere is a far shorter campaign game than beforethere are a lot more times where you just sit and watch an uninteruptable cut scenesome weapons have minor improvements
the battle rifle is arguably superior to that assault rifle due to the scope and the small burst fire but for serious action it is deficient to even the old arthe pistol has had its scope removed and is weaker than before as is the shotgun and with lower ammo capacity as wellthe rocket launcher has a virtually useless tracking feature which turns so poorly it only makes things worsedual weapons can be marginally fun but you lose the use of grenades which are still ridiculously limited to  of each type as if your suit had special pockets for each type or something lame like thatvehicles are nice in a way now that they are all destroyable but they took away the damage indicator so you now have to guess from the appearance which you rarely see well enoughto sum up the game seems more like an advertisement for halo  or xbox live than anything elseof course the multiplayer is phenomenal with this game if you are lucky enough to have the online service hooked up
otherwise i felt that this game was not stacking up to the fist
the graphics got a major overhaul and look better than halo but halo lacks all of the huge and epic major battles that we saw in halo
this game would have done fine if it was just another shooter but it surely does not offer something comparable to the original
you play as a covenant and can wield the cool sword
the game is fun but the dissapointment of not meeting the expectations for me from the first game left me no choice than to view this game as just another shooter
ive played the first game with a friend cooperatively on each difficutly setting all the way through and every time i am blown away by how action packed exciting and hair raisingly edge of your seat challenging the very end of the game was when you have to make your final escape
halo had a very easy cliche and unmotivated boss battle with an ape with a hammer
i guess everything is explained in the special edition dvd in which the developers explain that they either had to cut tons of content for time or money purposes
this game maybe was a little rushed
it gets  stars for being like just any other shooter out there and another  for leaving me wantng to play the original morei just completed the game after somewhere between  hours of total gameplay over the course of two days
i feel cheated out of  dollars
i havent yet tried the multiplayer aspect of this game nor xbox live but the story mode was not worth it
i recommend this as a weekend rental the missions are nowhere as interesting or dynamic as they were in the first game
as another review mentioned much of the levels are corridorstyle involving fighting in tight quarters which gets old fast
i kept playing expecting something better but the only thing that came was the credits and the end of the game
though i havent played on it i think this may be an attempt to push live because the story mode seems prematurei like the ocasinal shooter game
halo  is one shooter game for me is not fun
i didnt enjoy this game as much as i would of
the graphics are amazing but the controls were too hard
if you like the first halo get this game
but ill get day of reckoningthe legendary level is way much harder than halo   the game is also boring i quit playing after a couple hourslet me summarize this game for you its repetitive
it gets oldyou will run around in circles for hours and hours trying to kill each other
around around around and around
if that rocks your boat like it does thousands of xbox gamers then feel free to buy this
where is the substanceone other point i am tired of hearing people refer to other games as this is a halo rip off this is a halo rip off guess what
halo is an unreal rip off it stole every concept it has from unreal tournament
so put that in you pipes and smoke iti gave it an extra star for the graphicsif you must have this type of game id wait for doom iii
at least its a gory adventure game besides a fpsgrand theft auto vice city is as you may know one of the most lauded computer games of all time and you will find no shortage of enthusiasts singing its praises on amazon
while there has also been a great deal of negativity about this game and moral condemnation it has usually been from people who dont much actually play computer games and from many who did not take much time to see what this game is about or understand its context
that doesnt mean these people are entirely wrong but it does mean they are mostly wrong and actually one of the very clever things gta vice city does is actually lampoon the hypocrisy of its critics
this along with some excellent music is done on the games brilliant radio stations that play randomly in any of the cars you steal
i was a little surprised that the in game radio was perhaps my favorite thing from the gameanyway thats a pretty wordy preamble
you maybe just want to know what i thought of the game so i wont go into an essay on morality in computer games
ill tell you what i thought
i thought the game was all kind of a joke which is fine just it was a mean joke
its meant to be played as a mean joke
i didnt like that so much
from here ill just rank it according to some categories i devised reflecting issues important to mestory  c  never very great in computer games but taking that into account it was pretty nicely done ridiculous at times  the free roaming thing integrated well with it you sort of intersect with different lines of the story as you like  still linear dont know how you could have a story without that but like i said its all a bit of a mean joke and i got tired of it
i cant say how well it developed as i only managed to play about a quarter way through this gamecharacters  c  clever very well voice acted colorful types but completely lacking in any emotional connection whatsoevergameplay  c  here is where i really expected this game to be so great but was surprised it wasnt
the variety of things to do was good driving shooting very different kinds of missions etc but mainly i never much liked the shooting stuff
i thought it had a stiff jerkiness to it found it unnatural and not as good as an average shooter
the city was neat but i never felt like it was very satisfying like you could really only be a thug and thats it
i guess thats the point you could do a lot within that just there wasnt any feeling of richness or depth just breadthgraphics c  again disappointing
i was expecting something terrific but was surprised to find that though the city was beautiful in its way the character modeling was pretty unimpressive and seemed sort of out of date even more so now
the stylish cartoony characters of the box are not a fair representation of the more graceless figures in the gamedreariness factor  d  personally mugging people and shooting and vandalizing and stealing my way to power kind of brought me down
it was nice to do it by the ocean thoughtechnical issues  did not have problems
thats just melearning factor  c  the game helps you along pretty well with a whileyouplay sort of tutorial
but quite a few things youre left on your own to figure out and controls for keyboard on certain missions like an awful remote control helicopter were very difficult to learn and handleproduct materials  d  a good example of stylish but sort of useless
just tell me in detail about how things work and about controls and stuff
all too often in pc games i get either almost no info or like this a bunch of setting the stage
cute but uselesschore factor  f  see belowdifficulty  f  yes i am all alone in this maybe but most games are too hard
difficulty levels are gods gift to a diverse population
especially useful difficulty levels
this had none whatsoever
some things you do are easier some are hard and since there are no in game saves you i have to do them over and over from the startgame saves f  no
there are these save places you can go to or you can sort of lose a lot of stuff and just come out of the police station or hospital but either way creates quite a bit of tediousness often involving a bit of a drive just to get thereother if the concept of this game sort of leaves you cold but youre curious because its such  a well reviewed game i really say dont bother
if it sounds hilarious to be a rising young tough driving around miami in cars you stole i do sincerely recommend it
it totally got the whole weird pulp fiction gangster movie amoral thing pretty wellafter careful consideration i think im going to have to go against the masses and say that this game was really kind of dumb
i was expecting a lot better
this was my st gta game and the lastsure its fun to drive a carmotorcycleambulance as crazily as you can and run over people
sure its interesting to run from the police for awhile
sure its different to fly a chopper
but really it gets kind of monotonous
quickly
after running around the town millions of time and failing some of the same missions buying weapons and killing people on the street for money you just find yourself saying whats the point
oh one thing though kchat is hystericalhave bought every installment of high heat and have loved it
this version is simply terrible
if i wanted a console port i would not buy a pc version
the lack of mouse support made the totally unintuitive menues even more difficult
two out of the  games i played crashed and one was the only fun game that was in extra innings
the player graphics look like arcade models and really do not look realistic
some of the player animations are entertainingfor some reason the game would not take the pitching imputs from my sidewinder often requiring more than five attempts yes my sidewinder was calibrated and works fine with other games
this interrupt the game play and is very frustrating
this has happened in past hh versions but seems worse in this onei felt angry and insulted that i was given a console game in the guise of a pc game
i am sad that they have ruined an outstanding franchise againive never considered myself a realtime strategist
since westwoods seminal dune ii ive beaten about every major rts on the american market
yet game play hasnt evolved enough to sustain my interestsame goes for turnedbased strategy though ive been clicking next turn since the original civilization
these too have stuck by the formula with insufficient innovations to maintain replay valueso when pc journalists began to herald an rtstbs revolution last year i took notice
developer big huge games and game zines alike trumpeted a game to bridge the gap between the excitement and mechanics of realtime war games with the scope and sophistication of turnedbased empire buildersfolks i am still waiting
in the meantime i received big huge games rise of nations beneath all the hype its a disappointingly conventional rtsltbuild and they will rushgtfrom the getgo its necessary to sort game from advertisement
favorable reviewers all around have gushed some variation of the following
ron is a sophisticated rts
ron is an epic rts
ron is a hybrid between rts and tbs game types
ron is a sophisticated epic hybrid between rts and tbs typeswhile i havent tested these claims online my singleplayer conquests invalidated these claims
ron rigidly adheres to rts tradition
gameplay confines to the b principle build bases build units blow up
the developers include a riskstyle conquer the world mode which offers raiding party actions but otherwise missions are solved by building a base amassing resources and then smashing a computercontrolled base with a large clumsy army
like most modern rts games ron offers rudimentary diplomacy research and economic features to upgrade your forces
likewise it offers a choice of combatants distinguished mainly by military power and texture skins variations
finally ron arrays stereotypical unit types and superfluous gimmicks like most rts games the player will quickly learn that building a bunch of tanks and rushing the enemy base works most of the time
ron rushes with blizzardstyle play mechanics founded back with the original warcraft
players use a central building to generate labor units units who mine a small range of archetypal resources from battlemap hotspots and typically hoof them back to the central building though ron mercifully permits players to build collection camps onsite
players then spend these resources by ordering labor units to build factories laboratories and fortifications around the central building
each has its own build queue for military units andor unit upgrades as wellbases are not sprawling welldefend affairs as in the westwood model
fortifications lack sufficient range and hit points while costing too much to build discouraging basecamping and encouraging aggressive play
one usually wins by destroying selected enemy buildings
a unit population cap per player constrains their entire infrastructuresfrankly i find this gamestyle dated
that doesnt stop big huge games from trying to adorn their product with trappings of the turnedbased empire genre
ron notably introduces a library of additional building and unit upgrades
this library also improves caps and modifiers for resources and improves the next notable introduction national borders
national borders act strictly as a weapon by inflicting attrition damage on any enemy unit or building caught on the wrong side of a shift
per civilization a number of wonder buildings unlock special powers and modifications
and the players can advance through levels of technology called ages
bhg emulates stainless steel studios in offering peaceful technology or resource races as an endgame option for skirmish and multiplayer modesand thats it
big huge games might call its combatants civilizations its labor units citizens and its bases cities in practice its still the blizzard rts military model
the intricate tech trees of the civ and moo series are here trimmed down to lines of yet more unit upgrades
borders have no cultural or political purposethey just act as a force shield
economy is still a shallow matter of collecting resources and uncovering crates to build powerful armies
missions are limited mostly to combat the nonmilitary options being woefully underdeveloped
yes rise of nations is straight rts no more sophisticated than starcraft or epic than empire earthltrise abovegtwith ron put into perspective i can see its virtues more clearly
its a fastpaced entry into the historical genre for those who want to upgrade armies from the stone age to modern times in an afternoon
a plethora of civilizationspecific units and advantages lends a style choice to whichever side you play
bhg keeps base buildings to a minimum and players can immediately build all units available for a given age so long as they have the resources and the factories
resources are widely available and players have plenty of room on each map to spread their bases and amass armies
bhg also incorporates good unit ai and pathfinding
if the player doesnt want to worry about an extended campaign or storyline ron is all about skirmishes and multiplayerltfall of nationsgtperhaps as much as the hype these traditions fail to please me
im tired of the arbitrary unit population caps and mindless b routine
westwood games may be even more dated in their play mechanics but at least they concentrated each game on a story and wellexecuted themes instead of developing a loose collection of skirmish variations beneath a threadbare claim of being historicalbhg could have broke the mold the idea of a true epic rts is one of the great unrealized ideas in pc gaming
they played it safe insteadbut had the gall to call it something it is not
make no mistake dedicated rts gamers will probably love this game for the same reasons i dislike it
but serious tbs gamers may be disappointed all around
rise of nations is no realtime civilization its as conventional a military rts as they come
just dont buy the hype if you buy this gamei find ron so similar to microsofts age of kings series game mechanics
if you enjoy microsofts approach to rts then i would recommend you buying ronon the other hand if your tastes are more inclined to civilization then dont buy ron or youll find it boring
ive honestly tried playing this game five times and i just cannot bare it
i eventually go back to civiii because i find it much more intelligent and deeperin rts its not so much about the latest graphics its the playability and the challenge that counts
i find the graphics of ron better than those of civ but its just not enough im afraiddrakanmust say i played it for a day and never played again
i really didnt understand the storyline of this game if it has one
every campaign has only one map and mission
they just put you in a map to gather resources develop your forces with endless upgrades and destroy the enemy
there is no more objectives in this game
for me this is like playing always in skirmish mode
age of empire was betternote to video game developersbefore the discussionsmeetings on gameplay mechanics begin please insure a basic requirement for your title is metits actually fun to playit really is amazing how the simplest things escape people a lot of whom are very intelligent
unfortunately this is exactly what has befallen team ninja the developers of ninja gaidenthe graphics while very good for the original xbox remain the sole redeeming value for this travesty of a title
excruciatingly frustrating to the point of shouting expletives and tossing the controller i wonder in amazement had the developer even bothered to perform playbeta testing with gamers
surely they wouldve received tons of feedback on just how frustrating the camera can be how it becomes an invisible enemy along with the many real enemies the game throws at ryu the character you controlnot only that but it is guaranteed that the gamer will be forced to play through several scenes at least  times before progressing without some sort of guide
people play video games for amusement not for frustration and angst
they represent an escape from lifes everyday conundrums and ninja gaiden is the polar opposite of that simple premisenote to team ninja before anything else make sure your games are actually fun to playfunny thing  i was at a gamestop the day this game came out and i was very tempted to purchase a copy
my lovely lady advised otherwise and for once the crack of the whip was a good thing
i rented the game and played about three hours into it before giving up all hope
the graphics were beautiful but that should go without saying if youre going to delay a game for months upon months to tweak it and then ask  bucks for it it had better look nice and purdy
so whooptyhey on the gorgeous animations
software designers have no excuse for not raising the bar graphicwise with all the computer technology they now have at their disposalthe gameplay is linear and stagnant
 fight these three brown ninjas
here comes a white ninja
 fight this monster oh wait more ninjas
about the only rewarding feeling while playing the game was getting to run up walls and flip over people onto ledges etc
but you cant have fun flipping around all day long because that damn random ninja generator is cranked to  and wave after wave of generic ninjas will keep attacking you as you play
 so you cant enjoy the wall hopping without having to participate in ninja gaidens stale fighting system
maybe they should have done a ninja olympics game
there is no ragdoll and the ninjas when killed die in about the same three or four poses
this makes for very monotonous gameplay
they attack the same way and then they die the same way
zzz
ps  the cameraview system is bearable at best
 which is funny because the game constantly emphasizes how a true ninja must be extremely observant and adept at looking around
 youll spend a great deal of time wrestling with compromising camera angles
the bosses as im sure youve heard are ridiculously hard
but not in a fun advanced ai sense where you feel the joy of battle no im afraid not at all
the bosses are hard in the sense that they know what you are about to do before you do it and constantly thwart your every attempt to attack them
to defeat the bosses you have to waste about  or  tries finding out what moves not to do and what pattern its okay to attack in
to me thats not a fun challenge thats more of a math equation done with an xbox controller instead of a calculator
tecmo thinks its funny to waste our time to end on a good note i must say that the story is solid
and of course the character artwork and animation is beautiful and fluid
very fun to watch
sorry tecmo i just ran out of compliments
if youre a hardcore fan of the original games hey buy it
 youre bound to make it fun for yourself
but if it was the hype train that brought you here i would advise that you rent this one before buying it
 metaphorically this game is a shiny new corvette with my craptacular  cylinder ford engine powering it
savyno doubt this game is great
but i do not have time to constantly restarting playing the same old area to get to where i died previously
camera does sucked at times constantly have to adjust your camera to see your path ahead
save points are far apart
time is essence
with people like me who has tons of game to play i wanna finished one game and move on to the next one
with such unjustable difficulty level i think i would king forego this game and move on to the next one
i do not intend to kill myself with such difficulty
the creators are gods i know
but there are a whole bunch of gamers around the world who are not god gamers
who seek a sense of completing a game because they want to experience the thrill and the excitement of a great game like ninja gaiden
however this i can say is definitely not worth my time playing it
when you create a game you wanna make sure that gamers who play it can complete the game so that they will have an awesome experience and if they feel like challenging themselves to a greater difficulty level then they may do so at there own will
games must be created with various difficulty level in mind
if they want to reach out to mass gamers that is just what they need to do
people like myself arent expert at games but enjoyed playing and completing it to experience something that could not be experienced in tv movies or elsewhere
with games it is the only hope for me to explore the scifi and fantasy world beyond my imagination
and yet ninja gaiden has failed to do so and my only advice to gamers are if you have the time to spend playing over and over again where you got killed then by all means go ahead if not find another game that will make you feel happy and satisfied
because i know i am moving on period
with this i rest my casei had this game a few years backand it was without a doubtone of the top five hardest games i have ever played in my lifewords cannot describe how hard this game isits really a shame toobecause this game is actually really coolthe graphicsthe musicthe storyall of that is excellentits just too dang hard
if you get agrovated easilythen i highly recommend that you do not buy this gameif you want one of the hardest games ever madethen go for itif you are looking for a total dungeon crawl with random battles every ten seconds though endless dungeons that require mindnumbing repetition to finally work you way through then this is the game for youas a gamer since age  when i first saw asteroids in an arcade i have played and beaten hundreds of games
battlestar galactica is so frustrating that i put it away after  attempts to get through level 
yes level 
i just stopped caring
any game that forces you play through the same  minutes of gameplay every time you die towards the end of a level is a waste of my time
no save points
no midmission saves
i could be out making money or going on a date or playing something thats actually fun and rewarding
what makes me so mad about galactica is the fact that the graphicssounds are really well donethat and the fact that i have waited  years to fly a viper in a video game and when i finally do i want to forget the name battlestar galactica altogether
strictly for the sadists out there
i just finished the game black and found it to be a walk in the park compared to this gamelook for my copy used onlinethis game has ok graphics for todays first person shooter standard
i dont like the fact that you cant just kill without saying freeze or something
it gets really old really fast
rent it and beat it without spending the  or 
maybe wait until it drops down to 
this game is cool because of the futuristic weapons and its a squad based first person shooter
just with some issueswish i did not buy it because the game is really dull and not as good as the other swat series games because they have tagged on some sort of a silly story that is not as dramatic as any type of swat gameplay that we have done before
the graphics however are good and the control easy to use but the game lacks any serious tone or theme does not have that many functions  guns  types of grenades some updates for guns earned by tokens after you complete a level and  or  orders you can give to your team mates max of two only team mates
it plays more like some arcade game as you move about the levels
it is a serious step back in the wrong direction for the swat series
i would recommend renting this before you choose to buy it
it is only just okay but the gameplay value is not there and it misses suspense completely
yawngo buy swat  insteadi have been a huge fan of the swat games ever since swat  came out swat  was by far the best of them lots of accesories realistic senarios more interaction and better game playswat global strike team is realy just a shoot them up game very little interaction
just go around shooting bad guys get your partner to restrain hostages defuse bombs open doors and play with door passwords sounds more fun than it realy is
no stealth mode that i know of and when you release cs gas it only seams to affect you and not the crims
the controlls are touchy and its hard to aim specialy in sniper mode
it realy is a let down after swat  i have always said that i cant waite untill they bring swat out on a video game system ps i now think they shouldnt have botheredi have to say save your money and buy swat for your pc its  better and cheaper
i hope the next swat game to come out of seirra isnt some lame futuristic shoot them up but i hope they go back to the swat  style tatical games
if you have never played a swat game and just want a cheap cheasy shoot them up game then this might be the one for you
but if you are a swat fan then stay awaywell this game started off looking really cool i mean the graphics are great and youre mulder running around with a flashlight and pistol what could be coolersadly the gameplay is very much what youd expect from a subpar game running around it looks kind of like indigo prophecy which is very good but without any of the good parts of that game  you run around and when you walk next to something that requires an action an x appears on the screen
so its just a matter of finding xs
takes all thought out of it
when you run around the camera changes so lets say you run down the screen changes and suddenly youre supposed to be moving the controller up
this happens over and over and is really annoying
again it looks great
it just isnt fun to play
to compound that problem you have to run around areas that look similar so its very disorienting and confusing running up oh wait am i running down or up
where am i
you have a notebook with notes from scully unfortunately the notes are handwritten
making them really hard to read at least on my tv
and besides who wants to read during a ps gameon to shooting shooting is meh
it could definitely be worse but could definitely be better
its just not very good
i gave up on this game pretty fast  an xfiles game is a cool idea but didnt like this onei guess im the voice of dissent but i didnt care for this game at all
heres what i didnt like about wario ware too easy
i got through the entire game including unlocking all the other games in two days i was expecting strategic variety in the various minigames but almost all of them boil down to hitting a single button at just the right time hit the a button at the height of a jump to sink a basketball shotor jump off a ski lift or catch a rod thats dropped into your hand or catch a piece of toast launched from a toaster or put a finger up a nose or slice a bamboo shoot in half or jump over an oncoming car etc etc etc
almost entirely built on oneshot reflex timing and not on strategy logic reasoning skill or anything else id look for in a game or one of  games
the unlocked games as opposed to the minigames are predictably lamethey remind me of mindnumbingly dull spaceinvader wannabe games circa id say the game was a decent diversion for  days but it feels more like one of those demo disks with a dozen game previews except that it costs money
if nothing else the company gets kudos for exploring new ideas and formatsthis game is alright but it would be a lot better if the camera control wasnt so horrible
the concept of the game is cute and fun but it gets really annoying very quickly
i was lucky enough to find it for 
its an ok
game but i wouldnt have payed full price for it
if i were you i wouldnt pay more then  for it
i hope you found this review helpfulat best this headset purchase will be a crap shoot
even after i read complaint after complaint about this headset after only  days the mic stopped working
its not only the ps for which i bought this for i even tested it on my pc using skype and it still wont worktoo bad other than the fact that sound only comes out of one ear the other is a dummy speaker it keeps popping offyes its cheaply made but if only the mic would last for more than a few days it would be worth the headache
i only hope i get my money back as i am returning it without the original packaging cause it was working
but only for  days
one star for each day it workedthis head set is pretty good
and im not rough when i handle tech
i owned two of them at different times and both of them just died
im researching and that seems a problem with logitech productsi purchased several of these headsets prior to upgrading to a bluetooth headset
these headsets sound good but they are cheaply made and do not last
a little tug on the cord is all it takes and it stops working
if you are purchasing for use on the playstation  then the ps bluetooth headset is a much better option in my opinionplaystation  bluetooth headseti bought this to use as a usb headset on pc rather than connect it to my ps because all of my othes are either lost or broken
i figured the size and the logitech name would guarantee a little longevity
im not especially rough on my toys but my gaming area is rather cluttered with numerous projects games books cds computer parts etc
so wires mice game controllers have a tendancy to get tangled and like any lynch pin move one and they all come crashing downwhile the headset works its a little wonky in its functioning
it sounds just fine but the microphone shaft is too short and ends up sitting on my cheek a halfinch shy of my mouth and doesnt pick up spoken word all that well
worse its kinda flimsy the plastic too soft
it has a bulky volume control with mute button about a foot down the cord from the headset while at the other end is a small box with the playstation logo on it
i suspect its a preamp or a signal changer but it seems kind of obtrusive and gets in the wayis it worth owning
not at its current price if it were ten bucks cheaper it would be worth it
it does what its supposed to do but not very well
there must be a better substitute somewherejust great
the headphone amp mic just fell of my desk and broke
a grand total of  meter
cheap junkit was rather uncomfortable all things conisdred
pretty meh quality sound etcyou can find better for roughly the same price if not a few bucks more
look for those insteadthis game is degrading to all women and mankind
it is a monotonous d beatem up game but that is just the first problem
the controls are so bad that you can never be sure of what move your character will do next secondly it doesnt seem to matter because the hit detection is so off that it is like you are playing karate champ for nes
also the movements that these girls perform make me wonder if it is even possible to do them in real life
also the ladders oh man there is this one ladder that is just so pointlessly high that it literally takes  minutes of straight climbing to reach the top but there is nothing there but you have to go there to switch to the next girlthe stages are so long and drawn out and take forever to complete
it is just painful to play
also i think you have unlimited lives i could never really figure out what was going on with this
anyway the cg sequences are so awkward like worse than the moviesone last thing about this game i am not sure if there are more than  levels
stage  just seemed to drag on forever i think i was playing it for  minutes and still never cleared it
many times i would get to some point and get stuck much like in stage  of cheetahmen  for nes it just didnt do anything i read online that people have cleared stage  then the game repeats itselfi give this game a  star because a game this bad just has to be played by anyone just to really see it for themselves plus it is the worst game on gamecube and voted to have the superman  award for that year
this game goes with et atari dr jeckyl  mr hyde and superman  that badokay i love indy racing and i was upset with this game
the graphics on this game just sucks
i have played formula one games and nascar games that have more detail that this game has
i would have enjoyed this game a little bit more if they had a camera view on top the car like they do in real indycar racingwhy that wasnt put in is a mystery
the camera views are so crazyyou have four
the rearfurther in the rear the nose and the cockpitsomeone please explain to me why the heck we need two rear views
are you trying to tell me that you got all the drivers and cars but couldnt get a camera view with over the head shotokay
when your looking back to see whos racing from the rear its the same view in all of them
oh in the cockpitno freaking mirrors
the crashes are awesome i love the fact that you have to stay in your line before you start and the pace car comes out like the actual race thats pretty cool
the spotter i love that he always give you information on where you are
other than thatrentrentrentactually the more i play the more i wanna change my review
ive noticed some good things and bad things
the campaign is as i said nothing special
seems pathetic compared to roc
they couldnt even work in the orcs so they made them a bonus campaign which involves you do some boring tasks than ends
people say later you download more but thats just a rumor
anyways the problem isnt building
there are  types of missions
get a hero fight to the exit while rescuing units of yours who for some reason still have their weapons even when in jail
theres also get a half built base upgrade your townhall or tree or whatever than attack
most missions are so easy to complete with the starting units you are given
the real problem is the characters
there are no backgrounds to any character or development
maiev wants revenge over some dead guards so she hunts illidan that is her entire story
you never learn anything else about her except she has some real problems with being nice
kael hungers for magic which is stupid
arthas is boring wants to get his power back and help the king of liches
pretty boring
then theres the crypt lord ananarub
he says i was sent to aid you from the lich king and bam thats it
you never learn anything about him
he is so boring
then once you finish campaigns there is no ending and you learn what happens to none of the characters except one
yes you have to wait for a new game because there was no ending really
it never says kael decided to eat so he stopped being hungry
it says nothing about any of those charactersbattlenet seems to be boring
every game is usually a rush now
they downgraded most unit costs and now it is incredibly easy to get mass units and attack
out of the  or so ladder games i have played only a few involved zero rushing
tournaments are boring match after match people love chatting about nothing
clan support has added the new constant spamming
every public channel involves tons of newb clans talking about how they pwn everyone and are  so we should all jointhe new units are boring
spell breakers got old
dragonhawks were in roc just you couldnt build them the ai could
wyverns have had their name changed to wind riders for some odd reason
batriders are fun except noone goes them
i hate having to take down mountain giants but they arent too bad same with those spirit walkers
some units have been changed
tanks are now engines and gyros are now flying machines
boring
i dont know why they changed those units but anyways
there are some new buildings like nerubian towers arcane towers the  new item shops thats about it for players
than taverns and market places which are pretty boringneutral heroes are alright
naga sea witch kinda boring pit lord fun beast master involves alot of summoning dark ranger involves some life sucking and the pandaran is probably the biggest relief
its better than vashj
which reminds me blizzard needs to get a good name department cause the names for the new heroes and such are terriblealright i havent played this game for more than two hours but felt the need to save some others some money and put my opinion in for what its worthgood news if you still play doom  and  then this is your game
youll probley think its game of the year materialbad news  if your not in the doom  and  group youre probley gonna hate this game
im in the hate groupthere is no great gameplay here no ai no inspiring level design its not scary
theres enough pretty graphics to make nice screenshots to sell the game
mainly its just shoot collect stuff and move on to next area gameplay
boring
the monsters just spawn then run at you
you just run upto them and take them out point blank with a shotgun
its hard to even get hurt in this game the main thing that will hurt you is the collaterial damage from the explosives that just happen to be laying around the map right in your projectile pathmy recommendation is download the demo and if you think the demo is the most awesome gameplay youve seen they buy it
but dont buy this game without trying the demothis game ran at top speed on my system  amd  radeon  pro   ram
theres nothing spectacular to look at so my guess is it will probley run at top speed on a majority of systems out therethis game is most similar to serious sam than any other game i can think of except whereas ss is mainly in large open spaces with hundreds of opponents this one is more commonly in large rooms with dozens of opponents
thats ok  its pretty much what i expectedbut what i dont like is the way you have no way to stack items except to repeatedly hit them randomly until they fall the way you want them
then you better quick save because as soon as you try to jump on them theyll fall down and youll have to start again
all the surfaces except the floor seem very slippery and moving on them is another exercise in frustration
i quit at the military base because i didnt spend  to waste  minutes randomly hitting tanks to stack them up so i could move onmost of the secret locations and holy items are almost impossible to reach unless you are prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of time on it
im not  i have a life  and it doesnt include this stupid gameeverything im about to say concerning postal  youve probably already read
the shock value of lighting innocent people on fire and going on random  crazy rampages ebbs away rather quickly
and when i say long load times i mean exactly that
the gameplay map is divided into about  or  main sections
you traverse this map section by section
everytime you wish to travel to a new part of the map you get stuck between areas with load times that can last up to  minutes
 yep i said  minutes
i ran the game on a  gz cpu with  ram
 still took a ridiculous amount of time to load
the constant hurry up and wait in this game extinguishes a gamers lust for blood and nulls any interest you may have had for its mundane storyline
considering how brilliant and userfriendly todays fps can be this game has no excuse for being so outmoded in its playability
 years ago this game would have knocked my socks off
now it comes across as too little to late and so much wasted potentialmost of this game was a bore
it was funny at times but really a complete waste of time to play
do not pay more than  or  bucks for this gamepostal  with out a doubt in my mind is one of the most violent video games ever made sure the game never made it to controversial status like grand theft auto but the game was still very verydisturbing
i mean you can do things like blow off a cops head with a shotty piss on people urin on animals set dogs and cats on fire and literaly throw a moltov at a marching band and have them go crazy running about screaming for help while theyre running around in firethe game is indeed sick and funny
other then the games violence another plus is the friggin humor its hilarious with some of the vulgar and funny stuff postal dude says
the game takes place in anot so hugetown where you can go around freeroaming and doing random things like going to the arcade or getting some milk in the convenient store
now of course thats not what youre suppose to do in the gamebasicly everyday you come out of your trailer house and have abunch of errands to dosome which are very funnyand somewell acctually alotof them will have funny misshaps causing chaos and violence
overall the game is pretty funny the missions are somewhat pointless at times and the games violence makes gta look like an e rated video game made by disney
first of all i will get this out of the way i had a really fun time with this game but overall its not a game you should shell out  buckswell i should have said that at the time i was playing the game cause it was indeed  bucks
i for one did not spend the  dollars i had it burned from a friend and now ill get to itfirst of all i loved some of the missions especially the one with garycoleman and a few others they were some pretty funny stuff right there and some were abit disturbinglike the one where you have to visit your fathers gravebut overall everymission was quite entertaining
visualy the games average no wows not greats nothing special just average
the weapons are awesome especially the one with the cat silencer and the areas and places you visit were splinded to see at some points
now other then the funny missions and the game weapons over the top violence the humor does get a little stale at some points and i will say this and i dont care for your flaming but there are way too many load times and they take forever
there are some points where i could go downstairs and get a drink and come back up and the load time would still be there
and alot of the missions become very very boring and repetitive
the load times are horrid the humor does get very stale and the gameplay may get boring real fast to someheck maybe many
and the game is just too shortif you ignore the friggin load times and the stupid ai you will notice the game is ridiculously short and i beat this on normal mode not to mention the game takes place in a  day periodscenarioto some you will like it to many you will hate itand to others like myself youll probably find it to be a below average fpsbut overalli did have a fun time with itthe goodthe humor gets at times is pretty funnygary colemannuff saidsome missions are really really really funnyyou can use a cat as a silencer
if you like a game with horrible acts of violence and animal abuse you will love this gamethe badgets old real fastload times are justhorriblesome missions in my opiinon were just plain lamethis game may offend alot of peoplesome missions were abit frustraitingnothing els to really do other then mess around after you beat the gamevery short just borrow it from someone you know who owns the gamein my opionjust a below average gameonly to be played for kicks and funwell im done with my complaining and ranting the game is  bucks now and i still think its not worth the cash its short not a very great game but the humor and jokes at times are hilarious but get stale later onsome of the games missions were just plain boring only the violence gary coleman and some of the missions kept the game entertaining for me at some pointsbut overall all i just didnt think the game was really that good  i give this a out of it pains me
only when all nine planets are in perfect alignment is it possible for me to hate a squareenix game
for the game to come from the muchloved final fantasy franchise there has to be a lunar and solar eclipse at the same time
anyones heard the story right
square was a struggling developer back in the eighties facing bankrupty
they made a rpg styled after dragon quest japans topselling rpg which turned into a megahit saving the company and launching one of the most revered videogame series everits strange that i never played final fantasy when it first came out on nes
i know that my family owned the cartridge but id never played it
i figured that the first game would be something special
final fantasy to me has always been the epic stories the memorable characters and the solid gameplay mechanics
those were the qualities that just enthralled me when i became hooked on final fantasy ii the th one really for the snes
unfortunately the story is barely there and the characterization is nil
you are a band of heroes that is plopped down in a medival fantasy world and given the task of restoring the four crystals which will save the world
thats it
most of the time you are wandering about aimlessly trying to figure out where you are supposed to go
the method of exploration is go into cave if monsters kill you in one hit leave cave and find another
there are some towns you can visit and be treated to wonderful dialogue like bless the crystal
only thing half the idiots in this world sayif that werent frustrating enough this is a really hard game
unfortunately the difficulty feels like it comes from poor game design than actually being meant to challenge you
perpare to spend tons of time leveling up
youll be attacked often after one or two steps sometimes the monsters appear in droves and your attacks will miss as much as they hit
in dungeons there are no save points for you to save and restore your health with a tent
the healing items and magic is woefully inadequate most of the time
the magic system is also messed up
instead of having magic points to use as you please magic is divided into  levels and you can buy  spells from each level
you can only use magic from each level a certain number of time
this annoying because by the time you reach level ten most of the low level spells are practically obsolete but youll have tons of them and few higher level spells
there are also no items to revive fallen party members so you have to leave the dungeon track back to town and get a priest to revive you
this is really annoying when the town doesnt have a priest and you have to go halfway around the world to find onei managed to play for  hours before i could stand no more
final fantasy ii is a little better
you play as a group of youths fighting for a rebel resistance movement
the characters have personalities and the game actually gives you missions to accomplish
however i didnt like the leveling system
depending on how you fight your stats increase and decrease accordingly
youd think that would have the characters highly customizable
wrong
the characters are still inclined towards certain jobs and weapon types
maria has low hp and cant hit the broad side of a barn so she has to be a mage
give her a javeline instead of her bow and arrow and some animals will have gone extinct before she lands another hit
it takes forever to get the stats to increasethe presentation of the games are pretty good
the graphics and spell effects are bright and attractive
the music is still exceptional
if you loved final fantasy i when it first came out and have been itching to play it again ignore this review and buy this right away
these games have never looked better and they come will a host of unlockable extras
for everyone else looking to play the rpgs are yesteryear get final fantasy chronicles or anthology as square has perfected the formula for rpgs by thenfinal fantasy origins is a relic of a longago era in gaming that has aged like buddy hackette
its a definitely a historic benchmark for the industry but for me its only novelty is that it shows that youve come along way babyfinal fantasy i  final fantasy ii are nothing special to me
they are very primative made in d
final fantasy ii is a lot better in its origanal form on super nintendo
also the story lines are different in those two versions
its for little kidsthis is a long playing shooter with very poor graphics and average sound
if you like shooters you might like this and it might be worth it for  bucks but if you havent played ghost recon halo etc use the money on them and see what the xbox can do
this game might be alright for playstation ii users but it doesnt really make the cut on xboxi love all of the previous final fantasy games
they all have a good storyline along with excellent gameplay
final fantasy x ends that streak though
the idea of continuing with a story from an earlier game is good but they definitely picked the wrong one to go with
wouldnt it have been much cooler to see cloud and the aftermath of ff vii
the story is just terribly uninteresting in this game
what i absolutely hated was the amount of humor that they tried to put in
i felt like this game was geared more toward yearold girls than to the gamers who have been playing ff all along
rikku and brother are the two most annoying characters ever to be in a game
i couldnt stand listening or seeing either one of them
this was the first ff game that i didnt play through a second time
i didnt get the good ending where tidus comes back but then again i didnt care
i hate to say it but i just wanted it to get over with
please do not buy this gamei dont think square has ever been involved in something as bad as this game
i picked it up after playing and enjoying ffx hoping to find a continuation of the innovative storyline development and overall fun
what i got was about as enjoyable as a knee to the groin
at times i was tempted to break the game in half simply to assure that i would never accidentally put it in and play this beast againanger and spite aside on with the reviewthis game continues the ffx story just about where you ended
it is   years later and the land of spira has turned into one giant theme park where everyone and their mother is a tourist
two factions governed by what looks like  year olds have taken control of the population and are about to come to blowsthe game starts out at a concert where yuna is performing a song and dance number which is where i begin to taste a bit of bile
it seems that yuna has given up on her priestly ways completely lost about  years of maturity and started a life as a scavengerpop star
throughout the game you are forced to deal with her singing and dancing and a poor attempt to build a plot around itother costars from the first installment are back as well
lulu wakka and kimhari make their cameo appearances but contribute nothing to the story
rikku comes back as a playable character but she seems to have deevolved into a prepubescent child as welli wont go into the storyline at all simply because it would hard to say anything about it without giving the entire premise away completely
let me just say it is shallow very shallow and completely not worth investing the time to see the endings
just look them up on youtube and that would be good enoughgame mechanics were severely underdone in my opinion
after the success of ffx square could have simply ported the game over changed the names around and made yet another success out of it
this game consists of all of the bad parts ported over and new dumbed down material
the awkward conversation scripts irritating voices and giant plot holes are all back again
sadly all of the good things are gone
gone is the sphere grid leveling system the multiple character with some nice storyline even a good underlying story is too much to ask of this gamethe combat system is nice i have to give it that
you are given three characters for the entire game but you have the ability to change their profession in midcombat
sadly because every battle is fast paced and all of your skills magic and even items require a large amount of time to use you will fight most of your battles by holding the button down and attacking madly until something diesall of the visuals monsters characters and settings are a straight port from the previous release which i found odd since this game is far shorter
i got through it with about  completion in under  hours
while spending more time to get  will get you another  minutes of ending sequence it is really not worth your timein all looks as good as the original
while i liked the fast paced quick thinking fight system the omission of an interesting leveling system was irritating
this game was a slap to the face of the fan base it was supposed to be made for
at many points the shear shallowness of the dialog lack of character development and simpleminded minigames make you feel like you are playing a game more suited for  year olds
then you get a thong shot of rikku or you hit the point you have to give  a sensual massage to a woman for points and you wonder what the heck the creators were thinkingif you are a fan of final fantasy gaming avoid this one
if you are not a fan well you have no reason to touch this one anywaylet me begin by saying that this game is very different from ffx
do not expect an epic story here
and the battle system is drastically different
all three of the main characters are females
the story takes place in spira
yuna rikky and a new character paine are sphere hunters
they travel all over the continenct searching for these artifacts
the story is very lightweight and definitely not engaging
however the game is not a bad rpg
if you simply just want to pass the time and play an rpg then this game will do
just do not expect it to be anywhere near as good as ffx
in my view there are many other superior rpgs out there that should be first on your listnot really a fan
i dont like the dancing and singing especially in final fantasy collection
it is just not my idea of good final fantasy gameim a final fantasy fan but this game didnt do it for me and i finally gave it away without finishing the game very uncharacteristici didnt care much for the changes and felt that almost all of them were quotfor the worsequotthe characters and locations are the same as ffx but only the female ones are active now  other than that everything else is different
the battle system involves changing your characters outfit and based on what theyre wearing they have different abilities so each character could be a mage or a warrior or a thief  etc etc based on what theyre wearingthis was nice to watch the first time but it just gets boring after a few hours and frustrating to have to quotchange dressquot where previously you could have just switched characters in and out of the gamethe characters act goofy and say stupid things all the timeno more eons either
the dress sphere is supposed to replace all of thatthere is of course a lot more to this than im writing here but the overall feeling i got from playing the game was quotickyquot and the bottom line was that it didnt even keep my interest long enough for me to want to find out about yunas loveinterest and the rest of the gangif you forgot everything you ever knew about final fantasy x and this came out you would think it was so stupid
the plot trying to find a guy
who would want to play that
the cutscene graphics are very good
almost real
but the gameplay graphics are about the same as final fantasy x that came out  years ago
the powering up system is horrible and doing special movies you have to change cloths
it is very confusing and not worth getting into
the voices are good
the game takes  hours to beat
the battling is not at all stragetic because you have a certain amount of time before an enemy attacks
you just say attack everytime
yunas song is awfuli am female and purchased this game because i liked final fantasy x so much
this however is a very lame follow up
the fighting controls are very different and you have to fight fiends with song and dance
the story is very poor in comparison to x and the entire game just feels half baked and childishif youre expecting anything anywhere near as good as any other final fantasy game youre in for a huge disappointment
if youre a shallow yearold boy eager for fan service welcome homethe badcharacters
imagine an annoying stereotype of a dumb shallow woman who spends most of her time jumping up and down giggling and talking about make up
that is how the three main characters are portrayed
if you like yuna or rikku in ffx youre likely to be very irritated by what square turned them into
this cheesiness permeates every aspect of the game
in order to change job class you change their dresses and the characters strip and put on a new dress every time you change their job class
a minigame even entails one girl giving another a massage and you have to press the right buttons to massage her well
and lets not forget the scene where they all splash about in the water in their underwear gigglingstory
there isnt really one
its mostly the three characters going around the world map fighting unimpressive enemies and giggling
as an example ffx opened with a characters city getting destroyed by a gargantuan powerful force
ffx opens with a pop concert and the theft of yunas outfitthe goodbattle system
now this is great which is why this game got three stars instead of one
you can actually change job classes in the middle of a battle and characters improve their stats within each job class instead of overall
the jobs have some of the classics as well as some interesting new ones
the battles themselves are varied and complex as are the various interesting abilities the characters can acquiregraphics
aweinspiring
if you can grit your teeth through the cheesy dialogue irritating characters and complete lack of story then you will see a very visually beautiful game and absolutely breathtaking fmvsthis isnt the game they said it would be
despite previews promise of this being a nonliner missionbased ff which is partially true
the percentage completion system is set up in such a linear way it is nearly impsossible to even get  in your first playthrough and impossible to get  wo some sort of strategy guide due to the arbirartry nature of the linear storythe female characters are occasionally nice to look at but thats not a reason to play a game
real women are better levelling up is dull and theres not enough reason to switch out of different dress spheres once youve mastered the abilitiesin short this game doesnt have the fun story or sense of i must collect every item that previous final fantasies brought to me
its a struggle to make myself even finish this game and for me thats a lotlike ff you either like it or dont
i dont
this game is an embarrassment to the series
this is coming from a long time hardcore final fantasy fanthis game isnt that greatsonic adventure dx is supposed to be a nearly identical copy of the sega dreamcast title sonic adventure but something drastic has been lost in its translation to the gamecube
this game is severely lacking the feel of its dreamcast version and on top of that it seems to be full of glitchesthe first flaw most players will notice are the very akward camera angles
in this version of the game players have very little control over the games camera and as a result will often have their characters suffer death from an unseen enemy or pitthe second flaw players will likely notice are the glitches in the games platforms
while progressing through certain levels players can suddenly find their characters falling through floors and walls that should be solid and impermeable
the passability glitches in the floors and walls always occur in the same places so players can avoid them once learning where they are
if you are willing to deal with the frustration of frequent random character death then you might find this game to be a lot of fun
otherwise you should probably avoid it and find a good platform title elsewherei remember playing this on the dreamcast back in the day as well as the second in the series
i sold the dreamcast when they stopped making them and stopped making games for the system to purchase another system of some kind at the time
i regretted never finishing the game completely and really liked the sonic adventure games
this turd is not the original game it once was however
i would think that rereleasing a game on a newer platform should improve the title but apparently sonic team didnt see improvement as absolutely necessary
the camera is wonky and the controls arent nearly as smooth as they were with the dreamcasts controller
the graphics have not been improved much if any at all and the one thing a sonic game has going for it speed gets interrupted frequently because of the twitchy controls forcing you to get stuck on a wall in the middle of a big loop or something and you go from  suddenly
if you have never played the original on the dreamcast then this may be worth a rent if you really really must play it but keep in mind that the original was a groundbreaking eyepopping fun experience and this barely passes as fun
if  you ever played the dreamcast version there is nothing significantly different here so dont waste your moneyi had this game when it was first realeased on the sega dreamcast and at the time i was excited about the prospect of playing a d sonic game
and then i played sonic adventure oh and what a mess it was
you would think with the awsome power of the gamecube sega would have made some small attempt to improve all the awful bugs from the original dreamcast version
well they ait done a single thing its still a mess
the d camera is still as bad as it was on dreamcast and all other bugs that annoyed me at the time are still in there
everything about this game is just awful the music the terrible voice acting and lets no forget big the cat
get mario sunshine or if you need sonic that badly then get the mega collection instead avoid this rubbishsonic adventure dx directors cut is conceptually a great idea
the game is among the blue hedgehogs finest and the list of extra features is a sonic fans dream come true
unfortunately the execution looks and feels rushed resulting in an unbalanced end product
as advertised sonic adventure dx contains a slew of extras like every sonic game ever released on the game gear handheld a brandnew mission mode with  objectives and game boy advance connectivity options that let you raise chao and unlock links for other gamecube sonic games
those are all cool features but its a different story when you get to the main portion of the game
the graphics have been polished with detailed textures but the already problematic camera angles have gotten worse
the visuals also break up and have serious collision detection issues
these collision hiccups also adversely affect the controls which otherwise feel goodthe audio has been spiced up with a dolby pro logic ii option which sounds great albeit a tad too loud
the dialogue is the same as in the dreamcast version and is not intended to be as goofy as it sounds but its certainly not irritating
who would have thought a few years ago that virtually every major sonic game would be available on the gamecube
sonic adventure dx is a deeper more interesting game than its sequel but the camera and collision problems hurt the overall experience
only recommended for serious sonic enthusiasts and completistssome games frusterate you some games make you happy i dont know what it was about this game but i got the sensation of bothoh well heres my review of sonic adventure dxsonic sonic sonic what would we do without youwell i dont know but i know some of you can do without this gamebad voice overs dated graphics and frustration oh myyeah whatevergraphicsive never played the dreamcast version but from what ive heard they look exactly the samenow this is great if youre looking for that classic look but it would be great to see some enhanced visuals herecome onanother thing that bugs meand it goes for pretty much every d sonic gameis that every character is way too shinysonic tails knucklestheyre all shinyanimals are not shinyi know this isnt a very big deal but it just looks weirdcontrolssometimes the controls are great but other times all you have to do is push the analog stick forward for about half of the levelsi need something more interestinggameplaymost not including d sidescrolling sonic games have the worst camera everyoure running along then all of a sudden theres a wall in your facealso the game is way too hardi dont know where to go or what to do half the timemost of the hints they give you isgo to the insert place you might find something
whoopdeedo i might find somethingmusicno commentreplay valuewhen youre stuck the best resorce is the word wide webbut im too lazy to go on the internet to find some stupid hint for some stupid gameafter i get stuck and try to figure it out numerous times i give upits just not fun for me anymoreoverallmake a new sonic game for gods sakeim sick of all these remakes nobody has any innovative ideas anymoresonic heroes is a step up but thats just one gameone game out of all the amazing minds working at sega you made nights i want something interesting againnot exactly
i was a diehard fan of donkey kong country when it came out for the snes and i had hoped that this game would be a rerelease of the same game for new fans to enjoyits notthis is why more or less the grade is so low
i loved that old snes game to death
i think i may have loved it a little too much however because i waited several days before actually entering my name to play it
why
because although i turned the game on the very first day the absence of that wonderful image of cranky with the phonograph made me realize i wasnt back in kansas so to speakyes you may get some kicks out of this game if youre a new gamer
yes you may find it amusing if you were a casual fan of the original but for an orthadox kongaholic like me i just dont reccomend itit seems to me that the programmers were rushed to finish this game in order to release at the same time as the movie which has nothing to do with the game other than ships and piratesi encountered many bugscrashes as i reached higher levels and obtained larger shipsthe dungeons are intolerable there is basically no reason to go into them and theres no auto mapping feature  so you dont know what way youve been and then the skeleton regenerate  so you may fight the same skeletons over and overtheres also lots of pointless jungle areas with nothing to explore
they just waste your time and make you run  more like a geritall jogthrough themthe game is way too short and the end is a major let down
i was actually stunned to find that i had gotten to the end of the game so quickly  hrs of game play
perhaps if you do all of the side adventures it may bring you up to hrs max unless you are completely inept and die constantly without saving you games regularlyalso the character is very limited in movement
he walks jogs and swings a sword 
he can not jump
the good thing in the game is the sea battles they really did a fantastic job in this respect the whole thing is excellent in this respect with the minor exception of when you control your own guns and have the enemy in front of you on the larger ships you cant see the enemy because the sails screen them out overall i found pirates black kat much more enjoyable and even along the same lines when it came to the sea battles but far more enjoyable to explore and way more stable to playbuffy the vampire slayer wrath of the darkhul king is essentially another licensed side scrolling beat em up that occasionally has something to do with the series its based on through still cut scenes from the series and weapons that fans of the series will be familiar with
taking place within the fourth season of the show buffy encounters hordes of vampires and demons as well as the voice stealing gentlemen and the cybernetic giant adam among other baddies
the ability to combine weapons adds some variety to the game but there are plenty of cons here
jumping moves are very annoying to get ahold of the puzzles are tedious and if you can get through all that youll find that the game is actually a breeze to get through
the graphics are colorful but nothing that pushes the gba to its limits
its too bad that thq didnt put more thought into designing this game i for one would have enjoyed it if you could play as other characters than just buffy adding xander willow riley or even giles would have been fun given each has different abilities but oh well
all in all this game is worth a look for fans of the series that own a gba but all others should leave this on the shelfthe game has great potential
the psi powers are a great touch but for tk they are pretty useless
well i take that back mind drain has its usesbut the game itself ugh the story is pathetic without a minimum of charm and basically one huge clichethe game itself is flawed in many ways a major one is that enemies pop out of nowhere
now if this was a nonstop action game that would be ok but your guy is kinda fragile and it takes a lot of shots to kill even the smallest bad guy
now you clear a room assuming no one can come from a direction and sure enough as soon as you turn around they spawn at predermined places
this can really ruin your run at the game if they happen to do this right next to you they will also do spawn just outside your field of vision to ensure surprise i guesscombine that with a horrible jumping interface very low ammunition limits very few guns useless hand to hand combat anyone actually uses that in this game
 and the ability to save only at checkpoints and you have a very frustrating game on your handstking enemies is fun but not that funthis game is fun for about a day or two or for a party with friends
it is infuriating if you actually keep at it and try to get better and use strategy
because of the emphasis on offense as in nba street there is precious little strategy needed to win
defense is a lost art and a source of utter frustration for example you may block a shot yet it still goes in yet when the cpu blocks the ball falls towards them half the time
the moves are cool the unlockables are neat yet ultimately it is a shallow game
the whole emphasis on consumer goods buy a nice house car posse etc is a nice idea that is poorly implemented
ultimately the games are all as follows dribble towards your opponent perform the act a fool moves dribble by opponent shoot get back on defense and watch your opponent score on you no matter what you do
also the utter lack of reliability in terms of the shooting is aggravating there is no rhyme or reason to your jumpshots
you may hit them with someone in your face yet you may miss  in a row while wide open
dont get me wrong this isnt a bad game its just that those looking for a little depth may want to look elsewhere like espn nba k which has a street mode not unlike this game
the graphics are okay both espn nba k and nba live  are better and the sounds is good but the loading times are terrible
seems like half the game is spent waiting to load
rent firstnah need to lose the themeif you like mindless action and button mashing youll like this
i found the action repetitive
the graphics soso
i thought this would be like a gladiator dueling game
its definitely not
its roman gladiator using many out of period weapons meets bruce lee from that scene in enter the dragon where he fights  guards
really lameshadow over rome looks cooleri recently got right into the nba street vol games and i figured it was going to be hard to top those games on ps but then i read a few of the  star reviews here and people seemed to be praising the game and a few said it was even better then nba street and that this game supposedly had the best controls for a basketball game on ps
what misleading lies i beleive those reviews to be now
i think a person or persons is having a laugh on this site by giving good reviews to such a poor gamefirst off this game is simmilar to nba street which is pretty much an adaption of the nba jam games
however this version is only one on one play
there is one other mode of  on  on  that allows  players to play at once against each other but as much as it sounded interesting at first its as annoying to play as the regular  on  modes in this game as it makes matches longer more frustrating and fewer points awarded to your profile to unlock anything you want to eventually do in the game with custom created playershow long can one on one match ups last and remain fun
it took me  hours maybe before i was bored to death with the lack of options of gameplay this one here offers
i think i mentioned in my review of nba street vol  or  that an improvement could have been offering a one on on mode but after playing ballers it makes me think that the team of street probably did explore that possibility and found it to be as boring as playing this game hereso onto some other bad points
loading times are ridicules
it takes about  minutes to power up this game and get through all the stupid copyright and intro screens before you are finally asked to press start and even then doing so more loading time for the games main menu
if you accidentally go back to the title screen guess what more loading time just to go back to the menu screen again
its even worse when you pick players but its defaulted to the eastern nba stars you then have to press o to go to the list of team categories then select one with nba stars legends and custom players scattered all over the place
the selection menu is atrociousonce you do get into the game and you have skipped the annoying mc paronormal or something you finally begin to play but are then bombarded with popup boxes explaining what button does what is there no way to ever turn that off
then the action begins and you are forced to pretty much just keep smashing the ball into your opponents face and running for the basket for a dunk because for the most part no matter what your chars stats are they will miss a jump shot from anywhere
even with new dunks unlocked you feel very limited to what you can do after a while and thats something this game will never hold a candle to when compared to the nba street series its controls where smooth easy and fun to use where as this game here tried something simmilar but feels less responsive to any variety of dunks you can preform
i also miss the turbo blocking because blocks in this game are just a random act of the create a baler i will say is about the only decent thing about this game
you can make better looking ballers then that in nba street games however later with the lack of options and moves to do its just nice looking set of graphics covering the dung programming hiding behind it
the create a ballers process also only provides you a certain amount of points to use for creating skills and looks and then you have to play matches to earn more why must video game makers beleive that is what players want
its a no wonder the nba live series is so popular at least when you created a player you dont have to play  matches to finally max out the created players stats and by the time you do that you are completely sick of a game
this game here allows you to start off by giving a maximum of  points in one skill level later when you edit your character again you can advance up to  why
someone tell me whose stupid idea it was and in what game they did that first where someone figured it would be more fun to make you earn your stats rather then just create adjust play
filling up the rest of the disk where space could have been used to create more options modes and more than just  on  matches are a bunch of pointless nba videos of a bunch of guys you will probably never have any interest in ever watching their video anyway it only took me a glance at looking at dominque wilkins  minute video of not the best highlights of his career and him saying i love to play the game with that annoying letssssssssss get ready to rumbleeeeeeee guy talking over itwhile im on that the music in this game is just horrendous
a bunch of nobodies rapping about how they gonna be the streets and earn money in the nba someday gimme a break pay for a decent set of songs there is no way anyone could have been paid to write and record thatim done ripping on this game ive said my piece flipped it the bird and thrown its ballers in the bini dun know maybe this game is good i just dont like bball games idn but this game is easy
its not challenging its just like you know how basketball games are
maybe it is good the part about the blingi dun know decide for yourself
to me its bad cuz its easy
a real good game is def jam fight for ny now thats a real good gamefirst i should say i am not a gamer i am just someone that likestec toys and wanted a playstation to get into what it is all about
i try to pick games that i think will be higher on graphics and entertaining story  and lower on skill levelsfor me this was not the game to get
it just was too hard for me to keep up with as far as pushing the right buttons at the right time
i did enjoy the club house but unless you win more then you lose there is not much to do there so needless to say i traded this game in a long time agothe single player missions are just god aweful and super unfair and the multiplay needs massive improvementheres the basic rundown  what you have here is a firstperson shooter made with the unreal engine
it was based on a belgian comic book and imitating the style of said book it uses a nifty graphic effect called celshading which makes the polygonal characters look less like the realistic figures many games aim for and more like cartoon or comicbook characters
game play is divided between straightforward action sequences and goalbased sequences usually involving stealthso far so good
butas a gamer i always take things with a grain of salt when a reviewer says a game is too hard
for many gamers the response that comes to mind is invariably maybe it was too hard for you  but listen
i can play through most games on their regular difficulty setting and this one i gave up on largely because of the aforementioned stealth sectionsthere are stealth games and games with stealth segments that i enjoyed
metal gear solid and deus ex both come to mind
but a stealth game really ought to have some if not all of the following features  being spotted by an enemy makes things difficult but does not automatically kill the player
 stealth gameplay should allow players a great deal of flexibility in routes to take and tactics to use it should never be read the designers minds or die
 stealth games should have a system for saving your game that doesnt mean you have to sneak past the same four guards over and over again because you keep getting spotted by the fifthguess what game fails on all three counts
ding ding ding
thats right unlucky number xiii
many of the stealth sections are exactly matters of memorizing the guards positions after innumerable failures then timing your movements with theirs or failing
want to kill one of those obnoxious alarm raising guards
oops
pity the patrol path of another guard who you never saw takes him within line of sight of the body
you can move bodies if youre using a weapon that leaves one or both hands free a fact the manual fails to mention
the main character also has a kind of sixth sense which allows him to see visible comiclike tap tap taps on screen when an unseen enemy is walking nearby but its only intermitently useful
expect to still be blindsided with annoying frequencycompounding all this frustration is a savegame system that is dead lousy even for a console port
expect to be able to save at the beginning of a level and thats it
if youre lucky the designers may have deigned to give a checkpoint or two frequently at points that make little sense not immediately before a boss battle but three bad guys before it
the combination of these two points is unforgivable
i gave up on this game on a stealthbased submarine level featuring guards walking overhead on catwalks
these catwalks made guards who could see me nearly impossible to spot myself and literally impossible to kill before they triggered an alarm
thanks guys i love games that make my small advances in progress meaningless in such an arbitrary fashionirritating but less gamekilling annoyances  the games characters lipsync their speech in a fashion barely better than the old speed racer cartoons
for a game with such fluid animation otherwise and given any number of recent games with very good inengine character lipsync this is incomprehensible
lead actor david duchovnys inflection seems utterly uninterested in the intrigues around him phoned in another paycheck eh dave
and for a game that clearly prides itself on its storyline there are weaknesses in pacing and moments that completely jar ones suspension of disbelief
a rescue mission level ends if a guard trips an alarm while youre outside the prison but this condition vanishes when you enter the prison itself
theres no alarms in the prison
some levels link one into another in a frustratingly endless fashion other times after a single level its time for a cutscene restored health and a new weapons loadout
the latter is both bewildering and annoying why does the protaganist knowing hes heading into the lions den choose to leave some of his most powerful weapons behind
because he knows what kind of ammo the bad guys are going to be dropping when he kills them i guess the five missiles and the launcher you had at the end of one level are arbitrarily taken away from you and then you discover you really should have been conserving crossbow bolts during an unnanounced sixlevel stretch
a side effect of the process is never knowing whether you should be conserving ammunition or not
dont expect the ammunition you need to be conveniently there when you need it youll find a ridiculous overabundance of ammunition in some places throwing knives in the first aid station
of course
why not
and a fatal dearth of same when you really do need it like the aforementioned sub stealth missiontwo last quibbles  despite doing a full install my version demands each of the four cds be inserted sequentially as you progress through the game
i also get barraged with unskippable logo sequences for ubisoft nvidia and alienware every single time i play
ironic given ive been playing on a radeonequipped emachine
to be fair the graphics are frequently beautiful the plot probably makes a pretty good graphic novel if not the best game the use of a grappling hook is interesting though not unique the ability to pick up some ordinary objects to use as blunt weapons is a nice touch and the musical score isnt half bad
still there are many better games on which to spend your time even in the bargain bin including firstperson shooters
why frustrate yourself with ones like thisthis game gets off to a good start  you wake up on a beach everything looks animationcel painted and your feelings of disorientation are well done using some sort of camerawobbleblur technique
the idea here was also to add comicbook stylings  certain game elements appear in breakaway and popup panels seperate to the main action and sound effects get their own animation like the bam
of a gun or the tok
of footstepsfrom here the problems are many
the savegame system mimics consoles  you must make it to the next checkpoint to save and at least one level had no checkpoint throughout the entire first part
the gameplay is inconsistent  sometimes i can take down an opponent with one shotgun blast to the midsection other times it takes a halfdozen head shots
there are times when a sequence starts you off surrounded by bad guys and you end up standing there facing them both of you plugging away at each otherno chance to duck behind cover or take them out strategically
sometimes the comicpanel animations appear under my screen  i can see the edges of the animation poke up at the top
sometimes the game locks up my hefty system
and every time i start the game disc  isnt good enough  it asks me to please insert a xiii disc until i give it disc   or i would pay less for this game just to try it multiplayer but at the price i was very disappointed
id much rather have bought max payne the little action figure that you create is irritaing to move
i never did get the hang of it and spent lots of time spinning around and bumping into things
the game itself seems to have a marketing strategy geared toward the online game
i found the problems difficult actually impossible to solve
much frustration here
lots of side tracks that have nothing to do with solveing the game puzzles which lead to hours of boredom and frustration
much better to play previous games of riven and exile
even the original myst has a charm and satisfaction that this game lacksthis game is boring and dumb
all you do is walk around this stupid porely designed kingdom i dont recomend it
age of mythology is a better myth gamei was only able to get past the opening scene and then the game kept crashing
unfortunately i didnt realize that there are only two types of graphic cards work this game
the system requirements were for the following graphic cards  mb nvidia geforce     or fx ati radeon  or better
since my laptop is brand new i assumed my graphics card intel chipset was considered the or betteroh well i was really looking forward to playing uru since ive played all the other myst games
i dont understand why ubi did this
the other games were just finewhen uru was first released i as a huge myst fan completely bought in
i preordered the game updated the familys computer video card this game took some serious juice for its day and was all set
then i anxiously set off on the newest myst adventureand was severely disappointed within minuteseasily the biggest disappointment from this game is the fact that it isnt a traditional mystcanon story
basically it is your character exploring the ruins of the dni civilization
there really is no story to speak of whatsoeveronly you exploring different worlds and collecting cloth squaresalso the graphics are completely drendered in this one not the traditional interactive still shots of the previous games
to me this made the dni worlds look somewhat cheap and lessthanepic coming off the incredible beauty of the worlds we had seen to that point
things just looked a bit cartoony and very unmyst likei realize that uru was supposed to be a great online experiment that failed miserably thus rendering this game the chris gaines of the franchise garth brooks fans will understand this reference quite clearly
ill give it two stars because it isnt utterly terrible exploring the first dni cleft even has its moments but if you are expecting the great myst images and storylines of the series up until that point you will likely be as severely disappointed as i wasuru can easily be skipped in the myst pantheon with players moving right along to revelationi love the rainbow six series
im in the military have graduated from both antiterror and team tactics schools
the rainbow six series is an excellent series
the tactics needed to play the game are almost identical to those used in real close quarters combat scenariosthat being said
wow is this add on buggy
i played raven shield with no noticable problems but when i added the athena sword patch all hell broke loose
suddenly my computer began locking up the sound would crash and overall just a host of problems with the add on
my computer is used almost exclusively for gaming and the athena sword patch was the only thing that had changed from when i played raven shield so that is why i hold it responsible
i think reading the reviews here supports my theorythe maps looked very good especialy for online play but the glitches in the game became so frustrating that i have yet to play them all
evidently you can download fixes but if i have to patch a game more than once just to make it work then i have no interest in playing it
skip this game and wait for the next one
hopefully theyll get it right
im going to give them one more chance before i give up on ubi softi also didnt appriciate them installing thier hokey website shortcut on and software on my computer
yes i realize that its easy to remove and if i payed closer attention i could have prevented it from being installed but come on
rainbow six series is a great series but i fear that it may go the way of mech warrior
skip this gamewell its great in the fact that it puts the gameboy advance game images on the big screen but there is really no other point to it
i think the idea is a good one however normally if i playing my gamecube id play gamecube games and vice versa
there is no difference in game play for any game and youve lost the capability to move around
the graphics overall dont change only the size
its more of a hassle to hook up the gamecube then to just put it in your sp or ds
this is definately not a necessity for a gamecubedear god in heaven this game is trash but it is still in away funif you are an avid starwars fan like my self this game is awsome to bad it costs  friggin bucks a month it cost to much that even a true fan is given considerable pain and there are no space craft space and the jedi are weaklings tou want a starwars game try dark forces or jk or kinghts of the old republicthe game it self is pretty neat too look at looks very d and i really appreciated the original thought put into it
but the game it self totally had no substance
the story was boring the aiming is way too damn hard to be a simple game
i loved the way it looked but other than looks the game supplies nothing
i wouldnt of gave it any stars had the graphics not looked so coolside note to designers  make a game where the bodies dont disipear after you kill sombody
that totally ruins a gamedrawbacksthe graphics and gameplay are idenical to the first  gamesi have become so sick of the same dungeons and fieldsi cant count how many times ive been into a blue dungeon idenical to the very first one in part  infectionthe storyline has gone from intriguing to bizzare and confusingthe one and only new city looks alot like the nd city in hackinfection dun loriage and its very tiresome to shop there due to the fact the shops are very far apart and the graphics just repeat the game itself is incredibly short the dvd was also bizzare and the story line if there is one was just a bunch of random events and people talking about the epitath of twilightthe good the new characters are more colorful than the lasti was a huge hack fannow i feel jippedim definately never buying from bandai againrent ityoull have no time completing it several times over in  daysnothing new here from the other games
it was very very short and left a rather empty ending
this game didnt even bother to have all your characters request your help in a dungeon which i enjoyed in the other games
you are pretty much stuck with black rose in this game and i liked other characters much better
one good point about this game is once you have saved the world you do get to continue to play and get item completion with some side dungeon quests added in
the problem is i kind of lost interest as i was no longer playing to complete a story but just for fun
after  games of the same fighting this doesnt add much interest to methe game reproduces the world of the simpsons faithful down to the humor and the voices
unfortunately as a video game its more a test of memory than a game of challenge and skill
the more times you go through the maze the quicker you get
you can drive mostly any vehicle that comes along but its best to stick with the assorted lots offered in the menu
i wanted badly to like this game since i love the simpsons and got this game for the kids
they stopped playing it after running into so many false levelendings
thats where i took over fresh from playing need for speed underground
you become various characters driving around springfield to find clues to a mystery regarding black vans and crop circles
the automatic camera controls are by far the worst
it jumps erratically from chase view to overhead view if you get stuck in a tight corner or running on foot
this greatly interferes with game play
the physics gravity is terrible
i had my car hanging on the pier edge forever unable to decide whether to fall or not
the graphics is d cartoon
at times i find myself manually circling the camera several times to see where items are positioned and where the ledges are really located to jump on
the vehicle jump cam is also a big problem
its set to on by default but can be turned off in options
its no good if i cant see where youre going to land after doing a ramp jump
the task themselves are simple but after getting to a certain location or collecting such and such an items under a time limit the player is then immediately tasked to go to another location before time runs out to start yet another part of the level
there can be  parts to these levels and failure at anytime along the way results in the player starting the level all over
there is no way for anybody other than the programmers themselves to get through all the levels the first time
the game is unforgiving making a wrong turn or get stuck by a car will mean doing the level over
theres no room for error
when tasked to go to a location you have to rely heavily on the overlay map and green arrows on the road to know where to go while dodging pedestrians and vehicles that to me seem to have a death wish to jump into the path of your vehicle
hitting the items gains you coins
another problem is that some items you can crash through and some items are solid like the rock of gibraltar
theres no way to tell the difference without trial and error
if too many items are hit in a certain amount of time then the police comes in hot pursuit of you
if youre caught you pay a  coin fine
finally the game cheats the player by running over your character trying to get to your vehicle placing your vehicle way down the street or  stopping the game with time still left on the clock
im sure that the creators licensed the game to the video game developers and may have even wrote a basic story plot but as the video game part its totally weak
by changing the xboxs clock to holiday dates like christmas springfield will change its appearance to match the holiday moods
this is true of halloween thanksgiving etc
its good enough just to drive around springfield and forget the missionsnothing special about this game
its another first person shooter but with monsters creepy backgrounds and creepy cut scenes
okay if you like those type of gamesi think  this game was a complete knockoff of grand theft auto only with a lot less violence and the only funny part is when you hit people and the character says something
the levels are outrageously easy and theres really nothing to do after you beat the game
there are also about forty cars in the game and most of them are stupid
do not buy this game reapeat do not buy this game it is too easythis game can be described in one word
mediocre the graphics are poor and since when is the family car a convertible
missions are tedious and arnt even fun
if you get the police on you theres no running all they do is ticket you if they get within  yardsrent dont buyi dont recommend this game grainy graphics poor history and all the game is very dark it deserves a try not the buy my favorite genre of games are survival horror
this game isnt as good as silent hill three
plus it wont sell good because many parents wont let their kids buy this game
the suffering is also scary but not like silent hill  the graphics arent great and its too gory
their is a lot of pointless gore
they tried to make it like a grand theft auto with more gore
if you want a better game check out fatal frame  or silent hill  these are better gamesthis game is not a perfect and exciting game
sorry simpson fans but the game is not the best
you can play as homer bart apu marge and lisa but you dont really play them much on foot
you just stick to driving around in cars
the missions are repetative
you have to crash a car and destroy it get in a race against a cpu hit a viechal and collect the stuff that falls out not a lot of diffrent ideas
the jokes made gave me a laugh or  but they felt more forced than funny
also you only have  locations you play at with the  levels
the only diffrence is the time they take place with a few notable changes
it kind of kills the fun by level  there are collector cards but the rewards for them almost feel unworth it
plus in the bonus races it feels like any car you use easily knocks you aside making it near immposible to win
sorry simson fans
i say this game was rushed underdeveloped and its hard to make it to the end of the game without quittingthis is an older version of microsofts flight simulator
i bought it so i could make panels that would be compatible with both fs  also known as fs and fsx also known as fs otherwise i would not have bought it at all as the newer fsx version is totally betteryuck
another practice your skills game
each time you fail youre punished by being sent back to the beginning of the level
i received this game as crapware packed with a ps bundle and it thoroughly deserves itthe area isnt exactly the fantacy world jak and daxter  was set in that is one of my all time favorite games everywhere he went it looked plesant but this game is mostl building reuins geto and swamp
you have to check back in to the same location after each mission and its hard to find since everything looks the same and when think you are about to find it you run into the sombody and a large attack begains by the time you escape you have totaly lost your way again
jak does have a cool hover board he can flip out at any time and a laser rifel he can use to shoot the bad guys
i do like the hover vechiles that jak can jak anytime they fly over headthe game starts off with an intersting opending and quickly goes down hill from there
as soon as jak opens his mouth to speak i began to have my doubts
everything he says he is nasty and his vocal tones are those of the nastiest villians
granted he is supposed to be under the influence of dark forces and he is grumpy from two years of torture but still he sounds more like a stock villian then a hero whose fate you are supposed to care about itthe level designs are also unrelentedly difficult
from the very beginning you are faced with challenging moving platforms and with a couple of levels you will be chased by a relentless cannon while jumping blind repeatedly
poor camera angles lack of camera control in crucial areas make already difficult jumps nearly impossible as judging depth is often not possible  and more often then not you are forced to jump blind because you can not see where you need to go nextrarely is there is no time to pause to study your move and try to rotate the camera which at some crucial spots simply refuses to budge because crumbling ledges firing cannons and their ilk force you to keep hopping from one awkward ledge to the next
you will be forced to endless repeat difficult segements memorizing the exact route as you will often need to jump blind in order to complete levels
finely you make it through a difficult segement only to fall off a tiny ledge that lures you off the side by tempting goodies or shot by an unseen gun only to be sent bake to the beginning forced to repeat what you thought mastered until you eyes blur over and you forget why it is you are playing the game
only sheer stuborness will force you to continuewhen you are not being frustrated by the pooly paced and unbalanced levels you will be bored by the endless travel by foot or awkward vehicals that you can steal needed to get between levels which the game refers to as missions
this aspect of the game might have been amusing as a single section but is otherwise pointless
the vehicals can only be flown at two heights and there is little room to manuver
everyone just bangs into everyone else
it is like an endless game of bumper cars to get from one place to the othereventually if you persist you will realize that both the level difficulty and endless crisscrossings of the hub city to get to each level are only there to pad out what otherwise be a very brief game
its a shame really because the story is interesting the levels bright and intriguing and with just a bit of tuning could have been really fun rather then really frustrating
if nd really wanted to be innovative there would have a variable level of difficulity and maturity settings
as it is this game will only appeal to the teenager or adult who finds most platforms a piece of cake and longs for a real challengei bought this game because i had played the first one and it was fun funny and had the right level of challenge
i was looking forward to another cool actionplatforming adventure
but that was not what i gotfrom the very beginning the lighthearted madcapcartoon tone of the first game is lost
instead characters are constantly angry scowling and generally put you in a bad mood
i hated jaks new personality
i would rather him be a mute than this angry young man typein the first game once you entered an environment you could wander freely grabbing power cells in any order that you wanted to
not so in jak ii
instead you are given missions
now missionbased gameplay is a pet peeve of mine since im used to games where you figure out your objective on your own so it may not bother people who are used to this type of thing
it does however make me angryif the missions themselves were good this wouldnt matter but theyre not
theyre lame and repetitive to a fault
shoot thisshoot thatbeat this timewhat happened to the creative objectives of the first jak and daxterthe most grevious issue to me however is the controls
in the previous game the simple platforming and combat let me concentrate freely on my goals
here you must use unwieldy guns and vehicles
what is this grand theft auto
with the vehicles i was constantly crashing into things
then the guards would come after me and shoot at me yet another gta copy
with the guns targeting was terribly slow and clunky
i found it easier to just rush the enemy and punch it which kind of took away the strategyi was just so disappointed with this game
after the fun i had with jak and daxter i thought i would have another great series to play
sadly i was wrongi really really wanted to like this game
i got a good ways into the game with much teeth grinding but finally ended up trading it in
the thing is you need the reflexes of a god to get anywhere in the game
the rolling long jump is a good example of this
if you have to perform this move within an extremely short period of time and you dont pull it off perfectly youre screwed
i also found the hover bikes to be nearly impossible to control
i personally dont like vehicles to fishtail all over the place when i have to get from point a to point b as fast as possible
also i hate time limits
and escort missions
i like to take as long as i need to complete an objective
i dont like to be rushedon the plus side the level design is awesome and the characters are very likeable
i also liked the weaponry that jak gets to use
i just wish it werent so hard
but if you think youve got the reflexes of the mighty zeus then go ahead and buy the game
but everyone else may want to rent it firstjak  daxter  the precursor legacy was the first title in this series and it very much set the standard on the playstation for the platformer genre
i have played and beaten the prequel thoroughly even getting the extra ending for finding all the precursor orbs
i loved the game from one end to the otherwhen jak  opens its clear that the story will be taking a new turn into a dark place  our heroes are in a bad future and we take control of jak only after an interval told through cutscenes of his having been tortured and mutated
it seemed to make for an interesting new take on the series but very quickly you realize that unlike its predecessor jak ii imitates more than it innovates
even worse the imitation isnt even in the same genre  jak  dovetails its platformer formula into a more sandboxed open world that heavily mimics the grand theft auto series
ive played the gta series and loved it but here the fusion fails miserably
as the storyline progresses frustrating side quests and attempts to inject variety into the gameplay are quickly derailed by the fact that a single mistake blows the entire operation bumping into someone during a race can trigger a full alert and you can easily get shot out of the sky have your vehicle explode out from under you or find yourself surrounded by a neverending stream of guardsid like to say the awfulness ends there but unfortunately the amount of effort quickly outweighs the payoff
there are times when puzzles amount to how often can you killsmash things before youre caught and killed
in more than one sequence you become convinced that jack thompson has finally found his murder simulator  the goal is to bang on the trigger again and again as fast as you can while guards die screaming at your feet
the difficulty is balanced by a bonus dark jak feature that makes you superpowerful
however this feature gets seriously annoying it takes a lot of dark eco collecting to charge it up and during these murderfest stretches its all too easy to accidentally bang the lower trigger and blow your charge
if you plan to use this power burst to get yourself through a difficult spot if you dont survive to the checkpoint you wont have it available to you again because there wont be enough dark eco lying around to recharge youwhere i finally gave up on this gameat the  markwas when the number of pointless conveyor belts with hardtoreach switches over boiling lava andor radiation pits made me realize that this was no longer challenging it was more like a test to see how angry the player could get before they take the disc out and throw it against the wall
i have beaten many a game and put up with many many death sequences and in the end jak killed my desire to go on far deader than any of the bodies id stacked along the way
not clever not fun for long and not recommendedit was a good game to begin with but gets very repititive very soon 
played only like  of the game and now i will probably never play it againi rented this game hearing it was but is awful
the controls r all with the analog and r and l buttons which is very stupid in hand  hand fighting while gun fighting and sword fighting fun the controlls r still hard and the enemies is very and theres a diffculty level except u have  to unlock on my opininon definately rent this game and dont buy it cause u get tired of it pretty soonany enjoyment you might derive from this game is from playing as jet li in an oldschool fight setting
when the novelty of that wears off what you have left is an incredibly repetitive game with a godawful camera and an illadvised control schemeyes bonus marks are in order for using cantonese in hong kong with subtitles
as a native hong kong person i can say the dialogue is less stilted than usual though still flawed  though i might add that international espionage games like syphon filter has been doing that for years
the settings are authentic enough with the battles in the hong kong settings being especially evocative of kung fu filmsbut is it worth the very problematic gameplay
just barely
if youve seenplayed the demo already youll know that the entire fight system consists of slapping the right analog stick
while the array of moves you can unleash is impressive motioncaptured well from lis own silhouette this system is very ill conceived from a fightinggame perspective
worse still the camera is so restless that you could be in the middle of a combo against an enemy and then the perspective shifts so that youre suddenly hitting at air and the enemys to the side
so many game designers have misled notions about being filmmakers not realizing that the best perspective for gaming is a fixed perspective
this problem came to a head during the ludicrous escape from capture stage where the camera actually cuts you off preventing you from seeing whats behind you even though there are guards sweeping flashlights that way that youre supposed to avoid
this is simply a moronic use of the cameraaside from this the fighting gets tired awfully quickly especially since the designers committed the ol this level never ends sin
this game alleviates this problem by having lots of checkpoints where you can continue the game but during some of the one against  stages the endless brawling still gets tired
and whose idea was it to have enemies pull off hit combos where if you get hit the first time you get to watch your character get pummelled for  seconds straighti actually find the gunfight segments of this game more fun than the endless endless handtohand stages
this is where the dual analog sticks truly shine allowing you to smoothly run from spot to spot forwards and backwards while your hands can aim independently and a top button allows you to do time crisisstyle ducking
theres even a crazy level where you fight off about  enemies with two nailgunsthis game would probably remain tempting to jet li fans because of the roleplaying aspect of it
and i wouldnt blame them  this was my reason for buying this game and there are a few levels that i truly enjoyed
the overall game however is really not that great and i would recommend only playing it in small doses
it will get tired mightily quickly if you sit with it for more than an hourjet li rise to honor is a third person brawling and shooting game
in the game the player takes the role of jet li  or rather a character virtually portrayed by himthe story is a fairly simple revolving around chinese gangs and criminal elements
jet li  or the player  is kit yun a bodyguard responsible for protecting boss chiang who is attempting to leave his life of crime behind
most of the story involves beating up other gang members who are trying to kill chiang or later his daughter and the story serves mostly as an excuse for this violencethe gameplay is simple compared to many other brawler games aside from guarding and areaspecific actions fighting occurs by pushing slapping in the games words the right control stick in the direction that you want to attack
this allows for multidirectional attacking in the games many multiopponent fights
this simplifies combat almost to the point where its not fun anymore the only other action is adrenaline attacks which is basically slow motion or bullet time
gun battles work roughly the same way except the control stick is used to target and the r button is used to shoot
apart from some neat interactive features like kicking people into equipment or onto hot stoves there isnt a lot of gameplay varietythe graphics are decent but not good
faces are reasonably good but also tend to be blocky
the textures range from mediocre to poor with too much blur and not enough detail
the action despite some neat slowmotion moments is generally lackluster as well
the sound is for the most part forgettable and consists mainly of yelling in chinese
mediocre describes this game fairly well
at most parts it simply drags as you are forced to fight yet another wave of hooded thugs and it lacks excitement and panachesure the game could be great online game
but its unforgiveable flaws turn what could be something of a classic into an ulcerinducing experiencelets recap
the loadup time is just criminal
it takeswhatfive minutes or so im being nice between the time that the cd first starts to load and when the player finally connects to the online system
life is too short
this is atrocious
check out games like amplitude tribes or hell even socom  and the loaduplogin time is never more than a minute
network cable is disconnected
an error message that for no reason pops up once twice even three times during the bootuplogin process worse now with the recent patch
not that the network cable really is disconnected by the way
and once the error message appears the only resort is to reboot the game
takes the player all the way to the title screen
start the clock and watch another five minutes of loading drip by
this problem happens routinely to most players
the scoring system
zipper has refused to comment on the exact algorithm that they use for their zany scoring system
dont try to figure it out
win a roundyour rank may go up or downlose a roundyour rank may go up or down
who knows
the online joke is that even zipper has lost control over it
most players have long since abandoned trying to make sense of it
even with the new patch the logic of the scoring system remains a mystery
unpredictable online gameplay
when the disclaimer pops up and reveals that online experience may change during gameplay they ainta kidding
lagissues aside whole servers sometimes crash for no reason microphones workthen they dont and players are bounced from a game all the way back to the load up screenyou now get rewarded with another five minutes wait before you can get back in the game unless you get the network cable error again
the patch
what kind of ps game has to require you to download patches to fix the bugs
and then what kind of game uses patches that fix problems but creates still more problemsthe darn game already eats up the bulk of my memory card
i dont have room to keep downloading these things
the first patch was released in late february of  the second in midseptember of  if theres a thirdwhy not just release a whole darn new gameokay
in the plus category there are three 
 maps and they all look very gorgeous 
the socialinteractive component of the game sets a standard for others to follow and 
the game prevents game sharkerscheaters
thats a halfcompliment
glitchers different from cheaters will find new ways to exploit the gameand will eventually bring it downsocom  had none of these problems
that game was destroyed by cheaters
socom  smells suspicously of a game that was rushed out for christmas at the expense of proper betatesting
if zipper could go back to the first games program code and yet keep out the cheaterswell then they will have a game worthy of five starsor maybe someone else will come along and blow this game out of the wateri hated this game
it is too hard
as soon as you start boom you are deadit takes forever to get better in the game because when u are a beginner the whole game is practically better than you
ya so what people shoot at each other in teams like the us navy seals
even if you start to do bad just a little  bad they will all vote you out and you will leave that room and you cant go back in
what if you are just new and you cant help it
then for awhile you wouldnt be able to go into any room
and say your teammate was there and someone from the other team was running in front of him you shoot him and just barely miss and hit your teammate
you tell them sorry like i did and they stillvote you out
i have played a million games like that that are much better
try out americas army
it is much betterthis game is a huge waste
waste waste waste do not get itthe first socom game was amazing and now with the release of socom ii zipper interactive was looking to make an even better hit
butas so many sequals to anything are this one didnt exacally nail it on the button like the first one did
for starters the game is extreely easy compared to the first one
secondly the graphics arent exacally what youd expect for a second game they are almost just a little worse in comparison to the first game
the ai isnt all that and its more about mindless terrorist flying themselves at you than they are shooting at youi will grant that the health bar addition is good and your buddies are a little smarter than the first one but in addition their accurecy isnt like the first one
its like they lost the one shot one kill saying
there are only two levels that proved challenging and it is because the stealth was an absolute must on admiral the highest hardi guess since the first one was a surprise it made me expect more out of this one but i didnt get what i was expecting
there are a few really fun levels but overal not really worth it unless you just want to say youve played itthis one could have been so much better if only they made it harder it would be challenging
for  bucks a pop though it isnt so bad
but i do recomend the first one instead of this onehooyahday of defeat is basically counterstrike with an attempted wwii setting
it does not nor will it ever feel like saving private ryan and whoever told you that this was an epic wwii game needs to get their head examined
while not a bad idea in itself the game fails to convey the meaning of war
it is simply a pretty display of new textures and skins and a lame attempt at character classes a la return to castle wolfenstein
in the end it is a mediocre spinoff that screams counterstrike
the levels feel cramped and it feels like youre playing lasertag in a room rather than fighting a war out on the fields of battle
there are few maps and even fewer players actually playing the game
the omaha level is a nice try for the millionth time but still no cigar
consult medal of honor or battlefield  on how to get this level right
the game is multiplayer only and requires a somewhat fast connection cable is preferred
as far as system specifications go its the outdated halflife engine with new textures and you should be able to run it with the old system thats collecting dust in the attic
purchase at your own risk or download for free if you have halflife or retail version of counterstrike
but if you really must have a wwii game with freedom of movement so you dont feel like a rat in a mazeskip this title and get battlefield  insteadthe graphics arent anything special
the customize your officer has no good features
a lot of it is ridiculously hard
annoying music and menus
ive only played the first parts and so far it seems bad
maybe it will get better but i doubt it
rent it dont buy it
short and sweetcrimson sea  for ps which is perhaps one of the most annoying games ive ever played
beneath a load of pretentious storyline there is an even bigger pile of redundant and frustrating gameplay
regardless of the mission outline what every one really entails is mowing down hordes upon hordes of enemies with either some type of gun or a glaivestyle weaponevery few missions youll be faced with a new type of enemy which requires more than just holding down the fire button and moving from side to side
you might actually have to stop holding the button long enough for its temporary invincibility to wear off or be forced to use only your glaive
just in case straying from the norm of buttonholding proved too difficult the game tells you the trick to beating the enemies each timei should have been suspicious the moment i saw the koei logo being as though that company only seems capable of making games where you fight millions of enemies endlessly see dynasty warriors series
at least this ones not set to the backdrop of the three kingdoms period and has a story of its own but unfortunately its scattered amongst quest after quest of mindless repetition
to put it bluntly this game is crapive bought all the nfl games since  and this one is actually the worse of them all
it has a great franchise mode but the gameplay is just awful
there are far too many bugs exploited by the computer that result in long bs plays
you will find yourself buying a new controller every week to replace the one you broke against the wall after a  yard td pass on rd and i bought this game solely on the reviews of other gamers and i need to wonder what they were smokingat first i thought this was going to be a pretty good game until i had to worry about the odd camera controls
then the game sometimes automatically cuts to a fixed camera and all your movement controls are screwed upthe complaints about enemies taking  health bubbles in one hit are true
if youre surrounded it sucks to be you cuz youre going to the hobbit hole in the sky because theres no way to hit someone behind you and they can just keep hitting you as much as they wantthe complaints about not being able to save is sort of bogus
most of the time there is a save point just around the corner
butthis was a bad move by the game makers because everyone knows its best to make a game you can save at any pointi see absolutely no replayability for this game because as others have said it will force you to do exactly the same thing you did the first time with the same character same weapons etcit tried to keep with the book but was a sort of shortened kiddie version of itgraphics ok not stellar but not too bad
this is like the simpsons hit amp run
looks good but thats iteither play your friends copy or dont play itas much as squaresofts final fantasy x was quite possibly the best rpg title ever released in recent memory unlimited saga left me scratching my head and wondering what happened to the production and planning committee that put this game together
lets look at the graphics
there are limited cut sceens and fmvs and little if any character animation
if i didnt know it was for a ps machine i would have sworn that the game was produced for the ps
the graphics arent bad but considering the power of the ps these graphics are way under par with present day standards
all the art is twodimensional in nature
basic game play centers on moving your character from place to place on a world map
you and your party do not walk anywhere you merely jump from map location to map location
when arriving at a destination you are presented with another map where you also  move from place to placetypical of all rpgs your chracters gain skills and abilities as you continue through the game
the battle system is pretty straight forward with an element of chance
upon the start of a battle spining circles appear and you have the chance to bring mulitple attacks on the enemy depending on where you stop the wheels
your characters do not accumulate experience points as with standard rpgs but instead you try to protect your characters from losing their lp or life points
you finish each adventure by completing an assignment without losing all your lpthere are seven characters in the game and each one has his or her specific adventure
so in reality you have seven games in one
each character has their own story line and specific powers
the weapons for each character have a specific usable lifespan
the more points the weapons have the longer it will last
the weapons stop working when their durability is all used up
while the weapons are powerful they do not last forever
you have to make sure that the weapons are only used for the really difficult monsters
during the other times you can usually defeat the other baddies by using kicks punches and throwshow fun is this game
speaking personally i do not think the game is that entertaining
there is a lot of repetition in the battles and the story lines are very weak
basically the game can be broken down in these steps move fight or stop find new place move fight or stop upgrade weaponsabilities
there is not very much to do outside of these steps
in summary a pretty disappointing game
with all the great games that squaresoft has produced over the years i guess they are allowed a mistake every so often
i believe that unlimited saga is one of themomg i made the mistake of buying this game
how awful square
how could you
let me count the waysvisually unlimited saga characters  backgrounds arent animatedeverything is entirely static
the only place you get anything resembling modern graphics is in the battle sequences which feature spritebased characters and rudimentary d backgrounds
so if you like the games art style youll probably enjoy looking at it for a little while but if youre looking for moremodern graphical fare unlimited saga wont be the slightest bit exciting
the games catalog of sound effects is understandably limited since little of it plays out in anything like an action scene and the voice acting ranges from bad to horrible
the soundtrack is really good and the only saving grace
i advise buying the soundtrack and passing up the actual gamethe games field scenes play out like some ultra bizarre rpg board game
your character is represented by a tiny static sprite and you move in hops along preset paths that are presented to you
each movement may present some form of obstacle or curiosityyou can be attacked encounter a pitfall or discover a treasure chest for instance
none of these are visible on the board however so youll end up stumbling blindly into things quite a bit
this system of exploration which doesnt actually let you explore much at all comes off as stilted and constraining
its also horribly plodding and makes the movement portion of the game feel like a choreinteractions with townspeople and indeed all the dialogue sequences in the game play out with mere static character portraits and comicbookstyle text bubbles
when youre tired of moving a cursor around the town background you can head to the inn and see what adventures can be undertaken
sometimes these adventures tie into your characters storyline but other times they serve no apparent purpose and after embarking on one you often have to wonder exactly why youre doing what youre doing
the whole process which is meant to advance the games plot ends up being incredibly nonsensicalthink of usaga as a point  click adventure
click mouse move character fight battle collect gold move to next fightsuper boring repetitive totally lacking of innovationyup that is unlimited sagayou want a real good football game ncaa football  madden has great graphics and extras but the game feels to arcady to me
obviously my opinion differs from the rest of youill keep this review fairly short
if you have played madden  then that is pretty much what  is
 added more gimmicks like playmaker control and owner mode where you can basically set the price of hotdogs and hamburgers in your stadium
this is unimportant to me i would have liked to have seen ea use the extra spare time they used in adding more gimmicks and improve the obvious cheating quotcomebackquot ai
aside from it being the same game as  the ai is one of the main reasons i have not actually bought this game
if ea fixed their problems first then added gimmicks then i would consider purchasing this game however they did not
if ea ever decides to improve their problems like unrealistic cpu ai then maybe i will buy madden titles again but as it stands madden  and ncaa  will be my last ea titleswell this game is pretty decent i mean its dino crisis in space with jetpacks n vanquish like stuff there is a few things i hated about it though mainly that the health is so random its like even on easy mode you get hit once half of your health is gone now you can get upgrades to your health but your only gonna get a chance to purchase that upgrade  time as everytime you buy health packs you end up having to use them over n over again and then having to buy more health packs you can probly already hear the patern going on here the gameplay is great but the story health system and map arint all that good storywise it has nothing at all to do with dino crisis  or  they basicaly took the cheap way out n skiped a bunch of years and for some strange reason slaped the number  on the cover the map is like if you took metorid primes map n half aed it the health system i pretty much described it just seems so lazy because even with health upgrades you still end up feeling just as weak as you did before you upgraded your health would i say buy this game no unless you find it for under  dollars then yesto put it simple  this is five star actionhorror game that is drastically degraded by the worst camera system i have ever seen in my life
the camera systems should never be the most challenging part in a game
lol
i died more times from the silly camera than anything else
if you believe you can get over the flawed camera system in the game this game is for you
i highly suggest watching some videos on youtube of gameplay so you get an idea what the camera system is like
i seriously almost stopped playing the game due to the frustration but im a pretty hardcore gamer
so i sucked it up and fought my way to the end
in conclusion if you are easily frustrated by terrible camera systems this game is not for you but if you love for actionhorror space or dinosaurs is greater than your hatred for bad camera systems this game is for youaverage port of a ps game this one was dead before it hit the shelf
just like true crime streets of la came out at the same time as the vastly superior grand theft auto made the jump to xbox tenchu shows up practically the same day as ninja gaiden
ng has better controls more addictive gameplay and graphics that make tenchu look like a playstation one gametenchus been out less than a month and already theyre discounting the price but dont waste your money
its like kissing your sister
spend the extra money and get one of the best games ever seen on xbox  and this isnt it
no i dont work for team ninjawow
is there anyhting good about this game
the fighting is awful so is the plot graphics sound voice acting duration
tries to be cool like devil may cry but makes the game all  the more stupid
the worst level designmy title for this review basically states on how i feel about this game
if i can beat a game within  hours and not really remember the story  then im definately not giving it a good review
the game play is too much like devil may cry
i must say the cutscenes were good but thats it
i bought this the day it came out and also beat it the day it came out
if you like repeative easy games than this is for youbeing a huge fan of the first  original mega mans and having played through just about every version made except for the gameboy versions i was really excited to play a mega man on gamecube
but there are so many things wrong with this gamethe graphics are cel shaded and look weak
there is minimal background scrolling very little in general going on in the background and all the levels are very similar looking
graphics on the supernes were better than this
i know they were going for a cartoony look but its just too flat looking  lacking style looking more like colorforms
if you want an example of how it should have looked check out the mega man game that was in the arcades in the sthe music is also horrible
mega man  and others in the series are known for some of the best game music ever made and given the power of dvd techology youd think it would have a great soundtrack but it ends up just sounding really generic and tinnythe game also breaks away from previous games as you are given chips at the start of each level
the computer choses  chips to give you and you can either accept them or send them back and play the stage without any chips chips being your special item weapon
also refilling your meters works entirely different than previous mega man games
you blaster starts out extremely weak sometimes taking  shots to kill your standard  basic enemyyour character is also much larger now which is good but because you cant jump as high and because your slide is often uncontrollable its very hard to maneuver around enemy bullets
i could go on forever how disappointing this game is but i think ive gone on enoughim sure there will be people who like this game its playable but if you are like me and more into the oldschool style of mega man games you will only find this title to be mediocrei really wanted to like this game
the graphics reminded me of the old lucasarts adventure games which i loved
but theres nothing cute or charming about this game
its full of thugs and killers and the puzzles are too confusing
i gave up on itif you like puzzles that make no sense and a slow story that drags itself making no sense at all get this game
the hype is absurd
if you like cartoonish graphics go for the abbey or grim fandango insteadenjoyed the first  chapters but it will not let me play chapter   i receive a pop up that says errorfile not found  resourceresourcemmaybe when my kids come up for thanksgiving they can figure it out but i cant so i am stuck
it reminded me of the leisure suit larry games and i was enjoying it up til thenhype
i love hype
the kind of hype that says this game is going to have revolutionary graphics and gameplay
unfortunitly most things that are hyped dont live up to it as is the case with deus ex  lets start with the highly touted graphics the textures in this game suck theyre muddy dirty and washed out frankly they look as though they belong on the ps i hate them
it is true the game does have good lighting effects but they do not over shadow the otherwise bland and boring level disign
also the rag doll physics are realy lame and unrealistic
next the other over hyped portion of this game the gameplay its not that fing original its not
what it is though is very linear and uninspierd
my biggest complaint in this area is my biggest overall the shooting
this game is a first person shooter gamnit now i know the games creators would like to think that they crafted some sort of revolutionary rpg but that is just not the case
first and fore most this game is a fps and shooting people is realy boring and in no way satisfying
lastly the soposed quotgreat storyquot is realy not that special its just recycled xfiles you are not alone shlok did i spell that right
just about everybody i know admits that this game was at least somewhat disapointing be warnedive been playing the game for the last month and just past my subscription renewal point without cancelling but i dont think ill go that much further with this game
horizons does many things right but has a few things wrong with it that really ruin the game experiencegraphics look good but not always smooth
a high end system is required to run this game and youll be tweaking the settings even with the best of systems
as the biggest memory hog game ever created it will chew through  gig of memory real quick and a radeon  pro  becomes not enough
theres a good side of this though  even at low settings it looks great and you will spend time just staring at the landscape and stars
like eq most lag occurs in high populated areas such as towns and cites probley a result of bad net code just as much as graphicshorizons has the best sound and music ive heard in a game
they really spent some time and did it right and the music will haunt you once you hear it
it changes as you enter different environments and really enhances your experience
game designers can learn alot from horizons when it comes to the musicthe main challenge facing horizons is its content
theres barely any at all
the only real content youll find in horizons is what you create yourself
quests usually involve collecting  things of this or kill  of that and are just plain stupid
many quests will have you running here or running there being a mad messenger of sorts
while this follows whats been seen in other mmorpgs horizons fails in its attempt as theres no real sense of danger in it
dying in horizons gives you a death penalty ticket
you dont have to get back to your corpse no loss of xp you just get a ticket that reduces your effectiveness for eight hours
i have never felt this effect and cant tell the difference
there is no fear of death in horizons no real penalty
go ahead and kill that big golumn it doesnt matter if you die you can just try again
theres no real sense of adventure herecrafting becomes tedious
the placement of resources in the game at higher tiers is designed to get you running back and forth for hours between gathering and processing of them
while many things are done right with the way horizons does crafting it becomes a chore
spending four hours mining ore and creating things raising your level then rinse and repeatwheres my monsters
while other games had all sorts of monsters everywhere you run horizons has hardly any
they usually group in areas and can easily be avoided
even if they do come at you you can easily outrun them
for fun i aggrod an entire army of undead and tried to train them into town
in other games this would be a horrible thing but in horizons they just head directly back and give up at a certain point  not going after anyone else they pass along the way
again theres no sense of danger hereunlike others the game bugs are providing me with an endless source of entertainment
i dont get upset like so many others
it adds a challenge when the game crashes right in the middle of taking on two higher level creatures or right when my group needs me the most
it adds a real world element to the game and sense of urgency as i scramble to get back in through the web portal theyve created
to me this is a game feature that should be explored further and could really invoke some strong gameplayer emotions
the devs are scramblingi have hopes for this game
there are many things to like about it and it seems a shame that it was rushed out the door so quickly
they can fix it
i think it will be a better game in a couple of months
with the other mmorpgs coming world of warcrafteq ii it had better beover all the game play of this game is not bad
the  rules are well implemented
the story line is pretty good and the game is a nice mix of hack and slash and dialogue based quests
the lack of character customization when it came to the appearance of the characters bothered me a little bit but certainly didnt ruin the game for me
i certainly would have prefered a bit better graphics but again the graphics werent terrible eitherthis game is a real nice introduction to classic dd but those all ready familiar with the game may be wishing for some more areas to explore the game is kinda limited in this respect
i have a feeling that while ive never played the original temple of elemental evil that it was meant more as an introductory adventure anyhow this game certainly felt that way
i also really didnt like that your only option for character building was the dice rolling method when most games now a days are implementing the point buy system for stats as an option and i much prefer that optionthe real downfall of this game is it was released with a major flaw
on some systems it runs fine while on others it is completely unplayable without a patch
it is simply ridiculous that a game will not even play on some computers that meet the system requirements
when i buy a product i at least expect it to have been well enough made to run on a machine that meets all the requirments without having to download a patch
i expect a better quality product than thatthe game looks good and has a very nice user interface system for issuing commands to characters
but the program is full of bugs and should never have been released in this condition
dont buy this game until they do something about the bugs monsters spawn where you cant reach them and you cant exit that part of the dungeon while there are active monsters
you have to exit the game to actually leave the dungeon and if you saved while trapped  then youll have to start over again
very frustrating ironman mode menu system doesnt workyou know that saying the whole is greater than the some of its parts
well i feel the oposite is true with this game
it certainly looks very good
it has a very good turnbased fighting system that is easy to use
stat building and leveling up is handled well
the problem is that these individual elements do not add up to an enjoyable game
it feels rather empty and due to many bugs several of which crash the game i found myself eager to get it over with so i could play something elseit lacks any meaningful plot and is basically a series of somewhat redundant battles
i got the feeling it was a great starting point for a really good game but it never really went anywhere
on to kotori bought the game awhile back but for me didnt have a problem getting it to workthe control interface couldve been alot better as well as the many many bugs the game hasi uninstalled it and quit playing it because of the bugs as well as didnt agree with the fact you had to go and download all the patches for it as well and it doesnt mean the patches fixed anythingi am a hardcore gamer and i do have patience but with this game it was worn thinthe graphics are ok there are many things to do in the game but the overall bug problem as well as downloading all the patches hurts the gameif you have patience and you have time on your hands to tinker around then all means buy the gamei really like the way it looked but they spent more on the case then on the actual game
at first it was kinda fun but since i hate a camera  ft away from my character it got very annoying so i never finnished the game im not saying its a bad game im just saying that if you dont like a camera  feet in the freakin air you really shouldnt get this game but for those of you that dont mind that you would really like this game its kinda addicting if you can look past the  million glitchesif your like me i would suggest getting a different game like devil may cry titan quest the witcher oblivion timeshift or if your more into games like this you probably would like dawn of magic or spellforceas a huge fan of baldurs gate ii i was expecting a lot more from this game
the party system is not at all like bgii
there are no romances or banter to be found unless you engage in the online play
that in and of itself was the most dissapointing aspect of this game
the rest of the game was ok the graphics are pretty nice a little cumbersome at times
the plot is fairly interesting perhaps a bit too easy for some
the game also offers a starting level to help train the new player on the various controls and console
overall though it just got really boring without the ingame banterromancesmods that bgii hadim about half way through this game and it honestly feels like a  star game except it wont stop crashing
i played the original nwn without a problem skipped sou as well as dozens of other games all with my existing hardware software and configuration
im running all mainstream stuffwink service pack  with all relevant hotfixes soati radeon  pro  great cardamd  on an abit mobo  rampatch  installed on march th so basically what happens is the game either locks up during a save and after about  seconds crashes to desktop corrupting that save file in the process or the system reboots
neither scenario gives any warning and if i play for  hours then im about guarunteed to have at least one of each crashso the game is great
graphics are nice sound is fine nothing special
the battles are a lot of fun and i really enjoy watching my dwarven fighter charge a drow cleric amid fire and ice storms
the power given to you is awesome as your guy gets around level  and since the game starts off with you generating a character and leveling it up to level  you can customize the bejeezus out of it
the game bogs down a little sometimes which annoys me since i greatly exceed the recommended specs but that doesnt happen enough for it to be a problemsummarybuy this game if you liked nwn it is tons of fun
but either research your pc setup online to see if others are having problems or at least wait until patch  is no longer the latest
im going to think really hard before buying atari againupdate i updated my graphics driver to the latest catalyst driver from ati version  at this time and the machine reboots seem to have stopped
however the game still locks up about  time in  while saving
i hit ctrlaltdelete and kill the process after it freezes and ive caught the game using mb of memory
the log files it says it is generating are useless they just describe event within the game itself before it crashesmaybe atari is one of those things to avoid now so as to keep our fond childhood memorieshere is a small list of what is wrong with this game and what fun awaits you in you play itthe graphics are out of datethe textures repeat so often it feels like the game is set in one locationthe mood of the game is as much fun as a empty warehousethe story is a mess and feels like a  year old watched total recall a few too many timesthe voice acting will make you giggle and roll your eyesyour name in the game is quotchaserquot
the wepons are boring and we have seen them all beforethe in game movies are boring and too long at timesthe level design is crap with death waiting at every ladder hole or tiny little crevassmany times you will get stuck becuase you have not triggered the next part of the mapmaps are long boring and as lifelesseneimes all say the same things in the same voice on every levelyou face the same enimies on almost evey mapbad guys can pop into any level wherever it suited the game designersperhaps the wost part is the game is no fun at all
clearing a map has no sense of satifaction
after  maps you could care less about the story as you trudge thru this boring gameif your smart avoid this game
unless your a  year old fan of total recallthe first dark alliance had far better graphics and more interesting monsters
plus while the story was corny and cliched there still was a storythis has pretty much no story at all the monsters are lame the graphics are forgettable the settings are dumb or inappropriate for dd and the gameplay monotonous
the ending has you going through the very same onyx tower as in the first although the story explains this well and the final battle is largely identical to that in da ione oftheard criticism of dark alliance i was that it was too short  if you sat down in the morning with it you could definitely get through the game in one day by afternoon or early evening
i think the gamemakers took that criticism to heart when they made this sequel  no getting through this one in a day
unfortunately that was accomplished not by adding more mazes and monsters but simply by having each level by interminably long and repetitive
bigger mazes are not necessarily better especially if its just the same ol stuff over and over againwhenever i get in the mood to play hackandslash i always play through the first one
whenever i continue on to the second one i always regret itthis is basically a hacknslash game
you basically wind up figuring out the most effective attacks then ignore beefing up any other special abilities
some of the environments look pretty cool though i realize i dont like games that show everything in topdown  perspective anymore i think thats what they call it
but there is a lot of action
so if you like killing monsters for hours on end i found it to be a longer game than one person pointed out
longer than  hours imo youll like this game
i think for this kind of game gauntlet dark legacy is way more fun
its probably the same game length definitely better graphicsperspective more interesting level puzzles baldurs gate has none really and focuses on the abilities you need to kill monsters most effectively
there are no unnecessary abilities in that game
you can also play with a total of  people
bg is only for  playersafter reading so much about how great and underappreciated metal arms is i went to ebay and purchased a copy of it
oh how i regret it
metal arms is a mediocre uninspired shooter
the graphics are decent
environments are ok but there are a lot of jagged edges and it could have used some polish
the sound is ok and all the standard sound effects are here but there is nothing memorable at all
even the gameplay is weak
sure you can hijack robots but they are generally overpowered and you can easily jack out of them meaning that you can take just enough damage to leave the robot and run away to a new one
there are a variety of weapons though and the perspective is done well although i would have preferred a first person viewi could have forgiven all of that but two things absolutely kill this game
first and foremost is the framerate
i havent played the xbox or gamecube versions but the ps version has such a terrible framerate problem that it completely destroys any fun a person can have
the environments arent even high res and when there are only two characters onscreen the framerate takes a nosedive
just try playing multiplayer and from the moment both players take a step the framerate plunges
i understand that the ps is aging hardware but ive seen some damn beautiful games run perfectly on it
they really should have made  fps a top priority
the other thing that kills the game is the steep difficulty
bottom line this game is cheap
you start out with only a miniscule amount of health and your enemies are many and powerful
good luck resisting the urge to break your controller and the disc in half
where as the xbox has too many good shooters the ps has not even one good one to date
metal arms is just another terrible shooter
ive read that the gc and xbox versions run smoothly so those might be worth a try but dont come within  feet of the ps versioni dont know much about magic the gathering but i like strategy games so i gave this one a tryfor a video game based on a card game magic is pretty action packed
in fact the game plays a lot like one on one extreme dodgeball
the action is fast and frantic
there are two opponents on seperate sides divided by a line
if you cross the line you lose life every  seconds or something like that
you pick up power ups that can be used to conjure up monsters or to cast spells
the more powerups you have the more stuff you can throw at the other guy
so basically you pick up white balls off the ground and then you use their power to send monsters to hit the other guy
unlike dodgeball though you could even run over to the other side to steal your opponents power ups or better yet join your little monsters in the beatings
i guess its more like streetfighterdodgeball
the game is action packed and its somewhat entertaining especially when playing with friends
i wouldnt consider this a strategy or rpg but its easily worth its bargain bin price
with this game you definately get what you pay for
if youre looking for a real strategyrpg i recommend gladiushaving never played the card game i bought this primarily because it was xbox live capable and at  was a pretty good dealin single mode you begin with a cahracter you have no choice who you start with and then begin a series of battles
each time you win you are rewarded with a new spell
each of these quests consists of about    battles until you get to the boss battle
defeating this boss gets you one of  colored gem on the way to completing the entire questas has been noted by other reviewers the battles tend to be either so easy that you beat them on the first try or so frustrating that you give up after hours of trying
when games are this tough its always a signal to me that the game play is so thin that they make it very hard in an attempt to make things seem deeperbut the more you play the quest and arcade modes the more spells and characters you can get in order to fight online
you can pick your skill lever and your cards and battle it out against friends or foe from around the countryfrankly im a bit disappointed in that it seems there are not many online players for this game
i find it surprising given the popularity of the game but as i said the game is not very in depth with only some  or so odd spells and i think experienced magic players may be turned off by thisalso thus far there has been zero new content to download while a game like rainbow six  has provided  new maps alreadyits not a horrible game but i have to guess its just not deep enough for experience magic fans and just not fun enough for new playersive bought more expensive joysticks before and i always came back to this one just because i liked the layout of it
the problem is though ive gone through two of these because they tend to wear out pretty easilyi dont really use joysticks all that much maybe id use one for  hours a week but i seem to have to buy a new one every year
eventually especially with these logitech ones they get to a point one day where they get so far out of calibration that its literally impossible to calibrate them back ini guess in the future im going to just have to buy some high end joystick just so i dont have to keep buying new oneslogitech has replaced  of these extreme d pro joysticks for me under warrantythey all developed the same problema tickin the joysticki solved that problem by purchasing a ch enterprises joystickmuch better productlogitech always took several months to respond to the problemthen after some roaring and snorting at methey would replace the joysticki waited till codemasters had released the first patch hoping it would improve the game it hasnt
the action is slow and awkward and the use of timed missions destroys any illusion that this is a strategy game
the controls are more clunky after the patch then they were before
with all its problems arma  is a much better gamethe game is ok it is not badhowever if you buy it for the online experience like i did you will be  disappointed
i guarantee that
this game does not work online if there are more than maybe  people the lag is huge up to a second people are randomly kicked and game overagain the multiplayer does not workwhere to start
i guess ill start by saying how wrong people are when they call this game a mil simtheres so many examples its hard to choose from but lets start with a good oneif you ask the corpsman to heal you he gives you a shot of adrenaline i would have to assume its that and not just some silly yellow colored saline solution
if you give someone adrenaline and theyve received some massive trauma youre only going to help kill the person
if you dont know anything about adrenaline or how the human body works easily put its going to make them bleed out faster because adrenaline is going to increase their heart rate which is bad in this case
not to mention the animation of the corpsman giving you the shot is horrible but most animations in this game are  so dont be surprisedthis is honestly more like a mix of call of duty and battlefield i personally had high hopes for this game
while i was pointing out a lot of its mistakes and problems early on ive always loved the operation flashpoint games they were some of my favorites many years ago
but this is a horrible disappointment at least in regards to it being a mil sim and an operation flashpoint gamealso another big gripe is shooting sure the sounds sound like they were recorded in a very confined indoor shooting range
so when youre shooting outdoors it sounds terrible and also it seemed as though a lot of the weapons that you fire lack a lot of the bite that their real counterparts have
to me the game felt like there was very little weight everything felt very floaty for the lack of a better word
its hard to describe but it just didnt feel right from the very beginningalso speaking about shooting it takes about    rounds on average to take down someone
of course these vary some less than others depending on the round and placement but the enemies generally just stand there or continue crawling taking hit after hit and the simple fact that it takes so many rounds to take down someone makes this game laughableeven a single round or two from an m or m type variant can easily put someone to the ground even with some sort of armor it might not kill them but either way they wont be standing by their own will and strength after that type of impact
youre talking about almost  fps feet per second from an m
obviously more or less depending on the round grain and barrel
now a round from an m or m puts out almost  joules that equates to about  foot pounds of force
my calculations might be off a little im not much of a math wiz but you still get the idea
thats a lot of force
of course theres always little variables you can say well in this case or in this particular instance but having to take that many shots on the hardcore difficulty to take someone down is ridiculousback on point
there are so many mechanics of this game that are so unrealistic that calling this a mil sim is a huge slap in the face to anything else thats even halfway realisticnot to mention to lack of variants in firearms as well and customization options
you should at least be able to switch out your m or what have you with other optics like acogs eotechs aimpoints ccos and such
but no youre stuck with whats on the rifle
different rifles have different sights but there arent even that many to choose from
also when you shoot people you get a little tick mark on the crosshair i think that speaks for itself
theres also the simple fact that this game is not even that difficult
i probably only died maybe half a dozen to a dozen times or so throughout the course of the campaign and i always play all of my fps games on their hardest difficulty
but i guess that could just be due to my past league xp being ex cal and cevo main i know its not that big of a deal but its better than the majority for games like  css cod i honestly didnt have much of any difficulty with this game especially with the horrendous aithe main problems i did encounter however is with the other members of your fire teamoften times i had to tell them to board my vehicle then if a fire fight ensued and i had to leave the vehicle to find some real cover i would find that my team mates were still sitting there and doing for the most part nothing
its just a hassle having to bring up the command menu and telling them to get out of the vehicle every time although i can see how it might be a benefit
like if you just had to run out really quick to grab something and didnt want your team to dismount
but more often than naught its an annoyancethe only real use for them is to lay down some sort of suppressing fire if youre advancing on a location like in brothers in arms hh
or for having them point out obvious and sometimes not so obvious threatsalso if your team is in a vehicle and you look at them theyre often just stuck in a single pose
they dont move they dont do anything at all
theyre frozen in a single pose and dont move until something happens
i know it might not sound like something important but if youre playing and you hop out and look at your team mates frozen there it really does kill quite a bit of the experiencethere is also a very limited amount of vehicles you can operate
dont be fooled in thinking you can fly and drive everything under the sun well you can its just that theres not a lot of variety
i think its about on par with vehicles on bf
maybe more maybe less
theres something like a total of  vehicles however theyre not all playable well you can play with them in the mission editor so i guess that still counts rightmultiplayer
what a messfirst of all theres no dedicated servers
which for consoles is ok but for pcs yuck
and its funny how on the pc packaging it says under its multiplayer requirements that dedicated host server are recommended for optimum performance
neat stuff huh
that might change in the future if someone has their own dedicated box that theyre willing to host from but as of yet or to my knowledge codemasters hasnt provided any files for hosting the dedicated servertheres also a very limiting amount of people you can play withif you want to play coop know that its only online coop
you cant play coop offline
and when youre playing online theres a max of  players
theres no ability to drop in or drop out per say
theres supposedly a max of like  people on things like deathmatch and the other non coop modes
but remember since theres no dedicated servers hosting even  people is going to be a challenge
youre probably going to find servers from    people max
at least to have good enough and playable pingtheres a lot wrong with this game and very few things right
the graphics arent that great trust me in the videos they look way better but even with the settings maxed at x with full aa and all the ingame settings set to full i was left with a big emptiness because this just wasnt what i was looking for
plus there isnt that many settings to change either
you cant change the drawview distance you cant change things like the post effects or details in the terrain players etcthe textures are terrible on more than one occasion
if you go to your map and zoom in the map of the island is so low res that it becomes very pixelated before you even zoom all the way in to see your troops
the textures on rocks and the landscape in general are terrible
the uv mapping on them is awful theres lots of stretching going on and most of it is hidden by the games grass which looks pretty awful by todays standardsneedless to say i was highly disappointed with this release
however this game isnt all that bad
sure the graphics suck a lot of the animations are terrible its not realistic the sound isnt even half good
but its not a completely awful game
this is just another badly produced over hyped rushed shooter
thats itif it was  then it might be acceptable but even at  its not worth your time or moneyand dont listen to the operation flashpoint fan boys who rate this as the most amazing game ever
if this was tetris with the operation flashpoint name and called it a mil sim there would still be amazing reviews about it
dont listen to the fan boys you can read tons of reviews from real people who have real reviews about this all overi just started playing this game today and just finish the first mission which took me about an hour to complete both the main and side missions
i did not bother checking out the multiplayer because i heard that theres no servers and if you do get into one bunch of people get disconnected
anyway heres what i dont like and what i likei like the main menu music
i like the graphics in this one compare to ofp
i like the combat sounds too
picking the weapon you want is easier than ofp by pushing the numbers above your qwerty keys
ais are much smarter making the game more realistic
they will try to outflank you
they will take cover behind trees rocks and buildings
oh yeah you can swim in this game
in the first ofp you drown in the water
thats about itnow heres what i dont like its more complicated to control your squad
have to cycle through bunch of menus to get the right command i want as mention with other reviews no free look when driving
i cant look to my right or left or behind me no tutorial or training missions
if you are brand new to the game dont you want to learn how to fight and move and all the other goodies before going to combat default key assignments are ridiculous
push f to use binocular
then you have to hold the right mouse button to use it
i dont think you can even zoom with it
i pushed every button on my keyboard to see if i can zoom but nope no ability to lean left or right which is huge deal when peaking or shooting around corners if you get into a vehicle first your squad may sometime go in with you without you having to give them an order
im like did i order you to get in my vehicle
 you are stuck with the weapon you have before starting the mission
i like the option of choosing different weapons before starting the mission but apparently it wont let you when changing weapon it takes forever for your guy to get that weapon out especially when you take your rocket launcher out
if you need to get your rifle back out after switching forget about it
your dumb guy wants to put a rocket into the launcher first before getting to your other weapon it is always a  man team
unlike the first ofp where you can control as many as  men
however you are always the team leader from the very first mission low lack of vehicles to get into
you are mostly running all over the place mission editor sucks bc theres no preview for iti think the main thing the frustrates me the most is giving commands to your squad
this is truly a waste of my 
why theres no cdkey
i bought this game bc i thought i will need a cdkey to play online
apparently not
i bet this game is already free for download on filesharing programs and you can play online without any cdkey check
of course the multiplayer is currently in disarray and they are currently making a patch for this gamei dont know if future patches to this game will make gaming experience better
they tend to make it better but i still dont want to cycle through bunch of menus to give orders to my squad
i remember installing patches one by one for ofp and that took forever
you have to install the very first patch to install the most recent patch
you probably will have to do that too for this game as wellin summary dont buy this game
its very disappointing and it doesnt even come close to operation flashpoint cold war crisis or ofp resistance
if they implement the old ofp features with the awesome graphics and sounds this game would of been the best operation flashpoint ever to be madethe game is straight forward
you run from one pointer to another you see enemy where you supposed to see him you shoot him and do repetitive missions
no tricky tactics cause anyway everything is scripted
for me its waste of  
going to wait for arma to get more stablethis game is dark dank gritty and boring
the controls are extremely hard to master because you have to use both of the analog sticks to walk and turn and aim all at the same time
the graphics are cool and so are the actors voice overs but thats the only redeeming uality about this lamefest
dont buy this waste of  wait for the next one to come out that game is going to rocki bought this cheap so got lucky on that front but this game could have been so much better
graphically its not bad   bit boring seeing the same old terminator endoskeleton wandering toward you over and over again maybe a different color occassionally but it holds well
the backgrounds are a little ropey and its often difficult to find the way out of a building because the walls look totally the same but its still playable
ah ha thats a word
playable  well i ran through the game  it took maybe  hours got the secrets the arcade games from the movie and all the the extras and movie clips and ermi probably wont play it again unless i am that bored and every other game other than auto modalista are broken i hope that game breaks
but to play it  remember the movie as thats is what it is a game of a movie if you know the movie you know exactly whats going to happen
maybe be if tnt or spike have it on one night it might inspire you to play it againall in all its not bad its not great  itsermterminator basically this games not worth anyones money
i bought this game thinking it would be pretty good but boy was i surprised
this game has ok graphics terrible gameplay and no story at all
i wish this game was never made because it made atari look stupid
the only upside about it is that it has a terminator liscence which is always coolexcept this timeafter playing a lot of mario kart smash bros and mario tennis on my gamecube i went on the lookout for another fun multiplayer excursion
i came across mario golf and decided to give it a shot
unfortunately it was a very disappointing experiencethe main problem with toadstool tour is that it lacks energy and excitement
every hole seems exactly the sameblast the ball a few times and then fiddle around with the putting
there seem to be no cool secret moves or new things to discovernot helping matters are the shoddy controls
putting from short range is an exercise in frustration that immediately turned me off to the whole experience kind of turned it into a buttonmashing frenzythis one will not stay in my collection alongside the previously mentioned mario multiplayersfzero gx is a good gamecube game ill give it that unfortunately the game is way too hard i dont really mind hard games as long as im still having fun but when the games difficulty gets to the point where id rather be doing something else that becomes a problem
the games graphics look great especially for a gamecube game and the soundtracks pretty good but i still cant get over the games brutal difficulty for instance after bitterly struggling through the first few races i finally get the end but the last course is filled with jumps and if you accidentally fall of the stage you immediately lose race after just  retires its game over all it takes is  tiny mistakes on the games final stage and all my hard work goes to waste
this game will only appeal to fzero fans and those who enjoy brutally hard gamesthe game is fun and enjoyable
the weapon and vehicle choices are good
i like the game but i get games for multiplayer value
this game has some good maps for multiplayer but this game does not autoassign teams each game so they can be stacked and if a team wins they remain the same and can just be repetitous with one side abusing that
also vehicles can be abused and the map design itself especially blood gulch can be just a lame gamea team can just squat on portals and above hills and spawn kill you and portal ambush you
players will also portal block you which will force you into one of their other ambushes
the map is also not symmetrical and gives advantage to red or top sideyou would think that before putting it on pc which what originally it was designed for they would have changed that
glitches and bugs and flaws are still thereit can be a fun game but online players abusing things and betraying when friendly fire is on ruins it
free multiplayer but expect cursing and to be frustrated by abuse of game and map flawsglad i own it but sometimes i just prefer a well rounded game like star wars battlefront  over this flawed creationi just cant get excited about this game
outdated unintertesting and a lag in the mouse that i just couldnt seem to get rid of
even handing this one off to a friend didnt win it anymore stars with more complaints of mouse problems and boring play
skip this one get something without the dated graphics and boring playif you asked what my favourite type of computer game was it would be the firstperson shooter
so i was pretty excited when i finally got my hands on this game a socalled revolutionary game for the genre
revolutionary huh
this game is so regressive that i have to wondor what drugs its fans are taking and whether or not theyd mind sharing some with me
quite frankly its mediocre at bestok it does have its good points
the graphics are fairly nifty the aliens arent stupid and the ability to drive is a definate plus
however the level design is shocking
the game looks monotonous
the weapons dont feel at all meaty and you can only carry two of them at a time
the sound effects are simply horrible  from the muffled gun shots to the ridiculous squeeling coming from aliens that look like lumps of trifle and walk like penguinson top of this it seems you need to have an absolute top of the range computer to run the damn thing with it jerking around
im on an amd semptron ghz with mb of ram and an ati radeon  graphics card
not top of the range i know but thats more than twice the processor power and four times the ram the game claims is required to play this game
its not like i have the settings on maximum for crying out loudwhen compared to the halflife games or the medal of honour games for example halo falls very short
as someone whos been playing this genre since doom and wolfenstein d i can definately tell you that i have seen and enjoyed much betteri have a pentium   ghz a geforce  fx  mb and  mb of ram
apparently im exactly the sort of person that gearbox hates
i have to run this at an atrocious x to get remotely smooth fps performance
and even if i turn all of the bells  whistles on and set everything up to max and it become a  frames per hour slideshow the graphics still dont even come close to the quality of the xbox version
very disappointing
i was looking forward to playing halo with mousekeyboard support and better graphics
it simply isnt happening
ill stick to my xbox for now thanksthis game is boringi dont know what the big fuss about it isthe multiplayer is boringits not even excitinggraphics are amazingboring stupid plot thoughtry call of duty for a good fps this yearhere comesthe very long awaitedhalo
boooomits overits gonei cant beleive that i wasted so much money for thisthe quetion iswhats good about this game
ive played great games like medal of honourcall of dutywarcraft etcbut this game sucksokthe graphics are greatbut couldnt microsoft think of the magic words fun and excitingthe company has created award winning games like age of empiresaom etcbut this one is at the bottom of the listdont waste your money on ithalo for pc is not only outdated but not very fun
there is no strategy at all involved and its a very repeditive shooter
there is massive backtracking in most of the levels that makes you go through hallways youve already seen to flip a swich
eventually it gets extremely boring when you are wandering through the same grey room filled with enemies for the th time
the game just isnt very fun
it was bad on the xbox and now its bad on the pc
if you really want to play it for some reason wait untill it costs less than 
untill then just avoid itid like to say that this was a good game but its hard to dofirst of all i use component cables for my tvxbox and ran into tiles that didnt quite meet on a lot of levels
with how well the first game was put together this came as a shock
the game was also disturbingly easy even on the hard setting
it only took me  hours to beat on hard without using any of the loopholes that are in the gamethe other disappointments would have to be story itself
where you actually had some movement in the fist game this game is stuck in one place and when i hit the  hour mark in the game i had thought i was only about a  of the way through
my badalso they recycled almost all of the textures from the other game
as another review on a different website said the water effects that were so stunning in the first game now look old and datedi guess i just expected a little more from a company that put out knights of the old republic and the bg computer series and the original dagood game but the sameevery year they make a new a nhl game nhl  nhl  and so onits all the same exept maby better graphics and changed teamsthis goes the same to fifa and other ea sports gamesthey basicly have the same ideaif you are gonna buy nhl  dont waste youre money on nhl  when it comes out because its gonna be the samemy point is if you buy nhl  thats it dont buy next  wait a  years and then buy a new  which will be nhl  so if you have nhl  or  dont get nhl  its not worth the moneyit is too unrealistic
you feel like quiting on the first lap it is so boring the cars are slow and have bad handling
the graphics are choppy and pausey
this game is for fools
if you want a good racing game expeirience get nfs or nr season instead of this game
their is only  thing good about it
it is cool to wreck that slow poorly designed carthis is the buggiest game ive ever purchased and it does not stand up to ea games shining but rapidly fading history
for example  ive been stuck on a rooftop early in the game covering some guy name klaus while he picks the lock on a door
meanwhile nazis are coming out of the woodwork
after about the th try he finally opens the door and we go to the bottom of the stairs where 
nothing happens
the game is stuck
i cannot walk past him and he just stands there
i go back outside and nothing happens for several minutes
eventually the nazis show back up and i run out of ammo
this makes no sense because we supposedly on a covert mission and we should be running away once through the doorin addition the graphics engine is severely showing its age and overall the gameplay ai etc
is way behindi finally tossed this game system after becoming frustrated with its crudelyconstructed joystick
even a thumboperated stick would have worked better than the substandard joystick jakks went with
i think most the games stored on the system are cool and have their place in history but the cheapo hardware make this system a loserto start i would like to say that i am not that big of a harry potter fan
but i have been gamming for a very long time
this game at first is very complicated
i bought it expecting it to be high paced and hard hitting
to be quite honest the game is borring afrter an hour
the concept is too basic
get the ball throw it through the hoop attack the man with the ball throw it through the hoop
i mean its the same thing over and over and over
its really not hard at all
at the very end the golden snitch comes out but all you have to do is stay in its lit up path and youll winit could be found fun on the first day of having it but after that it could put you to sleep
the best part of the game are the special moves which are tricky combos but are done in cut scenes
there just isnt enough action or violence or speed
if youve read the books you know the game is supposed to be violent and thrilling
this game just makes it seem boring
i bought this game because i had read how awesome the game quiditch was supposed to be but the game is just way too repeditive and anticlimactic
sorry thrill seekers this is not the game for you
die hard harry potter fans give it a trycontrolls difficulty  there is no skill needed just the patience to play the same thing over and overfun graphics gameplay sound  the anouncer is increadibly annoyingthe xbox version is sooo much better in all respects
xbox forevermy husband and i loved the lord of the rings movies so we couldnt wait to play the game
we wish wed never heard of it
both of us find the game much too hard to the point that the game is irritating rather than fun
its neat to be able to be gandalf or aragorn or frodo but even when playing the most powerful characters we have to play the same scenario over and over and over and well you get the idea
this game could have been awesome but as it is my husband and i wish we hadnt bought it
if you are  years old and have really fast little hands this may not apply to youif you like fighting in videogames you should check out this game
the fighting is spectacular
you just beat down those orcs with your arrows and swords its a really fun time
the orcs are different and have different features
also whats new from the two towers version is the you have more characters to play with especially gandalf
but most of these characters exept for gandalf are unlock until later in the game which is unfortunate
it doesnt follow the movie like i thought it would
but you can see clips from the return of the king movie mixed in with the game
the reason i hate this game is because when your playing two player campaign you have to save on two different files and it gets mixed up all the time
the saving system is a joke
you see what i mean when you play the game
its horriblei put this game down after just a couple of hoursi like role playing puzzle solving and exploration gamesthis is not one of thosethis game no longer supports online play
find something else and dont waste your hardearned bucksone question
isnt this the same game as the two towers
besides the fact that there of course different missions and different characters its practitally the same game as beforeprosgood graphicsgood musiclots of charactersfun missionsconsits the same game as two towersthe same point as two towerspractically the same moves as two towerssame music as two towers
i still like it thoughthe last boss fight with golem sucksoverall this gameis fun but the the exact same as beforethe lord of thr rings the return of the king video game is a good game but it has one problem the checkpoints are to far appart
way to far apart
it is really anoying because i  spent  about one hour playing the game
i was doing really good but then i had to face this cave troll unfortunatly it had alot of armor so it was hard to kill
so then i died and i went all the way back to my last checkpoint and quess what i got that chectpoint about one hour before i died so it was like that entire hour never happened
so i sugest you never get this game
of course you can use the game for nice firewood
yeah thats it the game will make exillent firewood
if you want a good game i sugest metal arms halo halo  when it comes out or pgr project gothem racing 
any of those games are fine but dont get the return of the king video game unless you want good firewoodnintendos  is a load of fun packed into one small package
when you consider how limited the game is ultimately you cant help but feel disappointed after only a few days of game play
nintendo could have really done something special with this game and with the amount of time it took for the pioneer of video games nintendo to release it youd think thered be much morethe graphics of  are superb and the controls are smooth and fantastic but the characters and levelsstages seem grimly limited
i loved playing this game
i found myself begging for more
the music element of  was impressive but that wasnt enough to make up for the lack of greatness it could have been
im dumbfounded by nintendos lack of effort towards  and the overall product release
if nintendo was frustrated with the lack of sales this game produced they should have given this game what it really deserved
it deserved morei rented it for about  hour before i took it back
i really thought it was just another boring race game
there was nothing special about it
the graphics were what i expected not bad but not superior
not a must buykirbys air ride is one of those games that many will only buy because it has the name kirby in it a household name part of one of nintendos premiere franchise
while nintendo is not one of those develpers who make racing games  will be coming out this year
fzero gx great game mario kart double dash which is getting alot of hype and kirbys air ride a game that just doesnt seem like it actually came out of the nintendo camp
like nintendo couldnt have possibly okd a game that uses one button
but they did and to tell you the truth this game has little going for itthe game boasts of being a one button game which is basically saying we want to appeal to the younger crowd and get them involved in some of the older nintendo franchises
but after  days of renting the game my little brother was found playing the game hands on the controller sleeping in front of the television set
and the rd day he was saying how he didnt like the game and this is funny cause hes at that age where anything he watches that appeals to young audiances he will like no matter what  if its bad hell like it if its good hell like it
this got me into playing the game
the game has terrible gameplay
like i said before its a one button game meaning it takes absolutley no skill to win just knowing when to press the a button
if you know when to press a you can win
this means that i can play the game for years and years and my little brother can come up after not playing the game in years and whoop me cause he knew when to press a and this doesnt just go for racing in multiplayer
in city mode you can pick up items and while picking up things like the rocket launcher if you pick up something it will begin a rapid fire of rockets giving you no control over where the rockets go
why not use the y button or the b button
this is just plain old silly why cant you use the other  buttons on the gc controller to shoot a rocket why
why
whykirbys air ride does have a few things going for it
the graphics and the colors are nice and bright and the music is good but can get a little repetettive
plus there are plenty of cool feaures ot unlock in one of the modes giving the game a decent amount of replay value
something many kirby fans arent used to remember how quick it took to beat the last kirby game
unfortunatley kirby air ride is the first gc game to support the lan support for a gc game
this means that if you have  tvs  gamegubes and  copies of the game plus an local area network lan you can play the game with  of your friends
this is nice but i did say unfortunatley
unforunatley this game is so unworthy of this feature that youd wish tht this feature came out on fzero gx or some other mutliplayer game on the gckirby air ride is not one of those games you would want to buy or rent
i reccomend that no matter how old you are to not think about getting this game and staying away from itlet me just say of all the nintendo franchises kirby has always been my favorite
naturally last year when nintendo announced that they had revived this game it was on n but got canceled i was very excited
so it was with that excitement i proceded to my local blockbuster the week of its release to see just what the geniuses at hal labs had in store for me this time
words can not express the disapointment i felt the first time i raced
id heard this game was simple but this is downright retarded
memo to hal there are six other buttons on the controller for the reason that unless youre playing a minigame in mario party one button cant function as everything
in this game the a button does everything
it brakes sucks in enemies uses their powers and when over a boost pad initiates it
let me explain how this simply can not work
while attempting to catch up to the kirby in first i sucked in an enemy
problem is a is also the brake so i slowed down and was relegated to third place
now when i used my bombs i was forced to brake again thus putting me in fourth
are you seeing the picture now
but wait theres some bad icing to go on the stale cake
this game has nine tracks
whoever let this game ship thinking nine tracks was enough needs to be fired and hit
many people will tout this games  unlockables as a selling point but honestly they do a horrible job extending this games already short lifespan
this is due to the fact most are utterly pointless such as the soundcheck which at this point shouldnt have to be unlocked anyway
other than the initial time getting use to the controls this game is also pretty easy
once for fun i started a race and just set the controller down watched since kirby accelerates automatically which by the is another horrible idea
i finished second
finally the multiplayer in this game isnt even very good which is bad for a game in a genre where the lifespan of the game pretty much depends on multiplayer
overall i will buy this game but only to own kirbys first and hopefully not last gamecube outing
however this will be when i can pick it up for fifteen dollars at most
i recommend anyone wanting this game to rent it and then should you still want it wait like im doingok this might be a good game for young kirby fans but otherwiseits basically like any other fast paced unrealistic racing games not that theyre bad i personally like fx but the handling of the racing isnt smother or easy and its almost impossible to get any of the cool weapons on the track
i still havent mastered the controls completly
but multyplayers pretty fun so this is actually a good buy if you dont have any other  games or for first timers with the gamecube
especially for the younger kids if they have the intelligence to master the controlsoverall its a good game for the younger kids  or under but with anyone else older might be pushing iton the nintendo  is there  worth of additions
no is there  worth of better graphics
no is there  worth of new characters
no is there  worth of new gameplay
no is two characters in one cart worth 
no is gc broadband compatibility worth 
noface it this game is not a sequel its an expansion pack
moreover single player is no fun at all
has our society become so blind that we spend money on games that we already have all the while there are people in other countries who are starving
i mean give me a break donate  to a worthwhile charity and play the n version for crying out loudif you think madden doesnt change play this game
the one player competes with doa for the title of most shallow
where the hell is createakart a full career or something to give you something new to do
in terms of multiplayer so much wasted potential
where are the bots and level designs
get diddy kong racing on the  trust meive attempted on so many occasions to play this game and to force myself to like it
i cannot
the fun factor just isnt there for me
i sit there driving around bored the whole time
and then theres the musicwtf is with the music in this game
not only is it not good its actually bad
its downright annoying and painful like someone just randomly strung a bunch of notes together and called it a day
i honestly cant get over how terrible it is
theres also so much crap in the peripherals of the screen that you can barely see half the course
i wish theyd give you the option to turn that stuff off
the only reason im giving this two stars instead of one is because some of the levels have nice graphics
but who cares
anyone want to buy a used double dash gamei bought this to play on my new wii because i never did buy a gamecube and man was i ever let down
i have a snes system pretty much just for the original mariokart
its great its something that challenges everyone and can be enjoyed by kids and adults
double dash is so infantile it sickens me
the battlemode options are terrible
who wants to play on top of a gamecube
thats the most uninspired thing ive ever seen
and other venues such as cookie land
i wanted to see sequels to the original advances in the game but the same basic concept
this game is for kids much like the n version look toward the gameboy ds for a better mariokart
a serious let down
if you liked the original at least rent it before you buy it just to see if im telling the truth herei was expecting pokemon stadium  but this is not it
what it really is is just a new edition of the gameboy seriesive been a pokemon fan since red and blue versions the first two games of the gameboy series liking it all
but ever since the beginning it has been winding downnow with the new pokemon colosseum it took a jump down
theres some major problems with this game like wheres the plot
how come you cant go inbetween towns
why so little pokemon
why do the bad guys look mutated
well i can tell you this i was very disappointed at this almost a pokemon gamei say stay away from this gameit was  dollars wastedonly good thing i could say about it is its graphics
ok you have that onebut seriously
the plot is extremely cliche
i remember one part of the game where it actually tells youthe big deal about this game is the multiplayer
i heard its great when you have friends to play with but no one i know owns this gameto be honesti found this game difficult too
and im talking about playing with yourself
by the second stage i quit because it became frustrating
not really but it became boring and uninterestingfrom what i played i did enjoy it
the one thing that got me so frustrated was the controls which is why i never finished the game
im glad that they have improved that for the ds sequel ring of fates
my hope for this game is that they make a wii version and reformat the control system like nintendo has done for pikmin
or if they made a ds version of this game too i would be happy with thatsquare soft now square enix has been known for their great final fantasy titles
from the first ones on the nintendo to the more recent ones on the ps and ps and now ps weve seen great story lines combined with great graphics for the time period as well as a great battle systemchrystal chronicles lacks in most of these departments
the graphics are admitedly great compared to most games on the nintendo system
they are more geared toward a child audience rather than a fantasy audience howeverthe battle system comes across very easy
if one is having difficulty all she has to do is run away and come back after hisher life has filled up giving the player no challenge during the gameplay
in addition there isnt really anything new to the battle play and is very similar to kingdom hearts on the psthe story line lacks intensly
heres what happens
you go out collect something that looks like a drop of water and return home after filing your jar
you do that enough times and youve beaten the game
it really is pathetic and doesnt deserve  the square enix nameif youre a young kid looking to get into the rpg fantasy games this game would appeal to you
its a decent introduction to rpgs but by no means is it the best
if youve ever played an rpg before and liked it dont play this gamedo not be fooled into such logic
this is quite possibly the worst game i have played in quite some time and definitely the only one i have ever played where the best boss strategy waswait for itstanding directly in front of the boss and mashing the a button
i mashed my way through  hours of this game people and i even beat one of the bosses while eating a sandwich and not fully turning back toward the screen until i heard the myrrh tree music
make no mistake this is no incredible feat on my part this game is really that stupidin addition to the incredibly low level of challenge god was this game marketed for yearolds
then you shouldnt have put the ff title on it nintendose
 i havent seen a game this repetitive since pacman
you heard me
its as repetitive as an arcade game  only it was released in  this is truly a development that should put square enix to shame
all you do per level is wheel around in your crystal caravan watching second cutscenes at random and fight your way through three levels of your choice til you fill your chalice with myrrh
wow
each level honestly takes fewer than  minutes so you will probably complete a chapter in all of  what do you do for the next chapter you ask
does the plot advance
the answer is no
you do the same darn thing
again
after a few chapters pass you even have the option of going back to the levels you have already visited
gosh
what an exciting ideathe only cool things about this gameand believe me i really mean this partare graphics which are beautiful and character customization though that is of course minimal
but compared to the rest of the game i dont know i guess ill take anythingyet another complaint of mine is the rotating camera angle
for good games this isnt a problem and your typical gamer would be hard put to find a situation in which it was actually a bad thing
but in ffcc unlike most good rpgs the game is mapless  so dont you dare wander around in a town you arent familiar with or else youll be running in circles forever due to the rotating camera that makes it impossible to tell which way you just came frombecause you are always facing a different direction
im sure ive actually spent longer wandering stupidly in pointless towns where the townsfolk tell you parts of a story you arent privy to than ive spent fighting bosses
navigating was certainly more difficult thats for surein closing the only reason i still own this game is because the store i purchased it from went out of business and i can no longer return it
today however following this review i will put this pos
to rest underneath my massive pile of welldeveloped ps rpgs and forget it ever existedyep
the game informer review said everything about this game
i bought this piece of crap played it for the first  years and just stopped playing it
it was a good idea but if it had had a plot then it would have been awesome
there was absolutely no plot in this game
gameplay was pretty good except that you had to regain spells after each level  annoyingwhen i saydont buy this gameim also sayingdont throw your money in the garbageahh the joys of multitaskingi am a huge fan of the final fantasy series and i thoroughly enjoyed final fantasy tactics for the playstation
this game however i didnt care for much
the sound and graphics were decent but the playability was way down
in the original you were able to rotate the camera angle to get a better view that feature doesnt exist in this version i suppose due to the restricted available memory
for some reason game designers seem to think that more complicaated means more challenging
the whole law system i think is a big downfall
you can make a game challenging without making complicated game mechanicsfinal fantasy tactics advance is a fun and addictive gameto a pointprobably the best feature of the game is that its perfect for the gameboy advanceor at least for frequent short play instead of long sittings
its quick to hop in to doesnt have a whole lot of plot for you to forget this was kind of a downpoint but having played the game on and off over about  months its become a good thing and you can make accomplishments with about  minutes of gameplay or even save during game in a pinch
its perfect for travellingthe gameplay is fun and addictive
its been a while since i played the playstation original but the classes seem better and more balanced and more meaningful when you combine abilities
its a great way to kill a half hour here and a half hour therenow the things that drag it downthe law system is by far its most annoying feature
its basically  a list of things you cant do in a particular battle
there are two results to breaking said law  for a minor transgression you get a yellow card
after the battle it will do somethingbad to your character like lower stats etc
 more severe violations of the law usually koing someone with the illegal move will take you out of the battle and put you straight into prison
the problem is that the yellow card doesnt effect your opponents because what happens after the battle is irrelevant to them and usually  enemies every battle have an ability that converts any severe violations into a yellow card so they never get removed from battle
in effect the law system is a restriction on you and no one else
also if your main character ever gets a severe violation its game over for youthe further into the game you get the more annoying it gets to be because they become more general and more numerous
youll end up in battles where swords fight the basic attack command and color magic white black red etc are all forbidden
great so youve got about  character that can do anything worthwhile meanwhile the other team is all suited up perfectly to not have to deal with those laws
sometimes in a long drawnout battle youll forget what the laws are and accidentally break one
it sucks to get gameover just because after a  minute battle because  of your moves are handicapped it gets hard to win quickly you accidentally break some obscure law like attacking the same opponent twice in a rowwhich brings me to my next complaint
not all of the laws are clearly spelled out
youll remember what they are after the first time you break them but knowing ahead of time is often not possible
for instance knightswords will be banned
none of the offending weapons are labeled as such so you dont get to know if youre going to break the law until you actually do
similarly ganging up has something to do with multiple allies attacking the same enemy hard not to do when its the last enemy on the boardthe judge who enforces these laws one in every battle also is sort of annoying himself
he stands in the battlefield and takes a turn and a space like everyone else
he takes his turn extremely slow thoughjust sitting there for  seconds at a time most often and then moving somewhere or rearranging koed bodies for some reason
it breaks the momentum of the gamelet me start off by saying that ive been a fan of the final fantsy series since ff
each one has been different and had its own good points and bad points
as for ff tactics advanced the bad far outweigh the good
let me tell you the good points first
its on gba meaning its portable and that you can play it anywhere at anytime
players are able to change jobs as in the original ff tactics
the graphics are pretty decent for a gba gamenow for the bad
the story  the story for ffta has to be the most thoughtless and simple ones for any ff game to date
your character is warped into an alternate dimension where the final fantasy video game becomes real
your objective now is to find a way back home how creative
you join a clan of other characters and fight with other random clans throughout the game
you advance the plot by completing various missions
you eventually have to fight your friends from the real world who dont want to go home and convince them to go back with you
you can basically know the whole lame story of this game before you even get halfway through the game
i wont spoil the ending for those of you who havent played the game even though theres not much to spoil laws  on ffta the game has a set number of laws in each location and a judge watching the battle to make sure no one breaks them
at times you can cleverly use these laws to bind your enemies from doing certain things
however later on in the game the game starts placing  laws in effect all at once
this slows down the battles greatly and sometimes the  laws could be barring you from healing using magic or even using the fight command itself
sometimes they even barred me from doing dmg to animals in a battle where i was fighting  animals
these laws end up being more annoying than helpful especially if youre like me and want to build characters to their max lvs and stats
lack of sidequests  this game has a huge lack of sidequests or other alternate things to do in the game
you can accept extra missions from the pubs but half of them dont even allow you to fight but rather dispatch a clan member to complete the mission for a certain amount of time
the extra missions where you can actually fight are often unrewarding and a waste of time
this game lacks a dungeon or bonus area where enemies are stronger than the final boss like in the other ff titles ie
deep dungeon of fft via infinito of ffx research cen
ff etc
sound  if youve played any ff titles before then im sure you know what i mean when i say that the music on this game is weak
the tunes on the other games were so good that you would go to some areas just to hear the music and would later find yourself humming the tunes
however on this game that isnt the case
difficulty  square usually tries to balance the ff games
not make them to hard but then again not to easy either
this one falls in the category with the quotkiddie game stigmaquot that plagues nintendo today
the game is far too easy for anyone whos played and beaten the other ff titles
they made this one in order to ensure that all yr olds would be able to beat this gameoverall i wouldnt recommend this game to a normal rpg fan
get this one only if you feel the need to have every final fantasy game in your collection or if youre not bothered by the huge number of flaws in this game i would have listed more if i had more spaceremember shining force i and ii
remember
those turn based topdown view rpgs on the sega mega drive with cool characters heaps of cool magic and detailed combat animationswell those were classic sega games that came out a full decade ago
compared to those strategy rpgs of yore fire emblem this the th in the series makes no progress whatsoeverit has lacklustre character designs an overly wordy plot a simplistic and boring combat system a lack of difficulty and an annoying support feature which is somehow the developers attempt at adding replay value to this gameoverall to the utter newbie whose only prior experience with these kind of games was with advance warswhich is arguably a better game than this one fire emblem might seem like a solid choice
i agree it is a solid choice
it is also however a throwback of a game
a disappointing retread of gameplay that has been done bigger and betteron lower end systems i might addhow to begin
i will make a short comparison between this game and shining force ii which many of you have already played
let me remind you thatsfii had more exciting animations
in fire emblem most of the art went to the character portraits
when it comes to the topdown graphics in battle as well as the battle animations themselves this game looks extremely poor for a gba game
sfii had more varied character designs
fes characters might look pretty but are pretty much all sameish anime fare colorcoded hair and all
sfii had heaps more weapons armours spells items
it was much more varied
compared to this all fe has going for it is a nice little weapon triangle system and your token herbs and potions
not very exciting
in sfii you could cast spells like gigantic lightning storms which affect entire areas
in fe the magic works just like a weapon
you attack one square at a time
boring
sfii had betweencombat exploration
in fe its pretty much battle after battle
consequently the plot is forced to be told in huge chunks pre and postbattle
not very immersive
sfii was fun and worth replaying
just go try it
in fe however any semblance of replayability is in the form of placing different units next to each other and wait turn after turn in hope of getting new support combos
wheeeit seems abit ridiculous for me to compare this handheld game with a console game but bear in mind that the console game in question came out more than  years before this
the game boy advance is both graphically and performance wise better than the mega drive in every respect
why cant intelligent sys
make a game that fully utilises its potentiali waited a long time for this game
i was very excited having played mario golf on the n to have a similiar game in a handheld format
unfortunately it didnt live up to expectationspros great graphics cool side games that help improve your skills being able to build your skills through winning tournaments and the sound is decent
theres a storyline to follow if you care about that sort of thingcons the ai cheats fairly early on
ill give you an example the third tourney is played on a desert course
the first hole is a  par four
i get a birdie on the hole and when they go to the leader board im in th place
two people are tied for first with 
three under
after one
that means they both got a hole in one on a  yard hole
now thats cheapanother problem is dicey physics
sometimes youll get a ball to roll up on the green or stop one with backspin but most of time the green appears to be made of concrete with balls bouncing yards into the air and shooting off the green at high speeds
the flight path of your ball shown by a glowing line that sometimes looks as though its clear of obstacles but really isnt
you end up putting balls into trees cacti etc
that look as if you should be clearing them
if a ball is close to the edge of a fairway or fringe you invariably are put in the rough
and the rough appears to be made of some hybrid of grass and superglue a cheap way to make holes tougher
then well move on to the course designs
now im all for making golf games challenging but this is where the game really falls apart
trees and cacti are simply put randomly in the middle of fairways with no thought towards realistic or asthetic course design again a cheap way to make holes tough
then there are the quothillsquot
what they actually are are shelves or steppes that eat up ball momentum and fail to represent real world physics or course design
not too mention they make the course look silly
putting is random at best you cant rotate the green to read it the game doesnt give you any info other than distance to hole and those stupid arrows that affect the balls motion at seemingly random intervals
a big hill will certainly slow you down if youre putting up it but wont neccesarily help with a downhill putt
you always need to putt farther than the distance the computer gives youall in all i was really disappointed
maybe im expecting too much out of this game
i know its not supposed to be a golf sim its an rpg
thats fine im not opposed to adding a dimension to a game
however if the basis of a game is golf then it should play like a golf game moreover it should be a good golf game
im not saying it should be tiger woods  but games like hot shots and swing away do a fine job of incorporating stat building with a good arcade style of golf play
my copy of this game will be available at a used game store soondont get me wrong  super mario bros  is one of the greatest games nintendo ever made
i remember paying an exorbitant amount of money so i could play the japanese version before the original game was released in america  and then playing it literally all night and into the next morning
in fact i just had fun playing it the other day on my super nintendowhich leads to the question  why the heck does this cost 
as far as i could tell the only changes are some annoying random voice samples and a few text changes that i cant explain ie
the quotcardsquot that you get at the end of each level are now called something else  tiles maybe
i have a game called mario allstars for my super nintendo
it features four full mario games with extensive updates to the graphics and sound of each game
yet if i remember correctly that game sold for only  when it was brand new
the fact that nintendo now is selling a yearold game for more than  is ridiculousafter dropping the pathetic bombshell that was x back in  capcom finally decided it was time to take the x series to the next level
unforunately as if things werent already bad enough for the series we all know that capcom failed to make this conversion as painless as possible and fans had another halfbaked game to add to their mega man x gaming collectionat first glance mega man x has eveything one would expect from a mega man title
the the celshaded graphics are pretty nice to look at considering x fans are used to looking at d sprite graphics
beyond its graphical engine however x does almost everything humanly possible to ruin the rest of the experience for the gamerto start off the load times are way too abundant
considering  this isnt a first generation psx title and the fact that games like the psx final fantasys have better graphics and faster load times this is just unexcusable even if the load screens do act as continue points
next is the horrendous english voice acting
considering the fact capcom conmpletely disrespected us gamers but not even bothering to add english voices to x this is a little more tollerable in my book at least they tried  i guessanother gripe is were still treated to the same still shots and text story scenes as in x and x
i though the jump to a bit system to a bit system would actually mean something here but no
youll have to beat the game to see ending  the only vmf in the entire game excluding the openinggameplay is where mega man x commits the most serious of its crimes
the d sections of the game play well enough even if the autoaim is a bit glitchy at times
d sections dont even play half as well as camera problems creep up continously forcing players to make some jumps completely blind dont get me started on having to rotate the camera in conjunction to shooting in some boss fights just to see your attacker
even worse is the mass of slowdown one will experence espcially during the boss fights were the game slows down to a crawl
level designs are decent but it is pretty sad considering one can find all the hidden powerups without much exploration i didnt even have to consult a guide  i found everything on the first playthoughmost mega man fans will probably buy mega man x reguardless of what i written above i still bought it and i knew what i was getting into
still i remember a time when you could say you had beaten all the mega man x games and you could say it with pride
unfortunately now all it means you have played four good games and four soso gamesmega man x
the seventh game in a seven part seriesever since megaman x was released back in  hardcore fans of the series were impatiently waiting for capcom to follow up on its impressive streak of solid mmx games i being one of those fans
it took them nearly four long years to finally make mmx and when they did it received nothing but mixed reviews
while it still stayed tried and true to the classic d formula there were a few changes that ended up bringing the game down such as the lack of animecutscenes and a guiding feature that hindered more than helped the game
despite these quibbles however i felt that this game was needlessly bashed by other hardcore fans so i stood up for it
afterall it was still a fun game and it stuck tried and true to the classic gameplay
same thing for mmx only this one got even more criticism by the diehard fans
i personally thought x was a reasonable game though the story was bad but once again it delivered in challenging oldschool gameplay
as a hardcore fan who is open to most games i am willing to defend x and x to the end
however the same cannot be said about the new entry x
read on and see why the negatives outweigh the positivespositivesfor the most part the graphics here are pretty good
bringing the game to the ps was an advantage here because it allowed the environments to be brought fully into the d realm with lots of detail
not only the environments but also the characters were animated fairly well toocontrary to the last couple of x games x actually sports an excellent rock soundtrack
nothing real memorable but the tunes do stay true to the earlier gamesi like the option of being able to switch between two characters at anytime during a level
this helps when a certain part of a level is too difficult with one character but the one has an easier timethough most of the voice acting isnt necessarily great i thought that the voices for zero and signas were excellent
if you pay close attention you can tell that the voice for signas is the same as the voice of alucard from castlevania symphony of the nightand on the bright side x certainly doesnt sound like a girl like he did in xcertain enemies you encounter will bring up old memories of the first few mmx gamesnegativeshere is where the x comes crashing down when a mmx game is no longer classic d then a mmx game has lost its soul
what i mean is by moving the game to d the game loses its feel that most people have come to love
im not against making d games at all quite the opposite in fact
its just that the mmx series was meant to be classic sidescroller gaming and by taking that away the mmx games are reduced to nothing more than a generic d shooter that already looks like so many other games
besides we already have a d mm series and thats none other than mega man legends
i appreciate capcom for trying to add a little bit of new to the formula but this has really gone too faralso without the classic d formula the level designs become drab without excitementwhile there were some places where the camera switched to d sideview in both modes the controls are very sluggish
this is probably what turned me off the most about x
remember how x and zero had smooth controls in all the past games
well its mostly gone now
having sluggish controls is a big nono when it comes to these games because the games are all about fast action and the game becomes no fun to play when your controls arent very responsiveunresponsive controls means the game is going to be very difficult to play and not in a good waya mmx game where you have to unlock x the main character
utter blasphemywhats the point of axl
he may be an easy character to use but hes just plain annoying
i cringe everytime he speaksremember how in x how they thankfully gave you the option of listening or not listening to alias advice
well they somehow messed that up here too
everytime you get to certain points which is like every few feet alia will whine at you to listen to her advice
this is almost as annoying as when you were forced to listen to her in xalso the dialogue moves very slowly and you are forced to sit through everythingthe story has gone so far off track that its become difficult to follow
so zero is still around even after x where he spoiler alert put himself into a capsule pod to awaken in the future where the mm zero games take place
his presence in x completely negates those two games and they are very good mm games too unlike this one heredont get me started on the bosses
its been stated before but capcom really has run out of ideas for bosses
an onion
i wont even touch that onethe gameplay can become very unbalanced at times
while zero can storm levels its nearly impossible to use him on most bosses in the game even the easy oneswhats the point in putting sigma in the game
is there some sort of rule where sigma has to be the final boss in every x game regardless of how he doesdoesnt tie in to the plot
he hasnt been an important storyline element at all since x where he was a big part of the plot
i just wish capcom would surprise us a little in that areawhile i do give capcom props for trying to add new dimensions to the mmx series it proved to be a vain attempt to get a new audience and it ended up only making everyone yawn
since its a bad game overall im giving it only  stars
 star is too low though because i only reserve that for absolutely terrible games
x is still somewhat playable
its just not my cup of tea and thats saying alot because im actually a lot more open to newer mm games than most of the diehard fans are
they will continue to put down x and x needlessly but i believe x is where the low point really is
once the game has lost all the aspects of the mmx series its over
x unfortunately demonstrates that fact
i hate to say it but this is where capcom should call it quits
if you are a new fan avoid
otherwise this game is a weekend rental at bestmega man x continues the mega man x series slide into ruin
it tries to improve upon the formula and that certainly isnt the best idea
a new character is introduced but that cant save mega man x at allthe d graphics arent that bad at all in this game
surprisingly their pretty good
we get to watch a d anime scene at the start and its pretty cool
but thats about as far as eyecandy goes
without a doubt more animations and such couldve been put into the graphicsi cant say much for the sound
a lot of it is pretty bad and while it hits the action notes it just doesnt work
the voices in english anyway are very horrible
the sound effects are cool though but that doesnt mean the sound is all that greatthe gameplay almost saves this game and actually gets it the two stars it deserves
the gameplay is simple just like always
when you select to go to a level you now get to choose two of three characters
either x zero or the new character axl
youre allowed to switch between the two characters as you like
as you might have guessed zero is the strongest of the three and he uses a zsaber think of a lightsaber from star wars if this is your first mega man x game
axl is a new character who has the ability to float in the air if need be for a short while like peach in super mario brothers while the gameplay is good it is quite a difficult game like many other mega man x games it takes time to get used tothe story actually focuses around zero and axl
there really is no real plot in mega man x its the same old select between eight bosses until you get to that final encounter
short game as alwaysits about time a mega man game came to the ps but i certainly woudlnt recommend you get this one
pass this up it isnt even better than mega man xi have been a fan of capcoms megaman series since the first game on the original nes
the colorful environments stimulating music and inventive character design kept me interested even into recent years
after megaman x however capcom has been getting sloppy with the series
the translation and overall production of x and x took a nosedive the music wasnt as inspired and the level setupenemy design was poor
sadly megaman x is even worse than those two games
the updated d graphics give the game a fresh facelift but the hit detection boss design and story is just a garbled mess
the camera in the full d areas often obstructs the players view some of the minor enemies take way too many hits to defeat and there isnt even a sound effect when you pick up items
in short the whole production simply feels glitchy and incomplete
the new character axl is no redeeming factor eitherhes a whiny brat who is meant to appeal to todays overconfident youth
if a good megaman game is what you want get megaman x for ps or one of the megaman zero games for gameboy advance insteadfirst the street fightervs
series drops in quality then the sequel to devil may cry turns out to be a dud and now megaman xwhats going on capcomthis game was a big disapointment
it was almost exactly the same as medal of honor frontline
the only difference was the levels which were even more boring then frontlines levels
the storyline is so stupid that i skiped the in game movies
if ea wants to make a good and different war game than i suggest they make a war game about either the revolutionary war or the civil war
theres too many games about world war  or about special forces games
these games have died out years ago and there still making themthe good world war ii movie clips are interesting you can use cheat codes new arsenal of weapons fun opening levelthe bad wonky controls terrible ai boring gameplay horrid framerate ugly visuals an overall lack of polishpearl harbor was one of the worst terrorist attacks on the us and was what got us involved in world war ii
ea decided to leave the frontlines of europe and head to hawaii at pearl harbor and into the japanese and philippine frontlines
its a nice change of scenery especially back in the day when wwii shooters were coming out nearly every day
the problem is rising sun is a reskin of frontline with the lack of polish detail and just doesnt feel complete
rising sun needed about  months more of development before being anything remotely decent
what we have here is a sluggish boring and mediocre shooter probably one of the worst shooters of the game actually starts out pretty nicely
the bombing of pearl harbor feels epic in this game you are just a nobody sailor who gets woken up by the bombings
after you see the poorly prerendered cut scene you start controlling your guy and it feels very similar to frontline too similar
right off the bat you realize the control issues havent changed
the aiming is really sensitive and finicky theres no iron sights aiming and the controls just suck still
once you run around the boat trying to escape you notice you can save at checkpoints
this is actually one of the only two major issues that were fixed from frontline
the missions are very long and you no longer have to start at the beginning of every level when you dieonce you get out you notice the framerate is worse than frontline
the fps drops into single digits often and it actually affects gameplay
trying to shoot someone when the game is chugging along at  frames a second is nearly impossible
it doesnt help that the aiming is already wonky
the change of pace in the beginning using the turret on the boat and shooting down planes is fun i also have to mention that the only great part of rising sun is the music
medal of honor has a fantastic score across all the wwii games but rising sun needs more than that to save itonce you start the next level you realize the game is just so bad
the level design is abysmal with confusing mazes it was cute for ea to try to make you feel like you have multiple paths but you really dont
it just makes things more confusing
there are also secondary hidden objectives this time around but they are nearly impossible to figure out hell even the regular objectives are hard to figure out
items dont flash so you cant tel if its part of the scenery or something you need to interact with
most of the time you just get lucky when a prompt comes up on screen when you pass somethingi like the new selection of weapons the shotgun type  sten mkii and a few other pacific theatre weapons
thats probably the only other great change from frontline but the guns control so horribly that you wont care
the most annoying part of rising sun is the forced and failed implementation of stealth
during one of the last few levels you get recruited into the oss and have to infiltrate a japanese summit at a hotel
the game gives you the welrod which is a one shot silenced pistol
sure thats fine but rising sun wasnt built for stealth
i shot the first few people silently then all of a sudden i was being attacked
i had to run around the whole level with just a pistol and the welrod
not very fun
the hints say to stick to the shadows and stay in the column areas
yeah sure what shadows
the stealth is just completely broken but at least healing items give you more health so the game is a bit easier in that regardlets finally talk about graphics the game is butt ugly even uglier than frontline
during the jungle levels the devs just put a flat texture of a forest on the walls
yeah good jobs you lazy jerks
the game is just ugly and is so unpolished
the events in the game are so unbelievable that its hard to think that these things actually happened
did i mention theres still no blood
the last thing to go is the terrible ai
the friendly ai just stands there while theyre being shot and completely ignore enemies the multiplayer is also as boring as everrising sun sold millions of copies but couldnt live up to the previous games quality
with ugly graphics horrible framerate terrible ai bad level design and various other issues rising sun stands as one of the worst games in the seriesthis game is just all right
we enjoy playing it on  player amp teaming up
i wish there was an option for auto target or an option to see your man but theres not
the boards are a lot smaller on multiplayer
i think this is a good game to rent but dont recommend purchasing itthis game is a ripoff
its unbelievably short i beat the game in one afternoon
there are only a few levels and its way shorter than moh frontlinethis game is also incredibly unrealistic
i felt more like rambo in this game than an american soldier
you kill the japanese move forward and get ammo and keep killing
you dont have to conserve ammo you dont have to worry about getting hit because theres always health right therethe only part of the game i remotely enjoyed was the very first level where you have to shoot down some incoming planes
after that level though its all downhill
the levels are small and narrow
there is very little room for you to manueverthis game is really really short and really really bad
im so thankful that i rented it instead of buying it
dont get this gamelet me start with the positive  the gameplay is pretty good which makes up for a lot
however the problems are overwhelming
a list  like in ncaa football you get to pick your favorite team the first time you start up the game
unlike ncaa football there is no way to save this setting so the screen asking you to pick your favorite team pops up every time you enter the game  there is no autosaving or autoloading so every time you enter the game you have to load your settings your user profile and your dynasty
and instead of asking you after every game you play if you would like to save everything you have to go through and do it separately
save user profile save dynasty save settingsit gets tedious  typing in names is nuts
every time you type in a players name and save it it takes you all the way back out to the main roster menu and you have to start again
click edit rosters scroll through the hundreds of teams to find yours then scroll through the players to get the one you want to edit
just doing the  or  players on your team is frustrating  you cant use this years actual schedule
you either have to choose your outofconference opponents and hope they will accept your challenge or have your outofconference opponents randomly selected for you
then the dates of the games are randomly selected so even if you get all the teams on your teams schedule this season to accept your challenges the order in which you play those games will be nothing like the actual order that your team played them  when you put the ball out of bounds the little ea sports logo swipes across the screen to cut to the throwin and the opposing team throws it in way to fast sometimes even before the ea logo is finished swiping
this means no time to set up your defense to try to steal the ball on the inbounds pass
this is extremely frustrating when you are down by  points in the last couple minutes  the biggest problem of them all
one of those how do you make that error type mistakes  they set it up so the conference standings are set by teams overall records instead of inconference records
absolutely ridiculous
when i saw this after playing one season on dynasty mode i wanted to throw the cd in the garbage
unbelievablehonestly the game play is great
far better than s final four  which i bought last year and was disappointed by
but its like no one tested the menu functions or save functions or roster functionsand most of all it seems like no one who knew thing one about college basketball even gave the game so much as a onceover before it was shipped
its just not what you would expect from eaplease ea fix this for next yearalthough this years march madness is a step up from last years version it now includes many more teams like midmajor creighton etc and it fixed some of the tournament issues im still sorely disappointed by gameplay and featuresgameplay is relatively intuitive and the ability to juke and set plays are decent yet the game lacks imagination and creativity in its setupproblems with the menu are particularly troubling  you must load your favorite team each time you play as well as your saved dynasties and settings
recruiting is a tiring task which is disappointing since i truly enjoy this feature in eas football seriesthe game is a bit buggy with the announcers calling out the wrong teams name i was up by  pts and had scored  straight unanswered points but dick vitale said my opponent was on fire
i would not recommend a purchase  either buy it used rent it or wait until next yeari rented this game this year instead of buying it because of the garbage that ea had last year
i also played the espn game and it was horrible too
i cant believe that the people that own the best sports game out there madden cannot create another franchise mode similar to the one that is so successful
if they cut and paste maddens franchise mode to nba live it would be one of the best games ever
year after year since live has been on ps we have had the same gameplay except for the freestyle gimmick which is useless but i hope that they change the franchise mode and they never do
this year is the worst ive seen where only the star players get a rating in the s and the next best player on your team is a  who came up with this rating system
and from year to year your players stats never change
you think youre going to be the cavs and make lebron awesome good luck  years from now hes still  or whatever he starts out at the beginning of the game
i was totally heartbroken to see the pathetic attempts at basketball games this year from both companies and i hope that next year they can fix this because one of the reasons i have stopped becoming such a hardcore nba fan is because there isnt a game that i can play anymore to get me in the mood to watch basketballnhl  shows some signs of being a quality game but lacks far too much to actually achieve this
some features were improved others took a step backwards and the result is an average at best game that could have and should have been so much morewell start with the gameplay
the computer is able to use this incredible little quotholdhookquot feature to get the puck from you at will
last i checked holding and hooking were penalties but the computer is hardly penalized for these infractions
naturally you might think that turning around and hookingholding them would be successful but dont worry the computer is able to skate right through hooks and holds
this leads to many frustrating encounters as the computer effortlessly strips you of the puck while you have to bash a computer guy through the glass to get the puck from himthe passing can also be frustrating guys often cut or spontaneously change their direction after you fire off the pass
i thought i had finally got passing down was getting  passing and then i was hit with a game in which i completed a whole  of passes
as far as i know i didnt change anything
the nature of the beast
at any rate passing while it isnt guarenteed anymore thats good is perhaps a bit too random nowthe camera angles are also rather poor
i dont know why ea messed with its cameras but for any of the vertical camera angles the quotupquot net and the area behind the quotupquot net is impossible to find the puck inthe office features are a mess as well
first of all no more nhl cards
ok ok so you never used them anyway right
but you could unlock stuff with certain cards and earning points to buy card packs was a nice extra element
well all that is gone
instead in nhl  there is a menu option called quotunlockablesquot
oh how original
i believe it is tied in with your ea sports bio and periodically it pops up and gives you a new unlockable
exciting isnt itnow how about that new dynasty mode you ask yourself
well its a start at a good mode but is riddled with problems
first of all is this upgrade stuff
you get your team in a crippled state their facilities are horrible and you have to use upgrades to get them to average and then beyond
until you do thats a big ol  ov to your players
but every other gm faces this problem too so the playing field is level  everyone just plays with slow  ov players until they get their facilities upof course thatll take about  more upgrade points than you start with so youll need  exp points
thatd be  trades or  wins
win a stanley cup or two along the way and its probably only  winsthats not the only problem either
dynasty mode conviently forgets to mention when players are injured and refuses to even give you an injury estimate
perhaps this may be related to the medical upgrades but i should still be able to know if hes in serious health trouble or not
the effect of back to back games on your players is also ridiculous dont expect to win the back end of any back to backs your players are literally pylons out therethe big effort of nhl  seemed to go into its dynasty mode
this means the other features are very bare bones and you really must use dynasty mode to get anything worthwhile out of the game
unforetunately while dynasty mode had some good ideas the execution wasnt there
and sadly the gameplay certainly isnt about to quothook or holdquot you in where the features fail haha haha ha the motto of nhl  it had some good ideas but the execution just wasnt therethis game is not that good
the ea sports series for hockey are getting to complex and boringlike this one
you dont have nearly as much control as the other hockey games and the slapshots stinkget espn nhl hockey or nhl hits proconsider this a dual review im reviewing both the original and the sequel heremy first experience with deus ex was when my brother showed me a few minutes of the gameplay on his pc back in  it wasnt too terribly far into the game but far enough that i had no clue what was going on story wise or what sort of gameplay mechanics it used
that was the seed that began it all howevera few months after that i found a jewel case for about  in a used pc store
figuring that i could spend  on worse things i snatched it up and went back to my dorm
took a bit to tweak the settings to balance visuals with framerate the computer i owned at the time was ancient even then but finally worked all of that outand it didnt take too long before i realized why my brother liked the game so muchid played a few games that allowed for freedom of choice before but not to the scale that was offered here and certainly not one that had as much replay value
i couldnt even begin to imagine how many times i replayed a particular level or the game from beginning to end trying something else just to see how itd play out and it took many many playthroughs before i finally could say i sawheard everything
even on playthroughs where i already figured i mustve seenheard everything i still ended up uncovering something newthe game had a stronger emphasis on the shooter aspect than sneakinghacking but the general gaming atmosphere and the expectations of the gaming audience at the time were far different than itd be today so it shouldnt be too much of a surprise that shooting through the game was oftentimes the main path
there always was a stealth route available apparently even the most secure heavily defended bases on the planet all have at least one air duct large enough for a man to crawl through  and they can crawl through completely silent at that
but breaking stealth accidentally or otherwise usually meant a fight until everything around you gathered flies
the fact that decisions in one level rarely impacted the game in the long term was disappointing but it was more than fun enough to see everything it had to offer
in the end the game was easily one of my favorite games and likely always will bethen about a year ago i stumbled across a copy of the much less well received sequel deus ex invisible war
by the time it originally came out i was drifting away from pc gaming as a whole and didnt really bother to check into it before this
i knew that lots of people hated the game but some enjoyed it and i finally decided that there was only one way to find out which camp i belonged inby then i had a computer that was made several years after deiw came out and was far more powerful than the recommended specs on the boxyet somehow when the game began i had to spend at least  minutes messing with the visual settings before finally having no choice but to scale everything  resolution textures the whole nine  down to the lowest levels
if i made one single setting go higher than the absolute lowest itd be a slideshow
didnt matter which one every single setting had to be at its lowest
yet somehow everything at the lowest was smooth  there was no inbetween
not a great way to start things off especially when you already have concerns about the gameand it only got worse from thereits already very hard to ignore the mechanical flaws this game has such as the horrible voice acting from every major character who wasnt in the first game and some who were the clunky gameplay the annoying side quests that i ended up just ignoring about half way in the horribly washed out colors goofy character animations the tad bit too streamlined inventory and magic ammo pool from whence all weapons drew being examples just off the top of my head
these might  just might  be forgiven if the story and characters themselves are great
but these are also two areas where iw failed to deliver
there were zero  literally zero  great plot twists
there is a plot twist towards the latter half of the game that changes how you view the factions but even if the plot twist was mindblowing and completely unpredictable its not
it doesnt hold any weight to the game so replaying the game and knowing the truth doesnt really make a difference
the plot twist in this game doesnt quite hold the same impact as the original kotor when you discovered who darth revan was or perhaps andrew ryan telling you to stop and what he says after in bioshock or when harbinger said what would be his final two words tosomebody whos not shepherd in mass effect  despite the fact that it looks like thats what the developers were striving for
it seems like they were trying to wow us with that plot twist yet it just falls flattheres also no real sense of escalating tension between protagonist and antagonists either
in the original every step forward meant two steps back as it should be
here there were multiple factions going head to head and trying to convince you to take their side but theres no real reason to care about any one of them and the fact that you could have actively worked against any one of them the entire game yet still be able to fulfill their agenda was disappointing
in one instance this can even mean going so far as to kill a key member of the original game in cold blood
you could do that and still work with that faction as if nothing was wrong
no real consequence for your actionsspeaking of factions did anybody elses hand attach itself to forehead upon finding out that one of the factions is  im not making this up  the templars
oh but it gets better
despite being disbanded over  centuries ago somehow the templars manage to raise up a formidable army in a horrible global recession no less complete with walking mechs choppers tanks you name it
you also spend the majority of the game sneaking into killing destroying disrupting and otherwise giving anything that is even remotely templar a headache of titanic proportions
but towards the end of the game that doesnt matter none
nope
the grandmaster of the templar order doesnt seem to care one bit that youve killed countless soldiers and cost him millions in equipment loss
hell still let you work for him if youre so inclined
and unless i missed something the game also didnt really explain how chad went from peaceful protester to megalomaniacal homicidal dictator who would stop at nothing for total control
he was easily as detestable as the grandmaster of the templars if not more sothe endings do require that you commit to a certain path at the very end but only the very end and they divulge largely from each other  they are mutually exclusive
in the original theyre not really so exclusive a fact that this game takes on because the canon ending the sequel uses is a combination of all of them
that is to say jc fulfills every ending and the world is shaped by that
but despite being mutually exclusive and forcing a final commitment they still disappointthe only real improvements this game had over the original are that unlike the first game you can 
play a male or female operative
you cant save get a door code by paying somebody reload the game and use the code without spending the money  this time you have to have the code to open the door
air ducts are also guarded this time
 theres an interactive ai who resembles a major pop star
in one exchange you can reveal the actual pop stars manager doing a dirty deed and ask her what shell do
her response
oh tra la laill probably just fire the bh
that got a good laugh
and the last level in the game was a good choice as it ties the storyline back to the original gamebut those are it
and those plusses do not even begin to compensate for iws many and deep flaws
so in the end i have no choice but to side with the camp who loved the original but hated the sequel
fortunately human revolution proved to be just what the series needs to bring it back into the limelight so hopefully we can all move forward and forget this awful gamedeus ex invisible war  and i feel that im being generous with that score
human revolution i had my fun with the sims and somewhat with the sims  but really why would you play this game if you can do all the stuff yourself
its like playing an interactive life just play a real life instead of this
i would only reccomend this game to people who cant get anything and make themselves and their crush live in a house and do stuff i do not like this game anymore sorrythe sims  is the best horrible game of all time
let me explainthe sims  was incredibly boring to me
i got the idea of the game but there was no point the graphics were awful and it was just lame
so i was hesitant to try the sims   however when i first got it i was amazed
the graphics
amazing
the load times
no problem on my computer
the tutorials
perfect
the learning curve
piece of cake
i was up and running and totally addicted in no time
i played for hours on end imagining that the sims  was the one shining star of video games the one game that dared to do something different and it workedhow completely terribly wrong i wasthe sims  has a great deal of potential
the problem was they ruined it with their muchtouted aspirations feature
this means for example that if a sims aspiration is to be a family man he needs to go get a girl marry her and have kids
or if its career the sim needs to get a good job
this doesnt sound like a problem but it completely ruins an otherwise perfect game
why
because you have no free will in this game
none
i dont care what reviews say or what anyone else says you have none
at all times you must meet the demands of two different panels the needs panel and the aspirations panel and avoid fears
what does this mean
at all times you know exactly what you have to do because the computer is telling you what to do at all times
this is entertainment
no
its no different than some guy telling you ring this bell over and over and you have to do it to win a game that has no rewardnow i knew the needs panel was going to be a factor and its surprisingly fun
who knew it could be fun to do the dishes or lay on the couch
this is where the sims tricks you
then as you get addicted you realize for one thing you have nooooo free time
and i mean none
at all times you will have to do the dishes take out the trash pay bills or whatever
i mean literally at all times because this game is that demanding
your levels are constantly falling and youre constantly trying to keep them at a reasonable or better level
its work work work
also the free will option is an absolute joke
if you use the free will option your sim will be in big trouble
lets say you have  things to do  take out the trash take a shower cook a poptart and put it in the trash
on free will your sim might do  of those things and then be completely helpless
the name of the sims  should be micromanagement to the maxim not saying there arent great things about the sims   its a very different idea at least it seems so at first the graphics details even the music playing on the sims radios is copmletely amazing and creative
but considering they failed on the most fundamental level of video games to give you some control over the game and make the game your own makes this game a true failure
after all isnt that the whole point of the sims
to make something of your own
to have free will
if you dont believe me notice that all the online reviews of the sims  were written by reviewers who didnt play it for very long
same thing for amazon
one amazon reviewer wrote she was hooked on the sims  for a month and then got sick of it
thats about what happened to me
i was hooked on it until i realized what i was doing
now i dont even want to look at this stupid game
so expect to enjoy it for a week or so and then be bored to tears
youve been warnedps
i also had some other problems
you start the game and there are  different neighborhoods with different houses
this was great until i realized theres no way to replay these families so once you mess with them even a little bit your gameplay is saved and irreversible
also i have no interest in building a new house of my own or whatever so this seemed even more stupid to me
also i ran across a couple of bugs
one ruined a whole family for me a baby fell on the floor and a bug made it where i couldnt pick the baby up no matter what
this made the mother so upset she couldnt do anything
so i had to not play that family at all
they could have at least included more families or a way to replay the preset familiesgraphics
amazing
gameplay
amazing
the seemless evolution from sims  to sims  features
amazing
seriouly this is a well thoughtout game is its design and innovation
however ill tell you whats not amazing the fact that i cant get the freaking thing to play on my machine
i have a  p with a nvidia  card and g ram
so you can understand how i felt more than confident my machine could handle it
um well you see the game it simply locks up
alot
maybe about every  minutes it will freeze for no aparent reason even my angry furys of alttab alttab alttab could not save me from the frozen pixelated suburban nightmare on my screen
i spent the good part of the evening trying everything to get this sucker to work
from using the absolute lowest resolution to turning off all background processes to even applying a no cd crack
nada
nothing
zilch
no results
so my advice to you is to keep on checking back to the maxis website for an official patch to fix these issues
otherwise buy at your own riskthe medal of honor games have always been great
until now
this game should be a free download for anyone who still has frontline
it is short and the ai as far as i can tell is actually worse than in the previous game
the quotpacific battlefieldquot looks like a sandwich made out of doodoo brown and mud
real pretty it is
i couldnt tell much difference in the scenery from being down in a phillipine sewer and running free on the beachhead sp
the gameplay is a little tedious as wellmaybe it is a good rentalthis is worth about  if you pay  for this then i have a broken x for the sega genesis with no cables for just 
thats cash only and this is a onetime offer
send all payments toraoul drake pensacola hooker aveshattaboulasuchi la stay soberafter playing the last  fantastic medal of honors  this was a horrible outdated lack of technology version
maybe was not bad for the time it was made but if you are used to todays new games then do not go herewith the newer fsg available this game has shown its age
glad the used price was cheap and i could resell it to someone else
cant say too much more and the other reviews said it alli bought and played this game when it came out in  then sold it and got it again in a collection recently
now i remember why i got rid of it in the first place
id forgotten that the games scrolling refresh rate the speed at which the players view is update is so glitchy and slow
in any indoor scene the view renders at such a low frame rate that it gives me mild motion sickness until it stops moving
it seems to be a framerate problem with a blur when you turn
i have component hd cables and a p  lcd so its not my hardware and have no problems such as this with other games
the models and everything in the game are so bad it looks like a dreamcast port
i think it was a ps portif im not mistaken
that explains it
i was a big fan of frontline so im not bashing the series
all later games really rock on newer systems
this one for retro purposes just fills ones collection but is mostly unplayable
i recommend a newer iteration of the series and steering clear of this onei bought this thinking it would continue the awesomeness of the others before it
i was wrong
the controls are completely backwards and the physics and overall feel of the game just suffersi thought this game was going to be just like ssx tricky but i was wrong
i loved ssx trickey levels but ssx trickey levels are not that great
if you want a good snowboarding game then get ssx trickey not ssx well other than the console fanboys and paid reviews i didnt see much here so ill write a real review
basically ea took the same horribly crippled ssx engine and pasted in new gameplay
much the way the tonyhawk line went ssx  is just a more complex not to be confused with sophisticated version of the last game with even more bugs and play issues
in the first two games these flaws werent enough to keep me from playing the game but ssx  is so horrendously awful that i just cant play it for more than a few minutes before it disgusts me
im not in the know about the stability on other console versions but the gamecube version has crashed on me at least a dozen times in about seven hours of on and off gameplay more than the first two games combined over a period of months  none of my other games have crashed except resident evil 
the controller is often ignored during complex tricks ive tried three controllers
the boost is little more than a colored streak with no effect on speed or tricks and the tricks are outright boring since every character has the exact same tricks
youll find that the whole mountain theme is just a new way to layout most of the same tracks from the first two games theres no freedom to go wherever you want on the mountain even after youve unlocked everything its just a big track and that you absolutely have to do linked combos to pass certain events
the problem with combos is that the default controller layout is virtually useless you find out after using it for a while and that there are so many ignored key presses that its almost impossible to do a good combo or even a lot of tricks
the linking move for a combo is moronic yet its a copy from a competing poorly made game and keeps you from controlling direction and speed
the different players are now a bunch of huge footed drab clones but theres a new feature where you can dress your player
unfortunately i didnt get ssx  to play dressup so it absolutely worthless even changing your board has no effect whatsoever
the player characters have absolutely no personality unlike the earlier games
the tracks have even less
there are essentially five tracks that are modified to look different
the high scoring trickies are gone theres almost no reason to do trickies in this game the call them ubers and super ubers now more complexity that doesnt enhance gameplay in any way and are uber boring
short cuts are there but you have to follow them strictly there is almost no exploration like ssx tricky
lastly id like to talk about the sound
the dj is so mind numbingly stupid and the music so forgettable that i cant imagine a reason to play it with any
even with the music off youll hear your player character saying some of the stupidest things
oh and for those that played tricky and maxed out every player in gold its impossible in this game
players good at tricks can never win a race against speed characters
talk about lame ssx  fits that billtitle spawn armageddondescription this game is based on the popular todd mcfarlane comic that chronicles the activities of once human al simmons whose now turned into a sorta demon
he is hells answer to a fallen angel as simmons uses his new powers to his own ends and seeks to make sense of the madness that is his new existence
take on the forces of heaven and hell as you are in the good graces of neither
 playerplatform ps gc and xbox reviewedlearning curve  this title is as expected pretty linear and in tradition well as tradition based as the past  years can yield  of other linear games this one doesnt require a lot of you to get the hang of it
it is mostly hack and slash but expect to see some mobility learning with the capabilities of the cape and grappling with your chains but still learning is pretty stress free and most of it will go into familiarizing yourself with weapon iconsreplay value  since this is a linear title dont expect there to be a high replay value of this title
it is a good rent for people needing their fix of the hellspawn hero but purchase for the diehard fan isnt completely discouraged
it is now an affordable price
you can pass up a few comics this month and add this title to your collectiondifficulty  expect to see some frustration from the bosses and sometimes you can be swamped by enemies
from what i can tell so far most of your tasks arent time based so play should be otherwise stress free
this is a fun title for casual gamingguide there is a guide available through bradygames for 
like all guides it is helpful but navigating the game is pretty easy and the guide acts only to map certain difficult to find secrets of the game
for maximum fun try to find these on your own after youve completed level objectivespros price nice fmvs variety of baddies versatile battle system for a inexpensive linear game and very fun for casual gamingcons suffers from normal linear title problems of replay and game simplicity spawn graphics in game lack a bit spawn looks too short and stocky the story lacks a bit and the chain effects could have been bettertime expected to invest about a week to give the game a decent run throughretail value 
if you do some digging you can find it for  at several stores and perhaps here within amazon itselfsuggested purchase price under  used or newoverall  for fun factorthis game has had some horrible reviews and i think it is undeserved
i came to this title expecting a total piece of crap and to be honest i found it quite enjoyable
the gameplay isnt straight linear as it does give you the option to run back through the level to explore before moving on and there are hidden areas that you can miss if you arent watchful
i dont think this title is worth its original  price tag but for  i think its worth it
if you can find it cheap i recommend this title
the gameplay is fun so dont expect the monotony of titles like batman rise of the sin tzu and the terrible aquaman title
if you doubt me try it as a rental but purchase is just slightly more expensive i say you save yourself the extra gas money and timenamco has been known to make their racing games ridge racer a few snippets of rpgs xenosaga but the franchise that really sets them apart from the rest is tekken and the recent triumph of soul calibur ii
they have earned the title of delivering the most elite fighting games ever
so its not hard to be a little freaked out when they unleash a game like killswitch
if you asked me id say that they derived the idea from their lackluster action game dead to rights
neither impressive or a musthave title killswitch sadly shares a similar fate
the game does in fact fume out a bag of potential but what it lacks has transformed itself into grave issues that scatter in it
gamers may in turn be soured by having lost their money when they could have purchased another game at the same price tagkillswitch looks as if it were inspired by metal gear and other countless games that follow snake pilskens trend
not to mention a lot of mindless senseless killanythingthatmoves gameplay
we live in a reality where we are told to be the good guys and consequentially it was a pleasant surprise to take the role of a super solider being controlled by a man plotting utter ruination of the world
he wants all countries warring with each other to inspire fingers of the world to press the kaboom button
thats where disappointment reigns namco does not amplify the story so the player can be as engrossed as it sounds
nor does he even care about the character he mans
instead he is forced to do the games ultimate bidding to gun and gun because its filthy funthe action consists of a third person and if desired first person view to get into the gun fest
basically you run into every level and spray bullets at enemy targets
the mission layouts dont really augment your experience or juice up imaginations
most objectives varied in each mission simply has the player reach the end of the stage and perform redundant things such as planting explosives
extremely featherlight on the difficulty aspect killswitchs trademark relies on its blind fire concept
its sure seemed like it would push the fun factor but how can it when its utterly useless
blind fire rarely ever hits the target while the player shields himself behind cover and throws away streams of bullets
the player can just easily rush his assailants with an arsenal of weapons
forced to find cover when pitted with an excess of enemy soldiers the game does emanate a sense of entertainment by the unmotivated yet nonstop action
killswitchs combat is startlingly fastwhat really has me vexed is namco filling the game with excellent and runningsilkysmooth graphics
i mean why waste all  of that effort for a mediocre run and gun game
the lighting effects are solidly done with awesome shadow effects
the models are boosted all around in a nice myriad of fluid textures
vividly bright the sight of breaking windows and swirling sandy air helped me get into the combat
the music is downright unremarkable with retro poppy techno sounds that seem to sloppily bouncethere is this gut feeling that namco could have gone somewhere special with the game and make it deeply engaging
im tired of playing as the blonde blueeyed hero in videogames
i want to be an entity of villainy architect set out to destroy what the good cling onto
namco let the opportunity slip away by spoonfeeing players with a boring turn of events
they have drowned players by keeping the game abruptly concluded with no supplemental material
aside from that the gameplay keeps the game worth getting into no matter if its only a weekend or two
killswitch is not worth the price of ownership for it needs more than little touches here and there it calls for an invasion of themnot quite what i was hoping for in a spawn game
the graphics look great for a ps game but the controls were incredibly awkward even by ps standards
as for the story
im sure it exists but its not a very strong one and to be honest it doesnt make much sense for the spawn character
you could replace spawn with mario lighten the environment up some and you would have a semiacceptable nintendo gamei just expected more from a spawn game is what i am saying considering all of the backstory they had to work with
turning it into story lacking adventure seems such a waste
still if you dont much care for story or know little about spawnand of course dont mind bad controls then this game is the game for youpeople i dont know what you see in this game
its not really a bad game its just an average arcade shooter
more often than not i cant even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly
i pop out from behind something and im dead meat
pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good time crisis gamehello i got this game last week and i thought i would tell everyone what i think about it ok  its boring  the revenge mode only took a hour to finish  the graphics are the worst ive ever seen from thq i mean damn  they made stephanie mcmahon look like a transvestite if you want my opion dont waste your money on this gamewow
to say that this game is a disappointment would be like calling a screwdriver driven into my ear a quotheadachequot
dont fork out your money for this one unless youve rented it first and actually enjoyed playing itthe graphics are better than the last wrestlemania game but the controls are just as frustrating
even when you put a finishing move on an opponent it seems like too often they pop right up and knock you off of your ladder or cage or kick out of a three count
and if you find yourself in a triple threat or fatal fourway match
frustration
youll be trying so hard to face the right guy that by the time you do another opponent will come from behind and put a move on you
ughthere is no elimination chamber match
dont buy this game thinking this is an option
pretty much it has all the same matches that were on the last wrestlemania game
the storymode is a load of poop
you go through a bunch of streetfights such as a construction sight and get double or tripledteamed
all the story mode is good for is getting you to curse in angerin short i encourage you to rent this game
if you have a gamecube and like wrestling games try def jam vendetta
if you have a ps the smackdown series is totally better
find out for yourselfwhen you play it takes  sec after you press the button for the action to respond
there are no special moves no special effects youd find yourself doing the same stunts over and over again
theres really no variety of enemies overall this game is only worth a dollarthis game was horrible
there was no story line and the graphics sucked
the unlockables werent that good and by the time you mash the buttons to do a special attack the opponent is dead
there wasnt any differences between the characters besides the looks
they all had almost the exact same attacks
theres no storyline at all
playing this stupid game made my buttons on my gba go softthe only reason i go on this is for excercise but just like it gets boring the more you play on it the less tired you get so you wont be breathing hard like you do when jogging for a long time
the beat freak game is my favourite because it does not get boringthe  best songs are sing it back and boogie nighti dont listen to this kind of music but it goes great with this mini gamethis game has great voice acting graphics and plot
so far it sounds like a good game but it isnt
i beat it in  days which consisted of running around in the same looking levels fighting the same looking bad guys
its nearly impossble to beat without a guide book
youll have no idea whats going on if you never played blood omen or the soul reavers
one awful thing is that you cant first play the game as kain and then as raziel
it swiches off between themsony must be trying to suck up some cash from people and they are doing that from me
these things are  bucks and i have bought  of these and they are just breaking like crazy
i guess its a good thing i live in a family with money but this thing is just a cheap piece of junk that needs some improvingi thought vf evolution would be better than the normal vf but i was wrong
theres only better graphics more arenas and annoying guitar music along with a new mode
the games addictive at first but then i wondered why i was wasting my time on it because i ended up dragging myself through playing it
vf evolution does not have a single bit of my recommendationthis game is fun if youre bored
you can go across the world and play people in fake arcades
before you play that youre in for an extensive training mode and even if you master it and beat all of the arcade mode no one you know will play with youthis game is okay if you have  billion hours to learn how to rock itgreat game if you have the time
if you wanna pick up and play with your friends you might as well get some kind of mario party game cause this is whack unless yall know what youre doing which hinders the eff out of this gamei would give this a  outta  but due to the learning curve and lack of competition in real life this is more like a you know i really think that all the professional reviewers of this game couldnt have gotten more than a quarter of the way through it or they wouldnt have given it such favorable reviews
from what i can tell on average it got about  stars out of  amongst professional reviewers outside amazoncomin the early stages of the game it is both very fun and very funny
is the humor offensive
no
but its very politicallycharged and anticorporate
its funny to see such a strong anticorporate message in a game developed for a sony game system and who makes video games anyway
not the government
but hey the anticorporate thing sells to college kidsi played this game to within ten minutes of the end at which point i ran into such a severe glitch that i am unable to finish the game
im  hours into it and i literally have less than a half an hour to go and i have to abandon it and start the game over
why
a cutscene that was supposed to be activated once i completed an objective never happened and the next event was never triggered and no matter what i do i cant get it to trigger and there we are
but its typical of this game
if you play this youll find yourself falling through solid floors into blue nothingness killing enemies and having parts of them with sound effects floating in midair and getting stuck inside boxes that are supposed to be solid
and you know how you can charge up the bunny with different things
once i charged the bunny up with electricity and then i got on an elevatorand the electricity remained on the ground floor when the elevator went up but the bunny continued to bounce around as if he were electrified
i cant say it enough this thing is chock full of terrible bugsalso you would need a doctorate in cartography to make any use of the ingame maps
its ridiculously difficult to see where you are in relation to where youre trying to go and panning and zooming to different parts of the maps is badly controlled and awkward
you will constantly find yourself trying to complete objectives with no idea where you need to go or what you need to do
towards the end of the game you have to backtrack through everywhere you have been so far without any guidance as to what you should be doingi was really looking forward to this game before i got it
i thought it would be funny and different
what i got was a glitchy platformer that is so frustrating to play that it makes you want to throw your ps out the window and which contains a stupid political message
rent do not buyim really sorry to say this because i was a fever fanatic back in  and  but its the same game with one exception read and lead the commentary will put u to sleep ron pitts is boring and the soundtrack is awful and still no dynasy mode and many other in depth modes are missing for the real life playerthe polygon count is the only thing higher ten any other title ths year but im sorry its just missing so much madden  ruins this game completely microsoft needs to start listening to the feedback because im just   in  people to agree fever needs a makeover  not just read and lead my god there still doing the same stuff since  guys wake up first off there are like two games in this which would make one think that it would be great
the rpg gameplay is pathetic it is to hard and at night you cannot see whatsoever
you cannot defeat ships or even hit the ships
bad
terrible gamethe graphics in this game are great but the endless puzzles like getting to rooftops gets old i dont usually get mad over video games but i thought about taking it out if the xbox console and tearing itbatman of the ringsthis has got to stop
given the sheer quality of the batman animated series it blows me away that the games can be so subpar
the games appear to be made for six year olds while the series itself often deals with concepts and ideas that are beyond them
how many other animated series have people dragged into drug rehab centers to see what drugs do to their kids or the level of sexual tension between batman and catwoman
there is no reason that i can see that a batman or superman game cannot approach the level of quality in game play that can be achieved by such titles as the legacy of kain series spiderman or even socomin playing through batman rise of sin tzu it dawned on me that i was probably going to wear out my xbox controller given the sheer number of times i had to mash the buttons just to beat up wave after wave of bad guys
quite literally you are a one man or woman army against a never ending parade of thugs batman never beat up this many guys in an entire season of the cartoon
and its always the same work your way through some goons before you can move to the next area you cannot progress down a hallway thanks to invisible force fields that fade once you whack the previous areas bad guys and pray you do it fast enough before the civilian dies or the bomb explodes
i hate artificial limitations in games it smacks of bad design
i expect obstacles but not overly obvious time wasterseither this game uses the lord of the rings game engine or its an incredibly accurate copy
the game play is the same earn xp to buy combat moves and special abilities or coins to unlock trophies to view
i wouldnt mind that so much but the game play never changes rush into an area followthepath and pound bad guys thats it thats all
in all honesty it should have been more like the spiderman games more threedimensional movement and the ability to gain ground from opponents and search out health power ups if you get too low
graphically it is one big piece of eye candy as areas are beautifully detailed and effects are lively while the colors are vibrant just like the animated series
all the voice actors are there as well making pithy oneliners as they punch out the villains
the music is superb all around and carey tagawa does an awesome job voicing sin tzuthe combat system is neat but too limited by its design and game premise
earning more powerful attacks and combos is a great idea but you are hampered by your environment even though youre meant to use it against your foes as they will against you
you cant explore its all combat
no ability to jump on to objects or climb no real use of what batman is known for hes a detective
he solves crimes but in this case his methodology involves beating up every scumbag in gotham until he gets the right ones
the cut scenes are all batmanbased so its a little disconcerting when you defeat clayface as batgirl only to swap to batman for the moviethis game loses so many points for its annoying features artificial impediments being a fighting game masquerading as an adventure game stupid mission goals that only vary between protect the civilian protect the door and disarm the bombs
and dont give me one way and only one way to beat the endlevel boss let me devise my own or pick from a list of possibilities
make me think let me solve puzzles not just bash things it gets old very fast
so mega points for the look and sound of the game but minus loads of kudos for everything else
let me jump swing climb swim explore drive and fly not just follow the game designers whims and the path they have laid out for me
i expect more for my money and so should youthis is a decent game the only reason i gave it  stars
the story is great and it is a well developed game that goes along the lines of the getaway and grand theft auto iiivice city
but the loading times are rediculous
they put missions on different parts of the city knowing that you have a loading times across cities
not only that but the loading times are unbelivably long
it is a great game but if you are not a very patient person this game isnt for you
take away the load times and this game is an easy  or  star gamei never seen this game on the pc but when it came out a few years ago it got rave reviews
so i decided to check it out on the ps
uhm i shouldnt have
its one of the gta  clones and the worst one yetfirst off the graphics are great for a console
the city resembles a little of chicago of the s
the gameplay is decent the navigation is easy
there are no random search for items backtracking or impossible missions
the constant save points tend to limit replaying the same part of the level over and over again
the cutscenes though sometimes are really dull and cliched are decent enough to be watchedthough it tried to be like gta its unlike gta in that the city and the missions are not seamlessly integrated
its basically drive to one place and cut to the third person perspective
not that immersivethe driving is horrendous
definitely not as bad as the getaway but really slow and dull
the police will sometimes stop you for speeding
its really more irritating than realistic
the cars themselves are pretty clunky though they improve somewhat later
finally there really is nothing fun to do while driving
they made it as dull as well driving across town in a station wagon
mostly all the missions require you to drive from a bar to some other part of town and its really mostly the same road
there is no fun in exploring
the music is some s slow classical jazz that either annoys you or puts you to sleepthe third person perspective is fine except for a couple of glaring glitches
when an enemy comes up close to you the firing mechanism just entirely fails
they just ignore your shots and punch you to death or kill you with one shot
another bug is the fact that shooting at someone is completely random
it might take one shot to kill a guy but if you repeat the mission it might take six head shots the next time
vice versa the other way
you might get blown away in one shot while other times youll traverse a huge mission while only losing ten percent of your healthfinally the continuity of the game is just wrong
almost every mission starts off with a load time and a cutscene and another load time
then you have to get a gun right down the alley this entails another cutscene
then a car right down the stairs which has another cutscene
then you leave the head quarters which triggers some more load time
usually you have to drive to the other side of the town
the worst part is while driving the other half of the city triggers another load time
it takes about ten to twenty minutes to actually start the mission
about one third of my playing time was devoted to this stupidity
really they couldnt just have given me the car weapon and start me off at the correct building and saved my sanity
really
also in other parts of the missions the automatic save points and other loading times lull me into sleep
some of the hardest parts of some missions was staying awakeprosgood graphicseasy navigationcutscenes are goodno walkthrough neededautomatic save helpsconsdull drivingloading timeuseless drivingmissions contain useless partsclose range firing bugsuneven combatlack of continuitycannot save at any pointbad musictime to complete  hoursdifficulty easy to mediumfrustration level medium to highthis game really is bad after youve played one of the socom games
if only you are playing this game it is really hard because your teamates always do the dumbest things
all you can tell them to do is follow you
bad graphics and it feels unsmooth
with  people this game is very fun because you can split up and do separate objectives or distract a tank while your friend places a c next to it
aiming is not set up good because it is auto aim and is too hard to hit the guy that you want to
ememy ai is still pretty dumb and will aimlessy run at you
you can stand right in frount of a tank up next to it and it cant touch you
more challanging than the first and better missions
very bad level design
not a very big improvement over the first
you could possibly beat it in a rental
smart that you can give and trade things with your partnersi got hma wondeful life and loved itsimply loved iti played until midnight the day i got itand kept on playing every dayi decided to try the gba hm a spin and i was disapointed with what i gottime goes by to quicker than in awl and the years take too longthe biggest problem is that it gives you no reason to keep goingin awlas the years go byyou get marriedhave a kid and watch him grow and help influence his careersureyou can get married and have a kid in this onebut that only means you get to talk to them everyday so they dont hate youin awlyou can do so much with your sonhere you just talk to himthese daysi have stopped playing awl and fomt is forgottenbut ill always love awl and hate fomtthroughout my childhood harvest moon friends of mineral town was a big part of my life
i still give it repeated plays and treasure the memories i had exploring the game
it will always be one of my favorite video games and i would highly recommend it to anyonebut this game is not in the closest to earning that same praise from me
i learned about harvest moon a wonderful life from a younger friend
when i saw it being played at her house the graphics looked so beautiful and it seemed like something to be enjoyed
wow looks can be deceiving
first of all i want to praise this game for the beautiful graphics and design
it also brings in a lot of unique ideas such a different kinds of cows and ducks and being able to grow trees
i really liked how you interact more with your family and raise your son
now the negatives
the farm chores are incredibly boring and watering plants feels impossible
i prefer the class farming feel of the previous games
days and months drag on and on
maybe this is just me but i prefer a more high speed feel
it is more fun to just accomplish one big thing a day
the festivals are completely boring and all of the characters besides the three main girls you can date are dull and one dimensionalnothing ever changes or happens in this game besides for your son
the town stays boring the days stay boring the farms stay boring it is just an all around boring experiencei feel like this game had some potential and good ideas but with such a terrible farming system and town it just is not worth playing
you are much better off purchasing harvest moon friends of mineral town or harvest moon although it has a few promising traits this was a very bad first attempt for a nextgen yugioh
game the gameplay is repetitive and tediously slow
your stuck with three minor monsters for a long time and there are no cutscenes to speak of
over all this makes the sims look like an action game
my advice
only buy this if you have a lot of time on your hands and you dont get bord easilyit seems impossible for any company to make a good game based on a franchise
this is no exception
while somewhat entertaining and strategic falsebound kingdom can be infuriating and features basicly the same gameplay level after level
hardcore fans will enjoy this but casual gamers most likely will not
make sure to rent it  before you buy it
you might not want to be stuck owning this gamemany of the video game magazines are of the opinion that this is the first d castlevania game to be worthy of the name
it is better than that joke on the nintendo  but thats not saying muchthe action is tedious and repetitive and the levels are way too simple for their size
youll spend a lot of time just walking all over the place to hit switches
boooring
to make things worse most of the rooms are nearly identical
while playing this game i felt like a rat running through a maze looking for my piece of cheese
the music is weak too and i was really expecting better in this department since the music for super castlevania  bloodlines dracula x and symphony of the night was first classif this kind of game interests you id suggest devil may cry or metroid prime
theyre actually goodi played this game and it made absolutely no sense  maybe if it was yaoi or something itd make it worth playing
but i recommended devil may cry  anydaykonamis ps run in my opinion has been a huge disappointment with the exception of metal gear perhaps
even that game forced you to play as a character other than snake and what about the narrow minded and stripped down suikoden ivquotbut its d
quotwho cares
castlevania and the rpg mentioned above are admirable but are basically letdowns
when you really sit down and think about the game you are playing and what it is your doing you will realize that you are not enjoying yourself
you might think you are but your notgranted if you look at it like a simple oldschool button masher with d graphics you might enjoy it
but i for one could not have been more disappointedbasically you run from room to room or corridor to room to corridor to room and whip monsters constantly by jumping around and pressing the fire buttonyou do this constantlyi repeat constantlywith no environmental interaction
very little character growth ie
experience weapons
very little of anythingyou cant even look around the rooms to enjoy the great graphics
not as great as devil may cry
the wall clipping is a bit goofy toothe only quotpuzzlesquot you have are bacically navigating a few rooms and finding buttons or sculptures to push to unlock doors
some rooms use the very bad camera angle to quotchallengequot you
if you know what i meaneventually you come to a boss and defeat him and return to the castle entrance to pick another quotworldquot and beat another boss
when you beat all  or  bosses cant remember how many you advance to towards the end half of the gamei felt tired of mashing one button for hours travelling through similar and i mean similar rooms and corridors
fighting a boss or two then repeatingis this really what castlevania has become
there is no way in that the same programmers from symphony were paid to design this gameutter utter disappointment so far
id rather just play the st devil may cry insteada real heartbreakerbut its in dwell when we look at this game we are faced with the origin story of leon first and most vile apparently belmont and how he began his struggle against all monsters
he enters a castle in an attempt to rescue his beloved sarathis game sports killer graphics nice animations and awesome renditions of some classic castlevania enemiesbut its not for castlevania fans like me
let me tell you whyfirst the sound
i have precious few problems here
the music wasnt up to the level of symphony of the night but it was pretty good
the voices in turn were actually done quite well considering what they were asked to say see story presentation
secondly the graphics from a technical standpoint were really quite good and the characters and monsters wellrepresented in appearance but i had a few problems
first off the cutscenes
when the cutscenes in the game were in effect the characters would frequently sway back and forth or jerk around as if they were bored and many of those body motions were quite uncalledfor
secondly the whip
in midgame you use a whip to quotswingquot from place to place and to attack monsters but unlike a real whip no skill is required to twirl it around or aim it at your enemies
you just thrust it forward like a sword
as for the whipswinging all you do is smack the whip against a pole and watch yourself get vaulted over it like youre using an iron pole instead of a whip
whipswinging should look like webswinging
the whip was handled better in quotcircle of the moonquot third the environments
im sorry folks i really am but the environments were ugly and confined
when one plays a game like symphony of the night one finds oneself in vast glorious halls dressed in a fancy style and welllit for the most part
this game just had a bunch of dark hallways no more than a dozen feel in any direction and the few large rooms you do visit dont feel glorious at allmy last problem with the graphics was that this game uses a static and rigid camera and although its often a cooperative one sometimes youll get to an area and say quotgee i wish i could see above me or below me or off to the sidequot that got truly annoying after a whilenow story concept
well its a fairly interesting story about leon belmont the first of the belmont clan to fight monsters
the story was even in concept destined to be a poor one however since the series central draw for me count vlad tepes dracula is missing from the game entirelystory presentation however really drags it down
the scriptwriting or was it the translating
was truly bad and just felt lame cheesy and depressing
leon uses a whip made from alchemy and no distinction is ever drawn between that alchemy and the one used by the vampires
leon does not even strike me as being that good of a person except in his description in the game intro before you meet him
in all the other games a belmont or someone else would enter the castle of dracula known as castlevania and slay him
in this one leon enters a castle that is plainly not castlevania and slays several creatures that are plainly not dracula with weapons that are not plainly good
in past games the belmonts are always drawn up as good and holy men who always try to do what is best
leon seems like more of a griefcrazed fanaticthe gameplay itself doesnt even compensate
gone is the experience engine of the past several games that made them more fun than most rpgs
gone are the vast numbers of common and rare items that made sotn and the gba games such a hoot and what has been added in their place is a bunch of switchpushing puzzles and mazeexploringi dont know why konami thought this would be good
instead of a righteous warrior fighting evil beasts for the good of all we are given a depressed revengedriven person who crawls through dark tunnels after the next big treasure like a mole or packrat without the startalent of the series main villain as backup
i only rented this game but i have already beaten it with all secrets except the playthroughs in different modes
is this d castlevania game worth playing
yes it is
but not more than once and i wouldnt say its worth buying
frankly i thought circle of the moon was better
i do think konami could make a truly good d castlevania but this whole game felt like it shrunk in the wash considering how much this game lost in the d translation id just as soon they stay d in the future unless they can manage to do it right next timeit lacks camera controls which i simply do not like in a gamei put this game down after just a couple hoursseems to be a pure beat em up which is not my personal cup of teathis game could easily have been great
the main character moves with ease and his moves are complex
theres an expansive list of upgrades items and abilities all great things for a castlevania title
however this games perfect character interface is where the good ends for methe world starts off good enough great even
at least when you step out of the forest and beyond the castles first few rooms and into the first of five worlds of the game
soon you realize that the developers were rushed to complete a game for konami
the rooms and hallways youll notice within the first hour have been cut and pasted throughout the entirety of the games  levels
the skins of the rooms might look different a little but youll see the similarities unless of course you are blind that isthe music is great also at first anyway
the soundtrack when first entering the castle is quiet creepy and atmospheric
as you continue onward it gets betterfor the first floor of the first level
then wellthe soundtrack becomes a bouncy and annoying blend of club music and gothicnot a good mix in my opinion at least not to the extent that this soundtrack took it
the music was way too active and obnoxious for the lack of action that is really going on on the screen in front of you
that said the first few tracks in the game are some of the best in the seriesthe bosses are way too easy
the puzzles are way too simplistic
and eventually you find yourself wishing the game would have simply been made with d graphics and d level design why not
castlevania is to me a platforming action rpg
lament of innocence has a few moments of platforming throwbacks but theyre ruined by the games unmovable camera
this game pretty much relies upon its stationary camera angle because if you were allowed to move it youd be able to see all of the games hidden items plain as day thats bad game design if you ask meits sad to say it but as hard as i tried and wanted believe me i was pumped to play this game again it to be a great cv game it simply is not great
its better all other d castlevania games however lords of shadow included
but thats not saying much being that game was a mediocre ripoff blending of god of war and shadow of the colossusi wish there could be a great d castlevania but until they keep the simple things in the game that make castlevania castlevania intact theyll fail over and over againrating system star   disaster of a game nintendo gamecube stars  average game stars  good game above average stars  awesome game stars  best game ever changes the way we look at thegaming idustry very few of grand theft auto castlevania lament of innocencelament is an extremely plain and strait forward action game it has really no plotline or character development
in todays market of games this kind of strait forward action no longer gets it done
devil may cry did much more in the way of graphics interactive bosses and environments but even dmc isnt much better than an average game
lament of innocence just seems outdated and plain once youve swung that whip at creatures for the first  or  levels youve already done it all
there isnt even the need to try to advance to harder levels as you can take on any of the  levels in any order you want
not to mention you can enter and exit levels as you please so you get to see the concept of all levels from the start of the game
i was interested in seeing how much more this classic franchise had to offer and i found out it doesnt have much
konami might think about retiring this franchise and really focusing on metal gear solid and silent hillthe final verdict here is that swinging that whip provides some fun you should rent this game a couple of times and finish it but its definitely not worth buying
if for some crazy reason you havent played the original devil may cry yet id suggest you buy that for about 
thats of course if this kind of game interests younot great the ais are awful most of the cards that are famous for their effects like morphing jar and magician of faith have no effect spelltraps are almost useless your deck throughout the game is pitiful even if you get a good card your not allowed to use it until youve battled the same cheap ais over and overthe reasoni was generous enough to rate it  stars was for the story it followedi dont know
i guess im just not good at games like thesemy mind doesnt work that waytheres a lot of people who do have those skills thoughi guess i just suck at rpgs except zeldawe love mario but we cant figure this game out at all
my  year old wont even play it anymore
i dont get itas the subtitle of the game implies it is the real driving simulator
gt attempts to imitate driving in real life and does a pretty good job
the cars and race tracks are beautiful
and theres plenty variety of cars to choose from
but gameplay can be frustrating and drive you up the wall if you cant master cornering or brake at the wrong time and spin outi for one just suck at this game since i couldnt get used to cornering
heck i didnt want a realistic experience in driving or buying a car
i just wanted to race
so i jumped in headfirst picked the coolest car i could find and drove like a maniac around the track only to spin out and lose the race
this game as i found out too late is more suitable to those who want a classy lifelike imitation of driving a real car
but i didnt want that
i never shouldve listened to that review of this game off of youtube
this game is not easy
its hard and requires much time and dedication both of which i dont have much of especially to a game of this difficultyguess i shouldve gone for a racing game like burnout huhthe realistic driving experience here is authethic and im sure someone out there loves it
but this game was more infuriating than fun for meand now has a permanent spot under the other games in my collection wasting away
what a waste a money
i bought it new you know
and i cantget a refund for a product that works fine but i suck at using it
what a wastei liked gt and loved
gt so let me begin by saying this game does not measure upthe sad part is that there are a ton of cars including used cars and really neat historical cars but that is not enough to save this game
my problem with this game is that driving cars is too darn hard i cant even corner going  in a super car most of the timewhat else is wrong
no f cars
i really dont know how they avoided putting them in this game
it was too tough to drive with cheap cars and the same was true for super cars just stick with gt and save yourself the headacheafter a long time playing with gt only thing that wasnt there and wont be there in the th installment is online
first they say no then yes then guess what no again
this game is going to play just like the last only improvment is the newly added cars still gameplay is the same from the prolouge game that came out on early august and well thats it
the no driving sim my a theres no online mode they kept me waiting saying that itll be online and when they announce the official release date they manage to say that its not online
how does sony the publishers of this game dont seem to add in their trademark online mode
makes you think
notguess ill have to wait for need for speed underground  atleast that game has online mode the heck with wasting my cash on this garbagein order to be impressed by the graphics you need a hdtv
without one its a touched up gt jaggies and all
the city tracks are nice to look at but the actual race courseslaguna seca are poorly done especially considering there are only  cars per race
i didnt want to use the f wordim not even getting it but the sidebyside video between gt and forzas laguna seca is an eyeopener
the ps is capable of more than thisto notice the physics differences your going to have to have the  wheel
this is the only real addition worth buying the game for but most people are going to skip it due to it being as much as a new console
the bottom line is the game in this day in age feels dated and wooden without the wheel
now this doesnt apply if you didnt play the other gts but what the hell kind of racing fan hasntthe interface is pretty much the same as always
sure some things like races are better organized but they are just sprawled all over the place on the map
and you know that little garage icon from earlier gts
say goodbye to thatfor all the delay hoopla nothing meaningful was done except pd playing around with obscure japanese cars
no online play ai or damage will mark the gt series downfall
enthusia nevermind inevitably forza might take the crown away this year
unless you meet the farfetched criteria needed to see changes you are better off passing on this gamenot as good as gtgran turismo  is like robots taking over the world
if they conquered there would be peace and everything would be perfect
but everything would be bland and uncreative
gt has a great amount of potiential
the game has great graphics lots of cars and tons of features like taking pictures of your car
it is very realistic
what will irritate you is how the game feels
the menu icons in gran turismo mode are scrambled confusingly without a garage icon
the racing portion just feels way too slow
it might just be me because once youve played burnout  for a month or so anything feels way to slow  the speedometer says  miles per hour but it only feels like your going   its just sluggish
the drivers licences are annoying and seem much harder than gts
most cars you wont want to drive anyway
do you want to drive a scion xb or a honda insight
me neither
did i mention gt is a real memory card hog
it takes up  kb which is about ten times as much as a normal game
the memory card icon is simply a white bland cube that has gran turismo  written on it
that fits the game alright
uncreative
the game has very little creativity the only really new addition was spectators
the cars handle like bumper cars
it feels hard to make a slight turn
there are no damage or crashes
 how realistic is that
they held off this game for about  years and they couldnt fix these problems
overall this was a very disappointing game
this wasnt worth the wait
you have little to no fun playing this
instead i recomend the awesome burnout  which breaks away from annoying realism is extremely and overly fast adrenaline pumping and most of all is really really funthe main problem i had with mp is that it just takes so stinking long to play a game
i also have mario party  for nintendo  which is the best game in the series and it has options to allow you to skip the cpus minigames and speed up the movement of the characters
mp doesnt have this
what it does have is special quoteventsquot and bonuses on nearly every spacethe result is that it took me about  minutes to play a turn game the other night when i can play a turn game of mp in less than an houri do not like the concept of the quotcapsulesquot either
instead of buying bonus items from stores you get a quotfreequot item every time you pass a gumball machine and you have to pay to use it
problem is the game asks you before every turn whether you want to use a capsule or not
annoyingalso a problem in this game even more than the other mp games is the excess of animations that slow down the game even more
the boards also seem to be overly complex sometimes youll go through an entire game and none of the players will ever get a starthe minigames which are the heart of any mp game seem very dull
only a couple seemed not to be derivative of the previous games
on the plus side the graphics and sound of course are very nice especially the d game boards
but no one plays mario party for the graphicsi love mario games
theyre the reason i bought a gamecube
i rented this because i was interested in buying it and i was sure it would be an excellent game because the other mario bros games for the gamecube are very good
i was totally absolutely disappointed with mario party  and im glad i rented it firstfirst of all you cant just play minigames by themselves unless you unlock them
i think the board game part is ridiculously boring so id like to just be able to play minigames
unfortunately the only way to get the minigames is to play through the stupid board games
and get thisin this game no matter what the mode you must have  players playing it at a time
that means if its only you and two friends playing the party mode you must have a computer player in there also
and guess what the computer always gets a high roll on the dice always wins the minigames even if you set the computer players level to easy and always gets to the first star before you do
it totally stinksand dont even think about playing alone  the only way for one player to play is to play the stupid board game party mode against three computer players
that means you spend a lot of time watching the computer play the game because you cant skip past the computers turns
you have to watch them every time
that is one of the worst things about this game
even if you have three human players watching the computer take its turn always feels like a waste of timealthough the minigames have simple controls they often involve extremely careful timing or quick alternating of which button youre mashing which makes things much much more difficult
and of course then the computer always winseven on the easy minigamesthe graphics arent bad but theyre nothing special
not much to say about music either because if its there i dont notice itits all the same
if you want to play a good multiplayer game with some friends get mario kart double dash or super smash  bros melee
this game is no partymy brother got this game last xmas it came with this useless microphone lol anyway we loaded the game and it was pretty dissapointed at least for me ill tell you why the ingame voice is not good specially i hate daisys voice is just not that good and it can be very repetitive
you will just like to turn off your tv
characters the same old ones yoshi mario luigi wahh but these ones are the original see
but then nintendo wanted to come up with this lame idea to put wario daisy and another guy that looks very tall this is dissapointed cause they are just a bunch of duplicated characters with differents clothes
the gameplay is good but is just the same trick in every sequel they make
is just the same thing with another set of graphics and new minigames
the game here suffers in being repetitive specially when you play it alone this is pointless cause this game is no fun if you are not playing it with someone else is more funny in multiplayer but as i said is very very repetitive the game chooses the minigames for you is just get very repetitive
dont get me started this game is pointless if you just have one gc controller the controls are nice but it depends on which minigame you are playing the learning curve will take about  or  minutes to learn or maybe less as i said it depends on the minigame
the graphics are good but not excelent this is why i gave it a  stars ratingwell if you have more  than one gc control pick this up if not avoid it otherwise it will get veryyyy repetitive in both multiplayer or story modethe mario party franchise is one of the most wellknown game series and has known to be one of the most fun
however after playing and beating mario party  i must say that it is evident that the developers lost their touch and are running out ideas
all and i seriously mean all of the the mini games are either boring button mashers or mini games that weve seen in mario patrys    and  i was greatly disapointed by this title because i did love the first four mario partys but this one is purely unoriginal
i know one could say that it looks good because they added a single player mode and still has a great party mode
however who honestly cares that a game has a single and party player mode if the gameplay itself is boring
the answer is no one
take the word of a hardcore gamer that has beaten the single player mode of this game and played through the party mode this game is not worth 
if you want a party game seriously your better off getting mario party  it has the same graphics better price and is a better game
only extremists of party games and the mario party series that have all of the previous installments should consider buying this game when it becomes cheaper
but for the average gamer and as of right now youd be better off saving that you notice how in movies and books how  of the sequals are s
well guess what
its the same thing for video games
i must admit that the old marios were tons of fun
but then that stupid nintendo  had to come around and start the new marios
you could by an old nintendo system and a classic mario game for almost half the price of this garbage
and i can guarantee that you would get more enjoyment and playing time out of a classic then one of these imposters
plus  of gamecube games suck
if the title of this game didnt have the word mario in it this game would have a hands down  star
do yourself a favor and run as far away from gamecube games as you canwrath unleashed seems to be an attempt to capture the magic that was known as adeptarchon on the c ages ago
its a simple formula but youd be surprised by how badly they mess it upthe load times are atrocious considering the content the game spits out
the battle maps are adequate at best with little graphical candy to spice it up
strategy is also severely hampered since the only variables are distance and terrain type
its really not too complicated and yet it takes  seconds to load it after every fight
the fights themselves take  seconds to load and you are confined to the smallest arena of any kind of fighting game
considering that the ps can pump out much much more than what wrath unleashed does the load times and puny arenas are a crimethe battle themselves lack depth
everyone has a projectile
everyone has the same chains of melee attacks
they just have different animations and even those arent very impressive
the special magic attacks are pathetic
everything boils down to light melee attacks because everything else will be too slow and youll be hit instead of doing your moveto sum it all up you have maybe  types of moves that everyone does
the same
different animations dont equal depth or variety in gameplay
neither does it lend itself to any real fighting strategy
psone games have shown more substanceon top of this you can add some seriously unbalanced play
certain monsters are vastly more powerful than their supposed counterparts from other sides
for example the ogre mage is available to only one side and the reach of its sword and the power behind that reach makes cyclopses demons etc
weak in comparisonthere are only  campaign missions for each of the  sides
the variety in strategy is limited
you can either kill the opposing demigod capture the temple spaces and well since wiping out all the monsters means wiping out the god as well there isnt much actually going on in this game
it is an excercise in boredomif you absolutely must just rent it to toy around with it for a few hours
there isnt enough gameplay behind this game to warrant any further investment of time or moneyeven if you are a fan of adeptarchon avoid wrath unleasedi rented this game and thought it was crap
gameplay isnt any good sound and music is the same as any other lucas game graphics are ok and some of the creatures are nifty looking
controls arent very good either
 player mode is kinda fun
might as well take your  bucks somewhere else
so thanks lucas for another pitiful gamethat pretty much sums it up
the first  were great and everyone had high expectations of this one
only to be slightly bored most of the time and have excitment few and far in between
you can leave the cockpit
no friggin way
 
 yeah but the controls are aweful and all you do is give the a button a work out
theres a  player mode
yeah but the only thing exciting about that is the coop of rouge leader
some of the missions are kinda cool though the problem is youll have to play through so much garbage youll be afraid to continue on to finds these rare gems
ok os here is what you should do insteadgo buy rogue leader
you can probably find it somewhere for like  bucksk and if you already own that onei dont know take a nap or somethingthe ground missions blow
everything else is just dandyokayfirst off i would like to say that i was never a star wars fan until i got my hands on the best rpg to date which is star wars kotor
so when jedi acadamy came out i just had to get it
knowing that it was a sequal and it was said that this one promises to be better i thought quotwow
maybe this game can cure my kotor withdrawls until kotor  which is in production comes outquot yeah right i mean dont get me wrong this game is prettyokay but all the bad reveiws were right  horrible stroyline kinds of ememies are repetitive the controls suck and yes the graphics are horrible
i felt like i was back playing tomb raider  on playstaion one on a old television set
i read before i rented this game all the bad reviews on this site and now i can honestly say that they were not exaggerating
this game is not so good
if you ever played kotor then i suggest to lower your standards if you really have to play this game
but if you have no expectations not really picky with graphics and production sound voice overs story lines controls then by all means try this outoverall it is not really a bad game
its just mediocre
which is why i am so angry because i would expect a star wars game to be great because of passed titles like obi wan galaxies and especially kotor
but this game is just okayfrom what ive played of far cry i think its a great game and just the kind of game i like
unfortunately i cant continue playing it because it wont let me
chapter   i start out playing the game but i noticed the sound is having problems cutting out for a little bit
some guy online says to avoid a later patch so i use an earlier one
everything works fine until one point where the map tells me to go to a checkpoint
i go there
its at the end of a dock
i look around everywhere for what im supposed to find there all around the beach and underwater
nowhere to be found so i cant continue the game
i uninstall itchapter   i reinstall it and install the latest patch 
the sound problem still exists but its not a big deal
i just want to have fun with this game
then i notice a strange quirk about the targetting icon when i aim at a persons head it seems not to hit
now i play an online multiplayer fps a lot and get a lot of headshots but just to make sure im not just sucking badly i go up to a person really close and find the same stupid problem  the bullets dont hit at all when i shoot his head or upper torso but are fatal when i hit his stomach
good lord
i cant play a game like this
i have to stop again for another stupid technical problemthis is on top of  other problems  the game detected my system as very high spec yet obviously this was not the case because it crashed unless i played with the graphics on the low settingother problem is ironically the freakin ai
ok lets say you play on normal difficulty like i would normally do on a game
well the enemies are way too easy
i stood there and literally watched as two men ran up to me and shot me over and over missing and doing no damage
thats good ai
i dont think so
so i put it on challenging level  oops
too hard
someone kills me from long range through a window which i doubt he could see me through
so i switch it back to normal with ai auto balance ahh there we go
its really easy at first but as you blow through the enemies it makes them harder
then if you keep dying in the same place it makes them easier
thats a pretty good idea
but i had to restart the game over and over to figure that out only to find it was aiming wrong
geez
i find it kind of strange other reviewers havent mentioned all these technical issues with far cry
maybe if i remove the patches i can get it to work
ironyas for the multiplayer i cant comment on it because i signed up for it but it still wont workupdate  i tried again and found out why a guy shot me through a window  because of yet another bug
thats right folks i got everything to work right in this game except for enemies shooting me through solid building walls
thats with the latest patch
hows that for buggy
also im still not overly impressed with the ai
i have seen amazing ai before and this aint it
its decent but ive seen betterfirst the good
the graphics in far cry are stunning especially for being produced in  the water effects are stellar the foliage and trees lifelike
the tropical scenery creates an overall impressive atmosphere
the artificial intelligence is also improved over many previous games
enemies will actually hide in the underbrush and track you if you try and retreat
obviously there are still the typical problems with any computer ai that are a byproduct of the fact that a computer cant think like a human cannow the bad and there is lots of it
first the esrb rating system should either be trashed or severely reformed
they list this game as containing blood and intense violence yet they somehow ignore the fact that just about every other sentence spoken by the characters contains at least one profanity
this is a splendid example of how esrb doesnt actually monitor the entire game before rating it
also there is a moderate amount of sexual content present yet there is no mention of that on the rating either
a warning to parents dont let your kids play this title
the violent aspect aside there is plenty of objectionable material
dont go by the mature teen or everyone rating alone  actually see whats in the game before letting your children play it
you cant trust the rating systemsecond on the bad list is the repetitive nature of the levels
the tropical paradise motif is interesting for a while but it quickly becomes tiresome
there is very little level variety
also there are a number of pitiful graphics glitches that is evidence of either poor programming or a lastminute rush job to get the game out
at one point in the game a slain mercenary actually levitated about five feet off the ground
often times when youre driving a jeep or other vehicle grass will literally punch its way through the floor of the car displaying another of the many graphical glitches
the physics engine is also exceedingly messed up
stuff will somehow roll down a perfectly flat area of land
after rolling down a hill or off a bridge some things will get stuck in the water and make a continual splash sound that will drive you batty
finally the plot is absolutely pitiful
yes this is a firstperson shooter and therefore we shouldnt expect masterful storytelling but the plotline does not even attempt to be feasible or explain who the characters are or attribute any motivation to their actions
jack carver is a sea boat captain who picks up a pistol one day and suddenly becomes rambo dispatching hundreds of mercenaries and mutants
similar to the halflife notion of a scientist becoming a skilled marksmen in a matter of hours thats a bit farfetched even for a computer gameoverall i give far cry a losing score
parents keep this title out of the hands of your kids
and for you adults of which i am one chew on this nut is playing this game really the best way to spend your time
violence and general trash does have an effect even on adults
there are many better computer games out there that do not contain such sordid content pick any of the star wars games for an excellent example
my advice is to go there and avoid this trashjust like with doom  and to some extent half life  you should upgrade to good graphics card before playing this  geforce gt or better belonged to half life  and doom  or so it was until far cry hit the scene from out of nowhere
these three game defined the year fpswise
i think doom  was the better game with far cry and half life  splitting second placepros the graphics most of the time are great the sniper rifle
the zoom the satisfaction of taking out an enemiy from  feet leaving the chap next to him none the wiser the intensity when there are bad guys nearby but you cant see them immersive gameplay fantastic aicons the game has been called nonlinear
its not
games like boiling point gothic  best game ever and morrowind are
far cry tries to give the impression og being nonlinear but combat helicopters will take you out if you try to wander off  to far impassable chasms and steep hills and mountains limit you and force you back on the right route
the nonlinearity refers to the numerous way of approaching the enemy
this is not a big deal though the enemies have incredible eyesight and hearing
crouching in a shrub  feet away from a bad guy still makes him go whos there
and then firing upon you the though guy image of protagonist and the pretty girlie he is trying to rescue is a bit american action bmovieesque
luckily this happens only in the cut scenesto summarizegreat game
buyjan norwayi played the demo of this game a while back and liked it from what i had played which was very little
a few years later i was looking for a new game to play and i saw this on the shelf at best buy
it was only  bucks so i decided to give it a go
i didnt remember how to play really and i was shocked at how quickly you get thrown into the thick of the game
i dont really like fighting eagleeyed mercs from  yards away with a pistol when they have armor and assault rifles
i didnt much care for the voice acting in the game and i felt the main character was extremely cliche
one issue that really bugged me was the way that talking competed with the game
it seemed like every time doyle would talk to me i would be in the middle of a firefight or i wouldnt be able to hear a word he said without stopping what i was doing and turning up the volume
the story was rather mediocre and the idea of genetically altered something or others is so overdone
my biggest peeve about this game is the lack of save points
i felt like i could play far cry for an hour without finding a save point
maybe it is just me but i hate getting through a difficult part only to get killed by something stupid and having to redo that entire difficult part
there were some parts of the game where i would have to stop playing for a few days and gather my nerves after trying to the same part for hours straighton the plus side it has very good graphics and physics are good
the vehicles are fun to use as well
the weapon selection is pretty good tooi wouldnt pay much more for this game than 
also dont play on the hardest setting like i did
it will let you reap the benefits of normal blood pressure after about a weekcasual gamers need to take note that this is a very difficult game on any setting
i finish all the big fps games on normal difficulty without any problems but this one was sending me to the load screen constantly on its easy setting
your character spends most the game in a constant hail of bullets from enemies that are mere specks on the horizon
anonymous unpredictable death is very common as the hitpoints for the player are extremely low relative to other games even though hes supposed to be wearing body armor
if youre not a gaming ninja with unlimited time to spend honing your fps skills you may be in for a frustrating experienceplease note this is from the demo not the full version of the gamemyself and a number of friends downloaded this game
we all came to the same conclusions independent of each other  people   game designers  avid players  average players you need a high end machine to run the game but it is worth it
maps and scenery and ambiance
wonderful well done
the ai was total crap
predictable nonresponsive and generally reminded us of much older games
its easy to find spots the ai is blind to
they also snap back to patterns
you can have a firefight just a little bit away from the island and they ignore it less then m or so
you can drop a badguy in some ways so the others ignore his death even walking over the body
we found some other ai predictabilities which got worse as the game progressed
you just find the patterns pick off the badguys and move onit was heartbreaking that such a pretty game had such bad gameplayi was fairly excited to see this game go on sale for  on xbox live a few weeks ago
i knew it is an older game so i didnt expect too much but maybe my expectations are still too high for this game because i ended up uninstalling it after running through the th level
here is whyswitching weapon bug
after picking up a weapon i noticed that i cant cant switch it
i hold down the yellow button on the controller and press it and nothing happens
i sometimes reload the checkpoint and it is resolved
for a game this old this problem should have been resolved
i would pick up a sniper rifle because this is probably the best weapon in the game to have if you like to play like i do
which is kill everything but from a safe distance
and i wasnt able to use it
not coolok so here is probably the most irritating thing in the game and the deal breaker for me
if anybody has ever played halo  they will know what i am talking about
ai using suppressing fire type guns should not be able to casually aim and hit you over and over again from a distance of  yards away
also there really wasnt any stealthiness to the game other than the premade ways to do it by the developers
once you come into any sort of area where the enemy is they automatically know where you are and will start shooting at you
even through walls
as gamers we have moved past the days with having to deal with ai like this
i am not kidding
i would be croutching and walking really slow and boom
they would see me and me running to me to get me and alert the insane amount of enemies in the area i was trying to sneak throughthere is an emphasis on being stealth in this game but they dont give you moves or weapons to be stealthy with other than your stupid melee punch which doesnt work anyway because you cant get close enough to the enemy anyway because they will see you even if you sneak up from behindso basically i learn really quick that if i wanted to play through this game i would need to put the difficulty on easy and just deal with the gun bug
after i got through mission  with basically just gung hoeing and strafing through enemy areas i put this stupid game down
far cry  is obviously is way better than this game
i dunno if the pc version is any better
im hoping its just a bad porting job done for xbox
so if you have an xbox and see this game
steer clear
if you have a pc
its probably way betteryeah this games looks great
but this game ran on its easiest level is next to impossible
unless you have hours to spend dying and restarting in the first  minutes of the game
save your money
its better spent on something like painkiller or ut
after reading all the reviews and then buying the game im very disappointedthis game is a disappointment
all i heard from people was good reviews good reviews good reviews
but i have no good reviews for this gamegreat graphics in fact awesome graphics but still the weopons are unrealisic
the p has a mm bullet  armor piecingrealisic
but it still takes  to  shots to kill someone
unrealisicthe armor on this game is way to strongps
plus there are no ak sto summarizeif you want to play a game where it is close to impossible to control the protagonist solve puzzles that doesnt make any sense at all to the overall story climb walls while jumping from a ledge to pole over a crate while doing backflips  this just might be a game for youadd no savegame option there are savepoints but these are very very far between gameplay so linear it makes pac man and space invaders seem openended and a pretty lame story  voila you have got prince of persia the sands if time in a nutshellsome graphics were ok thoughbargain bin fodder
na trashcan ratherjan norwaykarateka and prince of persia were the two games i grew up on
more than any other arcadestyle games i can vividly remember these two games and how much fun they were
this is one of the reasons i was so disapointed with sands of time
i was really impressed wiht this game when i first played it
except it was called tomb raider bck then
and thats all this is tomb raider with a slight face lift
the storyline is basically the same run around ancient places doing flips and sommersaults and avoiding trips
thats exactly what you do in prince of persia
the only difference is that youfight more npcs
this actually detracts from pop because the combat system is so weak
gameplay on the pc is very awkward and difficult
instead of space bar causing you to jump it causes you to sommersault
for anyone with experience playing fps or basically any game the space bar should be reserved for jumping
but as i said the combat is very weak
you cant run from monsters and you cant really do many special attacks
besides what the game may say most of the attacks are the same they just look different
i dreadedthe combat system because it was so boring
i just hit random keys until the guys diedspecial save points
unlike tomb raider this game has preset save points which means youre pretty much forced to get to a certain area before you quit or you lose everything you did
some may like this feature i found it annoying
if the game had been challenging and fun i wouldnt have minded it but having to redo everything was just a painlastly the absolute worst thing about this game is the movement
unlikle other games the moue does not control your character it controls the camera angle
this makes for some very disorienting game play
longtime gamers will have a lot to get used to if they pick up this game
whats more many times i found myself thrown into angles thta made it almost impossible to play or see where i was going
several times the camera would go into a wall and no amount of moving the mouse would get a better shot
i just had to restart
that is the main reason this game is inferior to tomb raider
while this game might work on the ps it ports over to pc very poorlyif you have never played tomb raider you may find sands of time exciting
but considering when it came out it should have had much better graphics an easier skill set and a better storyline
ill have more fun playing the original prince of persia rom than thisthe game at first looks promising but as you go through the first level you will not get much more then that
of course youll learn a new move as you progress but nothing to boost about
the worse parts of the game is the repeating vocal lines as they fight
which youll hear over and over
limited fighting moves
the awful camera angles that will not let you see that might be ready to attack you
the only highlight is to see the short cartoon clips that are between each leveland it was for a few minutes
it really was satisfying to rack up a hit combo while destroying five or six foot soldiers all at once just like the oldschool tmnt arcade games
and the celshaded graphics look awesomeunfortunately killing an endless stream of soldiers and robots who rarely vary gets old really fast and the stages are pretty boring despite the colorful graphics
one stage takes place on a subway platform and i thought trains would be roaring by every now and then but they dontas others have mentioned the sound bites really are annoying especially mikes eat feet
eat feet
eat feet
eat feet
ad nauseumthe challenge is quite uneven  the stages are incredibly easy but youll waste all your lives when you get to the final boss
and you wont want to start over when the stage took you  minutes to get throughfirst of all there are a ton of reviews for this product but the customer reviews here dont apply to this game
this game was just released but the reviews are dated from last year and refer to old lucas arts gamesthat saidthis is a nice game but it leaves a lot to be desired
to defeat some of the tougher dudes and even the bosses just find a high perch and keep shocking them with your dark force lightning power
they die easily without a fuss
most of the storm troopers just stand idley by while you shoot or rip through their comrades with the light saberi played this game on the second hardest setting and i was finished in  hours
yes  and all i got was  stinking hours of mediocre game play
i honestly believe if you are over  years old you will be disappointed
there are some star wars loyalists out there that will say this game is great
heyi love the star wars trilogy too but that does not make this game any better guysit does not matter how mean or kind you are it does not matter if you build up your dark force powers and use them alot
it has no bearing or affect on game play
truthfully the dark powers makes this game easy to beatyou get the options of customizing your characters looks and clothing and you can customize your light sabers hilt and color but again this offers no bearing on the game play
just simple eye candy to make it look like the programmers did a lot of workthis game is not horrible but it is not much of an improvement over jedi knight ii   that is the real truthif you played jedi knight ii  wait for this game to come down in price
if you have not played any of the jedi games wait for this title to come down in price after christmasyou will be glad you saved yourself some moneydid i mention i finished the game in  hours
wait and save your bucksgames like half life  doom iii and others are just about to be releasedi do not like this gamejedi academy jedi knight iii or dark forces iv is a really really weird gameoutcast was very very fun
and so far the jedi knightdark forces series was unbelievable
when jedi academy was released gamers rushed to the stores to buy itunfortunately most of them came back disappointedpros cool lightsabers you can get your own saber color and your own saber style
okay moves some of them are boring but theyre okay
great multiplayer mode
interesting planets
ability to choose light side or dark side is funcons terrible ai
most of the missions you go on you go alone with no one to help you
no matter what species your character is hisher voice sounds the same human
the only voice difference comes from what gender your character is
way too short outcast was much longer
your character has no real importance in the galaxy
i found it to be much much easier than outcast and i cant stand easy games
horrible storyline
if this was a movie it would hold my attention for about  minutes then id be fast asleep with my head in my popcorn bagoverall i think this game couldve been a success if it was released as an expansion pack for jedi outcast or if it was just a multiplayer game with no singleplayer modethere are few games that are either good or bad  whether you like a game will depend on your own personal preferences and personalityi am not a patient person and therefore i like faster paced games that dont require wandering around for hours painting the walls with your cursor to look for hotspotsand i dont like having to collect a bunch of cryptic clues in order to figure out the combination to a safe
thats why this game just didnt work for meand also at my age a bit older than most computer gamesters i must admit it takes more than eerie voices and ghost stories to create a truly spooky atmosphere
okay and ill also admit that with my eyesight games where everything is dark dont appeal to me at alli found the navigation a bit clunky as well with the worse save game system ive ever encounteredall this doesnt mean its a bad game or that you wont enjoy it
it obviously is a great game for those who like the slower paced more cerebral puzzlers
but if youre like me and prefer to get on with the story and interact with other characters  besides disembodied voices a game like syberia or the longest journey might be more to your liking granny gamerdark fall looked like an intriguing game with atmospheric locations and the story about ghosts and hauntings really ought to have made it brilliant
however its no more than bland and boringyes the visuals and the various rooms of the abandoned hotel and train station are very impressive
but there is so much of nothing to do in them
the gameplay is kind of like the myst games being that when the arrow is moved over something important the icon changes
but almost every screen in dark fall is completely noninteractive so its no more than a slideshow tour of an old hotel
whats the pointit could have been creepy and the idea of answering ringing phones to have a ghost talk to you is completely wasted as it doesnt affect the gameplay one bit
there is a bit of humor in the newspaper clippings be prepared to read loads of them and in the voices of snobby ghosts but its not enough to save this dull game from dying so quicklyif you absolutely must then dont spend more than a few poundsdollars
but there are loads of better games out there so youll probably never even give it that much of a chancegraphics bsound cgameplay dlasting appeal dallow me to preface this by giving kudos to the programmer who put all his energy into designing a game that came solely from his heart
that alone is worth an added starthat being saidif you believe in the supernatural then this game is for youif you like your supernature to be eerie then this game is for youif you enjoy adventure games in which you interact with no one then this game is for youif you like taking lots of notes as well as handdrawing cryptic designs then this game is for youif you like openended unanswered questions at the conclusion then this game is for youthis game was not for medont get me wrong those who appreciate a creepy atmosphere and worthy albeit grainy graphics will be quite satisfied
if thats all they want
but i wanted and expected more than that and this game left me thoroughly frustrated to have spent all that time suspending disbelief only to be disappointed overallim sorry but for me the cons heavily outweighed the pros
i wish they didntsturgeons law states that  of everything is crap
i think he was optimistic  for every hamlet there are bezillions of sitcoms for every ring cycle there are several cubic yards of mindless mtv papand for every myst or syberia there are far too many games like crystal key crude and muddy graphics pointless story line endless exposition and illogical puzzles based on the tried and trusted technique of search everywhere until you are frustrated talk to everyone many times over try everything in your inventory in combination if necessaryno redeeming features as far as i can seei am a huge adventure game fan i did schizm and enjoyed it
i have played all the versions of myst and others with a simmilar game play style as they are my forte and most enjoyable to me
i usually can finish a game with little or no help and maybe at times a hint to get out of a bind but this game seemed to have little or no logic and having had to refer to a walkthrough for most of it i found it frustrating tedious and annoying
some of the bizzare sounds in it literally made me nauseous and i had to mute the game to get through those parts
i found that even with the walkthrough i asked myself repeatedly how was i supposed to figure that out
the graphics are indeed awesome or i would not have even bothered to take the time to see it through to the end
it made me tense and was really not worth my time
i frankly would only recommend this game to someone who is a dedicated gamer and who wants a challenge that could cause you to want to pull out your hair
the puzzles are too frequent and too random a trial and error solution for the most part if this is your idea of fun then you might like it but for me
thumbs down all the waymy husband and i are experienced puzzle game players and huge fans of the original mysterious journey
it was with great anticipation that we started this game but we have officially given it up halfway throughour biggest problem is that our machine only one year older than the games release date with a decent graphics card does not have the right setup for this games graphics rendering
stuff flashes in and out of visibility the cursor comes and goes peoples arms detach from their bodies and any prolonged animated scene completely mucks up the whole works to the point that the machine has to be rebooted if we can access the save screen at allwe may have been willing to fight longer if the game had drawn us in more but the puzzles just arent as interesting as they were in the original except for a couple of good mathematicallybased ones
also the puzzles were extremely linear there was rarely a matter of collecting information in general towards solving one of several open mysteries as one encounters in say riven but always just one puzzle you needed to solve at a time and always of the solve this so you can get past this doorbridge variety which got a bit repetitivewe moved on to a different game in our to play pile  and were sad to leave this one unfinished but just couldnt take it any moreunlike the first mysterious journey this game too many puzzles and is very boring
if you want to play a game for hours and days without getting anywhere then this game is for you
i do nothing but workout and play games with my spare time and this game isnt worthy of that time
ive played games like aliens vs predator  eternal darkness rez evil tomb raider so i have plenty of patience when it comes to gaming
the graphics are stunning but thats it for me
if you dont have the first game then get it insteadjust couldnt get into this game
it was boring
i only played for a little while and it just didnt hold my interesti had just finished playing syberia before this one so maybe that had something to do with itfirst of all right from the very first dialogue i knew i was going to have to mute this entire game because the voice acting hurt my ears it was so bad
and theres no subtitles so i didnt know what anyone was saying
but did i care
no i didnt
id rather have no idea whats going on than listen to those horrible character voices
its ok becuase you dont really need the dialogue to get through this game
its just you run of the mill inventory game get this now put it here type of thing
theres a couple puzzles that require a little focus but not too difficult
graphics were not good
no techinical issues for the most part
i did have to start over once because the game just gliched and wouldnt allow me to go forwardoverall it seems like it could have been better but whoever wrote the story for this just slaughtered any chance of that
the main character sounded like a full grown man trying to talk like a baby
it was sickening
and the story line didnt seem to make any sense to me
it seems like this game was supposed to be humorous but like the other reviewers said it was just extremely annoying
if you could get this game for free or for one dollar and you had absolutely nothing else to do then id say go for it
but be warned as soon as you walk into a new area your point of view changes
sometimes you stay in a forward direction other times you face the same direction you jsut came from
so if youre walking down a trail you really have no idea if youre moving forward or just going right back to the same screen
this becomes very frustrating during the mazeit was not entirely a waste of time but i woud not reccoment it to anyonethis game was just bizzare
i rarely laughed at the corny humor that saturates the gameplayi usually rolled my eyes
i thought the navigation was illogical and frustrating as well
this is one of those games that i forced myself to finish and was glad when it was over
still it had enough challenge in it to keep me going so it wasnt a total waste
ive definitely played worse games like conspiraciesive been trying for a week to get this to work
ive been going back and forth with their support department and the game keeps locking up my machine
from what ive seen of the game so far it looks like you might want to stay away from thisthe game has an interesting story and the setup as a writer who is on the rippers trail is pretty goodhowever the games technology is outdated and its implementation overly buggy
also the gameplay itself is extremely dull
but i played through it all because the whole jack the ripper story kinda intrigues me anyway
now i do not want to spoil the game for you by telling you the ending but really there simply isnt much to spoil
it was not worth it at allthis is one of those games with a real story
it makes you wish that there were more games with a story like this
but then you realize how bad this is actually implemented and you kinda lose hope for the whole genreif i were you id steer cleari bought this game because i wanted to play a game that was intriguing and mysterious
well it turns out that this game is frustrating at best because of its linear play
this game doesnt allow the player to do anything out of order which results in timeconsuming wandering back and forth between locations or praying that something different happens the th time you visit a location
i found myself very frustrated with the narrowness of this game and dont recommend it to anyone
the only reason why it gets  stars is because of the environment is very realistic and one gets a good feel for early s life as well as the fact that the music and acting are actually done quite well
however some sound bites cut off right in the middle of a sentence which has the player wondering what was said
finally there are misspelled words and factual errors such as the world series in  this game isnt very goodim vacillating between two or three stars on this game so maybe it should be two and a half
the story is pretty obvious  jack the ripper or a copycat is in new york in  killing off prostitutes in what the game calls the lowside district of new york
why in the world the developers decided to call lower manhattan the lowside district is beyond me
or why the pinkerton detective agency is called the pinterten detective agency
or why a deranged raven shows up at the crime scene of a couple of the murders and then disappears until the very end of the game when you hear the words nevermore nevermore
whats poe got to do with this game
they even have a story line about the world series which didnt even exist in ok but all that aside what drove me the most crazy about this game was that it was very linear
you have to keep going back over the same locations over and over because something wasnt done in the correct order
in the final chapter i ended up visiting every location three times
the only positive note is that navigation is easy
it you want to leave a location just rightclick and the map comes up so that you can visit another spot  again and againthe graphics are pretty good
theres really isnt an abundance of dialogue but the acting is fine
the music is something i rarely pay attention to  in fact if there is an option to turn it down i usually do because it interferes with the speaking voices and i find it annoying
this game did not have that option and there was only one time that the music was a problem
there really arent any puzzles  just when to use inventory items in the right place at the right time
they were pretty straight forward
there was one timed sequence in the morgue that i actually thought was kind of a bit of sick humor  i had to use a walkthough for it
i never would have figured it out myselfafter all that  the ending
it was terrible
absolutely awful
all that detective work reporter work actuallyfor nothing
i expected some big confrontation between the reporter and the villain or the heroine to be in actual danger and saved by the reporter  nope
nothing except a stupid nevermore nevermorenew york   the seedy lowside disctrict is rocked by a series of killings that resemble the london jack the ripper murders twelve yearas before
you play james palmer a young reporter for the new york today
your boss assigns you to cover the crimes and produce a series of articles that will regain sales lost to your papers competitor
when your articles start receiving attention you begin to hear from the killer himself
can you trace the hints he drops and prevent another murderjack the ripper jtr is the kind of game that will be familiar to adventure purists  one with many fine points one that has incredible potential to be remarkable but one that had obviously no been given the time or attention to rise above the mediocre
its perfectly playablemildly entertaining even
but when game developers complain that adventure doesnt sell they need look no farther than games like this to find the cause
jtr is boring
i personally dont think that games need lots of action threats and timed sequences to be excitingand except for one you wont find them here
but neither do you find very many interesting puzzles engaging characters inspiring conversations great locations or much of a plotthe game has its good points
the graphics are nice
the music is actually superb
the navigation and gameplay are smooth and easy
the voice acting isnt bad
the structure is well thoughtout
but there just isnt enough going on
each day of the game presents you with certain tasks and i always was surprised when the day came to an end  i never felt like i had actually done anything
part of this was because the puzzles were so very easy
ninety percent were conversation  the rest were a smattering of incredibly simplistic mechanical and inventory with one timed activity
i had downloaded the uhints file for this game but the only time i ever looked at it was at the end when i thought is that it
in general i found the puzzles so unchallenging that at one point i resorted to translating a book in french that my character found just for something to dothere are numerous red herrings in this gamethreads that turn into nothing places you can go where nothing happens
i suppose this is a realistic representation of investigative journalism but i found it tiresome
there was also a strange plot element involving a raven and what seemed to be psychic phenomena that was never explained at alli disliked the savegame feature
this gave you a limited number  i think of spaces to save thumbnails of your game in progress
 slots were about half the number i wanted and the thumbnails were so small you couldnt tell what they represented
as your game was saved by time and date only with no opportunity to label them for yourself this was an irritationjtr was also pretty glitchy particularly in the early portion of the game
several cutscenes did not run properly and had to be skipped out of
conversations overlapped and the navigational cursor sometimes didnt appear
once the game crashed entirelygood thing i had just savedthe ending of jtr is a disappointment
i realise that the real jack the ripper was never verufiably identified so it would have been going out on a limb to identify him here
but i would have preferred that to what i got
the way the game ended was like the rest of it  wimpy and without challengethis game took me about  hours to complete playing a couple hours a night
it was mildly entertaining as i said
but probably better to wait for the jewel case releasethis game completely fails to measure up to the rest of the nolf series
for one thing this game is way too linear even the original castle wolfenstein gave players more choice
throughout every level you are herded in one direction
there is absolutely no possibility of strategically using alternate approaches
for example youll be following a hallway filled with barrels and other junk
as soon as you reach a specific point a certain number of enemies will suddenly rush around the corner knowing exactly where you are then it is just a matter of engaging in a shoot outlike nolf  there is a button for sneaking but it is absolutely useless
since baddies know exactly where you are once you reach the magic point in the hallwaystreetetc any attempt at sneaking doesnt matter
since you cant sneak up on baddies or eavesdrop there are very few conversations to listen in on all but one take place over announcement systems
as a result much of the humour except for a few injokes which made the previous games so much fun are missingthe only plusses are that the graphics are stunning and the ai is quite good
but considering how short and repetitious it all is basically holding down the firing key as you run down halls shooting at loads of interchangeable badies i cannot give it a good rating
those more into shootemup games with no stealth or strategy might enjoy it a bit more but i doubt very much moremeant as a midquel connecting no onelives forever to nolf  this standalone expansion returns you to the cheeky world of stylish superspies and comical megavillainsyour deathdealing skills are put to use in an underground siberian base a lunar installation a rocket ship and an italian town complete with medieval fort
but while the environments are up to par the opposition is very unimpressive
on each level all the baddies look fight and die the same
the complete lack of diversity among your adversaries makes for monotonyi kept on wondering when the game would pick up and it just never did
contract jack
could be completed in one sitting clocking in at just over five hoursthis game at full price new is a waste of money
first theres a real lack of a good plot line to it
it consists mostly of shooting endless streams of enemies with only a meager plot line to each missionthe graphics are pretty good
the major drawback is that the environment isnt distructable like other fps games
so you cant shoot crates or other things to discover hidden items
imo this is a real drawback
you also can only interact with certain items in the environment that are integral to your missionthe plot line in the game really doesnt make a whole lot of sense either
you never really know why jack is going after the guy hes after except for money and theres no real good explaination why jacks client wants the guy foundi was absolutely shocked when this game ended after around  missions
not only is that way too short it ends in a particularly unsatisfying abrupt waythis game did deserve its m rating though its perhaps one of the most graphic games ive ever seen in terms of blood as well as some of the language
the dialogue in the game is rather good imo
some of it is wry humor that i found amusing although it really doesnt add anything to the game at allas other reviewers have said this game just has an expansion pack feel to it
theres also a limited amount of environments that the entire game takes place which i think is a drawback
theres even one level where all you do is shoot enemies you cant move around because theres no place to go in the environment
that reminded me of old arcade games not modern fpsif you like nolf youll probably want to play this game but dont expect it to be near as good
as for sierras contention that its a quotprequelquot to nolf prequels usually have some explaination included in them that clears something up in games that have already been released
this game doesnt do that at alloverall i was dissapointedrather than come out with a new kate archer game the folks at foxsierramonolith pushed out this overly short ultimately senseless game to capitalize on the no one lives forever franchisethe gameplay itself isnt bad and at times rather fun i really enjoyed a few of the levels but ultimately it all fell rather flat
it lacked the enjoyment humor and fun factor of the other no one lives forever games
it didnt help that the main character was a dudif you can get this for free and you have extra time on your hands its worth a spin otherwise avoid iti was very much looking forward to this game since i think that the idea is awesome
instead i was let down disappointed and frustrated at what might have been
here is the rundowngraphics mediocre
maybe the xbox and my pc have spoiled me but the pss graphics are really starting to show their age
the grainy texture meant to simulate a video feed conveniently hides lowres textures and graphicssound good though ive heard much better
splinter cell a game after which manhunt is patterned in many ways does it much bettercontrol laborious
remember how fights in gta  were somewhat laborious especially with multiple baddies
thats manhunt
the control is a little better but still rather stunted and jerky lacking the precision of splinter cell or metal gear
the fights are button mashing affairs with little difference between the hard and fast strike buttonsgameplay linear repetitive and forced
the game wont let you escape an area without killing so there goes the stealth aspect
you must gore the hunters in order to proceed
the weapons vary but be prepared for drudgery at the lower levels you have your fists a shard or a plastic bag
again its like splinter cell without the sense of purpose or mission as you mindlessly dispatch yet another identical clone on your way to the next level where you mindlessly dispatch another identical clone
the atmosphere is pretty good though again the control and graphics conspire against this game
if you want to run around and create havoc get gta  if you want stealth action get splinter cell
if you want to waste money get manhunthide hide hide and hide
kill kill kill and killsomething wrong with my review
yes redundancy awkward and brainless
well thats what this game is all aboutthis is a typical game made by rock star
a good idea came up with terrible execution
exactly like the way the did gta iii series
yes you read it right
i didnt made mistake
the game of the year gta iii seriesmanhunt and gta share something in common
first of all they all got horrible graphic
hard to image that its the same company who made max payne ii
secondly they are all sonotdetail oriented which i personally believe its the fundamental attitude to make a good games
this is the attitude that makes japanese games superior and american games stupider
probably this is the attitude made toyota surpassed fordanyway if you love gta series this game is just that style and wont let you down
however if youre those few who disagree the previews about gta iii or vice city in all major video magazines in the market stay awayso if youve played the original mp you know how extrordinarily beautiful and dark and twisted it was
so as usual you anticipate the follow up
this installment is a shoddy trashy version
the graphics look like a ps title  the story is boring
the deep save screens are terrible
also since you spend more time watching and hearing the graphic novel than playing the game it gets frustrating
if you dont save every two seconds and you die you have to watch all the cutscened boring as they are all over again
you can skip them but the time it takes to load the game after you skip them is just as long as watching them
there is no violence in this game the ai
is terrible
the bullet time and dodging is okay but not as stellar as the first
id skip this one its not worth it
there are rumors of a max payne  that are promising to deliver because even the company said they were dissapointed in how this game turned out
so maybe well have that to look forward toif there was never a max payne and this came out
everyone would have liked it better but there is one so i hate it
the slow diving and slow bullet dodging are still there but have changed for the worse
graphics are chucky and the textures are ugly
sound is ok running around seems hard and i think the plot is just about the worst for any game ever made
very short
still a fun game but not for the the pc version of max payne  the fall of max payne managed to improve on the first game in some areas and was vastly enjoyable overall however this playstation  port of the game is severely disappointing
a noticibly terrible frame rate blurry textures missing sound effects an even worse save system and ridiculously long loading times plague what could have been a stellar game
the storyline plot twists and even the once mediocre graphic novelesque cut scenes are the games few saving graces along with the run n gun bullet time action that was so enjoyable in the first game but in the end max payne s flaws outweigh its strengths
its a shame more time wasnt taken to make max payne  something as memorable as the first game i really wanted to like this game despite its flaws but theyre just too much
all in all max payne  is still worth a rental for fans who dug the original but dont expect anything at all great from itthis versian of max payne is not very goodi played this at a friends house even though i havemax payne  on my computer and they took out somelets say quotadultquot cheatsyes thats right there is something in the pc versian of max payne  that the x box and ps versian dont have
mona in full frontel nudityyes if you saw a brief scene with mona in the shower that is all you will get in the ps and x box versianbutin the pc versian there is a cheat were you can play mona with nothing but her gun if you know what i meanand every thing is detailed in her body including her ts and other places you dont want your  year old to seebasicly the pc versian of max payne  is the original mature rated versian but the ps and x box dont have that cheatthe graphics on the ps dont match up the awsome graphics of the pc versianbottom line is if you wanna see great graphics and great game playnot to mention explicit nuditythan get max payne  on pc than xbox and ps
its your choicemax payne is not a great game
its all shooting no fighting or dirving at all
its story is so werid and freaked out that i cant understand it at all
i expected better from rockstarthis review may contain minor spoilers
it was written specifically to those who have played the first game and are interested in the sequelmax payne  is a third person action shooter
obviously this title is the sequel to remedys max paynebut as a sequel it seems forced as if remedy and rockstar were cashing in on the success of the first game or simply felt obligated to make another title with max
the storyline is not nearly as compelling as the first game and as unrealistic as max payne was max payne  is downright ridiculous at parts
no longer directly motivated by the death of his family or by the fact that he is a framed cop on his own the game had to provide a reason to keep the relative feel and gameplay of the original
max has apparently been authorized to kill as though now officially once more a law enforcement officer he is still killing mobsters rather than arresting them
motivation for continuation of the game now comes from mona sax who was shot in the first game but was hinted at surviving
very quickly max falls in love with mona for no reason at all other than shes an attractive woman
the relationship between max and mona has no substance to it and at times i wondered if i was playing a cut version of the game that didnt feature some more backstory to how max had been dealing with his familys death over the years or some scenes actually adding  depth to max and monas relationship
the gang war is a lot less compelling than the one in the original
the removal of the drug elements also serve to reduce the mature dark elements of the original which are replaced with the more common themes seen on modern games such as language and sexual themes
throughout the game max experiences mortal wounds which he somehow recovers from such as being crushed by scaffolding getting shot in the back getting shot in the head and being trapped for an extended period of time in a burning building
this game also lacks a lot of consistency from the first game
all of the actors in the graphic novel panels have been replaced and everyones voice actor was replaced except for james mccaffery
the graphic novel panels in general are also not as effective this time aroundpanels are used multiple multiple times and the game is shown from a sort of flashback perspective that is presented ineffectivelyhowever max payne  does beat out max payne in terms of game play and graphic
bullet time is more enjoyable this time around and there are a lot more weapons that can be used to take out the bad guys
overall would i recommend this game now in 
well i decided to go back and play the max payne series after enjoying remedys alan wake and seeing that max payne  was on the horizon
if youre just looking to try out classic xbox titles i would recommend max payne but not max payne  additionally if you enjoyed alan wake youll likely enjoy max payne  a lot more than max payne  due to the similar themes of being motivated by a lost wife
but if youre looking to try the max payne series in preparation for max payne  i would recommend giving this title a quick run throughen general ce jeu est quand meme bien fait et parfois amusant mais il y a  rien de bien neuf dans le monde du hockey  ce jeu ressemble a pas mal de jeu que j ai deja vu et n apporte pas grand chose de neuf
les graphiques pourraient etre mieux  j ai joue a nhl  sur dreamcast et gamecube et je les prefere a cette version de xbox
l option xbox live semble bien mais le hic c est que les statistiques ne sont pas compilees correctement par xbox live  lorsque l on perd la connection a une partie  l on se vois parfois credite d une defaite parfois l on perd la connection et ca peut se produire frequemment
cela m a extremenent decu
ce jeu comporte certaines erreurs de programmation pour ce que est du jeu en ligne
pour ceux qui ne jouent pas en ligne ca pourrais etre pas si mal mais a part ca non
j ai parfois eut aussi des problemes avec le jeu comme parfois il gele meme en mode  joueur
je ne le recommanderais passegas espn nhl hockey k isnt the great hockey game that it was last year
where it has some good options and unlockables great teams from the past the gameplay really hurts ones ability to fully enjoy the gamegraphically the game looks a tad bit better than eas nhl   the sounds in the game arent that great as well as the horrible crowd chants and rink announcer
the only good sounds comes from the playbyplaycolor commentating by gary thorne and bill clementwhich is the best i have ever heard they could mention the quotshoulderquot a bit less thoughthe gameplay is where this game falls behind eas nhl   the animation is smooth but very slow
trying to perform a hook poke check block shot etc
are animated so slow that by the time the move is doneits too late
minor things like fighting and watching the player skate around can look really bad and silly
other than that the action is fierce and quickwhich can be good and badwhere this game has an advantage over eas nhl  is in its roster updates via online
eas nhl  updates have trades but never includes rookies or callups i play as the new york rangers and they have a rookie jed ortmeyer who has been with the team pretty much the entire season and isnt on any ea updates
granted he isnt an impact player but that is just an example of how poorly eas roster updates are
segas espn hockey updates are true to the game
every player that has played on an nhl team this season is in the roster updatesfrom one game callups to rookie skatersso if you want a hockey game to hold you over until the next hockey season or until the world cup of hockey this summer i would recommend eas nhl  over segas espn nhl k hockey if you want a more realistic game of hockeyi hate this game
i cant stand it
if you want a football game get madden
this game is hard and not fun and the graphics arent so great
so dont get it nowthe myst series are such beautiful games and i was so excited that they were released on dvd specifically for xp
the excitement lasted about  minutes into my first playing
despite the fact that it is supposed to be made for xp i am still experiencing a lot of trouble running it
in several different places in myst it crashes to desktopbad thing when those places are pertinent to solvingas of this date  may  there is still no patch availble or any signs that ubisoft is working on the problemi bought myst anniversary edition for my son who loves puzzles
unfortunately all i get is a black screen with a hand and no option but to kill the window
as it turns out you have to downgrade quicktime to an old version to make it work
if you do you cant run itunesdont buy the game
sorry there will be other games this ones a ripoffthis game is revolutionary in the history of computer gaming
from a historical point of view it is very noteworthy and shouldnt be ignoredother than that it set the standard template for many adventure games that followed
in other words point and click games based on a qvr slide show accompanied with music and sound effectsthe art work is surreal and awe inspiring but i would much rather view the creations on the pages of a large coffe table art book then to stare at monitor which is the equivalent of staring at a lightbulb looking for hidden cluesi do enjoy d gaming
there are good d adventure games
but not manyaccording to many critics the all time greatest adventure game ever written is s grim fandango
grim on the surface looks grostesque for those who have never played through the game
unfortunately because the game has never been updated most never will because it wont play well on xp with or without the compatibility mode and with the sp additionit wont play at all for that further separates xp from its predecessors
i fell in love with manny calvera as most do who play the game
i lost myself completely playing  grim fandango and i found myself transported to another world
that did not happen with mystthe myst th anniversay edition is the only game i didnt finish and i eventually gave it away
i played myst all the way through and i had almost completed exile when i just couldnt force myself to play the game anymore
the graphics while stunning were so pristine they began to look sterile and even with all foresty foilage towards the end of exilenuked
i didnt care about the characters or of the background storyline
i was looking at pretty pictures and going through the motions of trying to solve some inane puzzzles that reminded me of math word problems in schooli can say that because i was a math majorgrowing up my dad was a big rube goldberg fan and i remember growing up looking at all the rube goldberg books of all these wild contraptions and inventions
thats what many of the puzzles of myst reminded me of
to me myst isnt anything wildly inventiveit had been done before but in a sort of cartoony waythe authors of myst did pour a lot blood sweat and tears into this gamebut it has no soul
soap operas can come up with better storylines
there was nothing to love but pretty pictures and increasingly aggravating puzzles
i really got angry when i was required to work many of the puzzles out on paperwhat am i playing this on a computer for if i have to work the problems out on paper
i recently finished morrowind goty pccd rom but of course morrowind is never finished which is part of its appeal
that is truly a pc gameand there are even a few puzzles in it
that game cannot be played  any other way but by a computer
it is a pc game at its purist point
not even the xbox adaption comes close because of the mods and the modding community surrounding the morrowind computer edition
half the time i was playing myst i was asking myselfwhy am i playing this on a computer
my biggest complaint of the game was its wear and tear on my computer
with a p at ghz and gb ddr ram this should have loaded lickety split
nope  very long frame loads with all my fans going on and my computer obviously working very hard
i looked through many of the reviews for myst here at amazon
peppered throughout the majority of favorable reviews of myst are serious warnings about computer problems and this game
one reviewer stated he even took the game to work and tried it on a variety of computer brands and models and it was hard on all of them and many of the computers produced ctds during gameplay
ubi even has a disclaimer on the myst carton stating that the copy protection might produce driver conflicts with the purchasers computer and not play
not play is only half of itwear the computer out is more accurate and a further reason i have marked this game low
no one should be encouraged to purchase games or any software that might potentially damage equipmentmarfit is an ok game
the bra and panties matches are so stupid
in season mode if you are the challengeryou dont start out with any specails and the champ starts out with one or two
sometimes if you are the world champion and you save the ic champ from a beating your opponents will force you in to a tag team match with both the world title and ic title on the line
that is so lameany number of singles titles on the line in a tag team match
that is not the way the titles can be defended
one of the only good points is the fact that the game is more realistic than most of the others
of course it is so realistic that you can kiss your cruiserweight vs heavyweights goodbye
the legends are nothing to write home about
the game is hard as hell to beat because you have to build up your superstar in season mode they dont stand a chance otherwise
trust me i had to really build rvd up before i could beat hhh with him
i recomend playin either raw  or wm xix for real cool wrestling action that will let you put up offenserent this game first before you buy
i purchased and played all the way through and was greatly dissapointed
nothing like the original secret weapons of the luftwaffe not even close
if you play crimson skies then try this game you will know that this game is subpar by todays standards
i finished the game and sold as quickly as possible
the reason is i knew after playing this game it has terrible graphics and the missions are rediculously easy
this game price will drop when most find out how bad it really is just wait and get your copy cheap but do yourself a huge favor and rent it first and only buy if you can get it cheaper than rentingsecret weapons over normandy is a combination of flight simulator and historical recreation of ww
i had high hopes for this game but it seems a bit outdatedyou start out with some simple target practice  balloons bombers and barrels
soon youre moving against a variety of targets in the air land and sea
there are  missions in all plus the option for multiplayer combative always been a huge fan of flight simulators and space combat simulators
so i was all ready for this fresh release to have great graphics and gameplay
i just wasnt impressed at all in either case
yes i suppose if you compare the graphics against the early flight simulators its amazing how far weve come
the plane has the details of the flaps and wing segments the landscape has trees and roads
the radar display sweeps around
but nothing is up to the standards of current day productionsthe same is true for the planes themselves how they fly and how the ai flies against you
your planes controls are extremely simplistic
yes you stall if you fly straight up as you would expect to
and yes if you plow headfirst into a structure you crash
but there are many other cases where the game plays more like an arcade version set on quotvery easyquot than a modern day ww combat gamethis might be a good game for someone who has never played flight simulators before and who wants a very simple entry into that area before dealing with something more complex
but any advanced gamer or a gamer who has played any style of airplane  spacecraft flying game will want to rent this one first to see how they personally enjoy what it offersfatal frame  does nothing to innovate the genre at all
its an exact wannabe clone of resident evil and silent hill
explore a maze of rooms with some helpless and awkward to control characters all while solving some puzzles and reading some notes
been there done that
the problem with fatal frame is that its horror concept just isnt as cool as resident evil or silent hill those two games each have their unique style and little japanese girls taking pictures of spirits ancient japanese rituals and boring villages simply arent as interesting
sure fatal frame  is a pretty scary game but making a scary game isnt hard making a good game isnot only is fatal frame  a clone of better games its also a nearly exact clone of the original fatal frame and since fatal frame seems to only exist to try to claim the title of scariest game it might be worth mentioning that this one isnt as scary as the original
everything is the same and anything different isnt even worth mentioning because the game is still boringto be fair fatal frame is much easier game than the original which i think is good thing and the graphics are technically impressive with lighting and shadows that arent seen other than in resident evil games for nintendo gamecube
the controls and everything are just a bit smoother and more polished than the original
technically a well made game but the concept is just not there
make a horror game about something cool no one wants a horror that takes place in japan or old japan
people dont watch those old japanese movies where the lips dont match the words do they
use your head tecmo
this should be the last fatal frame installment please go home fatal frame
boringcounterstrike was or maybe still is according to wikipedia the most popular fps played over the internet
either it must be free or people have never seen halomade by valve makers of halflife  an infinitely better game using a modified quake engine
its basically a multiplayerbased tactical shooter a lot like rainbow six which looks and also is infinitely better
many of the weapons and items in cs are also used in rainbow sixthis game is ugly flat colorless and lifeless
its also frustrating
a couple hits and youre dead and you then you must sit there and wait until the other players are dead or the game is overthere really isnt much to this gameif you want good multiplayer for the xbox or  get halo halo or unreal tournament a multiplayerbased game
these games have many more options are more fun and just plain look betterif you want a good game made by valve for the xbox or  play halflife until the orangebox comes outand if you want to play something that feels like cs for the xbox or  play rainbow six  or rainbow six vegasand lastly if you want to play a cornball crappy looking multiplayer game like this but have a lot more maps and weapons try red faction ii
its not very good either but at least not as bad as thishey if you dont have xbox live dont bother getting this game
the ai is just plain stupid and the controls kinda suck i mean the highest look sensitivity is about equal to  on halo cmon thats some slow crap
the only good thing about this game is its different than the usual halo or unreal online
but other than thatyeah if it comes down to  buy it i guess cause thats probably how much its worththis stuff is great and the most fun i had
i dont own it but a friend let me use it for some weeks and this is just plain funyes the graphics arent the good but if you are complaining about that i have a huge list that also could have better graphics starting with the game quake this may actually be a import from the pc to the xbox but never played it on pc so cant say but for those that have an xbox buy this nw
probably take some days to get use to for those noob with fpsthis game might not appeal to you the first  weeks you got this game but this game is those rare games that you play when you are bored and even with games like halo and unreal this one is picked upverdict  out of  this game might not be played much but still you will need it for those times that you are bored and need some gaming this one will entertain you for hoursthis game is not much different than thecomputer version  it wasa verylarge dissapointmenti bought it because they convieniently put the best looking screen shots on the back of the box and the pc one was so much fun
when i opened it i played the off line version first so that i could get used to the controls and i was pissed off to find that the graphics are a complete joke
it looks like something off the ps
the bots walk and run like hunched over retards and use combat skills much to the same level they are useless
when i tried it on xbox live it was not much different with only  game scenarios very few maps too small maps and complete jackass booting me from the game because i was using cheap weopan combos
i had just played so i didnt know what was good and since when have  pistols been better that an m assault rifle
they say that the game should only be bought by people who own xbox live but even they will be dissapointed
if you want a good longlasting game that is always fun then get either rainbow  or halo  they both rock online have good graphics and lots of people are always playingits bad
really bad
i give it two stars only because ive heard stories of it working but could not get it to function in any way myself
otherwise id give it none
i am not the most experienced in networking but neither an i a novice
the configuration of this thing is pretty straightforward and im nearly positive i had it set up right but still no little wireless light on
i am using a dlink di with only wep enabled no mac filtering public ssid etc and this thing didnt want to hook up
even tried disabling wep setting ssid to default and still no go in this things default mode
also i gave up trying to get it working with the xbox and was just attempting to get it working with my pcs wired ethernet card at this pointcalled tech support they said it sounded defective
returned it got another same results same answer from tech support
either their quality control standards are poor their tech support is poor or their product is poori think its all threeget the xbox wireless adapter if youre using xbox
granted it only works with the xbox which is somewhat lame
keyword however is worksi picked this game up cheap and have been playing it on my dual  g
its a fun game very similar to warcraft iii but it has major crash issues with dual processor machines
there is nothing worse then playing a strategy game for  hours to have it crash on you and lose everything
and the sad part is it crashes more then not
macsoft support is nil infact there is a patch for this game and all three locations linked on the macsoft webpage to down load the patch are dead
even for  bucks i would have to pass on this game not worth the crashing and lost time
i am very disappointed they do not put some effort into porting there games to osxi wouldve given it  star but there were a few little touches that were nice
that said if anybody i knew asked me whether they should buy it i would definitely say noit crashed and crashed and crashed
when it wasnt crashing it would hang for minute after minute loading loadingon a machine that has far more than the recommended hardware requirements
and when it crashed it often left the desktop messed up changing the settings to a lower resolution so that i had to go into control panel and reset then clean up the icons which were now scattered across the screenthe game play itself had its fun moments but it was sloooooow
and the voicesman i wish i could just turn them off
maybe i couldi never bothered to find out
was it all one guy playing with different accents
the aliens were sometimes quite creepy but never had any of the charm of the old xcomi give the makers a couple points for trying to keep xcom aliveit was one of the best games ever and has never had a sequel that came close to measuring up to the original
unfortunately this one is even farther from measuring up than most
thank goodness i was only playing it on a friends machineat least i didnt waste any money on this onethis product came to me with a broken button
i have tried to get returned but with no success yetpc gamepads suck compared to the concole gamepads
i got this one because it looks like a playstation replica
i paid  dollars for this gamepad and it had unsatisfactory resultsi played n games on my pc using this gamepad and let me tell you there is no point in having a dpad because it just doesnt work
i thought maybe there something wrong with the emulator but actually it is the gamepads fault
as for action pc games such as gta vice city i still had problems with the dpad
save your money and just use your keyboardlogitech products are known to be of prime quality and in a gamepad i was expecting something well made responsive and accurate
well none of this are to be found on this gamepad
i believe and i think is a common notion nowadays that the best pc gamepad you can have as of today is the xbox  pc compatible one
dont look elsewherethe directional pad simply sucks
ive only had it for a day and despite the overally comfort and setup ease of this controller the directional pad is another one of those quotnearly impossible to just hold up without going diagonal as wellquot pads
you push up and  of the time you will either be going upright or upleft and ditto for all other directions down left or right its the most frustrating thing in the world ever try playing a game like silent hill on one of these controllers
its a nightmare no pun intendedthis controller doesnt stay calibrated for longer than a few seconds before going kaput and the digital controls dont work for anything requiring holding them or rapid actionafter learning of this game because of its unique genre real time tactics and realizing that it is now available for free legally i decided to give it a shotlets talk about what is good the conceptafter playing this game you appreciate the uniqueness of the game and realize that there is so much potential in the ideain the game you control a squad  two separate four man teams  and you are giving them general orders fire here move here are the two main ones
its very satisfying to employ strategy and tactics to kill enemiesnow lets talk about the bad most everything elseunfortunately playing the game makes you wish there was more this goes back to the potential of the concept
you are really limited in a lot of ways and there is just so much more that could be implemented and improvedhalf the gameplay in this game feels like babysitting  you have to tell your teams exactly where to go and this wouldnt be such a pain in the butt if they didnt force you to control each team separately all the time
plus its just really clunky to give and stop commandsheres the biggest kicker with this game the ai sucks
it gets really frustrating sometimes for an enemy to run right in front of your team and your team just stands there and watches and gets killedanother annoyance the graphics
you can tell what the game is up to because there are shield icons when the enemy or friendlies are in cover but the visuals never represent this well
often you will see the enemy entirely out in the open next to a wall but it will have them marked as in cover making them invincible in that position
if you think thats annoying once imagine that for nearly every enemy and your own guys too very oftenive really tried to give fsw a chance i really did but this game is terrible and doesnt live up the hype at all
for all the talk about fsw being an accurate simulation of tactical combat fsw falls way shortthe goodthe graphics
thats about it
and even then there are plenty of problems
for starters you hardly have any control over any options
want to turn off shadows notorious frame rate killers not possible
i have a pretty highend rig and i encounter lousy frame rates and tons of stuttering with the audio dialog
only by turning down the visual features can i get acceptable performance but then the stunning graphics are no morethe badunfortunately for pandemic this would encompass the rest of the entire game
enemy ai is lousy at a distance and entirely scripted
restart a level and theyll be in the same places every time so forget about replay valueif fsw is an accurate representation of the armys capabilities then we are in real trouble
while the soldiers move and take up basic firing position correctly their reactions are terrible
when directed to take cover theyll frequently use some of the worst cover around
their shooting accuracy is terrible often spending more time shooting everything around a target rather than the target itselffsw is clearly built for a console and not a pc
load times are terrible save points doesnt every developer by now know that this is a terrible way to treat pc users limited configuration options and a gamepadesq interfacedont think for a second the manual will prove useful
the instructions are vague with poor text descriptions to define actions with no supporting graphicswhile pandemic attempted to reflect reality in the game through degrading cover tactical movements and liberal use of swearing great way to represent out soldiers they swear more than a trucker in a shouting match with a longshoreman fsw just falls flat on itself as a tactical shootersave your money and move on to something betterbasically this is a game that wraps multiple types of game play into one package
that is where this game went wrong
also some of the high ratings were kids or people that reviewed this game based on the demo
you cannot truly rate a game unless you have played through the whole thing
that is how the gaming magazines do it
any designer manufacturer builder knows that it is almost impossible to make an effective allinone device because it usually does some things very well and some things fairly well or poorlyin this game you play from the rd person perspective more like you hover over your currently active squad
you command your teams of soldiers with mouse clicks and key commands while receiving orders from an offsite commandernow this is unique
however this is what stinks
you feel like your watching the action more than participating
you also have to wrestle with hard to observe terrain angles camera views and if you make a mistake you cannot quickly respond
ouch
oh did i mention that the game has designated save points
yep
so if you blow it you must go back to the last save point and start again
this is not horrible but not pleasant eitherthe good parts are that this game really requires you to think use strategy be patient it is unique there are some excellent tutorials about  minutes worth to help you learn the skills youll need to get started and the game brings in outside support like helicopter recon mortarartillery support armored bradley vehicles
this game also offers coop play which is a nice addition
i do like the hardcore cursing in this game mrfr is one shining example because i am an adult and i want adult level realistic games
kids dont need to play every game ok
that is what the esrb ratings system is for
so i say thank you to the developers for doing it
you will not find ammo health paks aliens space stations rocket cars jet packs or secret weapons laying around or on the dead bodies or behind hidden walls
if you run out of ammo your stuckthe bad parts are complicated camera angles buggy response to your commands at times the game is a bit of a hog on resources the action is not that exciting the visuals are not bad but not great there is a lot of unnecessary hardcore cursingi love it but any parent with a kid under  probably will not 
this game is very short too
just as your skills are starting to get good the game is overwho is this game good for
if you like rtsreal time strategy games but wish you could get more deeply immersed in themthis game will excite you
i doubt this will appeal to st person shooter fans that dont like rts gamesoverall i appreciate it for its uniqueness
yet i also found it very unsatisfying
due to the lack of excitement poor camera angles slow clumsy response of your soldiers mediocre ai for the enemies and buggy actioni cannot recommend this gamei will make a prediction though  i bet that another company will make a similar game only better or there will be a fsw  and the developers will have tweaked it into a lean mean shootem up game by learning from their mistakes
for the present  i would not bother with this gameyyay 
another sims gameboring takes up a ton of memory card and its the same as the first onethe sims bustin out is a goaloriented consolestyle version of the sims
the gameplay has been slightly watereddown and given a more simplistic feel
really i think bustin out was aimed at a somewhat younger audiencethe concept of the game is fun however
you create your own sim and control them in order to accomplish goals make friends and earn money
to furnish your home with
the game starts you out on your uncles farm where you become familiarized with some of the gameplay mechanics
afterwards you are sent out to explore simvalley and meet its various denizens
from there you will stumble upon various goals and will be required to fulfill them before moving on
after completing every goal in every chapter you finish the gameunfortunately it seems that the game was either rushed or underfunded as the graphics are not as up to par as they should be
in addition to this there are several glitches which can cause certain goals to become unavailable or incompletable
thus ruining any chance of actually finishing the game
there seems to be no way around these glitches eitherafter having completed the game myself i was sorely disappointed with the rewards of having done so
however i will not spoil it for those whove yet to finish the game themselves
regardless i do think the gameplay is fun in its own right
you wont find much entertainment in actually completing the game itself though
otherwise i would recommend trying the urbz sims in the city instead of bustin outi bought this pad as a spare because i was having a group of people over for a party
i brought it out since i didnt want everyone to ruin my better pads and sure enough this thing broke after about  hours of playing on it
it is thin and pretty flimsy and my friends who own it have said the same thing
stick with redoctane and youll never be sorry you spent the extra moneywell ignore for the moment that i dont particularly enjoy fighting games
the graphics and backgrounds were beautiful and the game managed to keep me entertained for four or five hours before it went back on the shelf to never see the light of day againfirst of all all of the maneuvers and combinations were just too much
the game would have been made much more playable if there had been a real training area
what it had was a guy who would stand there and let you hit him as you tried to reproduce the sometimes rediculous button combinations posted on the screen
it would have been great if there had been a martial arts master to instruct you and fight against you as he taught you the movessecond is the story or lack thereof
dead or alive  tries to present itself as a story even having a few exchanges between the characetrs as you move through it but youd have to already know the story for it to make any sense
all you do is beat up the opponents listen to a couple snips of dialog and fight the end of level villain at the end
it has about as much story as gotham racingas beating people up was a matter of perfecting two or three maneuvers for each character the fighting quickly became passe
the story wasnt
all in all the beautiful graphics were wasted in a game that had nothing going for it
dod extreme beach volleyball has more plot then this gamethey say if it aint broke then dont fix it
i loved the first spiderman game
the graphics were crisp and detailed the story was deep and involving and the controls were precise and tight
then grand theft auto vice city came out which completely rewrote the video game genre
games like true crime and the getaway were released that practically copied the gta formula  free roaming cities minimissions mayhem and violence etc
add spiderman  to the list with mediocre resultsi admit that i was initially excited when i heard that spiderman could now swing freely through the city and bust bad guys on the streets below
though the former is exhilirating and excellently implemented the latter is dull and repititious
like gta there is a minimap of the city in the upper right hand corner of the screen
whenever there is trouble a green icon will appear in the location where a crime is taking place
unfortunately there is a lack of variety in these missions
you will either have to prevent a robber from getting away take an injured civilian to the hospital catch a civilian from falling to his or her death or save people from a sinking boat
after a few of these youll begin wishing that the game would just get on with the story
solving these missions contribute to your hero points which allow you to purchase moves and combos from a spidey store
since when did spidey have to buy his own moves and combos
strangeunfortunately due to the heavy reliance on memory and processing power to produce the massive scope of the game the graphics are the first to suffer
in most instances the game resembled a playstation  game
spidey generally looks good but the other characters in the game look like spraypainted cardboard boxes
i would have preferred a much scaleddown city in order to boost the quality of the graphics because quite frankly spiderman  is an ugly gamefans of the first game will most likely be disappointed with the sequel
though the ability to explore the city by swinging from building to building is a treat the gameplay and graphics truly suffer
this one is definately a rentalno one plays it 
i dont know why they just dont give it a try 
yet they do like harry potter moviesi bot this bcuz im quite fond of square  the final fantasy series
i was sorely disappointed
while it started out great it dragged itself along
the two stories hereheroine were different with the heroine story being the most compelling
the games about a world that was destroyed the wrongful use of mana power by an evil tyrant vandole who was subdued by a powerful sword created by the goddess
so now it seems the vandole has been reincarnated intends to do it all againthe sad thing thing is that there are too many characters that have nothing to do with the overall story the mavoles for example  not to mention just too many characters  period
what was the purpose of the trip to the ice castle  just to kill the monster and unfreeze its people
youre sent helping people just to satisfy the journey aspect of the game but it contrast this game offers no real adventure or journey and the endgame was equally as disappointing
i got confused of who the real enemy actually was and in the end i was even more confused because the game offers no resolutionthe story itself was really uninspired as i had this game for a whole year without playing it only to just get it over with  you will spend a great deal of time looking for spirits but if think the game or any character will tell you how to find all  spirits no
gamefaqs will be your best friend for this game
a complete waste of time and moneyi love the mana series
i mean the original secret of mana for the snes is one of my favorite alltime games
it was an action rpg good story and plot
so when a sequel was slated for the gameboy i had to get itwell i had to get it a couple of years after it was released
shh
detailsanywho i must say i have never had so much aggravation and pain from playing a game
the ai is horrible repeat horrible
the story is convoluted and the gameplay just downright frustrating
i almost regret the  i spent on the cartridgegameplayi am going to get the worst part of this out of the way
the gameplay flatout stinks
you start the game by choosing either to play as the hero or the heroine
the basic difference in these two is one is better at physical attacks and the heroine is better with mana magic
depending upon who you choose the game will play differently
i chose the heroineyou start out as the heroine in a village talking to your mother as you prepare to leave on a quest with some strange swordsman as a bodyguard
the village is attacked by soldiers that work for the dark lord
you escape your village is slaughtered
you are taken to a manor by the mysterious soldier where you meet the hero
the manor is attacked you escape again and the hero promises to protect you
he falls down you run away he is captured and beaten by soldiersfast forward you wake up in bed after a nightmare recalling all this
the soldier is by your side and you learn that you have been living with him in hiding since your escape
the story takes off from there
the dark lord now controls the land he is evil you must avenge your people yadda yaddaoh yea there is a mysterious sword called get this the sword of mana
and a goddess that turned herself into a tree to protect the people of the world
you worship this mana goddess because you are of the mana tribe
it seems that you are the last of themyou now know as much as i do and i have played the game
the plot is that horrible
you meet townspeople that tell you pointless stories or offer side quests that make no sense
while the story itself is a bit linear run to next obstacle defeat boss possibly get an item for someone etc
 you will often find yourself wandering a map trying to figure out where to gosince save spots are few and far between and healing in this game is a pain either through the start menu or using the appropriate mana spirit controlled through the right shoulder button on the gba you will find your strength is depleted ie
 you die happens at the worst possible time with little warning
you then have to reset to your last save
early in the game this is horrible
the first cave you must travel as the heroine has an enemy layout that killed me  times before i developed a strategy to get past the monstersbosses vary in the game from easy to insanely difficult
one boss in particular was on a spinning platform and you could only hit him when he landed
however given your level your weapons only do like  points of damage per hit and he has over  hit points
it took me  minutes to kill this guy
needless to say he hits a lot harder than  points of damage
and he inflicts status effects like blindness so you may not even hit him at allthe next boss died within  minutes
literally
i just ran and whackedai has to be the worst i have ever seen
during the course of the game you will be partnered with various people
the battles in the game are realtime and as long as your character is in a battle mode you can switch between who you are actively controlling by using the select button
however if your main character dies you will have to start over from your last save
if you are controlling the main character and your partner dies you can resurrect them
it is a bit unfairthe ai though even after i figured it out stinks
there is a grid with zones
you can either set your character to be aggressive or timid use more magic or physical attacks
you position their icon within the grid to choose which attack style you would prefer
you have to manually do this for each new partner otherwise they will just stand there while you get yourself killedthen even if you do get the ai set to where they will attack they will attack using a method that may do no damage
if they are better with mana they will drain their mana casting at a monster even if it is doing  damage then move in to attack with melee
also they get stuck on a map and cant or wont follow you up a jump across an area etc
once you kill all the monsters on a map they will teleport to you but that does little to help you if the monsters are ganking youin terms of attacking and the like it is standard rpg fare
as aformentioned battles are realtime
you have to select the appropriate weaponspirit to attack each type of monster
one monster may take a lot of damage from the bow however another may take zero from the bow but lots from a specific type of magic
it is up to you to cycle through each and attack appropriatelytowns are small with standards like inns save points general stores and blacksmiths
weapons can only be upgraded if you have special vegetables or fruits
which you can grow with seeds that you collect in your hot house
weapons can be reinforced with different materials that you find
so in short you need to find materials to reinforce your weapon and vegetables to assign attributeslastly levelling and the like is a bit confusing
you can choose a level in a class and depending upon which you choose you will gain in different attributes
you can choose to level any class at any time
however your main class is fixed
so while you may decide to take a few points in say warrior if you have the bulk of your points in sage your main class will be like that of a cleric
none of this is satisfactorily explained by the gamecontrolsthe game controls to their credit are good
they respond well and i have never had a situation where i was pressing the a button and felt the system didnt register the attackcontrols for the heroine are as followsleft shoulder button jumpleft shoulder button  a meditateright shoulder button tap statheal boostright shoulder button hold attack w spirit assigneda button attack select a menu optionb button hold down to run exit a menuselect switch active character in battlestart menufor fighting you simply have to mash the a button or use magic
there really isnt much strategy in that regard
menus are complex though and there is no way to quickly assign a hotkey
so for instance if you want to change which kind of magic you have to scroll through menus find the new spirit set it back out of the menus then use the right shoulder button
it is just as complicated to change weapon typesmovement is like a standard gameboy title
not much to say theregraphics and soundgraphics are reminiscent of another gameboy title golden sun
the graphics are sprites and the backgrounds are detailed and colorful
particle effects are not really pretty
your character is nice to look at and menu pictures are clear if not really detailedsound is standard gameboy fare
bit sounding and nothing overly special
i play with the sound off
there are different sounds for different game areas but for the most part you will be disgustedthere is no voiceacting
all conversations are based on text and some story choices are textbasedfinal saythis title is cutesy but the story doesnt make much sense
the gameplay is frustratingly unbalanced the menus are too time consuming and when it is all said and done it seems like square tried to throw so many silly side quests that serve no purpose into the title that the game borders on ridiculous
in the end while it is a way to kill time i wouldnt recommend this title to anyone even the diehard fans
save your money and buy one of the many better gameboy rpg titles out there even something as textheavy as golden sun
at least that one makes more sensethe game is ok if you like hack and slash with little to no character development and no chance to create your own character
the clips are ok but the movie was better
go see the movie if thats what you want but dont get the game just for the clips
the dvd will be out soon enoughim a pc player first and foremost except when it comes to nintendo titles but performancewise you are better off purchasing it for the psxboxgamecube
if thats not an option for you you may want to pass
its like they skipped the optimization part of the coding and went straight to releasethe game itself is an improvement over the previous title the two towers
there are longer levels and the environment interaction is most welcome
at its core its a basic fighting game that provides some thrills but it isnt very memorableits also a lot more fun to do coop and you will need an extra controller for your pc so keep that in mind when deciding on a purchasedo you want to save your game sometimes
if so you will have to finish an entire level
i thought i would never get that far
yes i have spent a great deal of time playing games that are this difficult but better designed
after you get the the nd level what if you want to start a new game
the only way i could do it was to go to the windows task manager and kill the process
after that i had to restart the game and watch the video intro again
i know they are proud of the graphics yes i liked the movie butive had this game for a week or so now and so far its been decently fun but few racing games are able to steer away from leading players into an utter hopeless feeling of frustration sometimes
some days i put  hours of game play into it because in all truth im competitive and i like racing games
fun aside the game is somewhat frustrating
first i would like to admit a few of my own personal flaws
i like racing games but im not too keen to adjustment details not seen in this game this game is very simple
adjustment details that can be found in much more advance higher caliber detail concentrated games like forza
because of number  i concentrate more on more simpler games
thankfully theres nfs
my favorite nfs thus far is most wanted and the original older hot pursuit pc
i like them because even though theyre frustrating sometimes the game is more easy going and you win more often
i know thats not the greatest reason but i feel like the mixture of the two is more balanced in a positive way with those games
im also not a fantastic or very constantly good player
one game im god the next i cant go  ft without hitting something
i have a bad temper especially with frustrating games
my frustration is reasonable sometimes even though i blame my lack of skills a bit more but sometimes it just cant be helpedso ill go to the point of way i think this game is lacking and frustratingnote that i play in career mode aka underground
i play this game and of course the graphics is not that great it is a fairly old 
gaming has advanced significantly during that time
anyhow my point here is that the details are not adequate enough sometimes to let you see whats coming at you
when you race you not only have to watch out for your rivals but also whats in front of you and sometimes cars that not only go in your direction but in the opposite direction as well
i cant really say that anyone is good enough to react fast enough to all occasions
two examples would be going down hill where you momentarily go in slow motion through a third person oftenside point of view and turning corners whether sharp or not
i would race and the next thing i notice is a small bit of light and in a millisecond crash
so during that moment the details that i see my head is trying to confirm whether it is a car or something else maybe part of the scenary
the details are just not clear enough to tell you that to help you react fast enough its just very hard
the details in games that have you traveling at this speed with obstacles that are traveling at their speed towards you should be spot on clear and crisp
this goes the same with a very similar other game called burnout
car position and spawning
were talking about random cars used as obstacles
sometimes they would stop while crossing the street for no reason right in front of you
sometimes they would spawn near or in front of you
sometimes they just appear down a steep hill which makes it almost impossible to maneuverer around because you dont even see them until youre practically over them
if you play this game youll probably notice that when youre near your rival racers they tend to get into accidents a lot more
sometimes they would run into obvious objects to the point where its just too obvious to be left unnoticed where you start to understand that theyre getting into accidentsnot on accident but on purpose
like their main objective was to pretend to give you the feeling of a real race where everyone can have accidents
however off and away from your view youll start to notice that they almost always catch up and rarely get into accidents
if they get into accidents nearly as much as they do when you see them how do they ever catch up
an obvious accident is running straight into another car even though the other car is still relatively far away
i dont understand the upgrade part of the game
they give you upgrades only for you to keep up with the other cars
its like you never get an increased advantage over the other cars due to your newlyrecently acquired upgrades
the other cars will always be as good if not better
the only reason you ever catch up is because of your reckless speed
i know the game is made to do this to give you a challenge but it also demeans the thought of upgrading
also take note that the other cars will match your upgrade so if you dont upgrade they dont either
new cars
i choose my car based on stats and until the th race where the skyline is availableunlocked all other cars have lower stats so whats the use in giving me new cars when my old car that i originally had the choice of choosing mazda remains the best car in comparison
i keep unlocking new cars to drive yet i dont see why i should even use them
money
i play mostly on hard mode and until recently started going into medium because it started becoming a game of frustration than recreation
anyhow money in this game feels worthless
i have something like k and i dont see myself ever using it all
im almost completely upgraded accept the last threesince when you buy an upgrades for one car all the other cars that are available will also have those upgrades available to them i dont understand where the money is going into
i bought all the level paints almost all the upgrades full  star and i have tons of money left
hard mode gives you more money but i dont see the use of it
i read in some guides that playing it almost completely in medium mode should give you enough money for everything
thats nice but i dont really want everything
im a completionist in training but only when it counts
im not a hoarder of stuff that i dont even want
so if im not buying a ton of worthless stuff that i dont care for or dont even like whats the money for
i could very well play the whole game in the lowest difficulty and still probably have enough money
theres really only a small handful of cars to use and in underground mode theres a very very small variety of maps to use
mostly they just make you go in reverse or open up an extra road here or there
youll be racing in the same area over and over thats a good andor bad thing depends on how you look at it
why is this game even called underground anyway
i dont see anything underground from it that is different from the others in the nfs franchiseoverallthis game is a little too much based on luck especially with so little detail that you literally have to squint to make out the details of whats in front of you
cars jumping out of nowhere not getting into random accidents during a lap of racingone lap is something trying to cheat your luck on all  lap for examplethats just a little too much
the longest ive played a single race is an hour
i wanted to punch my monitor but its an lcd monitor and i dont have the money or time to replace it sothis game is so much based on luck be prepared to click the restart button a few dozen times especially on hard mode and even on medium modeis the game fun though
yeah
my advice is keep racing till the end sometimes for some weird reason you might seem like youre losing for most of the race but you might be able to win
luck and reckless speeding is your bonus over the ai
however if youre like  behind and you know you crash a lot its better to restart
just turn the difficulty down if it becomes frustrating
its a game its suppose to be fun and being frustrated id rather just go to work or somethinghowever i do notice that sometimes the change in difficulty doesnt always make the race significantly easier for yousee my review of age of mythology for further depthwhen compared to such expansion packs as the tiny starcraft brood war the even tinier warcraft ii expansion the hearty diablo ii lord of destruction and the massive command and conquer red alert  yuris revenge this one is more within the realm of starcraft brood warwhile brood war only introduced some new maps a new campaign and some new units this expansion pack introduces a whole new race fully playable in both skirmishes and the campaign
this race is reminiscent of the greeks only with more ancient units such as myrmidons think troy and more cretanminoan looking architecture
this is atlantiswhile the new race has its own new system of units and a very unique form of worker which doesnt need to return to a dropoff point this isnt enough to deter from the problem plaguing the original game
with the existence of allpowerful myth units and god powers what is the point of having a human armythis is only further exacerbated by the presence of titansrather than be restricted a new ability is open to any race with enough resources to reach it firstthey upgrade to some new age above mythic i forget its name i think it is called titan age in which rather than change anything they get a mound of rocks to place anywhere on the map
then they send as many villagers as possible to work on it and when it is done a titan springs up different depending on your race and what major god you have chosenwhile the titan is not invincible he may as well be because with the short population cap you have youre not likely to build enough units to withstand a titan with an army to back it up
titans are super effective against most all infantry other myth units and buildingssort of changing a small problem from the first god powers can be reused depending on what they are
for example while meteor strike and earthquake and tornado and such an only be used once the more base god powers like trees of gaia can be used up to four or five times though not all at onceand so the expansion pack not only doesnt change the flaws of the original but exacerbates them with more super units and the grossly overpowered titansthis is not a fun game to play
i am very puzzled with its tutorial
it doesnt help you much to understand the game as the tutorial is just some screenshots with some text on it
you have to memorize them all then when you are on the game you have to practice what the tutorial has told you before
sighon the gameplay i found difficulties in building my first airport
as the tutorial given was not clear at all i built my airport based on my trialanderror method
this was really time consuming and wasting my money
i built some things wrongly and i had to demolish them and built the new oneafter i created my first airport i didnt know what to do
i kept waiting and waiting until  minutes later an airline contract came in
the notification for the airline contract was not so clear
it was only representated by a tiny red dot on your control panel
hhi had to wait another  minutes to get my nd contract
oh
this game was so boring and not entertaining at all
i uninstalled this game from my pc
i would suggest you to avoid this worthless gamei bought this game for my  year old son because he loves roller coaster tycoon ski resort tycoon and zoo tycoon
this tycoon game had nice graphics and music when we found a computer that had an adequately equipped video card but that was about it for positive qualities
the manual is horrible the online tutorial is useless and gameplay is not intuitive when it comes to figuring out what the player should be doing as far as building and the business end of running an airport
the money runs out way too fast and the contracts come in way too slow  not a lot of action or fun
one of my biggest pet peeves about this program is that there are spelling and grammar errors throughout the program
it is almost like the person who wrote it doesnt speak english as hisher first language
not a good example for kids unless you want to teach them how not to check their workthis is one tycoon game i would suggest avoidingfor one thing the antipiracy block used on this game made it impossible for me to install it on my computer with vista even with loads of tech support etc
i ended up playing it on a friends older computer and half the graphics were blurredaside from the technical difficulties i must admit at times i enjoyed this game for the most part
the problems though are too numerous to overlook and i wont be playing it again
its too slow and plodding as others have pointed out and i got tired of hearing the same tired phrases over and over robert may i speak to you a moment
i have something i wish to talk to you about
substitute the name of any character for robert each time you wanted to inquire of someone
it got monotonous and there were times i stopped playing it altogether for a week or twoi wasnt as disappointed with the ending as some people were
perhaps though i was just glad to get it over with finallyi really wanted to like black mirrorthe gothic atmosphere was great and the story had the potential to be worldclass scary
unfortunately the click on everything a few times and come back to it later setup was so annoying that i finally resorted to playing with a walkthrough so i could just enjoy some parts of the game without the frustration of counterintuitive actionsmost of the puzzles werent terribly difficult but the walkthrough saved me from pixel hunting and multiple fruitless conversationsand yes the ending is as bad as everyone else said it wasthe whole focus of this game is that you drive incredibly fast and customise cars
if anyone who is reading this doesnt know what burnout  is then let me give you the gist of it
the whole focus is that you drive about   no   times faster than this game and you drive agressively
it doesnt have must customisation but its a hell of alot of fun
raming apponents into walls and having them explode is much more fun than this game
this game decent at first but then loses its charm
this game is slow compared to burnout  has hideous music than will pierce through your eardrums like a butchers knife bad collisions and is just not fun at all
buy burnout  if you want an excellent racing experience that you dont even need to like racing to enjoy and experience burnout s goodness
did i mention its only  bucks and there is a sequel coming out in a month called burnout revengeneed for speed underground has no xbox live but its available for ps online
the reason to this is because of a marketing fight between microsoft and ea games
ea games wanted microsoft to advertise their games to be the number  online games for xbox live
microsoft refused and ea games was too stuck up just to allow this to have xbox live
i mean if it is really the best game out there than theres no reason to advertise heavilly
halo is the number one reason to get xbox but its not advertised heavily but many people love it and it advertises itself word by mouthea games are trying to overhype the game so youll buy it and later you noticed its not much of a game
i believe ea games blows more of their company money on advertising than making a wonderful game
and also they have like so many expansion packs out for the sims because they are too lazy to make a new sims and just look for cheap ways to squeeze the most money out of the people
need for speed underground is probably the last game ea games thats coming out for xbox unless if ea games compromises with microsofti got a chance to finish this game one time all the way through but this was before my system had problems with this game like freezing up in certain seens on the game
i still cant figure out what the problem is of why the game freezes up on my pc i have a dell  running a p at ghz and gig of rdram pc radeon  all in wonder card
im still trying to figure out how to work around this i have the latest drivers on all my hardwarethis is a great game and theres a  chance it will work on your pc
me ive mostly been a metal of honor fan never had no problems running that game
this one is fun if you can get it to run in max graphics without freezing upmany good solid reviews maybe they were written when the game came out and it was better at that time but i love these types of games aoe an others but this one was difficult at time to learn  play and when i did get it and played it well the gameplay was just not what i wanted or likedhey kids fire up the xbox and lets watch this movie
that is what is heard through households that own an xbox but for some reason or another they are still in the s and dont already have a dvd playerlike my title suggests if you already have a dvd player this is a waste of money
the only reason i purchased one is because my dvd player had problems playing some dvdrs that i got from a friend
i had some money to burn so i just wanted to see if the xbox dvd kit could play it to determine if the dvd was a bad burn or was it just my dvd player
i found that the xbox was able to play the dvdrs in question with no problem
however aside from those two dvdrs all of the dvds i own are bought from retail stores so i really have no need to play dvdrs and my dvd player plays normal discs perfectlywith that being said i only used xboxs dvd playback kit once to watch the dvdrs i had problems with
because of the content of these burned movies there is really no need to watch them again however if push comes to shove i can always use one of my pcs or mac to watch the burned dvd no need to use my xbox for that
i meant to return the dvd kit the next day but never got around to itthe xboxs dvd player is a good feature but the fact that microsoft charges you to use the feature makes it not worth the moneyunless of course you dont have a dvd player at allcame damaged and with non stock screws that were rusty i also had to clean the laser lens for it to work but it did workback in  when playstation was released it was the coolest thing to date
lighting fast gameplay sharp graphics it couldnt get any better
then here comes ps
even better gameplay graphics and features
ive had my ps since  it worked fine unti mid
then i started to get the usual discread error and now even a brand new game takes ages to get to work
as far as i know playstation  is a waste of money
at first i thought it was just my unit but everyone i know has some kind of ps trouble
im not blowing it out proportion either everybody ps that ive heard of had malfunctioned at least two years after its shelf birthdate and purchase
its not just ps either pretty much anything sony sucks these days
i doubt ill be purchasing a ps since every ps and ps i have heard of has malfunctioned way too soon
disc read errors happening in five years maybe but two even one year for most
no way
besides these big negatives ps is beautiful and has some great games and an awesome emotion system
if only the units were good quality then itd be a  systemi didnt read what i was buying so this was the first bad experience i had with amazon
not only was it missing the cables the door wouldnt open and i ended up having to throw the whole thing away
a wasted 
live and learni enjoyed my ps for a good  months or so
i didnt play it too much maybe an average of  hours a week
then all of the sudden it started to sound like like a low pitch squirel after another day it didnt work at all
it seems like the only part that is broken is the cdromdvd drive
it wont recognize any of my games anymore and says to put a cd in that is in ps format
even when the games are brand new with no scratchesi decided to check my warranty info from amazon and sony but it was only good for  days
so im pretty much out of luck
my genesis sega cd and nintendo all still work today
but my almost new ps is now nothing more than useless junki talked to some friends and they told me that this is pretty common
they told me stories of them and their friends who had their pss break for no reason as wellif you buy one make sure you get some kind of extended warranty because even though its a sony product it is prone to breakingi have a gamecube and xbox and a ps and by far the ps is the worst
the systems have their own speacal things
the xbox has great shooters the gamecube has great kids games mario games but the ps has nothing
they barely have any original games
the gamecube and xbox have many original games
also the ps games are not that great
the memory cards also cost a lot more than the gamecube memory cards are a lot cheaperthe ps is designed to have disc read error after warranty expiration
it will just break down for no obvious reason
there is a class action lawsuit against sony because so many people have complained about this problemone of the things i love about the banjokazooie games is their personality
even though gruntys revenge is a graphical breakthrough for the game boy advance it has none of that personality
it feels more like a rehash of banjokazooie and tooie without hardly any inspiring elements about itthe plot is supposed to take place between the two nintendo  instalments
gruntilda the witch has escaped from under her rocky tomb by means of a spirit machine klungo has invented even if he was never a genius and now she kidnaps kazooie and goes back in time to change the past
by doing this she hopes to make sure kazooie and banjo never meet and thus never beat grunty
banjo travels to the past to save kazooie and prevent gruntilda from carrying out her evil planthis plot sounds promising enough
the trouble is that the game itself is a very confusing and worse uninspiring experience to play
this game has none of the character of the n games
there are no worlds like treasure trove cove click clock wood or jolly rogers lagoon
instead we have a rather dull beach level a town with some sludge and oil and a farm 
to name  of the  you play through
this should give you an idea as to what to expect
interesting characters are practically nonexistent as well though we do at least get to meet a young captain blubber even if i had to consult the rare fandom to confirm this because his appearance is very brief
everything feels uninspiring and coldthe gameplay is just as bad
a forefather of bottles called bozzeye is on hand to teach banjo moves in exchange for notes
however before banjo consults him he cant do a thing except move around
thats right
its no fun at all to have to find a mole to be able to climb a ladder
the layout of the game is very confusing as well
it has a semiisometric viewpoint that makes it almost impossible to judge jumps and distances like you must frequently do
the jiggies are either way too easy more than one world has an easy slide jiggy or ridiculously hard
one jiggy in spillers harbor is very frustrating to get because of the limited viewpoint and the ridiculously short timer you get
a couple of enemies kill you way too fast and they respawn almost the second you turn your back
honeycombs are also rare and inbetween and you never really feel that youre getting anywhere
trust me it isnt any more fun that it soundsthis game may be called banjokazooie but it has none of the character and spirit to deserve that name
i consider gruntys revenge more of an experiment in what the game boy advance is capable of than a good game because sadly its not
dust off your nintendo  if you want to know what makes a good banjo gamei bought this game a couple of weeks ago and it is very difficult
it is more than what i expected
i can get through the first level but after that i cant get much further
i have tried everything to get past the second level but it is quite frustrating
i hope that nintendo releases a players guide for this game soon because that would really help out alot
i got through the first banjokazooie on n with help from a players guide but you need one for this game
unless nintendo releases a players guide i will not be able to figure this game outbanjo kazooie is like a joyride through nostalgia for me
unfortunately even nostalgia cant save this titlebanjo kazooie has never taken itself very seriously
that is what makes it so lovable
however this game doesnt even try to catch your interest or perhaps it tries too hard
taking place between banjo kazooie and banjo tooie gruntilda apparently sends her ghost to possess a robot and harasses banjo and kazooie
she kidnaps kazooie and banjo has to rescue his feathered buddy himself
perhaps this is a pull at the heartstrings separating banjo and kazooie but without kazooies constant sarcasm the story feels too drystory graphics are not too bad for game boy advancegraphics sounds and music are fairly consistent with previous titlessound gameplay is where this game truly suffers
unlike tooie previous abilities are absent
the lack of kazooie makes much of the game feel slow
worlds are very small and uninteresting
and then its over before you know it
this game is incredibly shortgameplay replayability is very low
i have my doubts even the biggest banjo kazooie fan will play this one twicereplay value last the title is kid friendly as are all banjo kazooie titlesoverall this game does not do justice for the banjo kazooie name
if youre longing for another banjo kazooie game do not look here as this will just leave you wanting something more substantial
first timers should definitely avoid this one as they will miss what makes banjo kazooie greatthe ngage does everything that the gbasp cant
the thing is is that the gbasp does everything the ngage doesnt as well
the ngage can play mps and can act as a cell phone
it uses something called bluetooth technologhy that does well something
it plays old games that weve all seen before with playstation like graphics
you can even play with people you dont know as long as they have an ngage you can play multiplayer games and connect to that person without a wire or anything
but what can it not do play games decently
first of all this system has terrible graphics
i base this on the many many slow downs that continually happen
in fact the game system is always slowing and the frame rate always seems to be just too much for the little ngage
at the moment there is no must have game
this is because well there is no reason there just arent any good games for the system no ngage exclusive nothing like thatthat leaves us with this
the ngage us a new video gaming system that is more costly then the xbox and ps is portable has bad playstation graphics with no games and no depth
and to top it all off it can be used as a mediocore phone
a phone that looks really wierd and can be embarassing if your seen with itoverall dont buy this
i urge you not to buy it
pick up a nokia  still plays ngage games if you really want them or some type of verizon phone and try a gbasp
thats alot better for yaas the title of this post attests one should never buy the first version of marketnew electronics
same happened with gameboy advance zen jukebox apples ipod and so forththe problem nowadays is that manofacturers have less and less time to test thoroughly the equipment before launching it
nokia has the right stuff in this socalled quotconvergence electronicsquot thing is they did not pay attention to seemingly conspicous details
for instance the vertical orientation of the screen is utterly annoying
the phone could not be any more kneejerk put in place you need to put your ear in the profile of this device to talk
yes the graphics are ps quality but the controller is not hence making some games unplayable
the pda if you want to call that a pda is mediocre at best
i mean since when a calendar a appointment planner and a phone book can be called a pda
the mp player is alright nothing special
and the fm radio finction i admit is pretty handy and neat to havesure you can enjoy the device if you buy a series of attachments which will of course raise the price of ownership
i highly suggest to wait until the either they come with a revised model or to wait for another manofacturer to outsmart nokia
this one is not worth my nickelok so i knew it was like baldurs gate but unfortunately its worse
it gives you too many options to deal with items customizations and whatnot and not enough fun action
i was really hoping a big problem with baldurs gate aiming arrows would be fixed but nope
it wasnt
in fact the problem was worse
screw this gamechampions of norrath realms of everquest grafts the topdown seen from above hack n slash action engine ofbaldurs gate dark allianceonto the names and places that define the world ofeverquest i the anniversary edition
as evidenced by my reviews ofalien syndromeandphantasy star portable im pretty forgiving when it comes to this kind of game
it has to be pretty awful for me to actually not play it especially if i have someone to play it with
my girlfriend decided shed dive into some game or another with me on the ps so wed be playing together on one screen sitting together on the couch nice fire going in the fireplace and so on
i happily dug out this dungeon crawler that id gotten some time ago but never playedif you want only to know if champions manages to deliver on the very most basic elements of this kind of game then you can stop right here because this will take awhile
the answer is yes it generally lets you do what a dungeon crawler should
you have a few different classes you have a few different locales you can kill things and take their stuff and you can keep on doing that for hours as the game offers three successive difficulty levels each making the same story progressively tougher for higher level ranges
it supports up to four players locally with multitap and has a clientserver network mode that is probably based on a server that is no longer runninga few basic archetypes common to this sort of game define the classes healer tank ranged dps damagepersecond and magic dps as well as a hybrid meleemagic class
however though they hit all the right notes in concept execution is sloppy to be polite
the tank class while quite hardy has no real tools for managing aggro who the enemy nonplayer characters are attacking which means that the healer isnt really free to heal since theyre defending themselves instead of relying upon the tank
the magic dps class doesnt really do much damage considering all of the drawbacks it has with such a narrow focustheres nothing inherently wrong with this sort of gameplay but its frustrating to see familiar terms and trappings sit down to play and discover that theres really nothing like what was described in the manual insofar as gameplay anywhere in the actual game
its not really a cooperative multiplayer dungeon crawler so much as it is a simultaneous overlapping single player dungeon crawlerchampions makes use of a prepatchdiablo style skill tree for each of five classes
when i say prepatch i refer to the fact that when diablo  first released one of the chief complaints players had against it was that early skills in any given skill tree often felt like they served no purpose other than gating access to higherlevel and presumably better skills later in the tree
towards the end of the games life later patches included an update that made earlier skills improve upon later ones in the same line of the tree such that maxing those skills or raising them as high as the game allowed wasnt necessarily a waste of points since it improved the function of a descendantno such luck in champions as we get skills that not only have no impact on later skills in a tree beyond gating access to them but skills that often seem as though theyre only in a certain part of the tree because there wasnt any better place to put them
with a little digging online you can find out what each skill does for each class at each level some classes share a skill but with different levels of effectiveness by level for each
however the game itself has almost nothing to offer in that regard as it only ever tells you what the current skill level does and the next level if it exists
there is also a surprising lack of skillboosting gear in the game at least so far as weve played itcombined with the allsalesarefinal approach to skill point management the game progressively feels more and more punishing as any skill point regret you may suffer can only be assuaged by starting over and being more miserly
not only do you have no real good idea how any given skill grows to its maximum level of  such as when it hits a point where you would personally consider it to be offering diminishing returns but if you decide to really commit and dump a bunch of points in only to discover you wish you hadnt well
too badin action skills are assigned by means of an eightway radial menu managed with the dpad in concert with either the triangle or circle buttons
this menu can be arranged from the character sheet and used while playing without pausing to assign skills to either button
when the action ebbs its a passable enough system which manages to pack a whole lot of skills into two teeny tiny buttons
but when the blood and gore are aflyin its clumsiness is exacerbatedsay youre a cleric for example which often lives or dies by its numerous selfbuffs skills that improve stats in various categories for their duration
for each of them you must press and hold the dpad in the direction of the skill you wish to assign press the button to which you wish to assign it then release the button then release the dpad then press the button to actually cast it
then you get to repeat this process for each buff all of which start with impossibly short durations before finally rereassigning the button to a more regularly used active skill like holy strike a ranged spell attack
annoying enough when youre not even in combat but potentially lethal to your character when you are
according to its manualchampions return to arms the sequel solves this problem by allowing the player to press the square button in combination with the dpad to simply trigger a skill at that location in addition to the assignment model from this game a vast improvement but thats another review
like any other dungeon crawler champions is very lootoriented with the rapid cycle of kill something take its stuff equip it and repeat generally making up the entirety of the game
a storyline of sorts is sprinkled about here and there but its really just an excuse to change the backdrop and offer more things to kill because those things have stuff you can take
whenever youre full you use a gate scroll or one of the portal stones scattered about the landscape to return to the town for that act sell what you dont want keep what you do resupply on health or mana potions arrows throwing spears etc and then return to the frayunfortunately the encumbrance system which limits how much you can carry with the exception of quest items which are uniformly weightless regardless of how absurd that often is is unbalanced and halfbaked
the answer is to raise your strength stat which directly increases the amount of weight you can carry andor to put points into a passive skill that every class shares which increases the amount you can carry as wellnaturally this is a pretty useless skill for the barbarian which has a combatbased reason to raise strength as strength impacts melee damage output
on the other hand this means its also not really a problem for the barbarian
unfortunately our poor friend the wizard has to decide where he wants to be wasteful with a skill that has no impact on his already pathetic damage or with a stat thats equally without value in all other regardschampions does make use of a slotting system also very reminiscent of diablo  wherein various items that have no purpose on their own can be irrevocably attached to an equippable item provided it has enough slots to accept them
these items can raise base stats like strength or intelligence add elemental damage provide resistance to such damage etc
each comes in five tiers of effectiveness but there is no mechanism by which lesser types can be cashed in for greater
there is also curiously no level bar or any other bar to using them although you cannot stack the same type multiple times in the same item
that is if you slot a rune into your sword that raises strength by  you cannot put another one into that sword
you can however put one into every single other piece of equipment you have provided it does not already have a strength bonus effectively raising your strength by over  right at level 
for scale your starting strength is anywhere between about  and 
there is also no storage area so if you find something that is for a cleric but youre a barbarian and you think id like to make a cleric and use that item you will need to survive the obstacle course that is champions save and load system
while your current game is indicated with an asterisk in the save and load menu the rest of the data is almost uniformly worthless
it tells you to which difficulty the game is set it tells you the date and time it was saved and it tells you the area in which it was saved
no character names or levels nothing to tell you whos actually in there
that wouldnt be so bad if the entire save and load system didnt take so long or occasionally crash the systemif you are careful though you can work around the lack of a vault by spawning endless copies of mules characters who serve no purpose other than to store loot
and since you can load any character into any game at almost any time regardless of difficulty you can also make as many copies of that loot as you want
while this makes for some insanely overpowered items when slotted with infinite copies of socket items it simultaneously neuters the coolsounding unique items
ordinarily if you couldnt make infinite copies of everything finding a named chest plate for example that has a couple soso mods and one free slot would be a boon
however given the choice between that item or one with a similar armor value and three slots the decision is obviousthe resistances which can also be acquired on some jewelry range from the very obvious fire to the completely obscure magic
but much like the skill tree since its never really clear exactly what resistance does whether it be reducing your chance to be hit by the damage type or reducing the amount of damage you suffer from it and in some cases its not even clear with which damage type youre being attacked unfortunately not fire isnt a category the advantage of having some is equally murkyand then theres presentation
voice actors dont seem to be sure what sort of accent theyre affecting and sadly however unsurprisingly a clear gender bias is present throughout
leave a female shadow knight idle long enough and shell let you know that if you keep looking at me like that ill have to charge extra
because shes already charging you to look at her
you know like a woman
take her into a lavafilled cavern and the first thought that pops into her head predictably is that this place is hotter and steamier than i am
but arent you also really handy with a sword
sure but who cares about that
hot and steamyi realize this game is now over six years old as i write this but even today this remains a real problem with this industry in general
i understand target markets and all that and i dont see anything wrong with visually pleasing characters of either gender being used to draw an audience
at the same time however for the gaming industry to muse upon the mysterious illusive female gamer while simultaneously and needlessly filling the huge majority of games with any sort of violence with such shameless sexism is hypocritical not to mention lazy and pathetic
its degrading to women at large and insulting to male gamers as wellfor the meat of the gameplay itself there is some faint glimmer of elegance as upgrading the speed of your weapon by way of a misty globe series socket item will change the pace with which you may use it
that does not mean however that you can get away with just mashing the button as fast as possible and capitalize on this
it means instead that you must find the precise rhythm your weapons speed requires at the default speed and each of the five varying tiers of misty globes and tap the x button accordingly
if you manage to do so you will be rewarded with that increased attack rate which offers potentially significant boosts to your damage
its not much but frankly in one of the worst dungeon crawlers ive played in years and thats saying something its a welcome relief
a game that was made bearable almost entirely because i was playing with my girlfriend as we at turns shook our heads in disbelief at some aspects and laughed at others sometimes because we just didnt know what else to do was elevated somewhat by the discovery of a crude semblance of challenging gameplayon the other hand faced with more than two or three enemies at a time at least in a twoplayer simultaneous game the engine chugs and there is noticeable slowdown
this of course impacts that timing in a way that isnt quite sporting
mind you its still painfully easy to slog through the enemies of this game
player deaths are few and far between and owe in equal measure to tactical error a random itch now and again and the occasional sudden appearance of absurdly cute little kittens in various unexpected parts of our home the latter two of which we have found far more interesting
the discovery that there was actually some challenge to aspire to meet anywhere in the game at all was a godsendi could go on for hours about everything thats wrong with this game and cover whats right in just a few short sentences
but as i said im generally pretty easy on this kind of game
can i kill stuff
check
can i take its stuff
check
the graphics are as good as anything else on the ps so i should be good to go right
well given the limited selection of dungeon crawlers on ps yeah i guessi think the first baldurs gate dark alliance was the best of this genre of games on the ps
i was surprised when the same studio came out with such a shoddy producti knew things were going to be bad when the snowblind studios penguin didnt appear in their intro screen how hard is it to copy the penguin into this game
the intro was very long  talky but forgivable
the ability to choose male  female version of each character was nice as well as customizing their appearancethen we started to play
the gameplay was ok but we really missed being able to jump and after just having played baldurs gate dark alliance ii sprint but it was forgivable
i started out as the wizard  his first spell is some sort of cold attack i forget the name
but you have to aim it precisely which is a pain
it kept sailing past the enemies id intended for it to hit sometimes by tiny amountsmy girlfriend got bored of the game  i started a solo dark knight  what a cool character class
but i didnt want to get too far ahead because i didnt want to ruin the surprise for when were playing together so i started a barbarian
being able to zoom in in combat is cool but it also limits how far you can seen
getting out of  then back in to the inventory screens the game froze
id heard this game was buggy but this suckedi pursuaded my girlfriend to keep playing and we were progressing
the random locations are cool but can be annoying when various dungeons are scattered around the map
we wanted to clear the overland area first  then do the dungeons but not the main dungeon so we had to run back to the first one which was tedious
anyway i forget exactly what we were doing but the game froze again
thats  times in  dayswhen you pass a checkpoint or enter a new area it saves your data so you dont have to go though the process of saving the game making it more like gta which is great but if its going to keep crashing youll have to save at every save point anyway and then its minutes waiting for the game to load again when you reset the psso overall my review is fun game not as fun as the first baldurs gate dark alliance but neither is the second in that series but crashes way too much
seriously disappointed in snowblind for releasing such buggy software
next time guys push back  dont release until youre readyi honestly do not like cheat devices but since wild arms  came out it actually now has a use
let me explainunfortunately thanks to an programming on the part of xseed puplishing the company that translated wild arms  it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device or a similar device like a gameshark
since this is the cheapest of all said devices if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game youll want to shell out the twenty dollars for thisif it wasnt for this reason i wouldnt even be interested in this producti have worked and worked and gone over and over all the hints helps and made cotact with all the characters and i am stuck in the light house
the telephone callhints tell me the light house has some oil for the morse code light but i have looked all over the light house and cant find any oil
and the hits have become very vague
i cant find help anywhere
i advise everybody not to buy this game
it starts out ok
but then it show some malfunctioning bugs
perhaps that is why it is selling for 
too bad
i like nancy drew
for me her games are now suspect with bugs
i will not buy another nancy drew game
too bad so sad
o well moving onvivianai never myself liked any tom clancy games just because of their controls and style i am very picky when it comes to the games i like and i must say this game was not to my likingfirst off the single player is horrible so simply dont bother with thatnext off the online mode is not very well done either simply because there is not enough people online and the levels are too hugenext the graphics are horrible
i know graphics arent everything but these graphics are absolutely horriblefinally the one and only good thing the multi player
i found the split screen mode enjoyable to play with a friend because you actually have to make up strategies for this game you cant run and gun in this game without a strategyall in all this game is only good if you have a buddy next to you playing it with youterrible graphics pc version is much better socom  is a better game not at all what i was expecting the game play is slugish and team members sometimes ignore youalthough the games cel shaded graphics and design is simular to the batman animated series drakes does not exceed my expectationsthe game seems too rushed and the levels can become frustrating and unispiredmajesco was on a roll with gunmetal and bloodrayne the  hit sleepers of  but drake is sorely lacking
for shooting action and better graphicsplayability choose gungrave insteadbetter luck next time guyssorry i know this is suppose to be a great gamebut i couldnt get into it at all
combat was terrible just atrocious
the quests were ok from what i didthere wasnt much direction though so it was a lot of guess work and find the hiding npc or itemwhich wasnt fun when you found out your missing an item with no leads at all as to where that item might be located
in a world as big as elder scrollsgood thing finding something with no idea as to where it isvery bad thing in a huge world just isnt good at allwanted a fantasy game that didnt require highspeed internet to playsorrythis game doesit wont even install without signing up to a web sitebad form old boyi am an avid computer gamer primarily of real time strategy but occassionally other genres
i enjoy rpgs as well including the final fantasy series dungeon siege ii and diablo ii but elder scrolls  morrwind was just not a good game
why you may askwell my main problem with it is the battle interface which is a primary aspect of the game
hiting enemies esspecally short ones is very inaccurate and cumbersome causing a great deal of fusteration
this completely ruins the fun aspect of the game
also it can be occassionally difficult to figure out where youre going or what is happening
while this is true of many rpgs i found it to be a much more significan issue with this game
i have a feeling that some of those who enjoy everquest type games will enjoy this however many casual rpgers and people who appreciate a good battle interface will notalso while graphics are not that important to an rpg this game is kind of weird here
some aspects such as water and landscape are beautiful when the graphics are turned up
however characters monsters etc are very poorly rendered and akward looking and actingthe game has an overal cheesy feel dispite its depth
i have given this game probably  hours of play and it was not fun at the beginning and it still isnti really wanted to like this game
really
friends of mine had shown me the gorgeous graphics and said that the replay value was endlessthe problem was i never got though it once
if you had the sound on it crashed every  minutes
if you turned the sound off you might get away with  minutes of continuous play
after several hours of this applying every patch and every suggestion i gave upwhen i first played this game i loved it
it was fun and pretty easy
but after  days it put me to sleep
booooooooooringive been a big fan of the roller coaster tycoon games in which the gameplay is centered on the fun of developing an amusement park and getting to see the rides in action with the businessoriented quotgoalsquot for each scenario being kind of an afterthought
if you failed to meet the goals in time it was still fun to design the park itselfthis was my first railroad tycoon game so perhaps this was just my misconception to expect the same idea
i imagined it would be like designing one of those miniature model train sets in your basement and getting to watch the trains travel through minature towns through mountains over bridges etc
frustratingly the game has almost nothing to do with this it is barely a model train simulation but rather it is almost strictly a business simulation
the gameplay focusses heavily on raising funds via issuing stocks or bonds investing in stocks determining which goods to have your trains pick up in which amounts at which stations checking and rechecking investment portfolios and ledgers with profits minus expenses etc
there is very little room for imagination in track design why pay more than the shortest track between any two points
the lanscapes are a little bleak and monotonous
again picture the opposite gameplay of sid meyers golf sim where the business aspect of the game takes a back seat to the fun of designing your own course watching sim players play on it and even being able to test out the course yourself
here i felt more like i was taking a required tutorial cd for econ i being a fan of the first max payne because of its storyline and gameplay was not disappointed by the sequel
although there was nothing new to the game i still found it quite fun
i enjoyed the dark storyline and settings
not to mention that the bullettime feature was somewhat improved
and even though this game is singleminded running through every level mowing down countless numbers of mobsters the compelling story and intense firefights compensated for thishowever max payne  has little replay value
in my opinion rockstar copped out when it came to adding replay value
all they did was include an alternate ending which can be unlocked by beating the game on the hardest setting
pretty much you play the exact same game again to get  minutes of difference in the end
what really made me mad was that my friend found the alternate ending on kazaa by typing in quotmax payne  alternate endingquot
he got to see it in two minutes while i spent five hours replaying the game to get the alternate endingalthough the game provided good entertainment for a limited amount of time it isint worth spending  on
especially since it is short and has no replay value
either borrow it from a friend or rent itthis is a thirdpersonshooter
as in a movie you are looking over theshoulder of the hero
you are not the hero
if thats what youreinto then the game is fine but if youre like me and want to be thehero then avoid this gameas with other similar games such as stranglehold product descriptionsleave out this aspect an unforgiveable omissionim going to offer a dissenting opinion here and say that grand theft auto or at least this version of it for the xbox is not quite as wonderful as some of its fans would have you believe
i picked up the double pack after hearing friends who had pss rave about these games for years
i also read a few reviews that said even though the graphics may be a little out of date the gameplay remained very compelling
well gta may have been groundbreaking in its day but i was less than impressed after making several attemps to wade into these two games
the graphics even though they may have been updated a little more for the xbox are bad
distractingly bad
the cars look okay but the buildings in the distance when you can see them remind me of the background of a sega genesis game
i am not kidding
youll see the same three or four characters repeated over and over again on the street saying the same things
the way the people move is also very cartoonish and offputting
the control scheme is frustratingly awkward as well
whoever translated them over from the ps controller to the xboxs did a horrible job
the combat system is poorly designed and the way in which you target and fire guns leaves much to be desired
finally within my first fifteen or twenty minutes of playing the game i noticed two glaring bugs the first of which was a loss of sound and the second a slowing down of the framerate to a glacial pace
both of these occurred in vice city for what its worth
if youre an xbox owner and have not played gta before i would recommend just renting these games to see if theyre for you instead of just buying them on the basis of word of mouth
the dialogue in the game is pretty funny and driving around the city is fun but the missions are fairly repetitious and get to be more of a chore than anything else
ultimately i found the booklets that came with each game more entertaining than the game itselfif youve read all the reviews here at amazon on this game youre probably pretty confused
some people claim its the greatest mmorpg ever
others say its the most boring and time consuming theyve played
if youre looking to buy this game its hard to make that decision based on the conflicting information
i doubt my review will help as its based on my experience only
this is exactly the nature of this game you either love it or hate itunfortunately for me this game did not live up to my expectations
however id like to start on the positives
firstly the games graphics are pretty good
there are three main base cities to start off in there are other cities that you can explore to but your ranks and missions are generally based on the three base cities
the environment changes dramatically in the different zones its refreshing to just take some time and explore the different scenery in the gamethis game is also huge
ive played it for a couple of months and i doubt ive seen more than  of the world
add to that the recent expansion makes the game even more mammoth
this also has a negative ill address it later
ffxi features all youd expect in a mmorpg
you have your different skills you can multiskill when you reach a specific level
you also have crafts which are side skills that you can do eg
fishing farming etc
the depth in this game is mind boggling
the number of side skills i believe there are eight or nine all have their own levelscurrency is also traded with something called gil
you need gil to get anywhere in this game
ffxi is heavily cooperation inclined
you cannot play this game solo and reach anywhere
anyone who says this would either be lying or have absolutely nothing else to do in their life
this is both a positive and a negative
the positive being it encourages players to group together share knowledge and play together
the negatives being theres always competition to find the best groups
people also tend to clique together and play separately from the whole communityi should note that ffxi is played amongst several servers
when you create your character you are randomly placed on a server
you cannot move from one server to the other this is your server for life
if you want to play on the same server as your friends you must buy with gil not real money something called a worlpass which your friend can enter when theyre creating their account
i have no problem with this system i understand its necessary for the maintenance of the popularity of this gamein the game theres a wide range of armor and weapons that can be bought or retrieved
in your characters class there are tons of spells and skills to be learned at periodic levels
the battle system is similar to most ff games however the speed of the battles greatly depends on your equipment
i like the battle system personally i find it very flowingon to the negatives and there are many
as i mentioned earlier the game is huge
this brings me to my greatest grievance with ffxi
it takes far too long to reach anywhere without the help of higher level spells or items airship
im sure the drop out rate with this game is high for new players
you can spend fifteen to twenty five minutes walking from one area to the other
i personally found myself spending more time walking than fighting
thats what drove me to stop playinganother big negative is the variety of mobs
theres a very limited number of mob classes available
most zones are limited to only three or four different mob classes of varying strength
this makes fighting extremely repetitive you are fighting the same looking thing each time
every city has insert name crab insert name worm insert name fly that all look the same
the developers really failed in providing variety to players especially since this game requires hundreds of hours to achieve mighty levels
a related negative would be the fact you have to consider every mob as you have no idea of the mobs strength if they look alike even in the same roombig negative number three relates to people selling gil for real money
yes it plagues all mmorpgs however most companies try to do something to clamp down on it
square has done absolutely nothing to try to control the sale of gil for money
what this has caused is the cost in gil of items to be sky high to due the easy availability of gil to those who are willing to spend money for it
this makes the game extremely difficult for the average player who simply gains gil from killing quests and trading items
ffxi is centered around trading items with other players theres a central auction house for this that you cant get around playing without buying your equipment
im not sure if its related to the gil selling however all the rare item drops are camped by dozens of people
the average player will never be able to achieve a valuable item without buying itfinally because you cant solo in this game you need to find yourself some friends to play with
if you cant join a group called linkshells you will be spending minutes or hours waiting to join parties
the number of hours required to reach anywhere in this game is ridiculous
thats probably why so many people are either terribly addicted to this game or absolutely frustrated
unfortunately for me ffxi wasnt for me
its too demanding on time and far too repetitive for me
there are some people this game appeals to im certainly not one of them
if all the negatives i mentioned seemed negligible to you perhaps you should give it a tryreally
this game is dead
go buy world of warcraft or eq
even with the latest expansion pack the game isnt that fun and doesnt offer a lot of innovationlet me start by saying i love ford and have owned a ford ever since i could drive  yrs ago
so i thought this game would be perfect for me however i was terribly wrong
i love the cars but the game itself is very boring
some of the challenges will just aggravate you
others are too easy
the dirt tracks with the fx were fun thoughgraphics  comparable to a ps gamecontrol  not very responsivemusic  could have been betterchoice of cars  excellentfun factor  not thereoverall  if you are a ford fan buy it just to add it to your collection of ford memorabilia especially since you can get it cheap
the dirt tracks are fun but it just lacks the sense of speed you would expect when playing a game of this naturei was an intellivision junkie until i was about  years old
i cant even begin to remember all of the titles i once owned
needless to say i was excited to see that  games have been grouped together for use on the ps
unfortunately the transition for intv to ps was far from smoothcons the controls are horrible
most of my favorite games tower of doom utopia and etc are unplayable
who in the world did the qc on this product
wasnt it pretty obvious that in order to play any of the games you must first be able to control the characters it was next to impossible for me to even get the game to play
blue disc or not this is completely unacceptable
once again a decent qc department would never have allowed this product to be shipped a minor complaint is that some of the better games are missing
however compared to problems     this is pretty minor stuffpros it is nice having the games in one collection
not because the games are playable but more because it is like watching an old familar moviehere is the games list since i couldnt find it anywhere else
like others i found a good portion of them unplayable thanks to the control interfacearmor battleastrosmashauto racingb bombingbackgammonbaseballbasketballbattle tanksbiplanesbody slam super pro wrestlingbomb squadbowlingboxingbrickoutbuzz bomberscheckerschip shot super pro golfcrosswordsdeep pockets pool  billiardsdemo cartridgefactor funfootballfrog boggolfhard hathockeyhorseracinghover forcehypnotic lightslas vegas poker  blackjacklas vegas roulettemagic carouselmath mastermemory funmotocrossmountain madness super pro skiingnight stalkerpinballracing carsreversiroyal dealersea battleshark

largly in part to the fact that the intellivision had a very uniqe controller thus rendering this game mostly unplayable
buy this game only if you are a die hard collector
they really should have included a packaged controller so what if the game would have cost more at least you would be able to play iti bought this game because of the picture on the box  well forget about seeing that feature in the game
you get a rather primitively animated character
so hows the gameplay
not too great
youll spend a lot of time standing around waiting for stuff to happen
waitand wait and wait and waitfor some guy to walk down a hallway so you can sneak behind him
wait for some guy to show up so you can shoot him
wait for a camera to sweep in the other direction so you can sneak around it
the controls of the game dont lend themselves to any sort of exciting battles either
if you want to keep your weapon drawn you can only move slowly
you get a little red dot to designate what youre aiming at  its pretty hard to see
youll stand there getting shot as you try to locate where your little red dot istwo other really bad things about this game is that it constantly leaves you wandering around with no idea where youre supposed to go or what youre supposed to do
also youll quite often fail the mission and have no idea what you did wrong
just try something a little bit different next time
and try again
and again
then consult a walkthrough on the internetthe second time i played through it i got to one point in the game where there was supposed to be a cutscene which would then lead to the next part of the mission
but the cutscene never played
i did everything i was supposed to do but the game just seemed stuck there
anyhow its not nearly fun enough to make me really want to figure out what was wrong so i just went on to a different gameoverall id recommend skipping this one
its just not much fun at allget this one only if you either love stealthbased play and need a break from splinter cellmetal gear or are looking for a discount item
movement control is clunky especially since you have to use the the look command in specific very specific onscreen hotspots to perform anything but the most basic of actions
has some serious glitch issues as well eg i died during a boss fight yet the cinematic showing the boss death played and i went to the next level
and for some reason the only way to walk quietly is crouched down
hunhthe story is silly
omega  a fatty acid
killed your family and now theyre going to blow up the world
or some other runofthemill badnik stuff
i didnt care and you probably wont either
the journeyman voice cast mostly gets the job done though the lead actress is both lousy and miscast
one of the villains died twice in the script toothe big beef with this puppy is the challenge
not the actual gameplay thats standard sneaky stuff
some of the solutions just dont make a lot of sense
for example a puzzle makes you avoid setting off a heat sensor by running into a freezer for a few seconds first apparently lowering your body temperature
not only would this not work to drop her body temp at all shed have to just about freeze to death its not even explained whats happening when youre in the freezerelsewhere you have to bug a room that has a character in it
problem is you dont know at this point what she lookssounds like
when you walk down a corridor a short audio clip of someone speaking plays once though on some playthroughs it fails to play at all
you then have to crawl through the ventilation system avoiding the cliche police and set the bug though you cant even see the people youre listening in on when you do
if the audio clip didnt load youll have no idea what it is youre even doingif you get stuck and with all the nonsense in this title you will you have to run from room to room using that frustrating look command to find the miniscule hotspots then guess what the games screwedup logic wants you to do
and the levels are surprisingly linear for a game like this
some of the guards just stand there and stare at each other too
no talking just staring making it so you have no chance to take em out silently
who does that
you cant even distract themi gave it two stars because some of the puzzles actually are kind of fun and the stealth once you get used to the clunk factor is handled tolerably well
its definitely on the southside of average but theres worse out there
its worth a couple of bucksthis game is tough
you have to sneak around steathily because if you get caught it is impossible
the plot is terrible and the voices are as bad as castlevania
its dumb that the gaurds like cant see you in the dark if you are crouching down and right behind them stealing something from his pocket
good level design
graphics arent really jaw droping
not very funever used an xbox controller
well just think of the gamecube controller as the exact opposite
the xbox controller is enormous and has a very clunky feel and its difficult to use if you have small hands
the gamecube controller however is very easy to use and it molds into your hands no matter how big your hands are
the thumbsticks are both quite comfortable making it a controller that you can use with minimal strainso whats wrong with the gamecube controller
it is simply too simple get it
with only  buttons not including start the gamecube controller just isnt suited for games such as sports and action games that need a lot more than  buttons
while playing true crime streets of la i found myself having to press multiple buttons at the same time and sometimes i wished i had three hands because it was quite the inconvenience
and with the awkward button layout its hard to press two or more buttons at once unless your thumbs bend in very unusual ways
also ive noticed the durability of this controller is lacking the l and r buttons start acting funny after a while
lastly the cord is just too freakin shorttoo bad its the only controller nintendo offers besides the pricey wireless wavebird because this controller at times just wont do
at least microsoft released a smaller xbox controller  nintendo should release a better gamecube controllerfirst off be careful where you get your used controller from
i got mine from finest play and from what i can tell these controllers were all rebuilt fron parts of other controllers that were broken in one form or another
i got one controller that has the orange spice plug at the end instead of the silver plug and the other one had a black plug from the black controller
they are fine functionally but they were in worse condition than avertised
used very good means that all parts on the contoller match and that they are free from major cosmetic damage
thankfully i am good with the soldering iron and i got my controllers cord swapped for the spice cord and housing swapped for the one with the black end
also while i was at it i cleaned all of the grime off of the controllers when i had them dissassembledi just bought this controller about  days ago brand new and the thumb stick stop working on it i can only use left and right this controller also is not a real brand nintendo controller buyers beware of after market brandsthe gamecube has been out for two years and now we finally have a pokemon game for it
unfortunately this might not really be a game
lets start with some details and what this game does right first
apparently prof oak has been hard at work on a television network for pokemon does the man have a life
now youve been chosen to test this network and see if its any good
right when the television is delivered guess who suddenly breaks into your house
if you said pikachu youre unfortunately correct more on that later
so now you and pikachu who is apparently allowed to break the law are now tasked to watch this network and see how it works
each channel has different pokemon themed shows such as pnf pokemon news flash shop n squirtle pichu bros party panic anime and slowpokes weather report
there are more but theyre neither interesting nor fun to watch
lets start with the good
the graphics are okay not heavily detailed but they get the job done with the exception of some of the pokemon models looking like they came from the n games
you can occasionally go outside and see different pokemon which is pretty cool
the shopping channel even sells bus passes which can take you to different areas to see different pokemon
now the bad and there are more of these than the good
if you hate pikachu this will increase your hatred ten fold at least
he always wants to watch tv
it usually takes an act of congress to get him to go outside and see the different pokemon which is arguably the best part of this game
now some of the shows are okay but noo he wants to watch all of them including crap like smoochum exercising for five minutes
its like babysitting some annoying child
after a few days of this you will try to get him run over by the bus sadly you cannot
now my biggest gripe lack of interactivity to the point you question whether you have a dvd or a game
everything here has you watching
sure you get to click on things but after that you only get to see what pikachu does with them which if you dont like him anyway you wont want to see him roll around with a ball for example
as an interesting side note and this is neither good nor bad this game runs on real time like animal crossing
so if youre gamecubes clock is set correctly and you turn this on at three pm it will be the same in the game
at first this intrigued me but it soon became clear that this feature is very limited here
for example there are no exact time specific events such as quotcharmander only comes out from three to four in the afternoonquot
instead it seems as though things are divided into three time sections each day playing before noon playing from noon to seven pm and playing from seven pm to seven am when the first section starts again
while simplistic it does keep the game from ending too quickly unless you mess with the clock
each day when you save it unlocks things that when turned on in the proper time section the next day you can access
as stated before it isnt complex in the least but it does serve to stretch out what would be an otherwise short game
i know youre thinking im being too harsh on a game thats geared towards children right
well its because i know that tons of older pokemon fans will pick this up and be disappointed
i almost did but thankfully i rented it first
even at thirty dollars its too much for what an older person would get out of it
however if youre a parent looking for good game for your pokemonloving child this is actually a good choice
i could see a child enjoying it
anyone over ten would be wise to wait until this can be picked up for at most half the price i know im going toi know this game is older than many published  years ago and i bought it cheap
i am glad i did
i admit reviewing a game that is this old may not be fair but it should have a bit more staying powerin short i found the third person camera annoying the angles were distracting and keyboard navigation was variable
how can you fight something when the camera view is from behind your head
it is really incomprehensible who would have thought that anything but a quick switch to first person in a fight mode would be the only way to present these scenes
i am new to silent hill but this one makes me not want to try any others
there are newer games than thiswith better graphics and better implementation
if silent hill  comes around for pc i would hope that it would be updated with first person perspectivesokay well i got this game after buying part  and not being able to play it due to the awful graphics
it really wouldnt work on my new pc
well first thing i noticed was the graphics were much better
well then after a cut scene i had to use the move buttons
thats what the grrr is for i played for like  minutes and the camera angle is awful
the movements are annoying to the point i just said forget it
i am wondering about  i have spent money on part  and  and havent liked either one i dont think i am wasting any more money on these games
i dont know who sat down and said this is a good way to use the cameras in this game
no doubt they were tripping or something
really i would not suggest buying this unless youre in a really good mood and want to be put into a bad one
by the way the stupid monsters look so silly
they are not scary unless maybe your  well probably not even then
you cant really see any kind of details in them cause their isnt any
the whole blood thing people keep talking about just look like discolored walls
i buy and play a lot of games
some are really great half life deus ex fear but this was just awful
i know i said that already
pouting i want my  bucks backi bought this game hoping it was something along the lines of the gta series
it isnt really
it is very linear which might be somewhat forgiveable but its also very hard
in gta if you failed a difficult mission you could just move on unless you attracted a big police presence
fail here you start over from the beginning of the mission
i suspect the game might be a bit easier if the controls werent so bad
ive tried modifing them to be more like gta controls but it just cant quite be made to workgreat graphics great sound great music that is it
game play sucks so far
driving around is almost impossible to control
you can barely aim at anything
the second mission will drive you insane after awhile
they made the game too difficult
i think i will skip all atari games after this i had such a bad experience
i love the sound and the graphics but the handling of the game will not let me enjoy it
i dont like repeating myself over and over again through the course of several days
it is definately not for the novice of for people with little patience
the only reason i got the game because according to the advertisement this is the series that inspired grand theft auto
please i beg of you do not get it because of that
two totally different type of companies and two totally different type of playing experiencedrivr gets  stars simply because its beautiful to look at the cops will chase you for breaking the law and the cars sound so sweeeeeetunfortunately thats about all that is goodthe driving aspect isnt so bad either but its not as great as it looks on the comercials
the cars handle well and take more realistic damage but that cant make up for atrocious gameplay with a captial atrocious
it was so bad that i only played it for an hour even though it was a  rental
quickly heres a rundown of the biggest problemsthat i saw remember i only played through about  missions incar camera view was either st person or behind the car but not high enough to really see over it
i kept wishing i were somehow taller so i could see over the top of the flashing sirens
grand theft auto this isnt
tanner your main character moves ackwardly and shoots even worse
even with auto aim i felt like my reflexes were slooooow
max payne this isnt
way too linear
you have little to no real decision making ability
its a quotone way inquot and quotone way outquot kind of game
splinter cell this isnt either
finally the quottake a drivequot function for the nonlinear gurus is boring
theres nothing to do thats the least bit creative
again grand theft auto this isntbottom line they should have kept this as a stictly driving game because its clear that they dont know what theyre doing yet when they have to make the character get out of the carif youre still interested in checking this game out rent it before you buyyoull be glad like me that you did
sorry atari but i have better things to do with my time and moneyps apparently there is an extensive replay function but i didnt bother with that
i hear its the same as grand turismos
still not enough to make up for incredibly disappointing gameplayill keep it short because i dont think this games warrants any more of my time
what a piece of junk
the controls stink and the graphics are terrible
i cant believe this is a ps game
thankfully i rented itand returned it early
blockbuster video should be ashamed of having this garbage on their shelves but they were probably mislead from the great commercials they saw on this product as welli personally ensure i bash no one lives forever every time i write a review since that game really set the bar for crapness but this one runs a close second
save your gas money stay away from driverlike enter the matrix last year drivr is buggy and clearly unfinished
the mess isnt as extensive as it was with neos nightmare  tanners latest adventures as an undercover cop arent quite that treacherously crashprone  but poorly tuned gameplay and controls sink what should have been a rousing ride from one of grand theft autos primary forefathers
bugs and technical issues first
we tested three boxed copies of drivr on three different consoles and a clear pattern of glitches emerged
the most common issue the game often freezes for between three and ten seconds then usually resumes without harm
sometimes however it locks up permanently requiring a reboot
also collisiondetection mishaps are widespread  everything from tanner to his vehicle sometimes passes through walls or gets stuck in walls in a way that significantly interferes with gameplay
framerate sluggishness and popup issues are also prevalent
surprisingly the popup doesnt involve the environment  in fact your line of sight is impressively long  but cars and other traffic often teleport into existence a short distance down the road adding unfairly to the challenge of highspeed driving
as far as the actual gameplay drivr is like a car badly in need of a tuneup
like the first two games you play as an undercover cop infiltrating cartheft gangs by posing as a driver
reflections created three sprawling cities and added new elements like speedboats and shooterstyle gameplay on foot but at its core the game still revolves around highspeed pursuits
the best part of the action is how the cars handle on the bleeding edge of losing control
as in past reflections games stuntman and other entries in the driver series making the smallest mistake can be lethal particularly because excessively bouncy physics and insanely invulnerable obstacles like lamp posts
can send your vehicle cartwheeling into absurd wipeouts
completing missions becomes a test of your stubbornness and endurance and most players wont be able to stomach the process of incessantly repeating a mission until they succeed
the new onfoot gameplay also just flatout sucks and it figures far too heavily into the action
aiming your weapon is an aggravating chore the enemy ai
is horribly lame and theres just not a scrap of fun to be had
visually drivr looks outdated
unsurprisingly the xbox version is substantially prettier featuring richer lighting and smoother details that outshine the more pixelated ps game
the games star power voice acting by michael madsen ving rhames and more and an impressive soundtrack make for a surprisingly good showing on the audio side
all these glitches and design problems dont make drivr unplayable and the problems arent as deep or as devastating as they were in enter the matrix another muchhyped atari disappointment
but they do make the game an intensely frustrating trial of patience thats rewarded with only the most fleeting glimmers of fun
if you love the driver series with an unswerving loyalty youll be able to slog through drivr and extract your thrills
but if youre looking for something to tide you over until gta san andreas is released later this fall youd better execute a  spin floor it and flee in the opposite directiondriver  for the xbox is a third person action game where you play a cop out to chase down and kill crime syndicates
the game is similar to grand theft auto in concept but not at all in execution
you can walk or run around on foot missions and explore the cityscape or you can cruise around with a vehicle of your choice
you can play the single player story mode if you want to see the story or you can play freemode where you can roam around doing whatever you want
i did enjoy the fact that your character can swim in water i also liked some of the map level designs
you can get on a highway and gas it or go through narrow alleways you can also enter many of the buildings
some of the weapons are fun to use although the aiming system is very clumsy
the overall feel of the game is very unplolished
there are tons of glitches with the sound effects music graphics and collision detection
driver  was rushed and needed more beta testing before being released to the public as a finished product
just to give you an example of some of the bugs my game characters body got stuck into invisible objects or his body went through like a ghost into a car the ingame music stops or starts sparadically ditto with the sound effects headshots are not always fatal the police and enemy ai
is very stupid but cheats to compensate its stupidity the game graphics are grainy and crappy the framerate is low and there is no sense of real speed when driving vehicles
this game tried to be like grand theft auto but failed miserably
why get a cheap clone of gta when you can get the real thing for a good priceprosfreeform gameplaylarge city mapslots of vehiclesyour character can swimgo inside buildingspilot boatsconstons of glitchesstupid aiterrible graphicsslow vehiclesmusic cuts off abruptlysound effects cuts off abruptlybad controlsweek sound effectsterrible camera systemboring missionsgta wannabeterrible collision detectionnot very fundriver  is plagued by horrible controls interactivity and sub par graphics
first of all you accelerate with trigger which hurts your finger after awhile the sensitivity is low controls are inverted
your characters movements also seem unreal
graphics couldve been alot better
gameplay is average
i know its a large game but what ive seen with other titles drivrs just plain sucks
alot of ideas were adopted from gta also
gta  is so much better than this
it seems like atari rushed this title towards the endthis game has excellent graphics and physics but that doesnt make it any more fun to play the first  seconds of a level  times because if you miss one turn or clip a tree and have to start over
even missions that should be easy like following a police car to a crime scene are easily blown by one mistake
ive only played this game to level three and im already setting it asidethis game is just a major headachecan anyone say stuntman
oh my gosh this game hides so well
it has this beautiful outside appearancethe graphics are amazing the voice acting is decent and played quotreal namequot actors like ving rhames
the plot is pretty hardcore and what they say you will get to do sounds awesome
the problem
everything else
once you get past the superficiality of the above topics the game sucks
the cars are fun to handle when it goes your way but more often than not the tendency to slide becomes ridiculous
a slight turn could put you facing the other directionwhich is even worse by the fact that most missions are either timed or require you to keep up with an enemy
the car damage is nice and detailedbut who cares when i said turn left and i did a  and got wedged between an invisible wall stupid game engine and a polethe plot and cutscenes are awesome but the missions that go with them are so bland
sad attempts at copying gta thats what i think
you never feel like you get a breaka chance to go browse the city for shortcuts and health
it is into one timed mission to start another
of course it will actually take you as the player much longerbecause just like in stuntman you either perform the mission perfectly their way or you will start the mission over
and it is an extremely annoying start over with the inability to skip any videosthe repeitition and sheer aggravation with sitting through it gave me a headache before i finished my first missionthis game is a sad sad sad sequel to an otherwise great and groundbreaking series
the shootingon foot parts can sometimes be funand your character looks greatbut it isnt worth it
the engine is just sad
your character doesnt really feel there and he walks sideways easier than straight
i like shooting better than in gta  but the enemies firepower always drains my health too fast and spoils the funalso anytime you are given a mission pay close attention because they tell you exactly how it has to be done and you cant try to figure out what they said later
often i couldnt hear what the guy told me no subtitles for this part of the game and i never could figure out what i was supposed to doi rented this game and had this much trouble with it i wish i would have saved my money
this game is too hard too repetitive and no you have no sweet victory cuz youre so mad it took so stinking long and so many stupid random things happened along the way and too much of too many bad things to be worth even rentingit is also more mature from what i seen in the first  minutes of quotplot lengthquot  hours of actual repetitive play than any of the other games like gta that are out there
flush with detailed cutscenes of murder shootouts etcsave your moneyall this game is a rip off of grand theft auto vice city and not a very good one at thatrent thisdo not buy itthe graphics of out break were with out doubt quite possibly the best ps has ever seen
but you cant change camera angles you cant move quickly all in all the game sucks
its like watching a bad movie
i loved the resident evil games
but this one seems like they spent way too much time beefing it up and for got that keeping it simple is always bestsorry  starsi did not like this game compared to the others for seeral reasons  reoccuring enemies every time you go in a room kill all the enemies leave turn around and come back there they pop up again exactly how they did the first time and guess what you have to kill them all again while your ammo is rapidly depleting which gets to my second reason for not enoying the game
 you would figure in a game with a reoccuring enemies they would have plenty of ammo wrong
and thats not even the worst part
most of the ammo you get is a diffent caliber than the one to the gun your using so you cant use it until you either find that gun or one of your pals who has it
just imagine dealing with this kinda crap when zombies keep coming at you and you cant go back in the previous room without dealing with the same ones all over again
 same oldstyle outdated movements of characters as the very st resident evil which is almost  years old
overall just a frustrating game especially for single play
resident evil  rocks thoughthought re had beaten this stage to death
one more time ordains capcom
raccoon city has been taken over by zombies
sadly there is no real story to this game other than that
you spend most of your time roaming through frozen or burning halls looking to solve puzzles that one at least from the hive scenario are more frustrating than fun while constantly being chased by a blood sucking leech man
no i didnt make that upmultiplayer is great on the first level youre pretty much being chased down by a pack of zombies while being able to protect and guide others over broadband connections and it makes for an exciting rush having seen the introduction fmv explaining the situation of the scenario
the other scenarios
lets just say they involve incidences that the viewer is completely unaware of at least this one thus resulting in utter confusion and disinterestone point that id like to make about outbreak is that it becomes rather vain
each scnario you start out somewhere something is happening theres no explanations except for the first scenario and perhaps the last i havent bothered yet therefore there is no drama
only confusion
it becomes disparaging to wonder constantly why do our main characters keep plunging themselves into these horrible places with no way out
for instance in the hive scenario how do they get into a hospital that is locked down tight
how is the only way out through the sewer
if theres no way out from your starting position how did they get into this mess with mr
leech
on a side note mr leech man attacks a doctor
later the same doctor appears on the floor after leech man has been freed of his little assailants proving to be the leech man all along
so there are two dead bodies of an identical man
makes sense so far
good
alas nearly all the scenarios aside the first start out in a similar manner
how lazy of the designersdevelopers
in short there is no story
there are just many aimless incidences that add up to zerothe best things going for this game has to be the crisp graphics multiplayer function and unlockable collections you earn with points having completed scenarios
its only a shame you cant beat scenarios on multiplayer first
you must complete them on single player before you are allowed to play them onlinewow
an online game you must beat offline to play online
brilliantthe absolute worst thing about this game is the loading periods and incessant voice commands of the ai
while in single player mode trying to solve the usually lame puzzles the designers have conveniently laid down to make you want to punch the characters in the face with all their prattle
nothing is more frustrating than constantly being reminded of how lame you are by the snotnosed reporter or listening to the wallowing of a train employee
my life is st isnt this a mature rated game
whats with the childlike comic reliefraccoon city should have ended with re
it was a good last escape from this wretched place that i can say i am finally tired of seeing and hearing about in the re seriesan online resident evil game
sounds great
however slow load times and a lack of keyboard or voice support really bring it down
while this had the chance to be a stellar game its basically just something for the more hardcore resident evil fans rather than just someone with a passing interest in the series
granted the load times can be improved if you have the game installed on your ps hdd but not many people have them seeing as only three games out of all the ps games ever released in america use them and the new redesigned ps doesnt even have a slot for the hdd to fit in
so if youre a resident evil fan and have the network adaptor for your ps you should check the game out
and if thats you you probably already have the game anyway if not you could probably pass this one up
nnycw for capcityi played this game for maybe  minutes before asking myself whats the point
the game is non responsive un logical and completely boring
i will say though the graphics are amazing and the opening cutscene is maybe my favorite cutscene of all timeanyways im trading this in for a ps copy of re today and i expect most people will want to do the sameif you are like me you might hold a slight level of skeptism when you hear that a famous video game franchise is going to turn the tables by going online
so i held my breath and wondered when i read up on previews i was pretty impressed with the way it sounded on paper
the thought of a survival horror game with multiple players struggling for survival against ghastly monsters just was so tempting and really alluring
but when you get down to it when capcom finally conceived the game and just the simple tidbit that creator shinji mikami was going to have no input at all
the game pretty much shows itself as a turn into the wrong direction terrible programming tactics and horrid implemenation the concepts drawn outonline diagnosisi havent played a whole lot online actually my online time clocked in at about three hours
so maybe just maybe my critique isnt going to be  foolproof
but im sure i can at least give a proper judgement call on what i experienced online
for one we all know sony has no headset where online communication is posssible at all
bummer really because this makes me favor xbox live all the more
so without having a formal way of communicating there essentially becomes  players on the screen who may or may not know what to do
its really frustrating to have your teammates leave you when you needed some assistance or for them to go on ahead and there is no method to tell your team membersoffline diagnosisok so we got the singleplayer mode for anyone who lacks a friend or two
or maybe youre just unsure rather the online experience of sony is really worth the time and day
well as for as playing alone goes  it is beneficial
the scenarios you unlock here which total to five can only be played online when you have completed them
problem is the ai
is just as bad if not worse then when you are teamed up with your online counterparts
if you need a character to hold a key for you which by the way could be very crucial later on its saddening to see them drop it and replace it with it a pipe
and there is a set of commands much like freedom fighters and rainbow six
they are limited though to worsen it there is a lack of a graphical display where you can select the appropriate commands
so it all falls on the analog stick and how you move it  to me it felt they were more random then set
so i wanted my fellow comrades to follow me up the ladder instead they go off and fight the zombies taking one for the team
speaking of which offline character interaction is relevant
the moods of your team depend solely on how you interact with them the more you assist them in need theyll return the favor and save you when you need it
their behaviors vary so it might take longer to befriend some characters more than othersdated control schemewhat in the world went on in the minds of capcom didnt they know better then to configure the controls much like the past resident evils and i mean really the past ones
moving the characters around still feels like you are attempting to move the hand of a grandfather clock
the game itself is d but in a pseudo kind of fashion so in actuality youre playing this game more like it is set on prerendered backgrounds
and worse yet what bogs both variations of the game down is the loading
really i havent see these kinds of loading times since the dawn of the bit era
take into consideration if you must back track which is much of a integral component of resident evil as the zombies are and you can pretty much spell out not fun it hurts the scare factor too really if you are being hunted down by a hunter at dead way than you must pursue into the next room for cover too see the ugly load screens popup diminishes the fear leveli wouldnt totally dismiss this titlewhen it comes right down to it re outbreak could have been the best thing to hit the video game biz since slice cheese ormaybe legend of zelda rings a better tune
but the overall results are certainly subpar long loading times exceedingly bad artificial intelligence both with actual humans and computerized entities
toss in a ridiculous save system that only allows one save slot and is temporary
all these wrongs where is the light at the end of the tunnel 
well for starters the visuals are nicely done they pretty much show off the pss hardware
nice character models detailed shots of raccoon city and sweet animation are all abound
there also is some neat ideas like if you cannot face off against the hordes of demons due to a lack of weaponary you can exchange it all for setting up some shelter
take for example knocking down a fence and tightening it with staples thanks to a special tool
there are some really bright ideas a mist sadly the game developers didnt pull the punches enough on their debugging and quality control staff
simply put it if you love resident evil that much invest in the addon hard drive and dont mind silent companions to venture with online
by all means i suggest it but other than that if you share the same feelings as i a rental is otherwise considered
it will save you a lot of money believe mei bought this game after reading the comments of the other versions of resident evil the first level in the bar and in the buildings its easy but when you arrive to the below zero level its difficult to find out what to do
the movement of the characters is slow clumsy the ai
its a joke bad comments and the loading process from room to room takes a lot of time
good graphics for a bad game
whythis game has very good graphics and ok controls but overall a very tedious game
you can carry only very limited amount of items
the saving system is very weird nutjobs must have thought of this saving system
you also need to complete the level or scenario within the time limit
if you die you have to start from the very beginning
not fun at all
by the way this is not a scary game just annoyingsurvival horrormore like survival frustrationcapcoms latest offering in their oncemighty biohazard series sees us the players forced to take command of one of a host of forgetable dull characters in the sameesque city and sewer scenarios and once again avoid the moans and groans of unconvincingly animated and blatantly unscary zombies though to be fair most of them sound like the elderly infirm while the tvirus outbreak ravages racoon citysound familiarwell it is
bar a very frustrating online mode with no voice recognition control hateful npc interaction and a connection mode less stable than ms sally field in sybil outbreak is basically a clone of a clone of a game concept from which  years later hasnt aged at all wellgraphics in a word dull
surprising considering capcoms prowess in the onimusha and devil may cry series of games as well as the recent graphical delights of survival horror brethern silent hill  and project zero  its a worry and a shame that outbreak is restricted to a seeming colour palette of  browns with the odd streak of red thrown in
animation is average renders are very humdrum and the menu screens mystifying and very difficult to read
which since you need to be able to operate them quickly decisions are made in realtime folks
 is hugely prohibitive to decent gameplay flowplayability not really
npcs have been a feature of survival horror since s silent hill  but never before and hopefully never again will they be so unresponsive and weak
frustrating silly deaths occur left right and centre and see how many new swear words you can invent while watching an npc die as your gun reloads
painfully slowly might i addfear factor none whatsoever
that hot tension at the base of your skull aint fear
its rage
at capcom
the pounding of your heart isnt from terror
its annoyance at the sameold sameold creature design and unfair difficulty levels
in two words not scary
survival infuriation could be a better genre in which to group this sorry little gameif capcom is to sell resident evil titles on the playstation  they need to concentrate on originality and playability two crucial key points which outbreak unfortunately lacks in spadessteer clear
and get something else anything else instead
a very very disappointing showing for a franchise that was once so reverednot much to say here its like analyzing a football game when the score is  to  the game has terrible controlsworse than before laughable load times and its boring
its not scary at all im serious
it also has no definate characters to really build a story on
it just doesnt have that tense feeling of serious resident evils past
even if youre a fan and just think anything with zombies is cool you will change youre mind
re has always been about cool
this games characters and  their constantly cheesy out of place lines get very annoying
imagine a person climbing a latter and then in the midde of the act just screaming out quot i dont know what to doquot even as they keep climbing
if youre like me you expected much more from this one
just wait till re it better be beyond goodrisking a dollar for this at the local library sale i can safely say i got my moneys worthvery shortly into it i decided the game made little sense in its layout and clues
ive read that this was originally written in another language and had to be translated
perhaps this is why there are several odd turns of phrases
ex a thigh or arm bone when heated is labelled hardened craniumdoesnt make up for the rest of the game thoughi finally gave up and out of pure curiosity set the laptop next to the computer and followed a walkthrough step by step
tedious is the word
running back and forthone field was  clicks and even with arianne at a loping run it still took forever
right now i dont know if i will even finish it maybe if im absolutely bored out of my hardened craniumgood graphics makes me overlook lesser problems but the graphics in this was not good enough
the sky was pretty much blank and while there where a few nice shots the scenery was not special at all
too there was little movement of secondary characters trees etc
what did move tended to be very repetitivegameplay was frustrating
some hotspots were very very small which forced you to spend too much time trying to find the exact point
on several instances a necessary hotspot would not appear until you finished other actionsclues when existent made little sense
perhaps it was that translation thing again but i dont think so
just a poorly planned game
periodoverall im afraid i have to recommend you save your money time and wits
there are far too many better games out there to bother with journey not even for a bucki love adventure games
i love third person adventure games
they are the only ones i buy
this game promised so much and delivered so much  crap that is
the story is good the graphics are good the mood music is good
the acting is terrible
this i can forgive easilywhat i cannot forgive is having to reboot my computer which far exceeds the minimum requirements on average every  moves or so
no lie
every four movesi have disabled my antivirus software
i took off complex shadows from the options
nothing helpedhelpsthere was one time i got something from someone before i was to get it
alas and alack
i couldnt move forward
why because he was supposed to tell me something else and refused to tell me because he had already given me the thing
inconceivableshe stops she flips between scenes she freezes my computer
talk about a high maintenance woman
the glitches are regrettable and reduce the fun factor to a very generous  stars
amazon  call a sale and dump your stockthis game seemed hyped from the begining
and thats all it turned out to be
its not completely a bad game but its nothing that great reallygraphics wise shadow ops is a mixed bag
at times the textures seem clean and extremely lush others they muddy together
but the real problem is the frame rate which is just horrible at times
and loading is another headache along with some glitches that seem to be associated with disc accessloadingcontrol is actualy good when the frame rate keeps up with the action the guns all have scope capability
you cant pick up other enemys guns which really sucks actually
and ammo for your weapon can get very scare in a heated battle
and some missions are based on limited ammo and advise you to use strategy
basically make your enemy spend all their ammo then move in for the kill
you get alot of controller setup options so you can customize how you want the button schemesound is just amazing
probably the saving grace of this title you actually feel like youre in a movie
or in a real battlefield for that matter with ambience from enemys nature explosions echos from your teammates holloring out orders etcthe overall mission based theme of this game is just too a  b  at times the action has a more furious arcade flavor but then sometimes it takes on a more medal of honor type of gameplaywith so many fpses out there its getting hard to be original
shadow ops seems to be similar to fugitive hunter on the ps but just not as fun
better off to wait for doom  or area hmm what to say about this game
its pretty meh
it doesnt do anything well and does a number of things pretty badly
i would not suggest this game to anyone looking for a fps
the ai was horrible weapons were bland and boring to fire
they all sounded underpowered and pretty much are underpowered
the level design is pretty bad everything is scripted and feels like a shooting gallery
the teammate ai is horrible and doesnt help at all
in fact they get in the way most of the time
the graphics are horrible too
overall the game feels pretty old fashioned and more like it was made by a mod team then an actual developer
the only cool thing about it is the cut scenes that are actually pretty neat
i am surprised i bothered finishing this onelife line is the first game played entirely by speaking to the character via usb headsets
does that mean you dont need a controller to play
nopeyou need a controller to know what you can saythe graphics are pretty good
nothing flashy but quite good
pretty realistic backgrounds
objects are detailedthere is almost no sound going through the game
no music during walking around and some minimal music during a battle
the music is unimportantits good sometimes to have it quiet to hear what the main character rio is sayingthe voice recognition technology is the part were most interested in and at the same time is the worst part of the game
simply putthe recognition doesnt work
about  out of  times your voice will be heard incorrectly in the game
i said quotlook at the papers on the tablequot and the girl responds quotleave the room
okquot  now what i want to know is where did she hear me say the word quotroomquotthe game is a constant struggle
luckily your controller can help you say certain phrases by listing what she can understand
oh while talking you must hold down the circle button
quite lamenavigating through rooms is hard because of the constant misunderstandings
you say quotgo to room aquot  she understands it as quotgo to the lockerquot  you say quotgo to the lockerquot  she heard quotleave the roomquot  im not making this up peoplethis game has a serious flawif you think my review is false rent the game and find out
if you think you have the most clear voice and precise pronunciation ever try the game
youll be surprised by how much the character cant understand youthank god i only paid  for the game instead of the  msrp
thats the only good thing i can say about the gameim a fan of the show and i remember playing this when i was a kid though my memory on it was fuzzy
i decided just for kicks to pick it up again  it would serve as a reprieve from all of the dbz and naruto fighting games
after playing for about a half hour i remember why my memory was limited with this game i probably didnt play for long because it sucked
the game modes are limited the tutorial is a pain in the ass and confusing and the controls are god awful
the only redeeming quality is the ability to play as your favorite character and even that is bitter sweet with the controls
its a bit painful to see an awesome series get stuck with this crappy gamei thought nfl street was up to quality to the nba street series
i thought wrong
nfl street isnt funthe gameplay is like any other football game
its not complicated
however not many playbooks and strategies limit this game
this game isnt as great as the nfl blitz series for nintendo   nfl street has no late hits jumping on someone after hes down or any spectacularlooking moves
considering this is arcade football its a wastethe soundtrack is ok  some good beats
but you know what
you cant hear the soundtrack while youre playing
during menu selection its good music
when you play football the soundtrack is replaced by some boring uninspiring music
sometimes its nice to just stare at the menu screen because its the only time youll listen to the games soundtrackthe graphics are great
nothing special but makes the football look realisticonline mode has voicechat and is  players only
its actually decent
but the offline mode is the core of the game and that isnt goodi bought the game on the first day
however i do not want to look at the game ever again
seriouslythis is one of sonics worst games
surely it was the worst one on the nintendo gamecube
to say that it was disgraceful and glitchy is the serious understatement of the weekthe characters charms and voice acting was there but the soul wasnt
the levels were nice and huge as promised but there were many glitches and the story left so much to be desired
i think we loved this game for  weeks and then it hit us this game is seriously stupidcover art cinside art story dcharacters agraphics bsound bcontrols alength d starsoverall dthis is one of sonics worst games
surely it was the worst one on the nintendo gamecube
to say that it was disgraceful and glitchy is the serious understatement of the weekthe characters charms and voice acting was there but the soul wasnt

i think we loved this game for  weeks and then it hit us this game is seriously stupidcover art cinside art story dcharacters agraphics bsound bcontrols alength d starsoverall dive had this game since the day it came out
it was extremely hyped by sega and it was made to look like the absolute best sonic game ever
okay thats all find and dandyexcept when you see that it is not the best sonic game everstory well for the most part the story is pretty ridiculous
i wonder what they were thinking when they thought of eggman or metal sonic who whoever it was actually sending sonic a letter saying he would take action in  days
and as completely ridiculous as the story is it is simply not told very well
you pretty much have to read the plot off wikipedia or some sonic fan site to have any idea what is going on in this game
the sonic team is probably the only team that has anything to with the central storyline
the other teams are doing little side stories that the game couldve totally gone on without
in my eyes theyre only there to keep the game from being incredibly short
the ending by the way is totally ridiculous and its something id never really expect sonic or anyone with any sense would do
by the way if you think ive just said the word ridiculous too many times i have no excuse other than that ridiculous is pretty much the definition of anything that happens in this game storywisegameplay now we have a pretty dumb storyline but what about actually playing the game
it can be fun in some places
there are definitely certain levels that i just enjoy playing
but there are others that i just quit on and dont even bother with
playing as  characters at the same time was a good idea but when i actually experienced it i couldnt help but miss playing as one character only so i can get what i want without having to deal with the rest
its not a terrible system but i would really rather playing as sonictailsknuckles alone
maybe that way i wouldnt have to deal with all three of them spewing out idiotic oneliners over and over and over againthe pinball levels are the absolute worst things ive had to sit through in a sonic game
they were just frustrating boring and not fun at all
it was fun in sonic spinball and sonic adventure but here its just dreadfuloverall sonic heroes is inferior to almost every d sonic game released before
a ridiculous story which was terribly executed  other teams which i view as total wastes an alright team system terrible dialogue and a game that just makes me miss playing the adventure series or almost every other sonic game
the only things it improves on from previous d sonic games is the homing attack and the speed dashive played sonic adventure dxsonic adventure  battle and my favorite of all sonic mega collection and was definitely not disappointed by any of them but this game is a different storyi mean i can accept that sonic team want to try new things with the sonic characters but this game goes about it in all the wrong waysthe first  or  levels are pretty fun but after that it all becomes tedious and hardi love a challenging gamei mean ocarina of time is the best game ive ever played because of all the challenges but that was a role playing gamea platformer should be challenging but not frustratingit wrecks the whole experience but if youre really good at all sorts of games you might find that you like thisthats the only reason i gave it  stars instead of its just okthe game crashed on me when i hit the spacebar to skip the paradox interactive opening credit not a good sign
tried to find any patch information on the game on the paradox forum site all patch information leads to victoria  could not find one word on whether my victoria  needed a patch at all
plunging on ahead i spent  minutes happily telling various territories to build factories or expand production when victoria experienced an error and crashedi will be generous and give this game an extra star as i am uninstalling it before braving another crash
i have no idea if the crash was because i was running xp or because victoria  needed a patch that i couldnt find
a specific link to a gamespecific patch webpage would have been helpful
as a final insult the game requires a complete computer reboot after uninstalling
thanksjoint operations typhoon rising is what happens when you rush to put out a game in order to compete with other ww fps shooters
novalogic claimed this was the game to beat battlefield   wrong
the graphics are blocky the gameplay is choppy even with video settings at low resolution enemy ai
is average at best and almost all the time you get killed u never see where its coming from
the games original score pales in comparison to the music from bf and the multiplayer they promised to be as smooth as silk on a k modem is utter garbage
there are numerous patches available for download but you never notice the difference
i play on a p ghz with ht technologynvidia  mb geforce fx  ultrasound blaster audigy  zsmb ram mhz front side busthese are more than the required hardware for smooth play yet the game is a complete mess
i play battlefield  on the same machine and the graphics are great the music is fantastic and the expansion packs road to rome  secret weapons of ww are a great addition
please do not purchase thiseven when it gets to bargain bin
novalogic failed with this onewarning
if you can play battlefield  in highest resolution doesnt mean your video card can support this game
i have a geforce fx  ultra and played bf in highest resolution halflife  in highest resolution and setting but only can play fear in x resolution 
radiculus and unbelievable
why
dont ask me ask sierra
bebe be careful and check your video card before buying this gametry this as a test find some reviews of fear
that have screens
ignore the foregrounds that show flashy effects and character models and just look at the background environments
now go find screens of quake  doom  hl or just about any other newish shooter and compare their environments
shake your head in stunned disbelief about how everyone says this game has the best graphicsyoull be spending  percent of the game looking at those environment graphics which are dull dull dull
and im not some teenage kid who plays so many games that only the very latest graphics will do
just show me some stuff i dont see every day is all i ask
newsflash for monolith productionssome of us have jobs and have to look at corporate offices all day maybe sticking us in that same environment for  hours isnt the best choicea huge part of why i enjoy video games is for the escapism and sense of exploration
fear
just doesnt give a fig about any of this
the environments are so generic it affects the game playi constantly couldnt tell if id entered a new area because it all looked the same
that leads to a lot of wrong turns and backtracking through levels
playing quake  after this was like jumping  years aheadalso all the other criticsms here about the story are right on target
fear
tries to be kind of a shooter silent hillwhich would be great if it succeded at all in those terms please somebody make a good one
but the story is really an afterthought tacked on top of a game thats really just a series of firefights
if youre expecting supernatural monsters to play any appreciable role in this game youll be dissapointedyou should only buy this game if enemy ai is your first priority
and then only if you plan to play it on the hardest difficulty settings where the ai is most active
gamers looking for any sense of exporation escapism or storyline should look elswhere
i really wanted to like this game
shooters with supernatural themes are my favorite
but fear
ignores the biggest reasons of why i play video gameswow this game is overrated beyond belief
i cannot even comprehend in the slightest how a game like this got any popularity
i mean alright it has great graphics but it is a system hogprosgrahpics are excellent even at medium settings they were beautifulgood combat aresenal and i was glad there isnt a super weapon or a cheap weapon that makes the game too easy
halo  pistol cough cough lolconshuge system requirements
my computer is brand new and this game still maxed it outgame is freaky but they mostly use a disgting and over the top amount of violence and gore
i would not reccomend this game to someone under the age of  or game was way too easy even at the hardest difficulty
i found myself flying through levels at what ithought was an almost exaggerated pace
and this was without using the slowmo abilityonline play is not very good
its not very fun and it can be a nuisance at times just to play itstory line is weak and it feels like it ends without much explinationif you are really looking for a fps i would suggest battlefield  modern combat or maybe quake  if your looking for a mostly multiplayer gamessingle player wise go with call of duty there are pros and cons of this cardprosits stores a lot of memoryable to save many files at one timecompactaffordableconsgames that require  blocks will not be able to savesometimes crashesi tried saving with nhl  and it said it needed more memory
if you have a game that used  blocks get the gameshark x memory cardi dont know how this game is getting  stars
it is complicated in the way of icons and easy in the way of play
i actually sat back and let the game play itself let time run at an accelerated speed and i earned billions of dollarsyou can open and operate a grocery store but you have only  items to sell there and no marketing options no advertising no hiring and firing
its just a plain bore
i think that very little thought went into its creationi bought it because of the good reviews and the low price 
i am sorry i didi was prepared to give this game a great review just as the others here have
i spent countless hours building up a vast underground base gaining worldwide noteriety and getting some good research going
then super agent mako walks in and basically just ended the game
i had dealt with other agents but this character walked in as an invincible game entity
he fought and killed all but about  of my men and still had full health killed got his rd and final life my last remaining henchman and destroyed about  of my base before i hit the exit game button
strategy no longer applied days worth of game play building this empire was rewarded by having it all ended by some extremely poor game design
as a result i believe ill be freeing about  gigs of hard drive spacei am into firstperson shooters from the silly to the brutally real and this is somewhere in the middle
i like it as a change of pace from pure simulators like ghost recon advanced warfighter i and ii
this has an arcade feel to it although the graphics are decent enough
you get to operate a few different styles of weapons from various assault and sniper rifles to  cal
machine guns and mounted miniguns
the vehicle mounted ones can be particularly challenging as the aim is realistically affected by the bouncing and swaying
theres a nice variety of environments as wellthe one glaring problem though is the utterly idiotic ai of your fellow soldiers
these guys are supposed to represent highlytrained spec ops soldiers but in most cases they couldnt defend themselves from a little old lady with a cane
missions end in failure far too often because the morons with you got gunned down while you were busy trying to kill the other  of the enemies for them or the hostagesprisoners they were protecting were killed
there are times where you may pull out clumps of hair to keep from punching your monitorif you dont take it too seriously and like an interesting runngun every now and then this can be funjust grit your teeth when the inevitable mission failuretoo many friendlies lost rears its ugly headupdate  after coming back to this title a few times hoping for some simple shooting fun i have decided the ai just isnt worth the hassle
i am so sick of failing missions over and over because the socalled spec ops soldiers with me couldnt hit water if they fell out of a boat and cant protect a hostage while im out trying to eliminate the remaining  of the bad guys all by myself
frankly i just tossed the disc in the trash to avoid coming back to this nonsense in the future after the memories of the stupidity wear thin
ive played plenty of brutal highly realistic military shooters and i love them being realistically difficultbut this games difficulty is from sheer stupidity with the ai artificial lack of intelligence
im done with itvery good graphics and sound
the problem i had with this game was that there seemed to be a very specific route you were meant to take throughout the game down to every move or maneuver you made
if you strayed from the path the programmers determened was the quotcorrectquot one you would be killed
the end result is being killed over and over until you figure outwas i supposed to go left or right at this partshould i shoot this guy or pass by himdo i open the door to the right or the left
every decision seems to have a quotrightquot decision and it is tedious trialanderror figuring out what the programmers had in mind for each minute detailed decision you make
you get killed you try again over and over until you find the one quotcorrectquot path
very little if any freedom to move aroundthis game is an exercise in tedious repetition go through the same scenarios over and over and overuntil you stumble across the one solution
should entertain adolescents at besteditors note i reviewed the xbox  version virtually identical in content to both pc and ps versionsan extremely slow game that took me hours to make any headway
combat is automatic and restrictive in what actions i could perform based on a cooldown system that prevents players from doing anything beyond basic attacks more than once for certain amounts of real time so i couldnt steal anything from monsters more than once every five minutes
the games presentation can be a mixed bag with slowdown and graphics that are plenty plain by todays standards with only the music standing tall as being noticeably goodi personally found this to be an overall dull game
i did not sit well with the fact that a plodding experience like this is something one pays for especially not how it is on a monthtomonth basis
id rather do something more immediately gratifying or worthwhile like playing an actually fun game or reading
i sincerely hope final fantasy xiv this games onlineonly sequel lives up to its promise to deliver a faster more enjoyable experience and does better for itself and its community
we dont have all the time in the worldim not going to review the game final fantasy xi beyond saying that its a fine game if youre into that sort of thing but rather the hard drive itself
i figured that having a hard drive in my ps would make it as useful as the one in my xbox it doesnt
with the xbox all your game saves go straight to the hard drive rather than a memory card
given that a ps  mb memory card costs around  dollars and the  gb hard drive costs around  dollars you would need to buy  memory cards to have the same amount of space at a cost of  dollars
you can find more online capable games than you can find games that use the hard drive for game saves
so far final fantasy xi and socom ii appear to be only ones
yes you can copy games from a memory card to the drive but why should you have to bother
why not just make the newer games write directly to the hard drive
also sony had promised a sort of media center that would enable you to record and share media files but no such software has appeared
now that sony has redesigned the ps making slimmer it of course doent seat the hard drive
no big deal though sony doesnt support the hard drive anyway
buying this is like buying a turbo charger for your car that isnt connected to the engine
you can say you have it but it doesnt do you any goodlet me begin by saying that the camera is the most frustrating thing i have ever experienced
every time i wanted to do something i ended up looking up her skirt
the only gold in red ninja is the story
electronic gaming may have mocked it but i can actually see it becoming a movie
gameplay is a bit stiff and wall running is difficult to get started sometimes
right now i am in a level where i have no idea what to do
i may be forced to use a walkthrough with this game
i would suggest to you people to buy it when it when the price comes down to friends has this ever happened to you
youve just chased the thunder demon up a tree
after scaling numerous branches you find that you cannot quite strike the enemy
sure you can hit her but nothing seems to have an effect
finally after a mix of timing luck and some kind of design flaw your foe is vanquished
although you dont know whybefore i played this game i really didnt understand the phrases what were they smoking and i honestly couldnt care less
i thought i did but i didnt
because after you play red ninja you will ask the former which will ultimately lapse into the latterafter an introduction that is so overly dramatic it seems like it was written by a six year old as said by our heroine im not alive butim not dead
what is she a zombie
 the games begin
the story is actually not bad although it reeks of clint eastwoods hang em high
a female ninja intends to avenge her fathers death at the hands of enemy ninjas whom you never really seem to fight gamewise using a weapon forged from the very wire used to hang her
daddys death was all part of a greater scheme to get a super weapon the gattling gun
script wise however the game suffers
and lets face it the writers didnt want to make a video game
they wanted to make a small movie
where else can you get four count em four cutscenes in a rowbut getting back on the subject this ninja couldnt avenge a snail
even a small snail
she spends most of her time sneaking up on enemies and stealthfully killing them
sounds kind of familiar doesnt it
the controls also follow the same design as the tenchu series and some of the levels seems awfully similar to another game ive played limestone mines
abandoned temple with a giant buddha
however tenchus controls were always clear
red ninjas controls can be confusing hold b to crouch
also while tenchu gives your over half a dozen ways kill from behind red ninja gives you about three
one of them involves the ninja seducing enemies and gutting them but they usually get wise and flip out and kill her in the process of trying to get to know her better
youll see
and in tenchu you stealth killed for a reason to rack up points and to rack up your offense
here you stealth kill for the sake of spicing up the game sure you kill for points and to get ninja items youll never use but it feels hollow
its like a soulless tenchuthe other half of the time red ninja seems to be trying to take after the prince of persia
while the stealth killing controls are both simplistic and clumsy the acrobatics are the stuffs of nightmares
the controls are not nearly tight enough for the kind of punishment you are put through causing you to over or under shoot many goals
luckily your ninjalike reflexes usually allow you to recover
usually
also those same controls are backwards to drop from a ledge press a
 and the camera is nuts
it tries to follow you except its so hyperactive you usually just get a nice long look at the wall the ninjas underpants or a dizzying sickening swarm of images as the camera tries its very best to focus
and any game in which the controls and camera are that bad and expects you to perform doordie jumps and flips over bottomless chasms should not grade you on continues
or timeevery now and again you are swamped by mobs of enemies who all look mysteriously alike but hey the samurai factory must have been out that day and will fall back on a barrage of melee attacks
the coolest of these is flinging your wireweapon into an enemy using said wire to trip up other opponents then rip it out of your victim usually resulting in him being split in two
and the fighting controls are okay block is y
 and as long as there is enough space in the level for the camera not to go psycho on you the battles are fine
however also similar to the prince of persia your fightin is not always up to par
if knocked down it is very likely that enemies will pummel you the second you get back up resulting in a great loss of life on your partwhats really sad is that this is a good game trying to get out of a bad box
graphics music story its all good
but those flashes of niceness just cant compete witheverything else in the game
red ninjas problem was trying to be something it clearly wasnt
its like training a monkey to golf then giving him a crowbar and telling him to chop down a mighty oak
its just not going to happen
if theyd scrap a little stealth and acrobatics and pump up the fighting system there could be another game in the future
but if they dont the closeups we get of her underpants will begin to represent pain and anguish and nobody wants to see thatthis game was independently produced by two gentlemen
not to say this game is absolutely horrible but believe me its close to it
the story is vague the photos are average the music is ok the interface is horrible and the gameplay is confusing and boring to think that anyone could even begin to compare this to myst is a laughing joke
i urge you not to spend your money on a waste of a game like this
if youre into these kind of adventure games take a look at what the adventure company is currently making or other wellknown publishers
dont be mislead by the other reviews here that describe this game as something its not
trust me you will not have fun playing this game
adventure games are my favorite genre and i must say this ranks pretty low on my list
if you still have doubts about what i have just written check ign or gamespot for their reviews
as you will see the game gets something like  out of  if youre into essentially just clicking randomly in what seems that a powerpoint slideshow then go for it otherwise dont buy this pathetic excuse for a gamei was very excited with this game at first
i am a huge sims lover and i wanted something different for a while
i liked the game at first but soon realized the game was a big disappointmenti had to keep restarting the game because of bugs i know its the game and not my computer it was so repetitive the same thing over and over
maybe a  or  dollar game but not worth anything more than that
a somewhat smart person could finish this game in about  hours maybe less
so no i would not suggest buying it unless you find it here very cheapwell as most reviewers have mentioned this game was released with major bugs
if you plan to play this game you must install the game and then download the patch from the ubisoft website
even with the patch i had problems
the game crashed once for me  the game must save continuously and automatically because i didnt lose any data and could start again where the game crashed
i also had problems trying to click on items
if i wanted to select a line of dialogue i had to click numerous times
this got really tedious and annoying when i was trying to collect evidence
i kept clicking over and over again trying to pick up items with tweezers or gloves or trying to use dusting powders etc
i didnt know if it was the glitch in the system or it i actually didnt need to use that particular collection tool or any tool at all
also tools had a tendency to disappear from the bottom of the screen every once in a while
i think that covers most of the glitches i encounteredas far as the characters are concerned  the spoken dialogue is by the actors from the tv serious and the acting is pretty good
everyone sounded true to form including sarah sidles annoying habit of speaking her sentences as though she were asking a question
the computer renditions of warrick brown and nick stokes resemble their tv characters pretty well
katherine looks like someone else entirely
gil only resembles his tv persona because of his beard
sarah sidle resembled her tv character somewhat
what i found really disappointing and amateurish was the almost total lack of movement of any of the characters
their lips move slightly when they talk but there was no effort to make that movement even remotely resemble real life
their bodies resemble statues and they stare vacantly into spacethe graphics were pretty poor
it is difficult to find evidence when the graphics are somewhat blurry
after playing games such as syberia i and ii and being spoiled by their fantastic graphics its hard not to compare other games to that type of beauty and tedious detail
so it adds to the difficulty of examining evidence when it lacks detail and clarityregarding the storyline i thought that the vignettes in the first csi game were much more interesting that the ones in this game
they are as follows  you and katherine investigate a motorcycle stunt that has gone wrong  you and warrick brown investigate the death of a homeless man who had highend vodka and plate truffles in his stomach contents i thought this was the most interesting vignette  you and sarah investigate a construction site where bones have been unearthed by a backhoe  i think this was the one where a psychic is used to help solve the case so much for following the evidence and relying on the science
this was the silliest storyline  the motive for the death was a guy who scams people out of their life savings by getting them to sink their money into soap sculpturing a soap sculpturing getrichquickscheme in the st century  you and nick stokes investigate the death of an actress when a stunt involving a gun thats supposed to be firing blanks appears to kill the actress  and finally you and gil investigate the death of a komodo dragonwith the exception of the second story with warrick brown i found all the storylines to be boring
unlike the first game where the final vignette ties in the previous stories these stories remain separate
in fact even though the first csi game was too easy i found the storylines more interestingto sum it up i was really disappointed all around with this game
i think even hardcore fans of the tv show might be disappointedfinally the bonus materials that can be access if the player achieves a high enough score
i scored master level on all the games and was able to access  bonus extras for each level
their along the same line as the ones found in the first game  storyboards showing characters and locations
i didnt find any of these to be of any interest
the only interesting perks were interviews with the writer of the game who also is the arthur of the csi books and a real csi who is a consultant for the showfirst off i have to say that i got this game simply because i heard it was offensivethat being said i thought i would at least get a couple of laughs out of it but i did notthe jokes are for  year oldsthe game itself is very short and the whole thing feels very cheaply madethe only reason i gave this game  stars is because it has multiplayerthats itand even that gets old quicklythe game is about a man that works at a video game company and has to simply get through the week doing little chores like getting his paycheck and going to the store to get milk for his ladythese little things turn out to make the week a living hell as danger pops up at every turneven at churchthe game gets old very quickly and even the voice actors sound like they dont want to be therethe shock value is not that shocking and thats all this game has going for itavoid this oneif youve played games like socom  and  and loved them this game is not for you
if your looking for a first person shooter where you can just run into action and blow somebodys head off this games not for you
if your looking for a slowerpaced tactical millitary game this is for you
im one of the people that love the socomlike games
therefor  was a huge dissapointment
rent this game before you buy it
the game to me was not fun at all but there was great graphics
to me graphics do not make a game they may help it but im totally into gameplay and i cant play this game longer then an hour without falling asleepthe graphics atmosphere and overall look of this game is pretty good
the gameplay is lousy and has no replay potential
remember those old games like space invaders or pac man where once you figured out the sequence you could play forever
well fsw is a lot like that
there really is no skill or manual dexterity required and really not even many alternatives to how you accomplish the missions
you are not free to move everywhere on the map
you just get channeled down a certain route and then shoot who pops up
basically all you do is place your cursor on the enemy and tell your squad to shoot
it takes these guys one shot to hit someone  feet away up on a castle turret and around the next bend they use  rounds to hit a target hiding behind a hot dog stand
there really is no use of tactics you just try a different combination of shooting grenades smoke grenades and see which one the game is programmed to perceive as a successthe first thing to note about this game is that it is based on a training program used by the armyyou might think that means cool it will be ultra realistic
well its notas far as squad based tactics go it follows a simple guideline err in the name of safetywhat this means is that they took all the rambo out of the gamewhich is great for a training tool but doesnt translate too well to a console video gamebeing a training tool also means that it is highly repetetiveevery level is the same just a different backgroundso basically once you know the gist of the game you can beat it in a daythis game is a rental if anything it lacks replay value for the fact that it provides next to no challengeit doesnt allow for ingenuityits severly streamlined its sole pupose is to teach flanking and squad unityi spent five years in the usmc and had these same maneuvers drilled into my head
so consider this before you take my advicei may be jaded towards this gameit might be very easy to me because i am very familiar with the tacticsbut i dont think soi think everyone will find this game the samerentrentrentbefore you buythat was my screeming little girl voice you heard the other night after playing this game
i was excited to see a fight club game coming out
i wanted this to be at least an ok game
heres whats what
the story mode is too short
the make your own fighter is extreemly limited
control is a bit off
they put a nice dent in the movie making this
i hope chuck p the guy that wrote the book befor it was a movie urinates all over this in a public place for everyone to see
i dont know if he actually cares if this was a failure so i think ill take this to a public place and do my thing on it for him
read the book
watch the movie
skip the painful gameas a gamer and a fight club fan i was excited to hear a game was coming out and couldnt wait to see how well they would transcend the movie into the video game world
i had high hopes for it
as a book as well written and a movie as well done as fight club youd just expect it to be good
by the time i had enough money to rent it i had heard all the bad reviews for it
i decided to check it out anyway
and yes all the previous reviewers were right
the game is just not well done at all
i mean it had a few kind of fun moments while playing like breaking bones or bashing heads but after you play it for so long you realy feel like you are wasting your time
no lasting play value what so ever
none of the characters really look like the ones from the film not enough environments the moves are made for people who just press buttons and i really think they were doing us all a favor by making the story mode really short becuase it wasnt really a story mode at all
just dialogue and cg stills that led you to your next repetitive fight
did i mention fred durst sucks
id rather have icp
im glad i only rented it and i feel really bad for those who rushed out and spent the  bucks on itfirst id like to note that the first splinter cell was a very enjoyable game
this game has all the aspects of the first one when it comes to unique shading and excellent graphics however they didnt do anything new
it was like an addon pack at best
also for being such a large game nearly twice the size of the first one i would have expected it to be longer
the game is very short there are many levels with zero body count and the story doesnt really go anywhere
not to mention there wasnt any new weapons or special moves added
spoiler  whats worse is you dont even get to kill the two quotbossesquot theyre just spy missionsim on the second mission and im bored to death
it must be a training mission still but the gameplay is ultra linear
im not having any fun at all
i havent been allowed to use my gun at all yet
i had much more fun with the rainbow six series
ive played through at least  of those
this game feels like im just doing what the game tells me to dowell okay it is mortal kombat
they added a lot of features that a lot of people would find amusing konquest mode puzzle kombat
and chess kombat to name the main elements
these are some of my many problems the combos are seemingly impossible to me the konquest mode was just  to me  seemingly a quick little throwtogether to get this game out in stores
the onyl way to get characters is by playing konquest and i am dead stuck at the beggining  in training
 and no i am not a beginner to videogames even though i am only  in fact i found a glitch in a video game for my first time when i was  but getting back on topic the game isnt fun
the clunky controls dont suit for me at all but what i did like about this game was this the puzzle kombat and kinda the chess kombat
i just like sitting down to a game or two of one of those
i think i may be a little generous rating this game a  out of  but im not buying this game for you  im merely telling you what i think about itthis to me is not worth  the  or  dollars 
depending on if you buy the extra pack like me which includes the original mortal kombat  the money
its worth a rental
nothing more nothing lessim dissapointed in you sadly midway for these new generation mortal kombat gameshave fun
   with the chesspuzzle kombat  after playing mk shaolin monks i couldnt wait to start this adventure
but what i found was a lame mk remake and a stupid mode for konquestthe first thing i thought looked good was chess kombat if you know how to play chess you can play a game where once your piece tries to take another you go to a fight and take on the computer or player  in a mk style one on one match
lower your difficulty settings at first otherwise the cpu whips you in  seconds before you can blink get used to it first
i then played the arcade euhh its mk the default costumes look stupid and you have to unlock classic costumes
at least you can do thatso far those are ok but the konquest mode how can anyone say its good
ok i can understand if you like rpg games you will probably get into it but since when has mk been an rpg
i probably wouldnt mind it so much is i was playing as a familiar character but im not im playing as a kid
wtf
you run around town where time is moving so fast the space time continue should be caving in on itself and im running around collecting coins and looking for another kid to take me to the next training session
ummm ok but wait now i am trying to fill a bucket of water for an old lady finding some guys lost dog and collecting flour for a baker
wtf
this is mortal kombat and im playing as a kid doing good deeds for the townspeople
wtf
i seriously mean it wtf
if there is a great story to be told afterwards when you leave the walls of the first city then im afraid i wont see it because once i reached the first save point and exited the walls i was bored stupid and wondering what the heck kind of idea midway had to change mortal kombat into this sort of thingcould you imagine if mk was like this
instead of being a one on one fighter you had to learn to tie your shoe laces and pee in a straight line before advancing to the next level
that game would have been horrible and mortal kombat would not still be here today
mk is about fighting not collecting coins and doing chores for a bunch of townspeople who cant be bothered doing it themselves and the pictures of the meat and water bucket bwuahahahha oh man they are horrid to look at
it tried to through some humor in with the lost dog thing but i failed to find it funny because it seemed too child like orientated not something for the likes of teenagers and adults which mk has always been until this gamewtf happened here
did midway try to make an mk for children
yet get slapped with a m rating due to the  on  versionget shaolin monks instead of this this one is so warped and stupid it will make your head spinthis game seems like its a bit of a marketing ploy
sure if you and  friends have a gba with adapters then i guess its no big thing
but if everyone invests in a gba they might be disappointed by the multiplayer aspects
the game itself isnt all that fun as the plot is rather thin and the gameplay is annoying
i will say that the sound and graphics are all decent which is to be expected from squarebefore i purchased this i thought that it was going to be one of the best action games ever
after playing i was disappointed
its a very average game that doesnt have anything special to make it stand out from other gamesi found it very weird that there is no jump function
the only way to kill airborn enemies is to shoot them with a bow n arrow
this can be tedious since you have to stop and stand still then use the lock on target buttonand since there is no jump you can not jump in the air and perform hard landing attacksthere is also no kick button
kicks would have added a little more variety to the attacksyou should buy god of war instead
its a lot more fun and exciting than onimusha im of two minds about this game
on one hand its pretty fun to sit back with a friend and drive around crashing into other cars and making them explode
on the other hand it is so flawed that extended play is uninteresting and replayability is nilthe game has its good points but none of them are all that great
graphically its goodlooking but its not the bestlooking game on ps by any means
the physics are odd but its very easy to get used to how the game moves
the game is fun to play but only for about a half hour
i havent played online but i imagine its basically twoplayer mode without the splitscreen and with more playersthe game suffers from some serious pitfalls
the camera instead of staying behind your car so you know where youre going pans around at seemingly random times
this is especially irritating when youre attempting to tbone somebody only to have your aim ruined by the camera leaving you
the announcer in the game runs out of stock phrases pretty quickly but having nothing to say doesnt stop him
he spits out the same phrases time and time again
finally the game seems small as the championship mode is like any other racing game on the market there is no career mode or anything where you upgrade your car etc
gran turismo it is nowthis is a poor excuse for a demo derby game
its just horrible
look up videos on it on youtube before even thinking about buying this stupid gameshort reviewred dead revolver has a perfect atmosphere and fantastic soundtrack but its lack of checkpoints and brutal difficulty along with unexciting story and characters dont make it worthwhilelong reviewvideo games are by nature an industry that thrives on changing and evolving in response to ever evolving graphics and more powerful hardware and technology
gameplay wise its now pretty much standard practice to have quicktime events the ability to save where you like make every other game a free roaming sandbox etc
likewise some events also die out such as having to play through the game in one sitting not being able to save wherever you like and interactive movieswhy am i bringing this up
because red dead revolver is a perfect example of how some ideas in video games should be left behind for goodand not carried on for years when they should have gone extinct and died long beforered dead revolver is a third person western shooter has you running around the wild west as red a stereotypical bounty hunter who doesnt talk a whole lot and prefers shooting people to rationally discussing problems in the hopes of a diplomatic conclusion
years ago your parents were killed in a fiendish raid on your house and now decades later you finally have a chance to take revenge on those who tore your life apartlike virtually every other third person shooter on the market red dead revolver rdr has you running around levels shooting bad guys taking on boss characters gathering weapons and going on sneaking and infiltration missions among others
in fitting with the western theme you get to partake in numerous cliches such as train robberies ghost towns mines and desolate forts
and just like with its successor red dead redemption rdr absolutely oozes atmosphere from every angle
the environments you run through are distinct and varied and its always a treat to see what each level has in store from a train battle on the wide open plains complete with fields of golden grass to outposts lit with an overcast sun to ranches nestled amongst the mountains
rounding out the atmosphere is the spectacular musical score which perfectly embodies the feel of classic spaghetti westerns and the moment you hear it you really feel like youre in a good old fashioned western story ready to hop onto the nearest horse and ride off into the sunsetunfortunately however atmosphere can only take a game so far and when you start getting deeper into rdr you begin to realize that it embodies some of the most hated tropes in the world of video gamesa high difficulty level and a lack of checkpointsin fitting with the hostile world in inhabits rdr is a really hard game
youll go up against entire armies of outlaws militias and private armies who would love to put a bullet between your eyes and more often then not theyll accomplish it
in and of itself this isnt a problem save for those with low tolerance for frustration but what makes it such a huge problem is the lack of checkpoints
despite each level being really small theyre packed with enemies and events that you have to take on one after another and unfortunately you often have to complete two or three objectives at a time before you get a checkpoint
this sounds easy but in reality its anything but
i lost track of the amount of times i died only to respawn at the very beginning of the level thus making me fight through everything all over again especially on some of the more brutally difficult stagesunfortunitly this is especially annoying when it comes to duels another of the games biggest problems
quick draw gun duels have never really worked in video games and rdr doesnt break the trend
the aiming controls are very loose and drifty and youre always on a time limit before you get shot and killed
as the game goes on this limit gets smaller and smaller until you have perhaps half a second to react aim accurately and fire before dying
the second to last duel for example took me well almost a dozen tries to complete and even then it was pure blind luck that allowed me to pass not skillstill the difficulty and lack of checkpoints could be forgiven if the the story and characters were fascinating to follow but rdr doesnt succeed in this front
as the main character red is just not that interesting
for example he has just three facial expressions  neutral smirk
smug smirk
angry smirkcoupled with his sparse dialogue red just isnt an interesting character to follow or root for
the side characters fare slightly better and in a nice touch you even get to play as some of them at certain points such as the buffalo soldier the english gunslinger etc but they dont get much in the way of development either besides basic i want to save my ranch from the evil governor motivations and the whole story eventually finishes with an unsatisfying ending that fails to leave any impression on the playerin a nice touch after youve completed the single player game there are some really nice bonuses to unlock the biggest of which is a duel mode where you can play against up to three opponents at once in a big shoot out in stages that you can unlockbuy while playing through the main game and in addition you can also unlock pages in a journal that acts as a scrapbook
and theres even a bounty hunter mode which challenges you to complete levels in certain ways such as not taking a single hit finishing it within a time limit getting kills only with headshots etc
accomplishing such goals will get you some nice bonuses such as turning blood into glittering stars invincibility etc
all these unlockables really helps to give the game a lot of replay value that you dont see in many other western games so its a great touchoverall rdr has fantastic atmosphere an amazing musical soundtrack and some very nice unlockables but the high level of difficulty and uninteresting story ultimately makes rdr not worth recommending
whats really sad is that the checkpoint problem shouldnt happen
checkpoints in video games should be frequent not frustratingly sparse
never once have i encountered a review praising the lack of checkpoints for everyone hates to replay segments of a game over and over
even hard games like limbo for the xbox  provide very frequent checkpoints so if you die you feel determined to try again and dont feel like youre being harshly punished for failure
rdr does give the impression that its unduly punishing you for failing even though its the game itself thats brutally hard in the first placeanother short game made insanely monotonous and thoroughly boring due to limited ability to save games
actual new play is pretty limited but you will play the same scenes over and over and over again because you are set so far back each time you die
for the more dimwitted player this will make the game seem longer than it is
add to that some of the most unrealistic enemies in a western genre like the half naked fat guy that runs right up to you to blow you and him up with dynamite and you have a pretty pointless waste of time
if you have no need for originality or creativity buy this game nowlets face it american cowboys have gotten far less attention then their japanese samurai counterpart it seems like every month we get some new hack n slash title full of sweaty samurai
but perhaps the most reasonable explanation to all that could very well be that western games stink
the only bright spots that come to mind are lucas arts outlaws and konamis sunset riders
so attempting at all cost to bring the cowboy back into the picture perennial controversialspurringfavorites rockstar games have planted for us in the gaming soil red dead revolvero discuss red dead revolver without bringing up an issue of just how much explicit graphical nature this game has would be almost unheard especially taken from the game company that gave us manhunt and gran theft auto
much to my surprise this game didnt really have anything that was overthetop it was all kept to a minimumyou start the game as red the lone gunman whose pa was killed when he was just a young un
much like conan the barbarian revenge upon your fathers grave is the primary focus for igniting the plot
think conan just not as many governors and well more sheriffs
the games story mode doesnt play anything similar to gran theft auto so cancel out any assumption that youll be robbing people of their wagons and horses to cruise around towninstead the levels are condensed to linear and very tight surroundings
in addition to playing as red about  of the way to finishing the games many levels youll take control of an additional character who plays just the sameregardless of which character you play as red dead revolver is a standard action game dressed in a cowboy costume
you manuever around the playing field taking cover from enemy fire thanks in large part to the backgrounds this isnt much of a problem
what did annoy me was how unresponsive the controls wererockstar took a gamble by creating a control scheme too different than everyone elses
the finished results are unpleasent by moving around with one analog and aiming your gun with the other poses a seroius problem when faced with numerous enemies
also the inability to quickly change the camera freely led me on many occassions to die without ever knowing who was the culprit responsible for my death
there is a brief moment when you are allowed to use more firepower then usual
this mode is called dead eye when you have accumulated the points for bullet time you can press a button and slow down the camera in a matrix fashion
doing so allows you to chain six seperate hit points on the enemies body after that you can send them straight to the ground
my conclusion on this is the ability itself sure is useful but a little more creativity wouldve been nicer
then at final praise comes the dualing action the game offers which happens at scripted times of the game
it attempts to simulate a classic gun duel and to some degree succeeds in authenticating this as a western game
you pull back the analog stick to grab your gun push it forward to point it at the bad guys and then giving you a short amount of time to try aiming for the sweet spots before all hell breaks loose
its a novel concept but the fact that you cant actually decide when to use it turns it into nothing more than a flashy gimmickif i were to choose a version i would go with the xbox edition merely based on visuals
the game is a little more polished and the resolution is a few pixels higher but in the end both ps and xbox versions of red dead revolver suffer from low framerates and glitchy looking character models
character models that a first grader can make out of wooden blocks and construction paper
and some levels really do heighten the amount of suspense higher than what is really offered take the train stage for example
the music is decent there are those same tunes that flavored kill bill vol
 so well
too bad the voice acting has to go and screw things up when i say its bad i mean its really bad
the writing is also poorly done i understand this is only a game but with so many standards furthering the crossing of movie and game dynamics cheesy voice acting just doesnt cut it
with a little more freedom to whatever you want to do better graphics and a more understandable controlsred dead revolver couldve been a top choice action game
as it is given to us it will sell and obtain some acclaim thanks to rockstars games incompetent marketing moves but listen to me it isnt what the hype makes it out to bei originally had no interest in a game called quotthiefquot  sounded antisocial to me
but when i got a copy with my new sound card i installed it and gave it a shot what the heck rightand i fell in love with it
thief then the expanded version quotthief goldquot and then thief  made for a truly amazing experience
and unlike most games it was not a violent mindless game quite the oppositewell i bought this game a couple of days ago
i tried installing it on my main computer running winse which runs  of every other program ive ever owned or tested
guess what
thief  is the first game ive ever tried which does not run except under winxpsupposedly it runs with wink or winxp
so having k at work i took it in and gave it a shot
no go even though this is allegedly quotsupportedquot  why not
now bear in mind that this is a highend professional workstation not an old machine and not a quotkiddie computerquot  but it doesnt have the right quotpixel shaderquot revision built in
so it wont runget it
theres only a small subset of the pc marketplace that can even run this program people with very new highend graphics cards even the geforce wont work the most recent drivers nvidia series drivers at a minimum or the equivalently most recent ati drivers and nothing else will work
and you must have windows xp or else  you might as well rebox it and take it backor you can do what microsoft apparently convinced eidos to do trade in the pc version for the xbox version
i remember when the pc version was quotsuspendedquot and the product was formally announced as quotxbox onlyquot  well they didnt really really change their minds on thisthey removed one of the most commonlyused elements of the original game the ropearrows
they have such simple level design that there arent really any multilevel structures
oh yes and they have so far stated that there will be no sdk software development kit so you can just take it for granted that there will be no quotfan missionsquot released on the internet
for those of you who dont know its quotfan missionsquot which have made halflife stay on the sales racks for the past what five years
continuously
in other words be warned
despite the fact that this ad says that it will run in win it will not
despite the fact that this ad says that it will run in wink it will not
despite the fact that the ad says nothing about it if you dont have at a minimum a geforcefx  ultra with the latest drivers you will not be able to play the gamebottom line wait to see if ion storm and eidos fix these problems
and until they do do not buy this gamemine is going back first thing in the morningfirst ive been a fan of the thief games since day  including fanmade missions
i cannot recommend this game though because of the large amount of bugs that will likely never be fixed
lets start with the gameplay
sometimes when you jump up to mantle a ledge strange things will happen
you can either fall through the game world and fail the mission or get stuck in a weird floating pose
when youre in the floating pose you cannot jump and it is a royal pain to return the game to normal
whatever immersion the game has instilled in the player goes right out the window at these pointsof course that is assuming you can get the game to run in the first place
this game does not like multicore processors
unless you either disable the other cpu cores or limit the game to use only one core youll also have problems
back when this game came out we already had hyperthreading cpus which would cause problems like this because they show up as having multiple coresif the publishersdevelopers would stand by their product and patch these issues out it would be acceptable
however we got only one patch for this game which fixed some ai issues
if you simply must play this game i recommend buying it used in order to avoid supporting publishersdevelopers who dont fix glaring issues with their productslaggy even on my trickedout pc with whopper graphics card
keeps insisting on starting in d mode even though i turned it off repeatedly in the options menu because it makes a laggychoppy game even more laggy and choppy
biggest issue however is a gamesave bug that is suggested to be intentional by the developers for april fools your save games are useless and you cannot proceed past whatever levelchapter you are in the game
only proof of this is that it started on  april
save games during a level or try to load the latest autosave checkpoint after dying or whatever all to no avail
not funny at all
this is an official denial of service bug
instead of any of your saves actually loading you get dumped at the beginning of your current level over and over
realy funny considering you spend  for them to dos you
ha ha
how funny would it be for steam if i ran an dos against their servers and cloaked it in april foolsi love the simplicity of skulking around in the dark during medieval times
i like having a bow to fight with
beyond that this game is just too repetitiveyou get new missions and all you can do is sneak find loot by stealing it or picking locks on wooden chests achieve the required goals then get a new mission that has you doing the same crap all over again
i mean how many chests can you pick open before you get bored to tears
the weapons perform poorly too
i aim perfectly for the heart shoot a guy with  arrows close up and he still kicks my butt
then i can shoot another guy in the leg and he dies instantly
lame
the concept is fun it just lacks something to make you want to continue playing the next repetitive levels
the voice acting is pretty lame too
i would go so far as to call it banali am glad the developers stepped away from aliens and nazis
i swear if i have to kill one more darn superarmored alien nazi storm trooper with twin machine guns for hands i will screami dont want to imply that you should not play this game
it does have its moments
i would recommend you wait until this game costs around 
if you want a true sneak and loot challengego for splinter cell
the character has many more abilities and the game is actually entertainingi would have never played contracts but it came with my triple back that i bought on sale just for blood money i already had silent assassin
i forced myself to play contracts before playing blood money because i knew i would not if i played the later firstand i was right
there are some decent levels in contracts but i found myself more annoyed by some of them and thinking of how much i preferred the level the first time i played it in codename   it isnt really that the levels werent any good its just that id already done it
there was no point to it
and i dont understand why the developers did that becuase everything has been updated and they didnt just copy and paste that i can tell
so they basically just redid it all
bad movealthough the hotel mission was one of my favorites from codename  so it was nice to have that in although i would have preferrd a well made original mission
the ghost was a nice touch thoughgraphically speaking this was a good game
improvement there and with the physics
maps the new ones were decent but i have to dock this game major points for being basically a half a game at best
the gameplay is quite improved with less jumpy guards and a more intuitive rating system
theres really no incentive to get good ratings other than it makes it easier to survive the missionsi honestly think thats all i have to say about it so on to the ratingsgraphics  physics  gameplay  story    i think im being far too nice hereinterface maps  artificial intelligence  detail  replay potential   i see no reason to play it again so i may be too nice here as well total score by far my worst rating on a gameyet
thats down in the range where i should probably give it two stars
so i willok i bought hitman contracts and thought that it would be a great tpsstealth game
alas it wasnt to be
for a start the game itself doesnt play all that well with less than adequate framerates even though my computer specs are higher than what is recommendedi found it extremely difficult even on easy to approach a guard and kill him stealthily without alerting the other guards and causing a bloodbath
i understand the game requires patience but im not going to remain hidden in the shadows for  minutes just so that i can assassinate a couple of guardsthe controls are also annoying and take alot of time to get used to even if you configure them to your own liking
there also dont appear to be any health packs so that you can replenish your health
if you die you die and theres nothing you can do about it
it may be more realistic that way but its also less enjoyablethere are also a limited number of saves  that you can use for each mission
so for example if you did a quick save and suddenly lost most of your energy early on in the game it will be almost impossible to complete the mission without starting right from the beginning which makes it very cumbersomeall in all i was very disappointed and from a personal point of view would not recommend this gameif you expect a first person shooter along the lines of call of duty or vietcongforget it
if you have a video card other than nvidiaforget it
if you seek smooth logical gameplayforget it
as a previous reviewer noted there is definitely something wrong with this game
movement is awkward and laggy even at low resolutions
the single player games are pure confusion
the voiceovers and load time will drive you nuts
there is no keyboard reference sheet and there are at least  commands to memorize and use
land sea and air movements require different control setups
the game is buginfested and the bottom line isthis game sucksthis game stinks
i have pentium iv mhz ram  nvidia geforce fx video card and dsl and this game stinksheres what is good great soundtrack
the music is awesome
the idea
the idea is great
the way it plays out is noti first decided to play the single player mission to get the hang of the game
the graphics werent very good and even this part of the game lags
the movements are jumpy and it takes along to load
so i decided to try online and see what it was likei couldnt even log onto a game because i had the wrong version
i just got the game that day and it hadnt been out long
plus this game comes with some software called acegain liveupdate
it is supposed to automatically check and download any patches and updates
well it didnt
so i said ok to update
i waited and waited and waited and finally after  an hour i cancelled it and went out on the internet and looked for the patch
after waiting a little over an hour i finally got the patch and loaded it
the patch did let me enter an online game and it did help with the graphics but the game was way too laggy
according to my ping i was running less than  and i had the rd best ping out of  people and i still couldnt move very well
i was warping all over the place
so i tried another server and another server and after  tries i found a game with only  other guys
and guess what
it still played like crap
not sure how the other   people that are on everyday keep playing this but they arei thought the idea of doing helicopter drops and firing weapons from a helicopter and some of the booby traps you can set sounded cool
and it looks like the maps were done very well and there was lots of potential here
but somewhere along the line something happened
and it isnt goodi have also read some reviews here that said you had to have certain video cards and computers
why
this game should have been made to work with computers no matter what they have as long as they meet the minimum requirements
my computer which is a dell beats those requirements and the recommended requirements by alot
but the game still lags on single player and multi player
it is just unplayable
i have not had this problem with any other recently released games and should not have had a problem with this one
but it sounds like i am not the only onehaving been a pretty big fan of battlefield  i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone right now
maybe more patches are on the way but after trying to play this game for around  hours i just cant do it anymore
i will keep checking for new patches to see if it improves but for right now i would tell you to wait for battlefield  which is coming sometime
until then i will get back online and continue to play medal of honorget unreal tournament  instead of this crapthis game is buggy poor graphic and the machine guns are just too powerful
on the other hand unreal tournament  got very balanced weapons that actualy requires skill to shooti love games and first person shooters but i have to say that after recently tryng both battlefield  and vietnam i am considering going back to playing board gamesfirst of all the movement is so lame that when i compare it to other games like call of duty i cant imagine that the creators of these games were somewhat embarrassedits true that you get to go into different vehicles such as tanks planes and jeeps yipee but half the time that you are riding shot gun the driver aimlessly drives into trees gets stuck and i found myself killing the drivers just so that i can get into the drivers seat and get moving
the battles are so unrealistic that i wonder how this is even a war game
the look and feel of the game is entirely unsatisfactory and after about a half our i found myself thinking about deleting the game off my system
guess what its deletedi know that games are subjective and that many may think it is just the greatesti respect your opinions but for me these games were just horribleit is just my opinion but what can i tell you
try before you buy and consider yourselves forewarnedi loved bf  and it was with anticipation that i installed this new installment
much to my dismay this sequel feels more like an opensource mod than a whole new game
i fail to see the quotgreat graphicsquot that some are talking about i have a highend pcgraphics card thank you very much and the game is full of bugs
the online aspect has been really buggy so far with unacceptable lagmy biggest disappointment however was with the level design and the overall feel of the game
whereas the levels in bf and its expansion packs were brilliant and really conveyed a sheer sense of epic conflict the levels here are way too dark too cramped and boring
i realize that the battlefields of vietnam were different from wwii but all the levels end up looking exactly the same hilly jungle
far from creating tension this results in boredom as you skulk around looking for somebody to frag
all in all if feels like a cosmetic update to what was a great wwii gamei must agree with everyone it sucksalot and i mean a lot of bugs in the gamewhen it first came out i thought this is gonna be the bestbut was i wrongthe only good thing in the game is the graphics and multiplayerwait when the price goes down then buy it and play only multiplayer cause thats the besti am realy disipointed at this game and they could have done better a lot betterhope this helpedyou would think that after nearly twenty years of making wrestling games acclaim would have learned how to do it better than this by now
sadly this isnt the case
quotshowdownquot takes a very interesting concept and ruins it so much that it quickly reminds you why these legends are just that legends  meaning wrestlers of yesterday
despite having pretty good graphics and options the game plays like an old nintendo cartridge
the action is very slow and choppy and the commentary is way off timing at times
its hard to nail your opponent with a single punch due to the frustrating play control
its a great idea to have a game complete with all your favorite grapplers who paved the way for the new age entertainers but not when it plays like this
acclaim has further added to its tainted history of mediocre wrestling games
quotshowdownquot falls right into the category with all the silly snes wrestling titles along with quotwarzonequot quotattitudequot and the ultrahorrible quotecwquot game that hit n
my best advice for quotshowdownquot rent it play it enjoy seeing all your old favs wish it was a better game and ultimately save your money for quotraw vs smackdownquot coming this november
and to acclaim  please take some notes from thq
pleasehow many games have rockstar made
i dont know but it seems like it never ends
the godfather grand theft auto bully all the same damn game with different graphics and different stories
the warriors mixes it up a little by focusing on the close melee combat
unfortunately the melee combat isnt nearly as fun when youre playing it as it looks in those screenshots
it doesnt help that theres a lot of gangsters on the screen at the same time making it hard to see who are your buddies and who you should be beating upas in every other lame rockstar game the controls are too complicated read easy to forget
theres a different control scheme for everything  from picking a lock to busting down gates to you name it
the problem is like in grand theft auto theres no quick reference or reminder on the screen to tell you the controls
so im sitting there with a full rage meter and cant remember how to use it
this game isnt worth sifting through the controls in options to learn how to do something
now if it was ninja gaiden it would be worth looking up but this is certainly no ninja gaidenthe good  good graphics good storyline great dialog and style
unfortunately its a bunch of style and some pretty boring repetitive gameplay
even super mario bros  had more variety than just punching and kicking
yawn
ill be skipping anything that says rockstar games on it for the rest of my life
they never really make anything new or excitingi think the whole idea of the warriors with vests and funny afros bandanas baseball uniforms is just silly
warlord looks like one of those guys who throws a towel over his head because hes gonna do yard work
add all this to an imaginary world of gangsters who dont use guns and you have a very silly beatem up game
i have trouble distinguishing the difference between this and state of emergencywhen in cooperative mode the game play splits into two screens and everything gets a lot smaller
the camera gets confusing and the game looses any atmosphere its supposed to have
in the end i just remember running around in circles fetching for items in these mini like city portions
i just didnt like it if you want a violent atmospheric game i recommend manhunt also from rockstar games
a game i personally thought was underratedrock stars popularity essentially rests on two concepts innovation and controversy
the first and most positive concept  is to introduce something groundbreaking
with the gta games they introduced free roaming evironment with very few restrictions
there was cartoonish violence and some bad language but it was all in good funbut other less innovative rockstar games have relied on one thing moving further into the gutter
the warriors is no exception
this game is about one thing brutal realistic gang violence with countless fwords a rape or two and basically mass chaos
theyd have done better if the characters would have repeated one phrase the entire time were breaking all the rules man
were pushing the envelope manthat seems to be the only goal with this game
while the senseless violence is there it doesnt have the free roaming of the gta games and the dialogue is some of the most irritating with seemingly endless oneliners and nonstop cursingif this sounds like your thing well bon apetitei can honestly say right after experiencing xbox recently it is the worst console ever to be manufactured
i had to literally input time day and date again every time i switch on my xbox to play
this never ever happen to ps or gamecube
theres no reset button
if you wanna just start the game from the beginning you had to literally switch off and on again
didnt really liked the control as well
i dont see there is any big difference on graphics just because it is manufactured by microsoft
how realistic do you want it to be
if you want it like the real thing then dont play games but go out there and see the world
thats the real graphics
the console is heavy as hell due to its contents
i am selling my xbox after playing a few games and not even over  hours of gameplay
i bought it weeks ago to at last having an xbox in my possession so i could stay on top of the gaming industry but sadly it didnt
xbox is history
anyone interested in buying from me let me know it is still brand new in mint conditioni take care of all my belongings i just dont see myself enjoying xbox
but if you are a gamer who enjoys online game
this console is for youi cannot believe how many people worship this
its definetly not worth the hype
sure the graphics chip is capable of a lot of great graphics but guess what
they hardly use it
the controller isnt nearly as comfortable as the pss
and there are more fun and better games on gamecube
not to mention how many better games there are for ps
i have all  systems
xbox is by far the worst
oh and halo isnt nearly as good as everyone says it is
best fps on xb but thats not saying alot
maybe thats why so many people worship it its the only shooter that they could play
theres infinite lives you cant die
on the upside there are games like morrowind and fable that you cant find on any other console and there is a hard drive the first console to have one
a very tiny hd but neverthelessout of the  bit consoles ps xbox gc dreamcast the xbox is by far the worst
ive disliked the console ever since it launched in november  and since then very little has happened to make me change my mind about itthe console reeks of soulless corporate greed
some people may accuse sony and their games of being soulless and corporate but a soulless company could never make a game as beautiful and innovative as ico or something as charming  addictive as the first  spyro the dragon games
microsoft seems to care about profit  appeal more than creativity and fun and everything about the xbox proves itit also reeks of arrogance
when the xbox was in development it was codenamed project midway in reference to the world war ii battle where the americans outsmarted the japanese
thats extremely ironic because the idiots who almost ruined the game industry atari d were american and the ones who are credited with restoring it nintendo sega were japanese
and lets not forget those obnoxious only on xbox stamps that all the exclusive games have on their boxes as if theyre mocking the other consoles because they dont have those gamesseamus blackley the man who designed the xbox thought he had the formula for a great gaming system because the console itself was powerful
when he was working on it he didnt seem that concerned with making great games for it
the graphics over gameplay mentality that the console lives on is stupid and nonsensical
most xbox fanboys will brag about how powerful their console is
while its true that the technical specs are better than the other  consoles the only thing the xbox has really used its superior technical power for is for making better graphics and as we all know its the gameplay not the graphics that make the game good
and what about the xboxs gamesthe xbox was sold almost entirely on the success of the launch title halo which is one of the most generic and overrated games ever made
even microsoft themselves admits that if it wasnt for halo the xbox wouldve went the way of the dreamcast
the ps had a somewhat weak launch but by early  it was absolutely springloaded with a game after  a game
so why cant xbox do the same
calling the console a onetrick pony is  pretty much accurate because almost all of the other early first year xbox games like azurik and nighcaster were total garbage
not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but it almost makes you wonder if microsoft payed the gaming magazines to hype up one of their games so the whole console would sell wellthe xbox has largely rejected japanese support so it makes sense that the console has largely flopped in the land of the rising sun
some say that the japanese are a bunch of selfish overlypatriotic bastards
i say they know whats good for them
before you call me a japan asskisser who revived the game industry from americas mistakes
who created pacman mario sonic and many other of the best games and game characters ever
whos not afraid to try new things or appear crazy because of it
where are yuji naka and hideo kojima from
trying to make a good console without japans help is like britain trying to win world war ii without americas help
it just isnt going to happen
out of the few good exclusives that the xbox has all of them are from japan
gee i wonder if its some sort of coincedinceits also an rpgdeprived wasteland
most xbox owners will tell you that the console has rpgs in the form of fable star wars kotor and jade empire but these are actually just action games in disguise with rpg elements in them
theyre just not the same as final fantasy and dragon warrior nor are they anywhere near as memorableand where are the oddball and niche games
niche games dont really sell well but they usually turn out to be better than most highly anticipated titles
the ps has mister mosquito stretch panic and katamari damacy the gamecube has cubivore and pikmin but what does the xbox have for those of us who are looking for something different
nothingxbox has seemingly eclipsed the ps in terms of popularity which seems fitting
 years ago i wouldve grimaced at the thought of  the xbox overthrowing the ps in that category but now that i think about it it reflects the quality of the consoles better
most things that are popular just flat out suck
they get watered down for conformity and commercial success reasons
garbage bands like poison motley crue korn blink   cent ashlee simpson and fall out boy become popular and sell like crazy while real artists like the velvet underground captain beefheart and my bloody valentine are doomed to toil in obscurity
in high school the superficial preps take center stage at the proms and footballs games while the nerds goths and theatre kids are deemed weird by everyone else
walmart acts as a gigantic black hole toward smaller more honest businesses sucking them up and not giving them a fighting chance
it works the exact same way with video games so that should tell you which consoles have the real gamesto its credit xbox does have shenmue ii the release of the us version on the dreamcast was cancelled panzer dragoon orta ninja gaiden and metal slug  as exclusives which are all great
also the ability to save your game without a memory card is an excellent idea
because of these  factors ive bumped the rating up a half a stargaming fans save your money and get a ps or a dreamcast instead
or you could just wait for the next generation to arrive
its not that far off by this pointi own a ps and an xbox and i could careless about graphic music or video up loads
to me both systems have great graphic depending on the game you play
and if youre not a big time gaming freak and are shopping for the st time for a gaming system i thought id list some facts about xbox and ps that might help in your decision
ps is thin you can fit it in your briefcase or beach bag when heading on vacationxbox is rather large and heavy might not fit on some tv stands thin shelvesps requires a memory card sold separatelyto save your games big deal they cost  and ive had one for  years now and its still not full because you can delete game off it to make run for new onexbox has a built in memory nothing to purchaseto save your games but it can only hold so much
where you can buy as many memory cards for ps you wantps can play dvd which is great when youre on vacation at a hotel the kids get the game and you can watch movies at nightxbox can not although i think someone said you can buy an adapter for it but why do that if you already own a dvd player
ps you can play online as long as you have a broadband connection for freexbox you can play online too with a broadband connection but you also you have to pay a monthly fee to play onlineand most of all i am very disappointed in the games xbox offers
i know all the guys who own xbox are freaking saying what are you talking about you need to play republic commando and halo  xbox only games
i have and all those killing games have wonderful graphics but i guess being a women i really do not care for those gamesi like games where i have to search for something not just walk forward and kill anything in front of me
although battlefront is really fun which is available on ps and xbox
but my favorite games are sypro where you have to look for hidden treasure and figure out mazes
also i enjoy kingdom heart where you get to be disney world characters i know sounds girly but you have to fight villains and its very challenging you have to use your mind to figure out hidden section
but those games are only available on play station  you can not play them on xbox
i have not been able to find any games that are exclusively for xbox that i like it seem the majority of xbox only games are either sports or require you to kill someone great for guysif youre shopping for the st time for a gaming system i strongly suggest looking at the games st
if you find a few games that you really like that are only avaliable on xbox then that is the system you should get or maybe do like me and just get both ps and xbox
but if you can only get one and if you can guess by my review i think ps is much betterthough miles better than the awful first game this still suffers from major bore
the freeroaming gameplay would be great if there were a bit more variety and things to dothe main problem is that the gaming area is absolutely immense
while this may be a good thing a whole state is your gaming area in the upcoming gta san andreas there are very few definitive landmarks to give you some kind of orientation
its based on the real new york with all the famous buildings but literally hundreds of streets look the same and its very very easy to get hopelessly lost
plus the only method of travel is swinging
yes its cool but very slow considering the area you have to cover and not to easy to control unless your a genius with the control padand the missions are all the same
stop an armoured car hijack stop a guy stealing a car save some idiot hanging off a building beating up nameless thugs save some guy hanging off a building stop some guy stealing a car save some guy hanging off a buildingboring
when you complete a mission that should be it done for the whole game none of this again and again and again trash
the average score for completing these missions is  hero pointsyou need    to reach doc ock at the end of the game
sorry i aint sticking around long enough to  tedious missionsthe only cool thing about this game is that its narrated by bruce campbell
the rest seems like a rushed movie tiein not a real gamei miss the classic crash bandicoot games  and even  though it had load screens that would drive you crazy this one starts a new wave of a crash meets jak and daxter type of gameplay instead of the level at a time play that the classics we know and love hadafter three ps appearances several more on the gba a racing game and a nextgen turn in wrath of cortex it seemed about time to try varying things up a little for our favorite orange beasttwinsanity marks crashs first adventure game in a fully d world
while most of the levels still maintain the linear path this game really does provide the first fully d roaming experience and the results are well mixed
for me personally i had a hard time adjusting to the new look and feel
for starters the crisp pixels of the past have been replaced with the polygonal approach which results in everything looking a bit fatter and somehow cheaper like a hannah barbara cartoon seen next to a looney tunes originalthanks to the rotating camera i found controlling the characters to be very frustrating when i had to hit some very specific marks like bouncing up multiple rows of boxes to reach a special item or running up a circular path trying to dodge obstacles under a tight time limit
the problem is the camera constantly shifts to a predetermined position and while you are supposed to be able to control it you very rarely can do so enough to get it where you need it to be
in the d games of the past missing the mark was never an issue but in full d with a wildly rotating camera its very hard to plan where you will be landing next
this led to alot of cheap deaths throughout
and you can forget being able to freelook to try to find any object that might be hiding just off screenthe presentation of the gameplay was also an issue
in the past you would select what order you wanted to face a set of five levels then fight a boss then move to a new level with backtracking as simple as going to the main screen and reselecting a former level
here you move from one end of the island to another encountering level sequences as you go and backtracking becomes a huge chore
when you want to go back and find the games hidden gems you often have to traverse entire levels multiple times just to get back to the area you want to exploreand this is made all the more frustrating because of what i believe is the games single biggest flaw  the flaw which really lands it in thumbs down category for me
there is no way to skip cutscenes in this game
there are fullmotion movies that can be skipped but the ingame cutscenes are nonskippable even after youve sat through them once before
that means when backtracking you will keep having to sit through long cutscenes over and over that become less amusing each time  even when youve beaten that portion of the gamewhats even worse is there were times when i would come across a difficult section or boss fight and after each death i would be sent back some ways and have to make my way back to the difficult section and again sit through that increasingly annoying cutscene over and over again
this kills the rhythm of trying to figure out what youre doing wrong because by the time you get back to the difficult spot youve already forgotten what you tried beforethe forced cutscenes not only serve to frustrate you but also lengthen the game considerably  a game which is pretty short in the first place
were it not for these repeated cutscenes you could probably work through the game in a day though i suppose the same could be said of all the previous crash gamesmy final frustration was with the gems
they are hidden throughout the game seven or eight per level and the menu keeps track of what you have and havent found which is all nice
most of them are easy to spot but not always easy to get
they provide an incentive to revisit past levels  however there is no real reward to finding them
in previous games finding gems opened up new parts of previous levels to explore but that is not the case here
all you get here is unlocked artwork in the menu whoopdeedoo and finding all of them gives you an added ending though i cant really recall what the added ending was which should tell you how anticlimatic it was after bothering with all the revisiting of past levels and cutscenesfor all these faults though the game is not a total loss
when you are embroiled in the levels themselves they can be quite fun
and this time out crash offers several new gameplay styles revolving around controllable characters
through a handful of levels you will control both crash and cortex simultaneously where combo moves are required to proceed
these sections were pulled off pretty well where they could have easily felt contrived
the animations of the characters can be visually hysterical such as at the beginning when you are basically a ball made up of the two characters wrestling and punching each other as you roll past various obstacles
later you will be throwing cortex to outofreach ledges to trigger door locks or rolling him through pipes to access new areas or using him as a surfboard to race down mountain slopes
and in what is perhaps the games best new innovation you will occasionally have to run ahead of cortex as hes being chased by a bear or a swarm of bees and clear all obstacles out of his path
this happens twice and id have loved for it to have happened several more timesat other times you will control cortex alone in a thirdparty runandgun minigame that felt very tackedon
it was not very well fleshed out and was somewhat more difficult than fun
the same can be said for the wedgedin character of nina cortex who you will control for one drawnout level
shes a little more fun to play as but again her inclusion feels like a lastminute throw inthe writing of the cutscenes is pretty good  the story is indeed laughoutloud funny in parts  but again they lose their charm quickly after sitting through them fourfivesix times in a rowall told i did manage to enjoy the game but only just barely
its really a shadow of the fun of previous crash entries and it certainly pales in comparison to other recent platformers such as ratchet and clank or the mario franchise
i can only recommend that you rent it and give it a shot before committing to a purchasetheifdeadly shadows by eidos did not surprise in most of the gaming experiance
overall this game lacked details and details of information that just didnt fit xbox standardbeautiful graphicshmmmmm reminds me alot about splinter cellgameplay sucks  of the time
did the game copy ubi or somthing
i swear i saw a stealth meterits a stealth game quotstealthyquot tactics weaponsgeezfeels no different than splinter cell
to get to my pointyour a character called garret who assumably is supposed to be undercover or to make this game better than it is quotstealthyquot however there are a couple of problems with it other than the ones listedthe levels are to damn big
in almost every level too literally with no online help strat guides nothing have to look around the whole town and slumswow
that sure is fun
just to get to a simple objective that you could have done easily in gta vice citybut lets not go there
so  levels to big to manuever through
lastly i have to say the gameplay was so boringyou wait longer than you have to in splinter aside to the fact that splinter cell  and  are actually worth playing
the weapons are not funi mean come on a friggin wood club
good weapon for a theif eidosthe dialouge between the npcs are so dole that you just want to slap yourself for no reason please i prefer you stealth gamers or whatevr you are to go with tom clancy games or if you want to try somthing new dont waste your money on a game on this buying or renting
thanks for your timeps
the only good thing about this game is the soundgraphics forget the rest its a bunch of crapthis game was simply frustrating at every turn
i never really got into the tom clancy games a lot and tried this as a first in many yrs on my ps
the levels were just plain annoying the level of difficulty as i remember was adjustable and the enemy ai was generally quite good the problem lies with your team mates who will sometimes do the dumbest things ever
there is a level where you begin with only one team mate and must finish the mission without him being killed
i ended up spending  or  days working on this and atleast  hours time
your teammate will simply run in front of gunmen and i kept him at the very beginning of the level the whole time but when i commanded him to re join me near the end  he would get killed i couldnt complete the whole mission aloneas i was low on health
he only had to engage and kill  guys up a level of stairs and could not do it
time after time he would simply run in front of the enemies as they unloaded clips
i tried having him help me in another part of the level and he was continually running in front of a sniper
this was not the only time a problem like this that occured
play this game and you will know what i mean
ive heard splinter cell pandora tomorrow is very good but avoid ri was excited about this game at first
and if you are new you will be excited as well
there is a lot of new stuff for the usual mmorpg player who is used to the typical dwarf sword and sorcery
its funfor the first  levels or so
then the grind starts
the highest i reached after  hours of play is level  out of  highest level
around level  or so i noticed how hard it was to level up
i dont mind it taking awhile but in city of heroes you have limited things to do to level upbasically you fight villians
its fun but after you have killed the same type of villian thousands of times its not fun
and when you level up you dont always get a new power
at level  you only get a new power every rd level
what this boils down to is that after your hard work to level up you have to level up  more times to see a cool new power
not fun
there is no carrot to keep you interested in playingfinally if you reach level  there is nothing more for you to
in other games there are epic dungeons or pvp
here there is nothingi give the game  stars for the uniqueness of play and fast action
however it is not enough to keep you interested in playing especially with the steep xp curve
ive played other mmos before and this one is the longest time to xp ive ever seen
for a month or  you will get enjoyment
just dont plan on staying interested or making this the mmog you plan to stick with for  yearsprosbest graphics of any mmorpg currently on the market wo a doubtconsnearly unmonitored gameplay
excessive player killing exploits and moneyloot farming have all but destroyed the game in its short life spanvery limited pool of weaponsspells to use
only  weaponsspells for each tier of player level rangeitems and travel are extremely expensive in terms of payoutcost ratio
grind  weeks for  million adena then buyyour weaponget player killed by level  rangerdrop ur new weapon upon deathrinse repeatoverall horrible customer support system
despite the fact that all mmorpg supports arent fantastic l seems to be the worstsummaryl is a visually gorgeous game that does not have the gameplay to support it
if you purchase this game expect an extremely tough time starting out
also expect tougher leveling requirements than other games
if you are a  yr old griefer that enjoys screaming i pwnd joo
nbz
or someone looking to farm to make some fast cash then this is the game for you
if you are someone looking for a real roleplaying experience in a questing environment then i highly recommend that you stay with something else till eqii or wow goes livelineage  is the newest fantasy mmorpg ie
massive multiplayer on line role playing game from ncsoftthis game while beautiful in appearance lacks the necessary characteristics to compete with the present and future mmorpg products on the markethere is an analysis of the productcharacter creation
personalization is almost null you will be part of an endless army of clones roaming the land
classes and races are few
must say the character skins are the most beautiful i ever saw but there are only  for each race and class
this means everybody looks the sameatmosphere as much as the beautiful graphics the cities are detailed to perfection could contribute to a wonderful setting there are no rpg servers and name control is not implemented
cursing goes on all the time on public channels people talk about their own business and you end up hearing it allplus name filter is only on english thus many players use insults and curses as their names
finally names like xxkino really dont get you in the right mood for fantasy gameplay
not good at alla getting to level  is an enourmous level grind
an that is when the game gets betterb quests arent many and are not fun
its like being a pizza guy in a fantasy settingc all races are very far apart from each other at the beginning each race starting in its own city
result clone wars extravaganzaall you meet are players exactly like you same characters same faced moving around is an enormous pain
you have to click to where you want to go no horses hippogriffs etcso if you have to travel coast to coast prepare for a clicking tendinitis and an hour of tediume you actually travel to islands with boats and it is so realistic that you will be on a boat for more than an hour doing nothingf the game is all money based
monsters drop average equipment which you will sell to buy decent equipment
an when i say you will need a lot of money i mean  times what you are thinking right nowg basic rule you are your equipment
if you die you can lose a piece and this is over xp loss
the prima manual suggests not to die thanks a loth there seems to be no real objective what am i doing this for
its not even fun to be around the game grinding and there is nothing to get toi the game is packed with farmers botters macroers etc etc
all the worst you can get from an online communitybottom linefolks this is a not buyyour money is better spent on ffxi but i would simply wait for guild wars or worlds of warcrafti give up and in a few words here is whypitching good luck mastering the effectivenessaccuracy meter
its like kicking field goals in eas fb games
initiallyit seemed like a good thing but as soon as your pitcher tires a bit you will get hammered regardless of your skill with the meter
the toggle switches have very little if any
effect onthis
i got tired of pitching well against the red sox until theth or th inning and then just getting hammeredbatting you will hit very few home runs and rarely take a walk from the cpu
the home run derby is frustrating and onedimensionalno seasonal play unless you are in the dynasty mode which few people should ever possibly have the time to waste on
playing a season during the season for me at least was what it was all about
if i had only known that prior to my purchaseaa and aaa teams thanks for nothing
whats next ea sportsquotlittle league quot
are you really going to play many gameswith pawtucket and their cast of mostlyfake players
no thankssome reviewers here mention that they are going to wait for high heat  sadly d is out of business but msn has purchased the rights to their games
hopefully next year thatgame will be back as this is no substitute for the real thingthis game is a waste of time and money it is only fun when playing on manager mode
the minor league thing was cool but still i am bitter because the a teams from leagues like the south atlantic league were not in the game
get mlb baseball it is a much better gamethis game is ok because has bascally no fun into it being relastic
if you are under  years of age then ok but you should get the  sports seris if you are  years of age or older then get mlb slugfestpros of mlb nice hittingconsgraphics are ok but need some workcant really steel a basecant get a player out by throwing it to firstbase before the player slids back on first baseno arguments
blahnow i dont have a problem with the characters all being animated in lowres nor do have a big gripe with the completely bland  generic background music
what i do have a quarrel with is the completely broken gameplay  unbalanced character rosterthe character roster is one of the most marred to date for any vs series no zangief morrigan blanka yuri no rival school characters no last blade characters etc
 having two different types of ken mr karate akuma  iori dont really count as variety within the character roster
shin akuma  shin mr karate of all characters have infinite supers
this results in these types of characters being heavily abused online by noobs
also there is no rematch option online  the ranking system is broken at times if you defeat an opponent online that opponent can acquire your winpointsdont think for a minute that by placing the difficulty level on the hardest setting will give you a challenge against the computer in arcade mode
all the computer does is turtle you shooting projectiles  spamming the same moves over  over
the hit collision is very poorly executed with punches  kicks going right through characters supers as well
there is even some laginput inbetween supers at times
also grapplesthrows which miss result in ones powersuper meter slightly decreasing for each throw missedwhat really kills this game is how obsolete the capcom characters feel
characters such as guile  bison have had their chargedbased movesproportions adjusted drastically  making them practically useless to play asits pretty neat how the characters have dialogue throughout the arcade mode
the gallery sections also a nice touch though unlocking each character pic via survivor mode can be quite tedious as well as the replay mode which appears to have been completely stripped from cvs eo which allows one to save an indefinite amount of replays to the xboxs hard driveall in all this game would have been alright it were to have been released back in the mid s but with its unbalanced roster  limited modes of play this games not guaranteed to hold ones interest for very long
best wishes on seeing this one make it to a tourneyironically i had preordered the console version of call of duty long before i had played the pc version
yet with the release date oh so far away i decided to take advantage of the recent price drop of the call of duty pc game hoping that it would tide me over
however after playing countless hours of the game on my pc id have to say that call of duty finest hour is a bit of a disappointment
i understand that a console has nowhere near the processing power of a pc yet i couldnt help but feel underwhelmed by fhs graphics which were simple and bland at best
however i was mostly disappointed in the lack of save points throughout a level
that meant after spending ten minutes or so blasting your way through a difficult level you would have to start the campaign all over again from start to finish if your player is killed
i always appreciate a challenge yet not when the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against me
the one aspect that the console version did translate well was the war is hell theme
the beginning level featuring you as a russian soldier taking back stalingrad from the steeking germans was intense with gunfire raining all around you and enemy soldiers around every corner
the death animations are overly exaggerated which made in difficult to distinguish whether or not an enemy was either wounded or dead only to have them shoot you in the back
i played this game for only an hour before i filed it away with my other games
i imagine that i will someday go back but in the meantime im having too much fun with the pc versionthis game could have been excellent if not for a long list of flaws
here are some of the major issues that make it be only a  star game game advertises itself as an actionrpg
in reality this is nothing like baldurs gate or diablo but it is more like a beatem up arcade think mutant turtle ninjas in arcades there is zero artificial intelligence
in single player you control one of the  xmen while the other  are controlled by the ai
normally this would work but not in this game
i had xmen falling from bridges very expensive to revive them unless you replay that segment xmen standing on grenades and not moving xmen getting a beating with no reaction and so on
if you think single player  then do not get this game there is no way to really control what the other  xmen are doing
while pressing l should bring them to where you are this hardly ever works
and if they come to where you are the moment you let l go they run back to fight there is no way to setup the use of potions for these  other xmen
you can only choose to have them use potions at  or  of their health but  is not enough by the time they use the potion  if they use it  they are dead while  is too much they start chugging potions when is not needed
choosing other options or percentages is of no use too there is no way to go alone to scout if you already have the group with you similar to brute force or kotor
they always follow you and even when you set them up to not charge the enemy they will still do it like in lotr third age your characters level up every  minutes
this gets annoying really fast especially since you only get  point every time and most skills require more than  still basically you have to go through  menus every  minutes to level up this game gives new meaning to term linearity
there is always just one way to go
even fable seems nonlinear with respect to this
invisible walls are everywhere even though you can see the road you cannot go on it
no real surprise here since this game is a beatem up and this linearity is typical of these gameswhat is good about the game good graphics and distructable environment
never get tired of breaking walls etc even if it is presented poorly the story is good enough length of the game is around  hours  times that of most new games xmen characters old and new are excellent
skills  even if not a lot of them  are a lot of funoverall unless you are an xmen fan i would not recommend this game
i think the potential is definitely here but execution is amateurish strange since raven has been around for a while
if they work out the ai issues in the next one i may give it a tryironically i had preordered the console version of call of duty long before i had played the pc version
yet with the release date oh so far away i decided to take advantage of the recent price drop of the call of duty pc game hoping that it would tide me over
however after playing countless hours of the game on my pc id have to say that call of duty finest hour is a bit of a disappointment

i imagine that i will someday go back but in the meantime im having too much fun with the pc versioni have played the pc version of call of duty and it was an amazing game the ps version crap
horrible graphics and stale gameplay make this game look like a turd in the toiltet compared to its pc counterpart even if you never played the pc version you wouldnt liket his game
a complete waste of money do not bother with this gameunless youre a harcore gamer the first installment of xmen legends is really frustrating
first of all theres no way of setting game difficulty
so even though the normal playing mode is easy for people who are really into games its not so great for the casual gameranother thing i didnt like was the fact that if your team doesnt have characters who can fly youre basically on your own
there are some levels when the character has to fly to get to the otherside
while doing so you leave all the characters who cant fly behind and so you have to battle alone
unless theres a way of working around this which i can probably find on a walkthrough online this was not good
im at the beginning of the game and can only choose certain characters who are limited in power and ability and only the female characters ie
storm rogue and jean grey can fly
and they get beaten as soon as they reach the other sideanother thing i dont like is the fact that you have to pay  techbits money in the game to revive characters
so if you dont have enough techbits and youre character dies you wont be able to revive himheronce you enter a level you cant go back either which really gets on my nerves since you wont be able to get more techbits once you smash everything there is to smash which means you could run out of heroes if they all diethe reason i bought this game is because i really liked the xmen legends  and marvel ultimate alliance games by the same company ravensoft
it seemed they worked out all the short comings of xmen  in xmen  aside from the freezing problem in  and marvel ultimate alliance fixes all the problemsif youre a big xmen fan and a serious gamer than this version of xmen legends wont be a problem for you
but if youre like me a casual gamer who wants to enjoy the game and not be frustrated to no end by it stick with xmen legends  or marvel ultimate alliancealso a word of caution for those who are planning on purchasing xmen legends  read the other reviews on that game because although its fun to play it crashes freezes when you reach act  and thats a problem with the game itself not the disc so even if you exchange the game for another one the same thing will happenedit this is in the comments section because the edit button doesnt appear unless you leave a comment
so i pasted this info into the body of the review for additional info for the gamefirst when i consulted an online walk through and i discovered that in order to get characters who cannot fly over to the other side you must use a character who can build bridges ie
iceman or jean grey
these characters will build a bridge with their mutant powers that allow the other heroes to cross over
i didnt know that because i played and finished marvel ultimate alliance and xmen legends  before i played this game so i assumed that characters who couldnt fly would just appear on the other side like they did in those games
so that solves that problem
but there are other stages that require one or two heroes with specific mutant abilities otherwise you wont be able to progress
unless you consult a walk through youll have no idea which character you need
although the game does give hints in the dialoguenext thing game difficulty
the reason i had such a problem with this was due in part because the characters you choose to start the mission are at level one while the enemies seem to be at level  or more
there are also some stages with many foes and each one is shooting machine guns at you inflicting lots of damage so you have to keep repeating the stage over and overhowever once your characters level up to about  or so the game becomes more evenly matched and it actually becomes really fun
the problem is is that by that time youre pretty much at the end of the gameanother downer on leveling up you end up having to spend more techbitsmoney to revive your characters if they die
it started out at  but then started doubling as heroes leveled up until it was up in the thousandsi also discovered that you can go back in some stages but you cant extract
also in the later acts there seemed to be techbits health and energy packs everywhere which is odd because they arent that available in the first half of the game when you really need them mostlast thing once you finish the game and you want to start over all of your unlocked powers gear levels and characters go back to being locked
the only thing that becomes unlocked is alternate costumes for certain heroes
not sure if this changes if you choose hard modeim not even sure if theres a hard mode but that makes replay nonexistentso aside from its shortcomings ill have to admit that i finally enjoyed the first xmen legends game towards the last half
and i decided to add this comment to be fair to the game but i still say unless youre ready to be frustrated during the first half of game play stick with xml  or muai ran across this game sort of by accident and i noticed the positive reviews and the low price
everything seemed fair given the price but the following is my main reason for buying iti searched a lot of reviews to make sure it had multiplayer lan
supposedly on the lan mode you can play an uptofourplayer cooperative game
which meant i could play with my kids and be on the same team against the computer instead of fighting them
thats coolon further research i saw that supposedly you could legally install the game on all your personal computers in your house
thats also cool
i figure it is an old game and they are trying to do something like starcraft where you can spawn copies for lan only playall this is adding up to sounding like a really good deal
so naturally it should all fall apart rightapparently there are several editions of sacred
now i dont know about following editions but the first sacred has to have cd  in the drive to play the game
thats so  even blizzard patched starcraft to run without the cd and you can actually go to blizzards website and find the patch
and that totally cuts out playing more than one copy at a time for lan playok so for the price of this game i could buy a couple of copies and still not spend a lot of money but i have a couple of shuttle systems with no cdrom
usually not a problem
i usually just make an iso and mount the image with virtual cdrom softwarelet me tell you a person could probably hack into the pentagon before they could play this game without the original cd  in the drivei thought game play was mildly fun
i think starcraft is funner and not much more expensivebut sacred is ok but when you combine ok with horrible drm especially when you checked ahead of time to make sure this wasnt the case then you get two starsto compare that to starcraft i would probably give it  stars
it is pretty fun also not super expensive and doesnt beat you over the head with drm starcraft ii may be a different storyand one other thing as someone else pointed out
there are patches to this game that take it to plus
they are listed on the games website but they fail when you try to download them
i think they tried to make finding the patches part of the questin fact i think i have spent more time questing for solutions on google for sacred than i have spent playing the game
that right there should tell you somethingi tried hard to like this i really did
the demo was fun but the game itself has a few faults that make it really hard to like
its buggy and unbalanced playing more like a beta than a finished product
two examples  in towns its possible to get random quests that for some reason give no reward on completion
also the respawn rate for enemies is way too high as you can head off on a quest fight your way through various mobs to do so only to find theyve all respawned in the minute or so you were out of the area
hell theyll even respawn while youre buying stuff or getting your nonexistent reward
add that to the complete lack of variation in enemies and you have a fine recipe for a tedious slog as opposed to exciting gameplay
much is made of the promise of future patches but until they arrive the next ones due in june this game is more frustration than you deserve
having said that there is promise here but i would advise waiting until this one gets balanced and out on budgetif you have anything higher than windows xp for your operating system do not bother with this game
no matter how much i tried this game will not work off of anything that is higher than windows xpwarning this game is not for kidsmanhunt for the xbox is a stealth type  game where you have to sneak around hide in shadows and avoid making noise
if youve ever played games like splinter cell or tenchu then you know what im talking about
the twist in manhunt is that you  are playing as a villian
you are playing a game of death with a bunch of psychos and killers
within the game youll hear the voice of a sinister director who tells you what your objective is to complete a level
most of the levels look like abandoned cities
scattered around are killers who want to hunt you down
so you sneak up on them and the longer you remain undetected the more gruesome  your executions becomes
youll see the executions in a type of video sequences
the game is terribly violent and bloody it looks a lot like a slasher movie think friday the th
and this is why the game has a lot of controversy
it is senseless violence and has absolutely no redeeming valueprosgood graphicsgood sound effectsgood difficultybloodycreepy atmospherelots of weaponsconsway too violent no moralsyou play a bad guyyou are underequippedlinear gameplaysingle player gamedoom s graphics engine is amazing
it looks very goodxbox cannot handle the origonal engine very welldoom  on xbox looks terrible and the gameplay is pointless
the only draw for the computer version is the fact that it looks awesome
i does not on xboxits rare that youll find a bad review of a game here at amazon from me but i have to speak up about the woeful beyond divinity
a sequel to the muchheralded divine divinity bd is an amateurish romp through a bunch of static landscapes that holds no value unless you like getting annoyed
the main story line is decent and unique bringing two characters together in a soul bond which causes them to act as one or die together
you control them both and its nice to craft the characters any way you want but limiting it to three basic flavors warrior rogue or wizard is kind of lame and doesnt allow for much customization since youll spend most of your time fighting yourself to decide which items to carry to alleviate your encumbrance
yawnthe dialogue is awful esp
the deathknight under your control and i really dont need to hear from every imp i encounterthe game tries to be diablo much like the first divine divinity but it just doesnt have the polish that blizzard puts into all of its titles
the battlegrounds feature is a complete distraction from the main storyline and because its randomly generated you may find yourself trudging on and on in a dungeon only to realize the item you seek is in the third level of another dungeon in that same acts battlefield
blahinventory management graphics sound and overall gameplay really hamper this game from being any fun
i suggest diablo ii if you like hack n slash rpgs on the pc or if you have a console the champions of norrath or baldurs gate dark alliance series are very well donedespite the  price tage save your money and look elsewherei bought this game on the grounds that it was a survival horror game that took place in japan
i like asian horror and the supernatural elements that follow in that genre
sure this game featured zombies which are by this point a staple of the western surival horror tradition but i was willing to take my chances
i liked the idea of a lonely mountain village whose waters turned to blood during a ceremony every year only to turn the inhabitants into braindead creatures of the nightwell while the same atmosphere present in that brief description wasnt entirely lacking from the game it was not the same type of bonechilling spookiness that i was hoping for
in fact the gameplay ended up being pretty tedious and i found myself getting increasingly aggravated as i played rather than creeped outdont count on a lot of variation in any given level when your character dies and needs to restart at the beginning
and you will diea lot
the levels start out relatively tense but quickly devolve into predictable algorithms when you learn where your enemies are located and how quickly theyre going to lumber to another spot so you can run to another location and hide
perhaps its presumptuous for me to be judging the game on these parameters when every single other game ever released also had enemies that are located in a given area who have a preconceived attack pattern etc but its a little different when you dont plan your dash andor attack just right and the armed zombies spin around and shoot you with a hunting rifle from sixty feet away
gee whiz
thanksyou have no option but to play level one as one character and the next as whatever other character the game wants you to be and the next as a different character again completely chosen by the game and so and and so forth in that fashion until you get annoyed and turn off your console
its all laid out in an extremely easytouse visual grid thing with lots of colors and baffling halfrectangle shapes indicating that two characters had their own individual zombie conflicts on a particuler night and it all makes for a wonderfully maddening confusing mess that is sure to leave you ready for more runningandhidingbeforegettingshotinthebackoftheheadbecauseyoudidntseethatzombieinthebushesbehindyou fun
in addition the game also features a cast of  different playable characters which ensures that you will have  different people you wish would stop trying to voice act and just die alreadyits pretty moot to even mention it by this point but the voice acting is terrible
this can be said for about  percent of games but even so this voice acting is particularly insulting
daddy let me be a character in one of your video games
well all right but only if you promise to not emote or sound good ever
the good thing that i can say about this game is that the sightjacking ability is a revolutionary and peculiar idea that we dont see pop up in games all that often
that doesnt mean that its particularly useful for gameplay since you probably wont be able to make it through a level in only one try but hey its a novelty and ill take itif you are going to bother with this game at all id advise using your sightjacking capability and seeking out the patrol pattern of all the zombies in a given area even if they eventually find their way over to you and kill you while youre just standing there reading their minds
at least this way you know where theyre going to walk and how long it takes them to do it
so when you start over at the beginning of the levelwhich again you will be doing several timesyou can have a better idea of which route is the safest to escapeif dying that often and painstakingly figuring out where these clunky lobotomy patients are going to walk next doesnt sound like a great time to you though you might want to skip it
if youre looking for a good asian horror title i cant possibly recommend the fatal frame series to you enough but then if youre looking into siren youve probably already played those and are looking for something similar to fill the survival horror void inside of youand no siren aint itthe game sounded fun and looked scary from videos
i am a fan of any horror surviver game
but this one was quite disappointing
this game is very hard to play
some missions will take you like  times to do over and over untill you get it right if you even know what your suppost to be doing in the first place
i wish they would of focused more on horror surviving with a clear objective putting their work in making this game in to trying to really scare you
not wondering around unsure most of the time where to go or what to do
mele is bad in this game and can get frusturating dying over and over again from the unscary zombie villagers
this game could of been so much better if it wasnt a jappanese solve puzzle walk around with bad british voice overssony gave it a good try but the game is too frustrating
the story begins with part of the japanese landscape gone to hell
the population has been turned into killer zombies called shibito and you have to survive and find out what happened to the town
you can quotsightjackquot so you can see through the eyes of the shibito which is pretty scary but you really dont care because as soon as your starting to get emotionally invested with your character you switch to another one
the accents do not fit the characters and the color palettes used in the game a very drab looking
be prpared to die and restart alot
silent hill  the suffering and fatal frame  are better choicesthis game had so much hype surronding it when it was released  sure the graphics are good  blah blah blah  but the gameplay  had lots of bugs and control  issues as well  it felt like it was rushed  to be sold alongside the original trilogy dvd set last year  this game is made strictly for the online gamer as you can tell  which is sort of unfair because there are people that do not like playing games online  such as myself i dont relish having some dippy kid or moron  screaming in my ear saying stupid things as im trying to unwind playing a gamei tried playing this game on my own and it was no fun at all  i put mine up on ebay and got my cash back  now fast forward to  november st   we got the revenge of the sith dvd on sale  and bam
star wars battlefront  on the same day
im going to rent this game first and see whats up with itit looks good dont get me wrong  but im jaded from the first onealthough one major improvemrnt  is that they actually have a single player storyline where you can play as a stormtrooper in vaders elite st legion  which should be fun  and  interesting  also you can play as vader yoda and classic characters  but im hoping this is true and not the  you have to finish the whole game and then surprise 
they are unlockablethats very misleading  its this kind of  crap that the developers pulled on the  ultimate spider man gameand it had alienated a lot of gamers on that title  i hope that dosent happen here  with this onebut it wont surprise me if they pull this  besidestheres always cheat codes i supposestar wars battlefront  should have been released as a launch day game for the new x box  system  i mean its only a few weeks away  this could have been the first next gen star wars game in short  if you have to pick up this game  try getting it used for a lower priceor try  renting it  its not worth the  plus dollars  and as for battlefront i suggest that you rent it first before you buy itlet the buyer bewarei used this headset daily over a several month period away from home
movies music gaming web chat with the family i did it all
before i returned home i happily gave this headset away not because im a nice guy but beacuse i didnt want to wear them ever againthe headset was returned to me the next daythe sound and microphone quality is good thats not the problem
theyre uncomfortable
i couldnt get through a standard length movie without getting sore spots on the tops of my ears and the side of my head above my ears
i tried bending the headset wider though i dont think my head is abnormally large id reposition the headset to give relief to the pressure points on the side of my head
id keep my skype calls short just to avoid wearing the headsetdo you get my point yet
these are uncomfortable
dont buy them find something else
im now using alogitech gaming headset g blackand love it  long gaming sessions calls and movies are no longer a problem though its in a higher price range than this setkeep searching  this isnt the headset youre looking forfrom all that i read of this game i thought it was going to be great
i played and beat the original tales of phantasia and liked it alright
this game i couldnt make it twenty minutes in
five minute in and i was laughing out loud at the horrible dialogue and vague backstory
heres a samplecharacter  the desians have broken the nonaggression treaty
me  wait the desians are threatening the entire planet have a human ranch right next to you you have the chosen onethe one destined to destroy them allin your village  and you have a nonaggression treaty with them
i also loved how when the desians attack the village the villagers all run and hide abandoning all the kids in school  yet the kids dont even notice the raid go through town anywaywhat else is there to say about it
the story is completely boring characters uninteresting the graphics look alright until you get the closeups which come out incredibly blurry the gameplay is little more than buttonmashing the menu system is confusing you wonder why there isnt any voice acting in the animatedfacecutscene things even though the voice actors are barely tolerable the text is hard to read a lot of the time  im having a hard time coming up with anything good to say about itwant another example of bad dialoguecharacter elves are pretty cool but halfelves are scary
yeah screw dem halfbreeds
i swear this game is chalk full of hilariously bad dialoguethis game is about ww  in the pacific as the title indicates
in this game you follow  your character from pearl harbor to the southern most point on the japanese islands
the major downpoint of this game is that you are more watching a movie instead of actually playing a video game
although you get some good playing time in it isnt completely worth having to watch the videos inbetween playing timemy sys specs pfsb ram  gb ddr  card  radeon xse pci express mbyet i had to turn down the video settings
the gameplay didnt make up for the demanding sys req
choppyjerkyslow gameplay and the graphics werent all that great
mohpa almost brought my machine to a slideshow gaming experiencei have virtually nothing running in the background  turned down my desktop resolution to xgames like line of sightvietnam deadly dozenpacfic theater and marine sharpshooter  jungle warfare all did a nice job with junglefoliage while keeping the sys req within reasona good reason to play midway arcade treasures  but still not quite good enough
primal rage on its own is also available for the original sony playstation sega genesis windows computer and other platforms without all the other crappy games included
primal rage is the only reason to even want to put this game in your console
primal rage features prehistoric creatures fighting in a good and overall way better version of mortal kombats combo system with a descent plot  graphics that are smooth  impressive for their time
mortal kombat was is and will always be an overrated pile of garbage that has only gotten way worse over time and is the exact opposite of a good and fun game particularly like primal ragethe rest of the games will only remind you why midway is no long in business
how midway stayed in business at all is a total mystery
even when playing on the easiest difficulties these game become way too hard way too soon  you just wont have any chance to survive
in the past more dying meant spending more money to continue more money for midway at the arcades
it seems you cant goes more than a few seconds without dying or having great difficulty playingplaying these games now is just a mute point achieving nothing but annoyance or anger
robotron smash tv spy hunter mortal kombat  mortal kombat   the list of horrible  overrated junk just goes on  on with midway arcade treasuressome games are mildly entertaining at first but when you finally do play one of those it usually soon becomes repetitive and boring to play like rampagedont bother to pick up midway arcade treasures  or    for that matter unless you currently dont have primal rage for anything elsewhat a waste of moneypretty graphics but not as good as they should have been and great musicstiff gameplaymore like the sims really than a role playing action gamei enjoyed the goodevil choices much much more in star wars kotor and i enjoyed the customization features in gtasa way way more than this lame duckfirst off after many complains of this game not being the best rpg as the maker claimed it would be my expectations then became very littlethe story is good
i assume all you know the story of you village being burn blah blah blah  and also about you either becoming good or evilthe graphics are just great looking some good stuffthe voiceovers fit also goodthe music is somewhat bad well the music fits the game but after playing it for some hours the music just gets a litte annoyingthe controls are really great after some missions i finally mastered the batte systemnow with all that said let me go with the bad stuffthe story was great but barely gets good in the last  or  missions and should have got my attention for the whole game
for example most missions are kill this and rescue that and in the last missions you actually get the feeling that the world of fable is uniquethe voiceovers fit with the people but come on with the rescue missions they dont have to talk every  seconds
and sometimes i just had to but mute cause of those rescue missionsthe controls work very nicely and also we all should know that in fable there are swords  axe  bow etc
and in battle it was pretty much pressing the x and b button and comeon whats with that
even with the spells that make the game better the maker said we can be whatever we want and i am a big fan of just hacking slashing people but this game makes it so boringthey should look at ninja gaiden that was fun cause you had all these combos and stuff to do this game was rated m so then easily they could have put chopping body parts up and special moves like in your control when you want not just the x then the b buttonand even though there were a lot of various of enemies sometimes it just got plain dumb from the number of enemies you had to fight in a roomthis game is short and i would recommend to talk to everyone and do all stuff cause after finishing this game you might wont replay this game which i am actually doing just cause i am bored  and cause i lost my warcraft againverdict  out of  really fun but has a lot more flaws than i mention so that it can be a game that competes with games like warcraft
this is a mustrent and after you pass and think you are interest probably but it
but a great game though after allwhen i bought this game i thought that it would contain at least  hours of gaming
geeze was i wrong
i got maybe  hours out of this and that was with discovering like every possible thing you could do in the game
i will try to be as unsubjective as possible
this was supposedly a groundbreaking new rpg that was going to be amazing
first the good points
the customizability of the game is pretty cool and the types of armor swords and skills was definitely more than i expected
another thing that i really liked was that you could make your guy physically larger
now for the bad news
the graphics in general left me with a n feeling instead of xbox and came off as cartoonish with the large hands and feet
the only thing that was detailed was the main character
everything else was quite pixelated
secondly the ease at which i beat this game was unprecedented
quite possibly one of the easiest games i have ever played
and the story was pretty unoriginal
the thing that dissapointed me the most was this could have been an excellent knight type of rpg if it was 
 times longer  the graphics had a significantly larger amount of time put into them  if it wasnt so closed in with the area you could explorethen it would have been an excellent gamei admit that i am not far at all into this game
i know it has a whole heck of a lot more to it than i have seen so far
and i will come back to it and play it again
but just for what i have seen so far it does not impress me
the graphics the feel of driving its bicycles and cars the pesky police everywhere i go none of it seems all that good and none of it makes me want to come back for morei have tried all the d gta games and the only one that i really liked is gtathe one thing that does interest me about san andreas is its lead character
the story that plays out at the beginning the things he goes through early in the game i really care about this character and will play more to see how he fares
but i am not sure i will like it that much
none of the features i have heard of sound that great
i am a country music fan and i dont even like the country radio station that much
dont get me wrong i am sure there is much much more to this game than i know
but i dont think that what i have seen is going to keep me coming back long enough to discover iti thought this was a great controller when i first bought it
it worked great and it seemed indestructable
for the price it should be
this is from logitechs own websitequality construction that stands up to serious punishmentas if youd expect anything else from logitechi guess i must possess superhuman strength and this does not apply to me
ok so what happened is one of the joysticks broke
not broke off but whatever was holding it onto the innards of the pad was damaged and the stick was just loose enough to be diffcult to use
yea maybe i got a faulty one you say
well this happened twice with two different controllers
so i took it apart to see what went wrong
looking at the actual stick attachment design reveals the issue
it could have been easliy prevented by using a material other than plastic for attaching the stick
i just look at this and shake my head
this problem is not limited to logitech though the original ps controllers have the same problem
this is the weakest link in these controllers in my opinion
if they offered replacement parts i wouldnt be too upset but the fact that i have to buy a whole new controller is just disgusting
the other issue is that the tops of the sticks are just not sticky enough
maybe add a thumb harness
i dont know but the engineers should think of something
i saved the working stick from the two broken units if i buy another one of these at least i have spare partsthis controller broke just a few days after i bought it
its a piece of junkbought a wireless and loved it for the few weeks it worked until the joystick broke
bought another one and guess what
it not only broke but in the same place
this one lasted a few weeks as wellthe controller worked great for a very long time
it was quick responsive and wireless
al was fine until the analog stick is constantly shown to be sticking left
if you tape the stick to the right it still works fine
not happy thoughfirst off the story is confusing you start the game as the marked one and thats about all the information you receive
you basically start running around following the arrow on your map people speak to you in russian while you read what they say from a prompt if they have anything useful to say
the graphics are decent but thats about it
aiming is cumbersome to say the least if you want to zoom in your gun takes up the bottom part of the screen and makes aiming useless
picking up items is annoying with having to take all and drag and drop any unwanted items or you can drag and drop each single item
the maps  tasks window is also somewhat confusing
its just not time well spent you would be much better off picking up fallout  or any number of fps games insteadthis game was said to have been much more than it is
in concept its neat
in application it utterly failed
it could have been so much more than it actually is and that is the source of my frustration
it has a very neat world decent atmosphere at times and kind of a twist on fpsthe problems are immensethe graphics engine is out of date and still manages to grind my setup to a halt
my system runs most any fps in high resolution with everything turned up  and barely runs stalker with everything turned down
unbelievablethe quest structureimplementation is completely broken
utterly
if you can even figure out what to do some of the time youll be lucky if you dont fail a quest without explanation only to reload do the same thing and complete the quest
the scripted events are crucial to your progression through the game but can easily be derailed by quest failurethe enemy respawing is just ridiculous
theyll randomly respawn right in front of you
endless groups of enemies just appear near you
you can clear an area walk a ways turn around and theres another giant group of enemiesenemies can hone in on you and fire accurately and incredible ranges while you cant even see them
apparently bandits have night vision implanted into their skulls and have entire areas of the land wired with motion sensitive alarms  because you cant creep three inches if one is within a hundred meters without being seen or heardthe patch  for the love of god  do not install it if youve already started playing
it invalidates all previous save games
its also a mostly multiplayer patch and has almost no value for a single player personits amazing what the software industry gets away with selling for money these days
if you enjoy lots of build up with sudden aggravating let downs then this is the game for you
if you enjoyed serious sam but desire the pretense of a tactical shooter sorta then this game is for youpersonally id much rather enjoy just spending my money on a cheese grater to which i could apply liberally to tender parts of my body update i wish i could go back and change the star rating for this game
i feel i was a bit rash but the things i stated above are essentially still valid
i would give the game  stars overall with a  star fun ratingoverall fun i dont feel right about the serious sam comparison  that was just such a violently crappy game  and i apologize to stalker
  please stalker will you take me backthe first  of the game can be very frustrating but it is worth bearing with
the game really takes off once you reach a certain point and while it still has problems is worth the play
the maps get increasingly cooler and complex the environments are amazing
its too bad the economy in the game isnt too substantial
theyve patched the game a few times since i originally played it and those patches have much improved the entire experience  tweaks bug fixes changes etc
ive completed the game many times and each time i enjoy it
the fact that the game has alternative endings is also a plusoverall a good game of considerable length and depth and while it has its share of irritations and problems is worth the journeywalk around
die of radiation
walk around
die of radiationthis game is too complicated like bioshock to be enjoyable
game makers should take cues from halflife crysis and cod  which are exciting but you dont have to read the manual over and over and over and still not figure it outthis game sucksits a primitive game with lame graphics
not what was expected
thought the game would be fun and modern buts its lame boring and the graphics look like pixels
lame has got to be the worst year for games
two words for stalker
junk code
typically im very much against reviewing a game based on how well it runs because the technical shortcomings of ones own system should not define the quality of the game itself
alltooften we see reviewers on amazon rate a game badly simply because they dont know a thing about gaming or pcs in general
we all know and loathe these types because they unfairly give a game a bad rating when the actual problem is them  not the gameanyway with that out of the way i have to say stalker demonstrates a discouraging trend in current game development
games are becoming so dependent on apis and canned code that programmers no longer have to be programmers
game engines like bioshock and stalker make this all too evident
ive seen these games run on some of the best systems out there and what people dont realize is they still dont run the way they shouldstalker  like bioshock  has the feel of a badly moded engine
no matter how good your system is you will experience problems and strange ones at that because what you have here are game engines that are moded beyond their capabilities
its almost as if these companies said hey lets take doom or hl shove as much of the latest and greatest apis into it give it a storyline and sell itby the way for those who dont know what an api is its essentially huge junks of prewritten code
a lot of the lighting effects and physics in these games are apiseven if the apis are well written a team who relays to heavily on them brings to question their technical prowess
all the bugs in the finished game reveal the lack thereof
do you recall bioshocks constant bsod stalker does it too
there are also memory leaks in fdl
the problems are documented and the company actually suggests using community mods to fix the problem as well as installing rd party freeware openal drivers
wowto describe the game itself movement is chunky the environments looked tinselly and floaty and the character animations are not fluid or natural looking at all even with a high fpsthe story seemed cool but who cares really
i want good optimized code
story is tertiary no matter what people try to sell me on
give me good code
the future of game development is here and it does indeed look bleakthe rpgs ive played this year are listed order in other words mass effect  is the bestmass effect fallout new vegasdeus exjust cause bio shock stalker chernobyl is by far the worst of this list
i found the controls below average graphics not that great and the overall play labor intensive instead of fun
the most annoying part of the game is how long and difficult it is to get anywhere in the game
it made me wish for the ability to move through the world like you can in fallout nv
also the autosave wouldnt work for me
perhaps i didnt give the game enough time to grow on me i think i only put in  total hours
on the plus side you dont have to use steam which i freaking hateto playload the game
im sure others will disagree with me but for my time and money there are better games to playmy pc specsamd phenom ii x  gb ramwin  home premium bitamd radeon hd  gb gddrstalker shadow of chernobyl fails as both an rpg and a shooter in my opinion
i played roughly  hours of this game and put it down unable to take any more of it
this game consists of bland lifeless graphics an awful lot of running around in large open areas little action in terms of combat and little in the way of dialog or story
actually its hard to see what this game has going for it at allthe inventory system in this game is incredibly annoying
your inventory starts weighing you down after picking up only a few guns
as a result the game saps your endurance quite fast effectively slowing you down to a crawl
if youve played neverwinter nights the concept is similar to how in that game loot made you become encumbered except in this game this happens absurdly quickly
now consider the fact that you have vast distances to cover between each objective or scene in the game and you should quickly realize what an incredible annoyance this can bedue to this and a few other factors the large open areas in this game as opposed to the comparatively linear level design of games like halflife and halflife  result in a whole lot of time spent running around and a lot less time spent in dialog scenes or combat
some games manage to pull off having a bigger and more open game environment
unfortunately this isnt one of themif you want a good shooter game steer clear of this
go play anything from the halflife series
any of the halflife games are outstanding examples of fps excellence
they all have an interesting story setting and keep you interested all the way through to the very end and beyond with gutwrenching action flawless gameplay and intriguing storylinesif you want a good shooterrpg mass effect and bioshock have this game beaten by miles
they contain infinitely more interesting storylines far more interesting action and dialog and the graphics are stunningly realistic with vibrant colors as opposed to the kind of blocky and bland offering stalker serves uphonestly id rather be replaying mass effect bioshock or the halflife series than play this game despite the fact that ive already played these games several times over now
do yourself a favor and get any of these other games instead
you wont regret it if you enjoy thinking mans shootersi was going to write something clever like one word review  uninstall
but thats not really fair so heres what i really think
and i should preface this by saying that i do tend to be turned off by games that are rough around the edges
glitchy ui etc
will frustrate me and eventually ill stop playing  thats just me
so having read other reviews i probably should have known better than to take my chances with stalkeranyway theres a lot to like here but its mainly in the way of recognizing what the game is trying to be rather than what it actually isas far as what actually works the sense of vulnerability in a wideopen hostile environment with lots of enemies and realistically fallible weapons its great and probably whats earning the undeserved
 official ratings everywhere
this much starts out a little frustrating but grows on you as you catch the learning curve
theres a real challenge here that blends action and strategy very wellbut thats about all that works
the visuals are pretty lame on my g athlon  nvidia based system because dynamic lighting is out of the question
anything other than static lighting yields frame rates down around  fps
thats not a typo
sound is sometimes effective but mix and positioning are often confused ie
is that ground cover shuffling under my feet or machine gun fire in the distance
who knowsthe rest is really really broken
and im sure some of it works in some measure because a lot of people are toughing it out and really enjoying themselves
and thats great
but if theres a core story line that makes sense for the very patient it is absolutely buried in content that makes no sense whatsoever
i would write this off as bad translationlocalisation but it is not merely that the dialog is hard to comprehend
its also that missions begin and end fail more often than not with no apparent reason
when there is an apparent reason  ie
an npc is completely incompetent  its every bit as frustrating
the pda and especially the map are very nonintuitive to navigate
maybe it works but not as id expect not even the nd or rd way id expect
i could go on and onthe final dealbreaker for me was the dreaded inventory page
the game is challenging so youll hate to leave valuables namely ammo and the weapons to deliver it behind
but you will be forever burdened and wondering what to keep what you can afford to leave behind
the inventory screen that pops up when you loot a corpse is marginally different than the standard one not so much that you wont constantly forget and it somehow makes the process of looting a corpse and unloading the precious bullets from his weapon and then unburdening yourself so you can actually ahem walk very very tedious and frequently deadly
but maybe thats ok since most other loot is useless
artifacts offer tradeoffs that can consistently be reduced to  using this item will improve armor slightly but also kill you slowly
hmm trick question
and saving things for resale is also pointless since as many have bemoaned the games economy is nonexistent
there are few vendors with nearly nothing of interest and currency is mostly a nonconcernothers have complained that the faction system is broken that the game and the npcs do not react any differently based on your interactions with others
i cant confirm or deny because im never sure whos friend or foe until the first shot has been fired
at me
and thats every bit as much fun as it sounds
and then sometimes im still not suresigh
i really wanted to like this game
i already spent the money already wasted a weekend and on top of all of that its a very cool concept
but theres more bad than good here plain as that
this game didnt leave me feeling like a stalker
so much as a su  you get the ideacouple things make this game unjoyablei like the world of chernobyl  worth the price of the game but its not like other fps its anoying that they could fix this stuff if the company would release patch to fix the hit detection of the weaponsthe ai weapons are longer range and take less bullets to kill you you forced to fire sevel shoots to the head close range forget about the sniper rifles they are dum takes too many shots to kill  i scoped a head shot and enemy ai has a crap pistal and killed me hundred feet away wtfread some of the other bad reviews on the web and here
i wish i had
i played this game all the way through on xp and vista
for now if you are running vista without a patch specifically to fix the vista issues you had best skip this game
even on xp it is a rough ride
at times it did good and other times it drives you nutsit is buggy as hell
i tried running this on  different gaming computers that i have
all are top of the line screaming machines
one runs twin s in sli mode
another has just a simple  gt
it runs ok if you turn the settings way down
yuck
the graphics are not that good turned all the way up
lolthe latest patch has made a huge difference
before that this game ran like garbage
it crashed for no reason saves got corrupted
those problems still happen not as much thoughthe game play
well you only have one way to play the gameup close and personal until you get half of the way through
then you get some decent weapons
if you dont shoot the head and if you dont do it close your enemy most likely will not die
very annoying after the first  times you do thatthe graphics are completely outdated
you can tell they have been working on this game for  yearsif anyone thinks this game is better than hl fear or far cryyou have got to stop doing drugs
now i will say that the concept is great and some of the ideas and obstacles in this game are great
stalker will be seen as what could have been but didnt quite get there
hopefully this group will get to make a sequel and get it rightgood graphics and a pretty faithful rendering of the war hammer k universe are the only positive things i can say about this gamethe games interface is simple which is usually good but it lacks a lot of functionality that is necessary in controlling a larger battlefield with more than one force deployed at once
there are no hot keys for toggling between different unit groups and more importantly there is no way to speed or slow the passage of time
this makes it very difficult in hectic battles to manage the production of units and control multiple armies in the field and very boring at the end of levels when you are just trying to clear enemy units from the field
the only way to play the game is to create an army and then follow it as it moves around the boardin fact the only reason the game is beatable is that the levels are so easy
with a medium sized cadre of standard space marines and a couple missilelaunchers a player can clear even the final level
this negates the need to build most advanced structures as the most powerful unit or at least the most powerful unit you will ever need can be built with simply a chapel and an armory
in fact the only reason to build the more advanced units are the ever annoying puzzle levels where you must make the unit with some special ability like the ability to jump or teleport over a crevice in order to defeat some ridiculously weak enemy
hence most of the difficulty comes from figuring out how to build a unit that can teleport rather than defeating the enemy which seems to have no ai at all but rather just creates roaming adversaries
i never needed to save more than once and could usually play a level straight through beginning to end including the final level which is actually one of the easiestalso without going into the mechanics of game play too much resource gathering is so tedious that it is more time effective to just take the few strategic markers inside your base then go make a sandwich dont worry there is no danger of an enemy attack while resource points accrue than to undertake the difficult process of taking and developing markers in the field
also there is not much point in gathering too many resource points as there is a finite number of units you can field at one time and they almost never dieits frustrating that in the  years since dune ii rtss actually seem to have regressedi know ive slammed this game pretty hard but there is one more thing i need to mention
the writing both for during game play and in the cut scenes is awful i know im being a hypocrite since this review has a pretty good schemer of runons and sentence fragments
even for the wh k universe which is pretty complex the characters in the cut scenes seem to have no internal momentum but just come into conflict because well the game needs conflict i still have no idea why the eldar and empire fight each other as their greater enemy is chaos but oh wellall in all the game is a big disappointmentim one of the biggest dynasty warriors nuts on the face of the earth so i tend to follow most of koeis games when egm reports them they really need to make a gitaroo man sequelsamurai warriors sounds like a great idea take the massivescale actionstrategy of dynasty warriors and put it in tokugawa shogunateera japan
but not all is wellthe levels and especially characters in the game just flat out bore me to death
they feel bland and uninteresting compared to the dw cast specifically nobunaga who is a total cao cao clone and keiji maeda a lu bu wannabe
not to mention you can only play as  of them
what the hell
one of the main hooks of dynasty warriors is its  playable characters so a huge chunk of the replay value is torn outanother annoying feature is your allies
simply put they are  useless
every dw game seems to lower the fighting capabilities of your army a little more but this time they just went way too farthis game really does feel like it was made to cash in on the popularity of the dw series
of course the classic hack n slash gameplay is still present but what good does it do when everything around it feels uninspiredconsidering the hype and sys spec req i was expecting gameplay  graphic enjoyment wrong
just another fps
nothing special and at times very frustratingwow
paid about  for this and even that small amount wasnt worth it
out of the  or so fps games ive played men of valor is one of the worst
i have to go way back to igi before i find a game this badfirst the good
the music is finenow the badgraphics  when i first popped this in my rig i thought i had a defective disc
the graphics were awful
i went to the video options and turned everything up to maximum
no difference
i thought i went back to the late s
it reminded me of the first turok game
i was stunned that this was a  effortcharacter models are laughably bad and wooden and they glide across the ground as if the whole environment is made out of ice
it reminded me of my little plastic soldiers i used to play with when i was a child
i just pushed them across the groundstory and characters  the vietnam story is compelling and the various cut scenes with footage which gives a minihistory lesson on the war is okay
but the actual missions in the game are forgetful
the effort to try to connect with shepherd the main character via letters home really doesnt work
in fact i usually cut those off because they became boring very quicklymovement  moving is really awful
you get stuck on just about everything  rocks logs limbs boxes bodies
nothing is moveable
every level is narrowly encased in an invisible barrier
you think you can take a path to flank hostiles only to bump into an invisible wall which blocks that path
only one narrow and lineal predetermined path is allowed and scripted
you cant jump
even the smallest of logs youre locked behind
this is one of the poorest games ive played for trying to traverse the terraingameplay  awful
this is really bad folks
the whole game is about  hours
however at least half of that time is replaying the same thing over and over
save points are far apart and often you will tediously and slowly make your way up a path or river systematically eliminating the hostiles along the way only to find yourself ambushed  which by the way is scripted in there toward the end of every objective and you die very quickly
when you respawn youre all the way back at the beginning of the objective  which sometimes were as far back as  minutes of gameplay
if you try to go any faster the second try youll die so you have to go slowly and systematically through  the same routine all over again
when you get at the hard section you at least know what to expect and you can plan for a counterattack
sometimes however youre not successful on the second try and back you go for another  minutes redo
it became old very quickly
i think the worst one took me about six tries to finally make it though at about  minutes per try
so it took over an hour of playing to work my way through a  minute sectionhaving a challenging objective is one thing
but to have a boring tedious redoing of  minutes of work over and over with objective after objective is absolutely ridiculous
the result was a game that just wasnt fun
in fact it was painfully frustrating and boring
i think the developers wanted to make a game that evoked the reality of the vietnam war
but the result was a game that wasnt fun to playoverall   out of   men of valor makes my top  worst fps games of all timei really like the yelling in vietcongfunny stuff gets boring not very hard to beati stop playing after i beat  levels nothing interesting in this titlethis game sure gives me the feeling of been there done that in its gameplay
i am refering to medal of honor and call of duty except those games had a decent gamesave feature
here you have to wait for the game to automatically save itself because you cant
the result is that when youre killed you must replay the same action again and again until you get it right and can proceed
it even has the little compass so youll know which direction to go which is only another way of saying that this is a super linear game
it might appear to be a great big jungle for you to explore but there is really only one way for you to go
this copycat game can be fun at times but the feeling of dejavu transcends the experience
this game is completely unoriginal and if you really want to try it just wait for the price to drop before you get itbut unfortunately it turned into one of the biggest disappointments this year
the original larry games were fun and witty in a genius way
i guess sierra was afraid of creating a new adventure game
instead they created a bunch of retarded minigames that you have to play over and over again
arghthere is fun to be had with this game
if you can get past the bad gameplay you will actually encounter very funny details
whether or not you make it there before getting completely pissed of is a different question
and you should expect a much more simplistic sort of humor than in the original gamesthe problem with the mini games is that they are not just boring repetitive and dumb but they also come with controls that are just plain bad
when you lose your rd trampoline bouncing game just because the keyboard input is implemented badly then i guarantee that you will hardly be motivated to see more digital boobiesthis is about the worst they could have done with this license
the recent months have been great for video games with huge leaps forward in terms of frustrationelimination and general quality
this game however is a huge step back in both departments
probably the end of the larrygames for goodok i got to admit i like a lot of the jokes in this game
i thought some of the conclusion scenes after youve hit on one of the ladies for a certain amount of time
some of them were really perverted which either came across really funny or not or clean humor like when the mob is after youthats all of the game i really liked the rest of it well it aint a action game
if it was a game like that then maybe i wouldve liked it like the des blood or whatever in japan which included nudity sequences with resident evil gameplay but this game you guide a little sperm thing into the smiley faces to say the right thing then you play a minigame like quarters or grabbing worthless junk to achieve some dumb task that the girl youre hitting on needsthe graphics too are a little corny
why would you make it cartoonish if its a game about nudity and going to bed with a girl
you can even unlock nude pictures
sounds great on paper right but its not one of the models they show on the loading screen its their digitilized self
i guess its because sierra was worried that children might play this but thats why we have a rating scale
i am a little surprised how much they did get away with to keep the m rating anything worse and it couldve been rated aoi also found the controls to be a little clunky in the dance mini games i would press the button right when it said but i got it wrong making me have to repeat the mini game over and overdo you hate games that have looong loading times this game has a ton of them
you walk into a building loading walk up and talk to a girl for a date loading walk out of the main campus to the greek quad loading
it gets real annoyingi havent played the originals but i really dont want to after playing this game
if you dig games that are just made up of minigames that have clunky controls then this game is perfect
the only other crowd i can think of that would like this game are perverts or people who want to have a little fun but cant get a date in real life and even they might want to stay away from this gamehaving played law and order double or nothing i was looking forward to the next part entitled law and order justice is served
i notice a few changes new usage of cell phone replaced actorsactresses a change of inventory buttons a different way of questioning and longer game play
for that latter part thats where the fault lies
the longer law and order justice is served is the more boring it gets
i actually forgot what the case was all about during the sleuthing and i forgot who elena was
thats how boring the game actually was
there were too much pointandclick ridiculous puzzles and too much subplots that had me going in a labyrinth maze
i got tired of some dead end moments so i resorted to a strategy guide to get me through to the end because i didnt have the heart to care about the game just wanted to beat it and move on
all in all law and order justice is served turned out to be chore that is no fun
as for the cd it worked well for me except for a couple of occasional shutdowns so i had to save the game from time to time just in case
one odd thing occured during the lawyer part where missus breaks and enters or is it unbreaks and enters
in a storage space rented by an individual aint that against the law and not to mention unethical
i noticed a spelling mistake by the lawyer during the case judgement instead of judgment
come on this is poorsomething tells me being on the show isnt as difficult as playing this game
the controls are sloppy theres no easy way just to get into the game and play you have to jump through some serious hoops to get far in this gamemy review has mild spoilersive never played the first two lo games so i cannot compare justice is served with them but i can compare it to other adventure games
i didnt find the game interesting at all and i thought it was really cumbersome
unless i missed something in order to save a game the player has to access the menu select save choose a spot for the game there were only about a dozen save slots press save which brings up the menu again and then select resume game
thats an awful lot of steps when youre like me and saving every couple minutes
there is no autosave feature which would have made the process easierbut the whole save issue wouldnt be a big deal if i had liked the game
i just didnt find it interesting to spend most of the game asking people questions
many questionsanswers led to a new location to visit but when you get there there isnt much to do  minimal exploration you find only a few hotspots and not all on them are relevant and the puzzles are incredibly easy
find something locked and youll find the answer on an item you found at a hotspot  almost always at the same location you find the puzzle
the only puzzle i had a problem with was a musical onei got as far as the court room but the accused ended up being acquitted and i just didnt care enough to return to a saved game and retry the case
for me there just wasnt enough content to make the game interesting
i had just finished playing myst iii before playing justice is served so it is rather difficult to top that for gameplaybattlefront could have been released about a year ago and it would have been great
as it is today when compared with the likes of joint operations its fairthe graphics are decent but by todays standard they look dated
the sound is fine if not a little buggythe gameplay well lets just say i wish they could have combined galaxies and battlefront to make a complete gameim a big joint operations typhoon rising fan
i like everything about it
is it perfect
no
but damned near close
and heres a shocker ive never played battlefield whateveryouwanttocallit
some of my friend have played the entire battlefield series and said battlefront is almost as good as the starwars mod someone came up with for bf  pretty sad huhso why the letdown
its all about the marketing
the hype around the release of the screwedup dvds was just enough to help sell a bunch of toys legos and yes computer games that were probably ready to go out the door a year agoill probably see the last movie next year if im still in the us but itll probably be the last of my money that george will seeuntil lucasarts decides to release a windowsxplonghorn version of xwing fighter or tie fighter i think im done with starwars games
and to think lucasarts cancelled sequels to sam  max and full throttle to push this dated piece of crap
i bought this game because im still a stupid starwars fan but im not sure how much longer that will be the casethis is a warning to fans of other first person shooters fpsthis game does not live up to the hype
myself being a big fan of the quakeunrealbattlefieldcall of duty and their related mods i found this game to be very annoying on a number of different levels
if youre new to fpss you probably like the game because you dont know how many better games there are out there on the marketthis game is identical to battlefield  except that instead of fighting wwii style youre fighting al la stormtrooperrebel alliance style
for those who arent familar with battlefield  dozens of free mods exist for this game including a mod called galactic conquest which takes the wwii style game play and changes it to the star wars universe sound familari cant deny that the graphics are very beautiful in this game and way ahead of battlefield  utilizing direct x  capabilities but at the same time the controls fee awkwardthe gameplay feels a bit slowand the option interface makes me want to smash my keyboard changing your key bindings should not take a half hour because the interface is poorthis past weekend a group of us about  played this game at a lanparty for a couple hours
we eventually got sick of it and went back to play what we consider more fun games call of dutys revolt mod desert combat unreal tournament  because this game just got old quickmy advice
save some money go buy battlefield  about  if you dont have it already
go to fileplanet and dowload the galactic conquest mod for freewell i bought this game because of the  average rating from  reviews
i totally dont get it
multi player has one thing ctf
what is that
multi player is the only part of this game that is even close to good
the single player sucks
the ai is not smart at allwhat a dud
love empire earth
still play it
ee doesnt even come close
more like rise of nations which i hate toothey didnt even include their classic all your base are belong to us in it
if you want a great game get ee
if you want to try ee wait a few months and pick it up for a song
trust me you wont be sorry you waitedok so i could not believe in the bad press until i played through this game myself
this is the first sh game i didnt really enjoy
there is so much that is just wrong with it that it starts to overtake that which is new or innovative
basically you play through  generic levelsthen you get to struggle through the same identical  levels with a limping companion who gets injured easily and who gravitates into conflicts with invincible enemies i am not kidding
some of the monstersghosts are creepy the first time you see them which is saying something seeing how you dont encounter them in the dark with a flashlight but lack the originality of sh or sh and have seemingly nothing to do with the storyline
the story is a rehash of seven morphed with nightmare on elm street with a main villain who is about as scary as some trendy something actor playing a serial killer in any boring something neohorror flick not to mention henry
your room is an interesting and engaging concept but doesnt equate to what the spralling town of silent hill did for sh  sh
lastly there is the soundtrack
whoever thought to put a weak neometal ballad vocalist and a peter murphy wannabe singing the lamest lyrics ever over the soundtrack needs to seriously explore another direction
on the sh soundtrack it was annoying and embarrassing now it just sucks
konami needs to put quality back into this series no repeating levels no re item system and seriously reconsider the nuances between scary and annoying game playi remember when silent hill  got an xbox port as silent hill  restless dreams and ill tell you right now i was undeniably happy about it 
not only did i lack a ps at the time but i had played a copy of the ps original after playing the xbox port of silent hill  and found that the xbox port was aesthetically better than the original while the game on either system was and still is excellentunfortunately that was with silent hill  only
silent hill  does little to make itself stand out as an xbox port and does very little to improve on its aesthetics something that i feel it was in dire need of along with more competent writers to execute the story in something other than a dull drab boring anticlimactic tone with most of the main characters heroic or not featuring the depth of a shoe string boring hackneyed atmospherics and shoddy game design choicesthe only difference between the playstation  and xbox version is that the xbox version forces you to save games on the xbox hard disk you cant save copies of silent hill  on the portable memory units and you cant copy any of the saves you make
yeah not only does the game try to bore you to death with its apathy and lack of immersion but it also keeps you from storing save games on something other than the consoles hard drive
i guess the only plus side is that the save game image on the xbox has the eye of watchfulness rather than one of the toadstool monsters writhing around in front of a bright pink backgroundthats the only change
its graphically the same the minimalist realtime menu system works the same the sounds are all laughable and pathetic theres no other character you can play as something i wouldve payed good money to do just to spend fifteen minutes playing as someone other than a living piece of drywall in a nappy wig and blue jeans no different lighting effects
just a savegame nitpickyoure still playing the same boring game trying to pass as horrific when you have to deal with idiotic invincible enemies such as ghosts ringu ripoffs rolling wheelchairs and a gun totting hippy in a trench coat trying to come off as a serial killer
youre still cycling through five different drab well lit levels that takes the effects of subtle atmospherics and drives them so hard and heavy into the game its difficult to say your even having fun much less getting terrified youre still playing as some muttfaced emotionless drone who wiggles his butt every time he arms himself and strafes around an enemy letting him mumble ineffective and awkward dialogue and grope any and all blood encrusted women he stumbles across who just so happen to be more underdressed and sexy than the average stripper you still only get a pocketful of firearms that do little to keep the enemies down youre still reading memos written by idiots who forsake continuity and factual errors for the sake of sounding scary in that cheesy jc haunted house kind of way youre still thumbing your way through a game that hardly even tries to be dramatic or immersive until the last three minutes before the final boss fight and youve still got endings and replay value about as pointless as a pair of scissors without a screwthe game is still terrible in its own broken right
if anything i can recommend you get the xbox version of this game for two reasonsa because you dont own a playstation andb because a cheap game deserves a cheap pricewith video games it seems you get what you pay for and with the exception of expansions games that have had the appropriate amount of time and talent put into them are 
so when i saw silent hill  for  i was suspicious
however being a fan of silent hill   never came out for xbox i figured it was worth a try
big mistake and i think it speaks volumes that amazon has already dropped the price by a few bucks only two days after its release
as noted in a previous review the camera angles kill the game
you are constantly looking at your feet your face or walls
if you are lucky enough to see the enemy in front of you you cant see the one behind you until it has already attacked
the attack system is awful too
bullets are useless and it takes about  hits or so with the pipe to kill the enemy
the story is completely derivative with many scenes and effects taken straight out of horror movies like the ring
the first  minutes of the game was one clip after another interspersed with walking around until enough time has elapsed in order to play another clip
saving the game requires running all the way back to the apartment which youll want to do after killing an enemy or two seeing how long it takes to finally leadpipe them to deathotherwise youll find yourself loading up the last save which typically loses you ten or fifteen minutes of work
the game barely breaks out of the one star categories only because the atmosphere and sound is effectively creepy
overall a huge disappointment and one that is headed straight for the bargain bin at ebsremember back in the previous shs where you could actually kill the evil demonsmonstermutants that were terrifying youremember that sense of pride you felt when you dealt the death blow to some hideous looking monstrosity bent on ripping you to shredswell no morethrough the magic of game programmers that have no life and love to use every dirty trick in the book and call it a challengewe are given this terrible back end stink of the sh seriesi cant believe how naive some of the younger gamers are buying into this
this isnt a challengeits just cheating when you cant even fight back and kill your enemies aka ghostsi know ive heard all the talk about the magical sword that will seal away the ghostsfirst of allim wanting to play silent hill not zeldasave all that magical poop for some other foo foo gamestick with the guns blazingknives slashing and clubs bashingsecondthere are only  of the mentioned swords in the game and two of them are for bossesalso alot of the weapons in sh are breakablei guess konami wanted to make it more realistic which i guess explains the whole magical sword thing whateveri dont even need to get into how dumb the whole go back and put your items from your limited inventory into the amazing trunk that can hold everything iswhen theres a fair challengeill take itlike sh this is more like an extension of a level in castlevania the hedge maze levelthe monster chasing after you with the chainsaw can kill youbut you cant kill him only stun him temporarilyid rather play pongwhen you get a series like silent hill your expectations for it are going to be pretty high
but every now and then a famous developing team with a famous series decides to change things around to attract new players and also to mature the series into something different rather than remake the same game
the only problem is that game developers causing a game to mature will often lend themselves to immaturity in lieu of innovation and by handing out a game to new fans their own expectations for the game to deliver any semblance of emotional value said series was responsible for will have died out
all of this lies in the case of silent hill  the room quite possibly the worst fourth game in any series ever conceived next to resident evil  and quite possibly the worst silent hill game ever made featuring the dumbest subtitle ever to support the main one the room
that doesnt sound ominous at all it sounds boring and it isthe room has taken a lot of different steps in order to make itself stand out from silent hill games almost to the point where if you compared the two it would be hard to tell theyre related
the room doesnt depend on thick fog or thicker darkness to establish fear rather it depends on one claustrophobic room pitched in a very dull first person perspective that encounters goofy lowbudget haunted house noises whenever you approach something evil and doesnt inspire any feeling of being trapped despite that sense being pivotal to the plot as well as very large bright and wide open alternate areas that are visited through a hole in the wallthe enemies especially show little semblance to a silent hill game as you fight zombie dogs that scream like monkies and cats whenever they get hurt two headed zombies that make low budget ape noises and tall female zombies in torn miniskirts and bras wielding sticks who burp every time you hit them yes burpyou even run into ghosts who like most video game ghosts are the cheapest overly powered silliest enemies youll ever encounter in a game
every time you get close to them they hurt you
you cant fight them effectively without getting hurt in return even when you do wear special gift store items to guard yourself from them but heres the biggest downer theyre everywhere
theyre like nemesis on that regard in that they follow you everywhere you go
some of them arent even that scary
the one thats set on fire just looks like a guy in black makeup with fake fire around him that causes more slowdown than a dreamcast racing game and one of the ghosts is a huge juonringu ripoff
even weirder is that they all want to kill you for reasons the game never establishes they have no goals they have no purpose theyre dead people why are they here
and why do they all make only one noise when they chase youyoull notice right away that team silent just dug through a low budget sound effects library to deliver the games atmosphere some of the noises youve heard so many times in previous games theyre common place
its not a good sign when the first noise you hear is a scream youve heard in super nintendo and  studios games
but enough technical faults lets get to the aestheticssilent hill has always had a good idea of what a protagonist in a horror game should be like but apparently they ditched that too by replacing the usually charismatic occasionally emotional but well spoken and always empathetic protagonist with a dull mumbling unimaginative stoic idiotic anticlimactic thing
okay maybe im making a big deal about this but im not kidding when i say that the main character in this game wouldve been more poignant and effective if they had replaced him with a piece of card board or a brick or a tree stump
this man is devoid of human emotions
for what reason i dont know
the manual describes him as a boring dude he acts like a boring dude and he never ever gets interesting
of course i cant blame all this on the hero apparently all the other npcs tend to be just as one dimensional but at least some of them were more interesting than the hero and actually had a personality
i personally have never wanted to see a grown man being constantly showered with acetic acid but if its the main character of silent hill  were talking about then tell me where the ticket booth iswell apparently the plot isnt about him or the other characters nono its about someone else
silent hill loved the concept of sympathy for the devil but silent hill  tries something so alien so different and unique that its practically ineffective
dont you hate it in horror media where the writers think it would be really scary if serial killers were winging emo religious long haired super men whose motivation for killing is so crystal clear and perfectly explained that the character doesnt even feel insane
well expect that in silent hill  because the antagonist is all of that and is anything but scary especially when you consider his origins are dependent solely on continuity errors faulty factual assumptions and memos that treat its audience like an idiot
much like the protagonist the antagonist is also a formless emotionless cold lump of clay which makes sense for a killer i guess but does so little to boost empathy for that character despite the fact that the game treats him like a tragic victim of society
personally any antagonist that hounds you throughout levels wielding two pistols who cant actually be killed permanently is the kind of character id rather watch get processed through a pastrami slicerits actually hard to get into how bad the game play is in this game without spoiling the events in the story and considering the game takes place in an entire day the events are so constant and hurried that its practically hard to absorb or even believe any of it but the game design needs elucidation for those who dont know of the lurking horror that is the rooms game playin order to progress in the game you have to shift between reality and  the trade mark other world by going into a hole in your bathroom
while this feature is unique and creepy the first time around being overly exposed to the feature on a minutely basis breaks the atmosphere considering how many times you literally have to go back and forth between reality and the otherversesome of the backtracking adds to this as well seeing how you will have to use different elements in your apartment that you apparently cant find in the other world despite the fact that im pretty sure you could clean a filth encrusted toy key by you know wiping the dirt offthe otherworld is literally broken up into distinguishable levels that are all separated by different sections that ultimately break the desire for exploration in the first two games you could literally explore an entire town while following the linear story line but the room practically locks you in a cage and sends you down a conveyor beltmuch like resident evil  silent hill  depends on the innovation of having the players play the role of alpha male for that arbitrary reason that players love the idea of the brutish darkhaired inhuman main character scoring with a hot foxy young woman in a miniskirt who couldnt protect herself with a tooth pick but thankfully unlike resident evil  the female in silent hill  can actually protect herself after being severely injured dayumn and is so motherly and intelligent that she ends up being the best character in the game
all of this kind of wears off however when you consider the emotional connection between an emotional woman and a living breathing piece of petrified crap and the fact that you have to save her by keeping her from fighting thus helping you
at least in this case you cant blame her for running slower than you seeing how she has a sprained ankleyou will also have the option of saving this person from a lingering danger over their head
while looking after her was a seemingly mindless chore i felt naturally inclined to do so because with the escortmission aside she was the only character in the game i didnt genuinely feel like jumping into the screen and incinerating them with a flamethrower out of unbridled rage so saving her was a must for me
however in order to do this you have to use items that take upwards to half a minute to heal her and considering that she just gets more affected a minute later and if you let her fight even once past the third revisitation youre going to be spending a lot of time healing her which means sitting around scratching your nose waiting for nothing to happeneven saving your game gets to be obnoxious because you only have one save point and at later points in the game said save point will be guarded by things that can hurt you and even kill you if your not carefulbut you know what the worst aspect about this game is
the endings
all of them
each and every one of them are devoid of a climax emotion dread accomplishment even sense and logicive played games where your only ending is repeating the entire game over again for no reason ive played games where all you get is a text saying congratulations you won and ive played games where the only ending is a still image where the credits scroll up and those all of those endings were art compared to the endings of silent hill  the roomultimately i found this game to possess the dreadful abc of gaming that it was so apathetic boring and cantankerous that i couldnt logically find myself playing it out of fear or interest without wanting to turn it off and play one of the many resident evil clones from the s even if they werent that good and a game that i end up playing only so i can protect the jiggly young woman in the miniskirt and hope the hero ends up dying in the process isnt a game dedicated to being scary or involvingsilent hill  the room was not a fun or scary experience for me and was about as insulting to my patience as it was to my intelligence but if you like blatant ringu knockoffs boring brown haired emotionless heroes and more plot line movie ripoffs for the sake of originality in a horror game then dig right in
personally i think theres enough of this trite in horror movies today so why botherthis controller was fantastic
it worked great for halo and all of the ghost recons
very sensitive and quick response
i absolutely loved itthen one day it decided to start acting on its own
my characters started moving by themselvesplanes started flying themselves
very oddslowly at first i was able to correct the controller
a quick movement on the thumb stick or dpad stopped the controller from acting on its ownnow however its too far gone to bring back
for some reason the  controller is stuck on the down movement
nothing i do can fix itso now i have a cool looking paper weight
do not buy this as it will fail
it is only a matter of time
if you dont believe me look on ebay and see all of them for sale
oh yeah look closer
they are all refurbished
what does that tell youeditas an update to my original post ive fixed my controller
if you are having problems try this
it is straight from the logitech website allbeit buried in their knowledgebasequestionhow do i calibrate the logitech cordless precision controller for xboxanswernormally there is no reason to recalibrate the cordless precision for xbox
in rare cases where the minijoysticks may need to be recalibrated you can use the process below
please note that this process only works for the cordless precision controller for xbox
remove one battery
hold the left trigger and start buttons while reinserting the battery
note do not touch or move the minijoysticks at all during this time
it is very important that the mini joysticks are allowed to center themselves during this step or the calibration procedure will not be successful
the minijoysticks should now be recalibrated
please note that in some cases you may need to resynchronize the gamepad and receiver after this procedure
for more information on resynchronizing this device please see knowledge base article i am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it
this is a horrible controller
i mean it works well for maybe like a week or two in that time you love itbut after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with
the triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment
i swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity
im just playing halo  and out of nowhere my finger isnt on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade
it can spoil a good game of halo in an instant
occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver
which takes about  dear seconds
after the contoller started breaking down i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air
this controller is  and dont bother picking it upi loved this memory card
i had all my information saved on it
this is now the reason i hate it
this memory card corrupted for me
i lost everything for gamecube as far as saved information goes
i am an extreme gamer and the information lost was cumulative weeks of time of my life lost
the  blocks is a lot and i would have starred it until now
now it gets  stars
it would have gotten one star if i didnt love it while it worked
the fact of the matter is  there are too many blocks in this memory card to provide stability
the more information you save on to it the more like jenga it becomes until it finally topples and corrupts
you would be better off buying four  block memory cardsthis game does not have all of the original donkey kong arcade game levels
i dont think it is too much to ask to expect all of the levels from the s vintage bit arcade gameas it stands you just start repeating the same levels over and over again 
and that gets boring quick
had i known it was an incomplete adaptation i would not have bought itice climer like donkey kong and mario bros before it is as simple arcade title that stars two eskimos popo and nana who must climb vertical scrolling ice levels by shipping away at platforms in order to regain frozen vegetables that were stolen by a giant condor
nana and popo are better known to modern games as they appear the wildely popular super smash bros franchise
along the way to regain their vegetables perhaps a possible source for the vegetable themes in super mario bros doki doki panic as both games had the same programmer kazuaki morita the two eskimos fight three main enemies apolar bear a topi a seal in the japanese version and a yeti in the western version and the nitpickerultimately the most interesting thing about ice climber is that the programmer kazuaki morita considers this game a programming warmup for his next project which would turn out to be the immortal super mario bros  morita went on to be a major programer for the super mario series the legend of zelda series and star fox
after developing ice climber morita was assigned as one of the main programmers for the original super mario bros the characters from ice climber would go on to feature in the super smash bros seriesaccording to morita the famous turtle cheat where you can get unlimited lives in super mario bros was actually an accident
he is also the principal reason why fishing was introduced into the zelda series as one of his passions is fishingboth ice climber and nes open tournament golf were directed by kenji miki a long time producer for nintendoalthough the game worked well if you look at it in the context of arcade games in the early s with simple titles like defender space invaders the aforementioned mario bros and donkey kong pac man pong etc today modern players will find the title rather simplistic
like several other early games in the video game canon ice climbers would be a flash game in todays market
the game does feature  levels which does give some replay value and needed lengthnintendo also released ice climber as part of the classic nes series on the gameboy advance
although the game is undeniably fun the initial listing price of twenty dollars for an nes game that is this simple is rather steep
there are better titles in the classic nes series
this game would have been better served to be released in a complation of early nes classics featuring several other titles in conjunction with this if nintendo wanted to bring this to newer systems and still give consumers more bang for their buckthe video game website ign rated this title as the th greatest game on their top  nes games of all time
for those looking for great unknown nesfamicom games you simply must play moon crystal a criminally unknown famicom exclusive
the graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo ninja gaiden amazing music in depth gameplay and a fantastic storyline
absolutely amazing
had this been released in the us for the nes i feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the nes canonas bonus content to the review proper here is a portion of an interview with morita from the official zelda website from nintendo around the time the legend of zelda the twilight princess came aboutthe programming behind nintendos games and my own approach to it has changed vastly since the mid s
the first game that i programmed ice climber was my warmup on the nes then i dove into the fascinating task of working on the code for super mario bros
and i had a real scare related to that project which really taught me the importance of flawless code
ever hear of the unlimited mario cheat
the exact way to do it is a little complicated but it involved the player setting up a scenario that allows mario to bounce up and down on the same koopa shell again and again and again
points go up and up leading to a steady flow of ups
i remember when we first heard about that cheat
we got a phone call from some kid and mr miyamoto and i both thought the call was a hoaxthat such a thing was impossible
the programming was perfect 
wasnt it
well we verified that the cheat worked
fortunately very fortunately the unlimited mario cheat had a ton of pr value as word spread because i sweated bullets over what might happen
speaking of other groundbreaking projects i still fondly recall how games like doki doki panicthe foundation for super mario bros  in north americareally stimulated my imagination as a programmer
that game was released for the famicon disk system in japan whichback in the daywas a truly fascinating system from a programming point of view
of course disk systems are common now but then we were just exploring how the disk worked as an immense memory reservoir which let me toy with many programming methods that i couldnt do with rom
working with my design partner and getting very little guidance from others we developed doki doki panic in ways that really pushed my skills
i really matured as a programmer during that time
very interesting worklooking back im very fortunate to have been one of the main programmers working on almost every game in the zelda series since it first began since my programming has helped make zelda such a part of history
now its interesting to see how things have changed
while i used to do all of the programming for nes games now i supervise a whole programming team though i still do code myself too since i believe that staying very close to the art of programming is extremely important
sometimes i feel myself thinkingwhen i see what some of the newer faces around nintendo are conceivingthat suchandsuch concept isnt true zelda
listen to me
i have  years of experience here
but really having the fresh thoughts of young talents working on twilight princess has really opened my eyes and that makes me remember those first days working with mr miyamoto on the first zelda
its always essential to keep your mind open and learn from new ideas
ive known mr miyamoto for many many years
its fascinating to watch him work now
on the surface he looks like a perfectly pleasant middleaged guy
but watch him make decisions
his words are extremely precise
his explanations carry a lot of weight
i never fail to be impressed by how he helps people grow and learn about game development
which brings us back to twilight princess
as i prepare to cook in the kitchen im seeing extraordinary ingredients coming my way
if our programming can bring all of these flavors together and with our help also add a touch of lightworld zest and darkworld grit as needed you can bet that twilight princess will be the kind of memorable dish that will live up to the entire history of zeldabefore anyone suspects that i am picking on zelda note that i am not
after looking at evil lincolns review i do agree that charging over  bucks for a retro game with same graphics and gameplay is wrong
unlike mario allstars for snes zelda never remade any games from the nessnes vaults until about a few years ago and what pissed me off is that they did it one at a time with skyhigh prices
i also heard that this and zelda ii remakes didnt do any improvments with the graphics or effects like link to the past did four swords or the reretroed nessnes mario games eg
all stars mario advance seriesi grew up on this game and its one of the best nes games ever and i can write a three page review on why
nintendo decided to reretro this game to give a younger target market a history lesson on how it was started back to the old school because they know little to nothing about the nes meaning that they dont know how they were getting ripped off
gamers aged  to about  who actually owned the nes in the past refused to get suckered in
many of us still have our nes if we dont anymore then we can get the complete system off ebay or amazon for as low as 
nintendo wasnt thinking when they released this for gba with the same graphics and gameplay as nes version
if you still have your nes do not waste  on this game when you can get the original nes version for  of that on ebay and here
i know this is a gameboy game that you can take anywhere but wait for the price to go down to less than  if you want it for the gba that badi was looking for a fun new game because i am getting sick of playing halo and i found merceneries
it looked cool tanks helicopters cars and a bunch of weopans so i decided to buy it
the game is set into  parts with each part consisting of bounties and missions
the first part was fun slightly repetitive and i was under the impression that when it was over the not so big map that i was restricted to would grow it didnt
the second stage was the same as the first only harder on the account of poorly designed parts that are full of follies
i stopped playing because it was a joke and turned on halopro tanks helicopterslike gta but always fightingcons other armies turn on you with stupid reasoningaccidently ran over  gi now they hate me the guns are all horribly inaccurate controls are goofy map stays the same size as you progress destroyed major vehicles artillary and bases just reappear over time unbelievably repetitive sometimes just plain tediousdont buy this game but rent it
it is fun for a few hours but after that is not worth the  bucks i paid for itafter i was let down by the th ps installment of resident evil and lost interest in the meandering silent hill series i really had some high hopes for this game
like most games now the graphics are very nice and the music is cheesy
it sounds more self indulged by the composer and subsequently doesnt workthe control in this game is the worst element though
the simple task of aiming a crosshair is nothing short of slow torture
its a constant frustration that doesnt improve even as you progress since the enemies get harder and come in greater numberson top of the poor control the main character lazarus is a unbearable idiot
we are constantly having to endure his stupid one liners and conflicted rebel attitude through out the game
as an added treat if you stop moving him around for a few seconds he will scratch his ass
that would probably make me laugh in some other genre but when you want scary this just wont do
maybe im old and jaded 
but this game is just silly
thats not what i want in a scary gameless than half way through this game the difficulty on the missions contracts becomes ridiculous
there are no difficulty levels to choose from
i wouldnt go for this game unless youre a hardcore gamer with a lot of patiencegame was boring hard  annoying i recommend you do not purchase his game
however the humour was great and funnythis review is from madden nfl football  video gamemaddens nfl game allows us to live out a fantasy of directing a team on the field even if the promise is greater than the delivery
you get to personally see why your plan might or might not succeed and for that reason many will love this gamewell ive waited bought and played madden  collectors edition
unfortunately im not too impressed with its output this seasongraphically the game looks pretty good
the players are relatively detailed but the fields arent as sharp as im accustomed to
i tend to love espns graphics a lot more but in reality i like good playability over everything elsethe offense isnt supposed to be too overpowering this season though im putting up almost  points a game with a lackluster ravens offense
pass deep lead the reciever and its a td
the running game gets stuffed a lot easier this year as the defenses are pretty nasty on the line its just unfortunate that the secondaries are garbagethe defense has been tuned up nicely and hitting a running back three yards behind scrimmage is a blast
the hits are pretty serious
again the deep passing game is still a joke as most ds get burnedi havent gone online yet as im just not impressed with the game overall so i really havent bothered too much with it
im sure the online capabilities are just as good as always but i cannot be surethe presentation of the games is pretty weak
it has no television feel and its the same michaelsmadden dribble from the last three or four years so if youve heard maddenisms in the past be sure to have them repeated over and over and over again
the replays throughout the game happen during the play selection which means you can watch them but your play clock ticks away
if you choose a play the replay ends
like i said no television feeloverall im pretty unimpressed with the gameplay and will definitely be trying espns foray into the  season as ive always been very impressed with their graphics sound and playabilityif youre a diehard madden owner this game will probably satisfy you
unfortunately the franchise has not gotten better over the past few years and this attempt shows itwell i have only played madden at a friends house a couple times and it disgusts me that people say this game is so great just because its madden and ea made it
espn came out of left field this year and just crushed madden
madden has no running game but if you just air out hail maries all game your receivers always catch it and take it in for the score
in espn you can break out some great runs and the passing game is very difficult
the franchise in espn is incredible and managing a cap is very difficult
everyone complains about the offseason but i think its great
whatever floats your boat i guess
espn has an amazing presentation from the berman half time show to the weekly sportscenters and draft special it all adds to the experianceits sad to think that this will be one of the last non ea football games maybe ever but its good to go out on a good note
with the new deal ea made we probably wont see any other football games for a hell of a long timeit seems ea will never fix their obvious ai problems
yet each year they add more gimmicks without fixing one of the main problems in their football gamei havent bought madden since madden  and i will not buy another madden title until they fix the ai problems
i am sick of having cpus sub par running backs breaking  and  tackles on rd and  just so they can get a first down
qbs breaking tackles from lbs who outweight them by  pounds
how about the cpu always allowing your cbs to be out of position when the cpu passes the ball and on top of that they slow the cb down to give the receiver a better chance to catch the ball
sub par receivers making leaping one handed catches in tight coverage while getting hit
passes going through defenders bodies helmets hands legs arms etc
to end up in the receivers hands
balls changing direction in mid air just so the receiver can catch it
the cpu intentionally making tacklers dive in the opposite direction you expect them to turning a would be minimal  or  yard gain into a maddening  yard gain
your defenders all seem to be conntected by a string so if you go in and dive to make a sack and miss and most of the time you will miss or the qb will miracously break the tackle your defender who is guarding the intended receiver will automatically dive too if you switch to him resulting in a bs  yard td pass
the cpu automatically moving your linemen across the line on rd and  to give the offense a free  yard and then the cpu gets exactly  yards on the next play
cpu qbs getting off perfect passes while having a lb inches from taking him downif your offense you have to deal with your all star  rated receivers dropping wide open passes
all star qbs throwing balls out of bounds
all star rbs fumbling at the worse possible time
you lineman are moved across the line by the cpu and you get flagged for a false start
your linemen miss obvious blocks so big gains are rare in a close game
your qb automatically tucks the ball and takes a sack if a defender is  feet away while the cpu qb can get a perfect pass off while hes being sacked almost
psychic defense that almost always know what play your going to run
refs almost always get in the way of your receiver when you absolutely need to convert a rd downand who can forget the infamous comeback ai
no lead is safe
even if your up by  points at the half your better off running the clock out starting in the rd quarter because the ai will do any and everything to get the lead and screw you that includes your offense fumbling the ball receivers dropping wide open passes refs constantly calling clipping and holding on you after you get a good punt return or big gain
refs calling you for face mask penalties or pass interference after you stop the cpu on third down so the cpu can get a free first down bad calls in the final two minutes of the game so you cant challengeon special teams i have seen where i was lined up for the game winning field goal and i see my play clock is about to run out so i call a timeout with  seconds left on the clock
the screen signals that i called a timeout but a few moments after i call a timeout the ref throws a flag after the timeout was called
and i get pushed back five yards
talk about a late whistle
another occasion the cpu punted to me and the ball clearly went out of bounds at the  yard line
it was way beyond the side line and in fact nearly to the end of the thick white line however the ball bounced back in bounds and the cpu downed it at the  yard line
i was so shocked that i saved the replay
no matter what this cpu does to screw me they always do one better everytime i play the gamei have experienced these things and more in madden
more so on defense
while these problems certainly dont happen in every game it happens on average every other game
sometimes the cpu will cheat on every single down making it impossible to win
most of the time however i can usually still win in spite of the cheating it is still very frustrating when the cpu can constantly pull   and  yd td passes out their a just so the game will be close
this ruins the experience of an otherwise fun game
i still play  because i want to at least get my moneys worth and play all  seasons while drafting college players from ncaa   after that i will never even think about purchasing or playing another madden or ncaa title againfor me gone are the days that i rush out and buy the current years sports title
it is usually the same game as the previous one
however if you absolutely want a football title this year get espn and while it has its problems too it is certainly a much better deal being only  bucks versus  bucks for maddensince the folks at ea are shaking in the fear of a little competition from espn they have decided to purchase the nfl liscense exclusively for themselves so no other companies can make nfl games
because of this i suppose i wont be buying any football titles for the next  years
even if ea fixed their obvious game problems during these  years i still wouldnt buy madden or ncaa ever again
i dont even know if i will buy another ea game period
i am sorry i just cant support any company that buys their way out of competition
so long eamadden has two things going for it it has a more roleplaying game feel with its interaction between players and the team owner in franhise mode and through the weekly sports pages simulated each week
and the second thing
its gameplay is more arcade style making it easier for buttonmashers who cant make the cut on espn nfl kmy proof
simple i played espn k for a few weeks and then switched back to madden and beat it like it owed me money
i faked every punt and threw touchdowns with my kicker as qb
after four games of crappy plays that couldnt miss i traded it in
try it
nfl street is more realplus ea sports is looking more like an evil empire these days since buying all gaming rights to the nfl for the next  years
this means more arcade style goofiness in their sports games for five years
and lets not forget the graphics that make every player no matter what position look like the staypuft marshmallow manbefore you get all mad understand this i have been a madden fan since the first game came out on sega genesis in   remember that one
you could run buffalo bills thurman thomas on the pitchout and be unstoppable
but face it ea has gotten lazy
it recently came out that they treat their employees like s so its no wonder they rammed this through qc and put it out
and i dont see things getting better now that theyll have no competition for nfl games for the next  years
think about thatif you want a cool football sim i strongly recommend espn nfl k
it outdoes madden in realism graphics franchise mode music play calling voice acting and customization
unless ea corrects its mistakes im going to wait until espns football legendsthe major problem i had with  was that there were too many  star players in the recruiting process and the teams that performed well enough inked most of the five star recruits
the problem that created was that after about three or four seasons i began to notice the dominant teams that signed the bulk of those players were unbeatable
by the end of your seventh or eighth year there were anywhere from  to  undefeated teams at seasons end
i havent played  enough to be positive that this problem has been fixed but from just the first two seasons it definitely appears so
there are actually upsets in  thats about the only improvement i can name about another problem with  was that all you had to do was draft a fast qb  roll out of the pocket approach the line of scrimmage to draw in the linebackers and dbs and then heave it downfield to your single covered receiver for a  yard gain
i was left hoping that ea would fix the defensive ai to recognize and defend that
did i ever get what i asked for
overall  worked offensively
 is an entirely different story
my qb usually completes about  percent of his passes and i can never rush for over  ypg
toggle the ai settings someone suggested
even the worse teams will roll over my d and i still cant seem to complete a pass or run the ball even with the defensive ai on the dumbest level
sometimes i can move the ball well but usually end up punting or turning the ball over in my red zone
on the highest setting all my games end about  both teams under  yds total offense
on allamerican i score all the points and accrue all the offense with baylor while ou gets battered by my unforgiving c defense
when you come out of your huddle the ai defense is always in the right formation
if you try to audible the defense counters your audible before your guys even move
so you throw a pass to a seemingly wide open receiver here comes five supermans flying in to break up the play
you try to keep the ball on the ground but the defensive linemen blow past your o line and are on you like stink on poop
my favorite is when youre running a sweep or an off tackle and your fb is in front of you and you see a beautiful run developingonly to have willie mike or sam effortlessly run right past your fb and smack the daylights out of you  your fb doesnt even make an attempt to block
or you have a great drive going and you penetrate the red zone you get sacked  times and have to punt or you fumble the ball if you try to keep it on the ground
ridiculousdefensively there were problems that were a problem in  but are dominant in   it doesnt matter what setting i am playing on
i can hold ou or texas under  total yards of offense with the baylor c defense while their defense holds my offense to the same figure
in my first season i had the  ranked offense and the best defense ever to grace the gridiron of division a football
i held a top twenty five team dont remember who to  rushing yards and  passing yards on allamerican
thats just not fun to mei have beef in other areas of the game too but wouldnt be able to fit it here
suprisingly i think ea is on the right track with this one but major gameplay problems are the hindrance
i recently played nfl k from visual concepts
a flawed game no doubt but a good one nevertheless
at the end of the game all of the statistics and scores everything looked realistic
if ea could incorporate some of that realism into this ncaa franchise it would no doubt be the best football game ever madefirst off this is a good game but hands down the xbox version of  is not finished and i feel they should not have released it
the ps version amazingly while not looking as good plays much better
im continuing to have issues with xbox live with this game slow gameplay laggy online disconnects getting charged for losses and next to the ps version of ncaa there is no comparison it plays  times better on ps and if you have it on ps youll be in heaven
ive read ea
is giving out refunds for the people that want to send back the xbox version of the game but i suppose youll have to contact their tech support to find out
nonetheless what went wrong with ncaa for xbox
i can only hope ea
listens to the complaints people truly are experiencing
mind you the main issues are online play and offline play is decent but its still a bit sluggish overall and  actually played better than  in my opinion if you can live with the slowdown and dont play online you can probably live with the downfalls of an overall great playing game
its just hard to see its qualities with all the flaws this game has
i expect more from eado you remember those incredibly cheap fighting game characters that would cause you to blow a gasket as they unleashed a hit combo which you couldnt block or recover from
remember how m bison in street fighter  or heihachi in tekken  were so incredibly cheap and would barely let you get a hit in
if that sounds like fun then by all means buy def jam fight for ny
this game is actually fun for a while and it looks and sounds great but its too bad that the control is so cheesy and unbalanced that it basically ruined the game for mepros great graphics awesome voiceover acting tons of cool customization options real licensed gear you can get air jordans for your character
 an interesting story line and tons of famous and less famous hiphop celebrities
this game has got style and character without a doubtcons unfortunately the gameplay you know the actual point of the game as opposed to buying jewelry and clothes for your fighter like some urban barbie doll is both too simple and too frustrating
the main problem is that all fights follow the same exact progression land a punch or kick get your opponent dizzy grapple them throw them down pick them up while theyre still dizzy repeat
there are no moves in this game
oh sure you can buy a couple dozen blazin moves but these can only be used once or twice rarely twice a fight and only in certain circumstances
the big weakness is that the computer ai is really cheap and will basically string together about  moves before you can even move
blocking and countering are really really weak and tough to pull off and i actually had a fight admittedly with an upper level character where i couldnt land a hit and any miss on my part would result in a  minute orgy of hits from the ai
hhmmmmm fun
i guess you could sum up the problem by saying that there is really little strategy involved and that you cant get all that much better
the crowd and object interaction are also really poorly done since the crowd is like a magnet get too close to any spectator and theyll hold you while the computer unleashes a  hit combo
does this ever happen to the cpu
rarely
lastly the arenas are well done but you cant appreciate them because the camera stinks and half the time you cant see where your guy isthis is a game thats actually more fun with somebody else since you dont have to deal with the computer cheese that basically ruins what could have been a fun game  rent first definitelyas anyone reading this review is doubtless aware this game is based on the third installment in the harry potter movie franchise which is in turn based off the third book in the harry potter series
this one concerns the third year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry for harry potter hermione granger and ron weasley as they attend class learn new spells fight various enemies and  by the way  deal with the fact that the notorious wizard criminal sirius black has escaped from azkaban prison with the intent to murder young mr potter and he is being pursued by dementors which are ringwraithlike creatures that act as prison guards and they are intent on recapturing sirius black and woe to anyone who gets in their waythis is my second foray into the world of harry potter gaming
about a year ago i played harry potter and the chamber of secrets which was a great though not perfect game with a wellrealized immersive hogwarts lots of challenging combat fun sidequests and minigames quidditch matches goodlooking graphics and engaging puzzles
i went in to prisoner of azkaban expecting more of the same
i was rudely shocked to say the leastbut before i get into the negative lets talk about the positive
in this game you control harry ron and hermione at various times and each of the three has different strengths and abilities
harry has access to the marauders map which allows you to see minimaps or the levels complete with secret passageways and locations of other characters and enemies
harry is also able to jump gaps climb ropes and is generally the most acrobatic of the trio
ron can find secret doors and items
hermione can access tight spaces that the others cant
in addition though this game offers many spells to be learned and used most of them can only be used by one or another of the three characters though the basic spells are common to all three
all of this does make for a more varied gameplay experience and adds a certain amount of depth to the still too easy puzzlesolving
another positive thing about the game is the expecto patronus spell which allows harry to conjure up a patronus to use against the dementors
this is very well done and is the most enjoyable thing in the game although controlling the patronus effectively will take some getting used to
but thats about it as far as positives gocombat in this game is much easier than before
your expelliarmus spell for defense will almost never be used
the basic approach to any enemy is just cast filipendo at it over and over again until it goes down
this is complicated by the fact that your lockon targeting system in clearly flawed in this game as many times you will attempt to target an enemy and lock on to an inanimate object instead
a couple of the enemies are slightly more challenging but for the post part it is just point and shoot
this even applies to the several times you will encounter draco malfoy in the game
malfoy is no more difficult to defeat than any other enemy in the game
this doubtless makes the game easier for young players but it was a disappointment for methe puzzles in the game are very easy for the most part
they are made even easier by the fact that the characters will continuously shout out things like i wonder what that button does maybe you should push it
or hey ron why dont you cast lumos duo on that object over there
or other such things
so if you should ever experience some momentary hesitation about what to do next dont worry  the game will spill the beans quickly enoughthe most annoying thing about the game is the fact that whichever of the three characters you are playing the other two will constantly run along behind you shouting unhelpful and annoying remarks
for example when you have completed all the tasks assigned to you for a level but you need to explore the castle a bit the characters will gripe about how tired they are and how they want to go to bed approximately every  seconds
or if you should ever deviate from the shortest path through a level they will start spouting off about how youre going the wrong way
this will drive you insane in a hurry
i cant believe ea thought this was a good idea
at the least you should have an option to turn the voices offthe minigames in this game are dull to say the least
as i said before there is no quidditch in fact you dont touch a broomstick in the game
yes you do get to fly buckbeak aimlessly around the castle grounds if you desire but this is a very poor substitute
the other minigames are pointless and boring and one of them owl racing was apparently deisgned as torture for your fingers since you have to tap a button over and over again in a precise rhythm for several minutes in order to make your owl flap her wings and fly
i did it one time and never again since i dont particularly enjoy finger crampinggraphically and soundwise the game is also below par
most of the characters look and sound nothing like their movie counterparts
the worst is professor snape
i dont know who did his voice acting but they could have gotten the guy who does spongebob squarepants and it would have sounded better
of course you dont hear much of his voice anyway since every time you encounter him outside of potions class in the game he will look at you and immediately go into a fit of coughing and hacking  bascially snape has a yearlong bout of emphysema in this game
what is up with thatyou spend far too much time in this game staring at loading screens
every time you open a door even to enter the tiniest room  loading screens
running from outside the front door of hogwarts to gryffindor tower takes about  minutes of play time and about  seconds of staring at a loading screen
this is far too much and ea really needs to fix this recurring problem in their potter games
other simiar games dont have this problem why should this one
it certainly isnt the great graphicsoutdoors is another disappointment
yes you can fly buckbeak over a complete version of hogwarts but except for the relocated front door it is the exact same building and grounds layout as in the last game
in addition in the last game the grounds were inhabited by lots of students running around the castle which did a lot for the immersion factor of the game
here there is no one outside at all
its almost enough to make you feel lonely running over the huge grounds all alone
also in previous games exploring the grounds and castle had a purpose  there were secret items all over the place waiting to be found
here there is nothing beyond one or two chests with wizard cards
outdoor exploration was one of the best things about chamber of secrets but in this game it is yet another disappointmentoverall this game let me down severely
its like ea decided that since the harry potter games were intended for younger players and chamber of secrets might have been too difficult for them they decided to make prisoner of azkaban much easier and get rid of all the fun and challenge and in the process most of the hogwarts atmosphere
although young kids will probably have a lot of trouble with the patronus spell
unless you just have to play every game with the potter name on it avoid this one
play chamber of secrets instead
lets hope that goblet of fire is bettertitle says it all im just glad that i held out for this to drop
when i poped demoncrap i mean demonstone in my ps all i could think was damn i want to be lord of the rings then i saw that the same people did both didnt suprise me
oh and one more thing especially for the gameshark users the game will freeze up if you use codes
heed thy words save yourself the trouble on that
dont learn the hard way like i didthe character you play is james earl casha man that was suppose to die on a electric chairhe escapes so every gang and group is everyone in the city is trying to find himthis game is fun when you first play it and then later on around the fourteenth level this game is way too difficultthis game has so many things wrong with how it playsat least the violent stealth kills are coolbut besides that the game is lacking overallin this game you mostly  hide in the shadows and wait until they turn around and kill them with wireplastic bag or shoot them in the headthe problem with this game is that when the character does not have a weapon he can not fight without losing a lot of health or everyone finding where you are atlater on when you go against the swat you have to restart over and over because they outnumber you in better weapons and peoplewhen their is five enemies with machine guns against you that is unbalancedanother problem is the radartheir could be an enemy standing right next to you and the radar will not show it and then you get seenthe game is about stealth kills in the beginningbut later on the stealth is replaced most of the time with gunswhich is not fun when you are outnumberedthe health items are hidden and hard to find so you are likely have to start over it find where it is atsaving is not any better and you cannot save unless you get really far into the level before you get the save point tape itemmanhunt is not a fun game to play and it wasnt for the extreme difficultly this game would be betterthis game fequently uses the hit and run tactic most of the time because the fighting is useless and you are outnumbered with enemies with better weaponsthis game overall is fun until you get to last five levels than its too fustratingpros stealth kills grainy videos and voice actingcons cannot save without save hit tape ridiculous amount of enemies at once with better weaponscant see enemies on radar that are very closefrustrating difficulty that makes you crazy after you play the same level over and overthis game is deadly dull
it is mostly a stealth game that requires you to slowly and quietly scope out your surroundings and note the locations of all of your enemies
then you wait for them to walk by you and pounce on them from behind
the cut scene animation of your characters violently killing your enemy is the most graphic of any video game
they are cool to look at but after youve seen the same one a couple of times they get boring
another problem is that the cool frombehind killing sequences are only available with a few weapons not all of them so shooting someone in the back of the head with a pistol is less damaging than a plastic bag
its also a really hard game
the developers made the mistake of not allowing you to save at any point just at designated save locations
there are only  or  or these per level and since the game is so difficult and slow paced you end up playing the same minutes of game over and over again
your character cannot duck crawl or jump so you are basically limited to hiding in corners
the game is really gory and creepy but not scary in a stuffjumpsoutatyou kind of wayits nothing in front of todays modern futuristic games
some team jerk dies every  minutes reincarcerated and tries to stop japanese to invade certain islands
no pleasure barely time pass
only one word boooooooringokay im a gaming fan
i heard battlefield  was a great game so i went ahead and bought it
boy was that a mistake
this game is devoid of most things that make a firstperson shooter great
lets go down the listgraphicsthe graphics arent bad but theyre not great
sure there are vast environments that look pretty cool but the sprites could have been bettergameplayokay this is what will make you deside whether or not to buy this game
if you like the idea of the following this game would be good for you
if not then dont buy it
simple as that
anyhoo a lot of people spawn on a huge field and they just have to kill each other until their tickets run out
oh yeah you can take key points too but that doesnt really seem to do anything
theres also a lot of vehicles to choose from so that nice
and you get to choose your class which adds variety but doesnt really push this game the extra milemodsthis game has a lot of mods
a lot
from star wars to the postapocalyptic future theres something for everyone
though these mods do little other than replace the weapons and vehicles and occasionally throw in an extra map or two
that is if you can get them to work
theyd always make my game crashso all in all the game was fun for a while then i just kinda reapidly lost interest
its not a terrible game yet its not a terribly fun game either
yes getting the game and expansion packs all in one box is neat and a good value but if you really want a good wwii experience go get call of dutythis game and the way it plays has me befuddlednow i am getting on as an old geezer and like wwii stuff but this thing after using call of duty is a total mysteryfor one thing you are thrown in situations and it feels like you are out there by your lonesome the graphics are sparseso faryou start in a desert scenario and if you run to an area you get shot and one time does it and if you try to sneak up you get bombed or strafed from aboveget in a tankget blown by a bazookago to the battle of brittan and you have to run around looking for a machine gun cuz you aint in a planeboy oh boyand like i said the three scenarios i have tried it looks like nobodys home ya end up running around empty factories and what noti did max out the bots and all that jazz and it still feels like lonesome george out theremaybe ill get on a forum and then again i may just stick to moh or codcrysis is fun tooanother game i got hidden and dangerous is even goofier if you configure the controls the doggone they end up overlapping each otheryou know wforward sback and so ongame developers aught to stick with a familiar format in my bookthe disk dus not work at all i tryed to play it to install it and it dus not worki was so not impressed by these
this sound is below average unless it is heavy bass music and the computer is turned up to maximum volume
they are heavy and uncomfortable sound is horrible unless you dont want to hear anything around you waste of money completely
i ended up giving them away after about one month when i had enough money to buy new headphonesifyoucanstandlisteningto peopletalkinglikethistheni beeleiveyoumightenjoythis gammmmme
i swear
the voice acting in this game is very crappy
the characters just cant seem to match the mood with what is being said
they also never use words like thats
they say that is and that is annoying
the actors over annunciate every single word as if they were paranoid that the digital technology was not enough to allow the player to understand a normal sounding conversation
no
were too stupid to put together normal sounding sentences
the audio was put together for the people of zimbobway to practice their english listening skills
im only playing this because i am retired and own  or more games and this is one that i never got around to putting in my system and my year old wanted to see what it was about
she lost interest  minutes into the first game and the horrible voice acting is causing me to loose interest  hours into the game
i really just want to go back to playing kingdom hearts  and rogue galaxy
the fighting however is fun
just be prepared to grind your teeth at having to endure less than par crapsucking actorsmore of an attempt to create a leisure suit larry xtreme party games title rather then a continuance of the classic adventure series leisure suit larry magna cum laude will disappoint a majority of its long time fans
instead of talking to women working out puzzles and trying to persuade them to spend some quality time with you here you have a number of arcade games to complete to pass the game
its the most laziest game design id ever seen my heart sank when a majority of the puzzles required you to play pong or take photos
the comedy in the game is okay but it does wear out its welcome when most of the jokes rely on swearing and the fact theyve all been done before to better effect in previous titles
leisure suit larry magna cum laude also has little reply value compared to its predecessors
a game like larry  love for sail had heaps of secrets programmed into it that kept the gamers busy for months playing with shortcut keys and program files
in mcl all you have to do after you finish is keep playing annoying arcade games until you can afford to make everyone nudetheres almost nothing here for the long time fans except slight nudity and a few cheap references to the previous titles
although it should be noted sierra tried to win the old time fans over by saying the series creator al lowe would participate in the creation of this title as a creative consultant
however months went by with lowe not receiving any word from the developers
people had grown impatient and evidently gave up hope on sierra making an effort to contact larrys creator
however just before the release of the game lowe recieved an email from the developers
it turned out the only involvement they intended for al lowe was to make him sign a waver that wouldnt allow him to criticise the game when it came out
lowe humbly refused their offerif you want a game that shares the larry series traits look over ebay for freddy pharkas frontier pharmacistif youre just after a little computer nudity cant you find cheap hentai insteadps
the difference between the uncut version and the censored version is that the censored signs have been removed and theres slightly more graphic version of the barbarajo endingif you want some fun you may get it
for a serious chess player fritz  is much betteri got most of the way through this game before giving up on it
i had no trouble installing it and loved the beautiful graphics and sounds much better than uru
but after a while i realized that the puzzles were just no fun
too many of them involved getting the timing right and persnickity mouse movements i quit the game after a couple of hours of trying to carry a bubble to an elemental guide who might or might not be present
others were so clever that only after you solved them could you figure out the clues that should have helped you
and i dont even want to talk about the small blurry cursive alien language writing recognition problem in yeeshas bookshelf
theres also my dissatisfaction with the finales on the two prison worlds
basically you solve everything get an animated ride and then wonder what that was all about
after the first one i actually had to visit a hint site to confirm that id done everything and it was time to move on
its not at the level of the original mysts ending but its on the same path
to my shame i even had problems with the lack of direction in the game
essentially at every stage you have a mindnumbing number of alternative paths with no guidance on which you should do first
i also had trouble keeping track of where i was physically in the worlds  tomahna and spire were ok but haven vague twisty paths in lookalike jungle and serenia nice paths but twisty enough that even backtracking doesnt take you back where you thought you were were impossiblei dont understand why the people who make these myst games keep going astray
theres no place in myst games for timing problems or mouse movement problems
if it werent for those i probably would have finished the game
but as it is its just more trouble than its worth
overall i give it  stars out of i didnt have any problems installing the game other than needing to download a new driver for my video card so i cant really complain about any technical issues
the two stars i gave this game are mainly for the graphics and music
but since i started playing i have been severely frustratedi dont think ive solved any puzzle without using hints and often the hints just confirmed what i already knew
its very frustrating to know how to solve a puzzle and yet not be able to do it because of finicky hotspots or time limits if i wanted a game with time limits i would play an arcadestyle game
some puzzles are so obscure that youre not even sure what youre supposed to do
others are so complicated and involve so many steps that its a wonder anyone solves them at all
in my frustration i have had a look at some discussion groups and forums relating to the game some people claim they spent hours on certain puzzles
not everybody has that kind of time to wastei made it to serenia and am now blocked by the asinine dream puzzle ooh flashing lights
who designed such a boring repetetive monstrosity
after trying various hints walkthroughs instructions etc i still cant solve it
i no longer have a desire toin addition to the builtin hints i think this game needs a solve puzzle option
some of us just like wandering around enjoying the scenery and figuring out the solvable puzzles
as it is now we cant do that
if you get hopelessly stuck the game has basically endedmyst iv will probably sit on my hard drive for a few months until i find something else thats more enjoyable
then its getting uninstalledif there is a myst v i will be reading many reviews of the game before i decide whether or not to purchase it
i know im not the only one with these complaints
if the makers of myst dont listen to their fans theyre going to lose some of themthis product contains starforce copy protection which is supposed to keep people from making illegal copies
the bad thing about starforce is that for legal purchases it does things to your comptuer which are permanent and possibly destructive
do a search on starforce problems and you will see what i meani installed this software and when i first tried to run it it installed some device drivers on my system and windows asked me to reboot
after i rebooted i noticed the device drivers where there
i tried to remove them
after rebooting again the device drivers were back like a virus
i uninstalled the game
the device drivers were back
i removed the device drivers and rebooted they were back
in addition starforce has a program that runs all the time on my computer even when i am not playing the game taking up cpu speed and memory on my pc making it slower
it cannot be uninstalled in any way that i am awaresince i installed the game and after i uninstalled it starforce program has interfered with my usb external drive making it impossible to create images of cds i use for work disabled some features of my dvd drive disabled some features of my legally purchased cd creation software i use for worknone of this is disclosed in the enduser license agreement
one important note to customers who may have purchased this game however if you call or write the publisher and tell them that you disagree with the license agreement the contact information is in the agreement they will provide a cash refund for the game even if it is openedit was hard to give this software stars since the game itself is a great simulation
the trouble is ubi is still selling it but the software only works on xpxp is a great operating system  probably microsofts best ever  but when its over its over
and unlike xp vistas backwardscompatibility is sketchy at bestthere are workarounds to run sh on vista  bit
google that and read it before you click buy here because theyre not particularly well documentedfor vista 
the penalty for being modern is simple games like this simply wont runif you have an old xp gaming system this is a great game
if not think twicei got this product brand new and i thought that i had a cheat system that would help me pass those hard to beat gba games
it did help me through a few games and then one day it happened
i inserted the game into the gameshark just as i did before and i put the gameshark into the gba just as i did before but when i turned on the gbanothing happened
i took out the gameshark and tried it a few more times and still the gameshark would not work
i even called madcatz about this problem and they said the problem was if the pins are not correctly aligned it will stop working
they even told me in order to replace the product i would need to send them the receipt as proof of purchase and it has to be within the time of the store warranty
my receipt was only  days past the warranty expiration date so they said i would have to buy a new gameshark
i was able to fix the one pin that was off but it still did not work
i also have a gameshark for the playstation  and this item was from a different company and it still works today with no problems
this item is garbage and trust me when i say you would be better off to keep looking for a different gba cheat system
i was very disappointed with this product and i refuse to buy a second gameshark because this product is a big waste of money
plus in reaction to the  code limit that was said fyi everytime i only used  or  codes before it all of a sudden died on me
the two stars are for the time it actually workeddestroy all monsters melee not only has better graphics but they dont have those lame minigames monster bowling
please
they have more monsters yes but the controls feel a lot clunkier for some reason
the main story had not changed at all nor have many of the mapsoverall its a disappointment
its not horrible but this game series took a step back when should have taken a step forwardi think too many reviewers remember fondly and rightfully so the ps game wild arms
this remake pales in comparison and smacks of a desperate attempt by a design team to get a few extra bucks out of a franchisefirst and foremost there are bugs galore in the game
serious bugs
bugs that make you reset the ps although ive heard that some have even had to restart their games ive never experienced this
this is unacceptable
i dont care how good the source material is its shoddy and unprofessional to rush something with a price like thiswhich brings me back to my original point  the source material has already been published and can be found for a lower price than the remake
all that is given here are better graphics though theyre nothing to write home about  for the time wild arms for the ps had very nice graphics
the same is not true for alter code some extra characters which cannot be accessed until late in the game and a couple of extra dungeons
whats more the battle sequences in the remake are much poorer than the original offering and much much more annoying
they are overlong and often very tedioussorry but i dont see the love for this imitation
bugs design issues the surprise encounter rate is ridiculous  but only when your characters are of a high enough level to avoid most encounters and just general sloppiness make this one of the more tired rpgs ive played
i give it two stars only because the original was a star offeringrainbow six black arrow is just a bigger version of the original
but the online multiplayer has bigger maps and a new gun
the story isnt bad considering that its a firstperson shooter
the ai
is a little bit smarter but thats not saying much plus theres only one new gun
and whats the point in having retrievel in a squad based tactical game
it gets really stupid and there really is no point in making this game
say what you want black arrow isnt that great to me
i realized that its just like the original just bigger
halo  may have the same problem but people want halo  to be alot like halo just a little bit biggerdid you ever play front mission if you have you probably know what a great game that was
it had everything you could hope for from an rpg
a riviting story excellent music likeable characters and a fun wellpaced battle system
on its own front mission  isnt a bad game but compared to the last one it is a let down of epic proportionsone thing youll notice immediately while playing front mission  is that it doesnt have the internet mode in front mission  where you surf fictional websites in the complex fictional world
since i didnt like the internet system too much it wasnt that big a deal for me
however i will say that it did flesh out the world it took place in and made it more believable
some people may be dissapointed that this wasnt included in another thing is that the music in this game is incredibly bland
fm  had terrific music but fm has only elevator musicthe story isnt as compelling either but i mostly blame this on the bland character development
they were not threedimesional and sometimes they only came off as stereotypes
one thing i couldnt get over was one of the main villians a genetically enhanced superhuman like the imaginary numbers from fmnamed wagner who always reacts with wideeyed astonishment whenever you beat him a fight
he always says something like what is it that makes you so strong
uhhello
subtlety
not in this game
gone are the days when subtle philosophical build up spanned the length of a game to reveal in a grand climax the true strength of the human spirit they just decided to say look
human spirit trumps all
we dont even have to explain why
fing lamethe only good thing about this game is the much improved battlesystem
it puts much more emphasis on team work allowing characters to attack simoltaneously when grouped together in a small squad
also each character has their own signature moves and abilities which can be aquired by spending earned skill points
to me this works much better than the way you learned skills in fm from using different wanzers which always seemed weird to me
missle launchers arent just limited to six missles fired one at a time anymore
they can shoot more missiles sometimes fired in groups
for example a missle rack has x ammo
this means it can hit a target with four missles at once and can be done four times before you have to reload
x likewise means you can fire  times and each time attack with  missles at oncethe battle system is greatbut it is killed by massive terrain which must often be treked across making some battle last as long as an hour
this gets boring and tedious very fast
also skill points are incredibly hard to gainfront mission  is an inferior remake and if i was you id stick to prosmuch better than the flimsy standard padmore stable and solid basestill portableconsfrom personal experience this pad will eventually start to misfire
the buttons that misfires varies and so does the behavior the button may not respond or it may just repeatedly act like its being stepped on
regardless of whether its being used for xbox or ps this happens to most people
just search the internet for gripesbased on the above this pad should not cost more than  based on its life expectancy
 is too much money for something that breaks down within a few monthsbottomlineif you really like ddr and youre using it to workout i recommend that you just buy a metal dance pad for 
yes it is twice the price but its better than wasting  for something that only partially works after a relatively short amount of timedidnt work on my computer so there is not much i can say
met all requirements but it just wouldnt worki do not want to worry about hiring janitors searching for extras worrying about the landscape of my studio lot constructing toilets or any other of the micromanaging chores involved in running a studio
i want to build stars direct films and create cinematic masterpieces
there are so many distractions away from the main goal that one barely has time to enjoy the movie making experience
bad enough i have to spend forever worrying about side projects but the movie making software itself is flawed limiting what types of flicks i can even make
what could have been
what could have been
when one turns the entertainment industry into a boring exercise then one knows they have failed utterlythe novelty wears off
the fact that the movie making experience is very limited redundant and totally lacking
the stratagy part of it together with the fun and creative parts of the game is completely offputting
but its a fun game for the first  hours of playi was talking with a friend about another game before when he said how can you like it
im addicted to it but i dont like it
i didnt understand what he was saying until i played the movies
where to begin
this game is one of the most insanely frustrating games i have ever played
its meant to work as both an rpg simulator game and a movie making tool
i havent played many rpg sims but this is a lot of aggravation to go through to make a movie
lets start with the bugs
sometimes the actors show up as black blobs instead of actors
sometimes when costuming the actors for a scene in the movie the actors torso will appear as a formless white shape so that you cant see what their costume looks like
actors will sometime play roles or wear costumes that you didnt assign to them
in the movies the actors will make annoying mumbling noises unless you insert a microphone and dub over them
the microphone leads to a whole different set of bugs all togetherwhen the game starts you have to build a studio from scratch
you also need to hire employees to write scripts act in the movies direct the movies be extras for the movies build and maintain buildings clean the lot and research movie technology
directors and actors fall under the same category in the game but youll probably use them interchangeably
in fact youll probably use all of your employees interchangeably because only a handful of applicants apply for the jobs on your lot
making movies stars out as a lengthy process of putting screenwriters to work on a script casting the script making sure the script has enough employees attached to it and then filming on the sets you pay the studios budget to put up
once the movie is finished its reviewed
and then the reviews torment you for using a maintenance man as a star and a screenwriter as a director because you didnt have enough actors and directors to commit to making multiple movies at a time something youll need to do if you want to make any money at all in the gameyou also need to let your employees have fun without getting drunk and letting them have fun will stretch out the amount of time it takes to make your movies
you also have to build trailers and nurse relationships between the actors to keep them from quitting
plus running the studio is often interrupted by an awards ceremony
its fun at first but after a while i ended up fast forwarding through the ceremonies to see if my studio won anything
the game starts in the s and continues to move through time until it goes into the future and doesnt stop
also moviemaking processes evolve faster than they did in real life and theres no way to choose which technology you want to incorporate into which movie so dont count of producing a film noir in glorious black and white in the sits possible to attempt making movies without stressing over the strategy element in the games sandbox mode
unfortunately options in the sandbox mode must be unlocked by earning certain amounts of money winning certain awards garnering good reviews and babying movie stars in the main game mode
you even have to unlock the ability to write your own scripts
this process consists of stringing together different animated sequences ranging from a secretary seducing her boss to a zombie getting stabbed in the head
there are thousands of combinations of animations possible
still there arent enough possibilities
while you get to control certain elements such as violence level during fight scenes and the raciness of love scenes its impossible to control basic elements such as whether an actor is exiting stage left or stage right
also each script can be based only around three main actors and each actor only gets one primary costume
if you want an actor to wear a different costume in certain sequences in the movie you must change their clothes in each of those individual scenes
the same goes where choosing a custom backdrop for the scenes
and the options for dressing the sets with props are almost impossible to useive restarted the game twice already
the first time i restarted it was because i did so miserably in the strategy portion of the game that my studio spent a century being multimillions in debt and i only had three tiny sets to film on
the second time i restarted because my brother accidentally saved over my game in the confusing save screen
after that i was forced to start earning items i had unlocked all over againthere are several other frustrating elements of the game such as being unable to change simple mistakes like an actor being in the wrong costume during filming or post production but only during the screenwriting process
also in the main game custom scripts will take more time and money to produce meaning that making movies the way you want to make them will actually hurt you in the rpg strategy element
and the noncustom autowritten scripts you will have to produce to keep your studios above water are highly repetitive and hardly ever make sensethe game certainly has its moments
and it definitely is addicting
the first week i owned it i lost sleep trying to come up with strategies to save my studio from financial ruin
but it really isnt worth losing sleep over
and while im addicted to it i cant recommend it to othersthe game is very linar the production part of the movies gets old fast and very irritating
awards are impossible to win and vital if you want to progress because your crew is impossible to please and your actors will always demand more money than your budget will allowthe movie making part is even worse
you get stuck with several set settings of movements your character can do hence linar
you can only do certain things on certain sets their actions are campy though funny at first
nevertheless your actors actions are limited which comes off feeling very restrictedif you create custom actors they will have no skills and are pretty much worthless except for sandbox mode
the only way to unlock more cool sets and costumes is to keep playing and researching
this game had a great concept and as usual lionhead turned it into much less than it could have been
it would have been better is they cut out all the production studio crap and just focused on being able to make movies with a sims knockoff
and thats exactly what it isa sims knock off with a movie studio
thats it
in the words of rupert and ebert  thumbs downif your a fan of the lotr series than this game is for you
all you more hardcore rts players might want to spend your fifty bucks elseware
fun factor i gave this game  stars
keep in mind my judgement is a little bias i am a fan of lotr
the campaign is a blast whether you are evil or good
besides the campaign i dont really see what else this game has going for it
boring and uncreative formations tend to not serve purposes sometimes
all units evil or good have a generic formation that either raises their attack or defense
and no the formations do not even look good
half the time you cant even tell if they are in a formation or not
the biggest problem for the more seasoned rts players out there would be that advanced controls are non exsistant in this game
many times you may find your units chasing enemy units half way across the map bc there is no hold position command
or other times you might find your units getting torn apart by archers but all your units do is just sit there and do nothing
the units seem to not auto attack buildings and sometimes even enemy troops
i marched all my troops into an enemy base and the majority  just stood there getting rocked by the towers
its really annoying to have to manually guide each unit to attack when you have  other things going on at once
an interesting feature in the game you can combine archers with other units
when i first did this i was like ok cool my infantry will shield my archers while they fireto my suprise as soon as i combined the unit the archers no longer fired their bows but engaged in hand to hand combat whenever i ordered them to attack
little problems like that can be found throughout this game
whats the purpose of combining the archers with infantry if the archers just become a less effective weaker infantry
when i got this game i was expecting units to have massive amounts of men in them like in rtw
again to my dismay many units comprise of only  men  some even fewer
dont worry though you still can get some massive battles going nothing like rtw though
all in all a fun game for about a week definately not worth the fifty or forty bucks you are gonna pay for it
my number  problem with the game no advanced controlsthis game its not good i saw one other review that had  stars and its not even about the game the reviewer hadnt even played the damn thing this game sucks
this has to be the worst ninja game ever
the weapon is a cool idea but the problem is there are only three basic ways to attack with it at a range either decapitate them tear off their upper body or their feet thats it
unjustified gore and only three ways to do it the controls dont feel right when you play it running on walls is far too timid
the vos are pretty ghastly when you hear them and they dont even look like ninjas the male ninja is a spikyhaired guy with a mask on his face thats not a frickin ninjai understand that this game may not be made to make me feel like a ninja but what do i care
i didnt go into the game expecting to feel like a ninja i had high hopes for it too
and well it sucked
dont buy this game dont rent it either its ghastly really bad
clunky controls stupidly repettitive and samey bad voicovers and gameplay make this game a game to hatefirst i must admit i played this game all of about  minutes then spent  more minutes praising my decision to rented it rather than wasting  that could have gone to important things like uh wax paper and wdi consider myself someone who can see the good through the bad but as someone once kindly pointed out to me i have a low frustration level
in english that means i dont like wasting my time which is what i felt like i was doing with this gamealthough this game has many flaws im going to focus on the ones i feel is most fundamental to its downfallthe camera and controlsi list these together because theyre close neighbors with regard to this problembeing a pcgaming veteran i like customizable controls and a camera angle that benefits game play
however this game boasts two options vibration onoff and invert onoff
mind you the invert applies to updown looking leftright is inverted as well without an option to alter this
to me this shows a lack in consideration for the customer as games such as  are known to offer    and more presets for you to choose fromthere is no form of wallshooting such as in the godfather though you can aim with two problems
the first problem is that the aim sight doesnt line up with the characters eyes by this i mean just because something is in your line of sight doesnt mean when you aim the wall on your leftright wont block you
the second problem is you cant move while aiming so when you incur the first problem you must deaim alter stance and reaim sometimes more than once
mind you this game has stealth aspects
when i think stealth i think splintercell whose controls complement the required tactics expected to be employedin terms of camera angle i find myself constantly struggling with the camera
apparently it believes it knows where i should be looking better than i most of the time this is just a major annoyance but other times the view locks into place by that i mean your pigeon holed into some obscure view that is completely counter productive
ex your on stairs trying to look around the corner yet all you can see is the red ninjas backside
while this view isnt a total waste it doesnt aid the process of killingby this point youve probably noticed that i havent said a single thing about the gameplay aspect what the game offers etc
the reason for this is that i honestly dont know and couldnt care less
i believe character controls and ease of use to be the foundation of any game if flawed the rest follows
considering the array of available games for the ps i will be gingerly returning this cup coaster back to blockbusters shelves and selecting a new title to playpaused in middle of game had to restart game a few times but still pauses from time to timeok not only is the movie bad but the game is too
i gave this game a try anyhow to see what it would be likeit looked like a promesing game but it failsthe graphics are pretty good which earns the  stars but the game ultimatley fails
the controls are badreally bad
the game had some pretty stupid fights and a really stupid plotto make this short and sweet the game was bad
the controls were wierd and the game is a bit glitchya bit too glitchy
it goes like thisbad controlspretty shortstupid storybad fightingbad everything
i know i know its based on a movie its not suppose to have a grrreat story line but this was pathetic
i had a better time playing the hulk game this this garbage
dont get this game
i rank it with all the other ohso bad games such asspawn the eternalfight clubaquamandrakedo not get this game out of  starsterrible gamecatwoman is one of those games that gives licensed properties a bad namesomething really depressing as moviebased titles were starting to gain respectability with the chronicles of riddick escape from butcher bay and spiderman  no catwoman fumbles the ballfrom the moment you press start theres nothing but frustration
you play as patience a woman left for dead but instead of pushing up daisies shes revivedsavedresurrected by cats
somehow her small furry saviors imbue her with catpowers or something like that which translate into a limited repertoire of flailing punchkick moves expertise with a whip and other purchasable powers that are available as the game progresses
catwoman commits every actionadventure platformjumper crime imaginable lousy camera angles incomprehensible level designs and a lame combat engine
and for an agile character theres really nothing stealthy about her enemies mindlessly charge and no matter how you slice it one really shouldnt have to spend endless hours trying to repeatedly make a nearimpossible jump
the awkward controls dont help much either
actions are primarily limited to the triggers and analog sticks and combat is an infuriating visual mess thanks to the camera that has a mind of its own
unfortunately catwoman will surface on store shelves before this review appears
too bad unaware purchasers of this title will probably quickly relegate it to the litter boxsamurai warriors is a hack nslash game for the xbox
it is played in the third person view
you pick a warrior and fight along your army in feudal japan youll also get two bodygaurds that will attack your nearby enemies to protect you
there are hundreds of enemies on screen and the action is very good if you like these type of games
the gameplay is similar to dynasty warriors series  thru  the sounds are the same the graphics are the same and the levels feel like the same thing
in fact samuai warriors feels exactly the same as dynasty warriors
there is nothing innovative in gameplay to set these games apart
this game actually takes one step backwards by including a lousy camera system
they also added indoor levels where you fight random enemies in mazelike castles filled with boobytraps
sounds exciting but it is rather boring
dont buy this game expecting new and refreshing game mechanics because it feels and plays pretty much like all the dw series
the game creators are laughing to the bank while you play the same old game over and over
the only work they did was make it into a japanese setting and creating new dialog for the story
dont get me wrong i love dw games but expected something different this time around
how many times are they going to milk this same cowprosexcellent actionbodyguards ai

since there are numerous free online poker sites where you can play against real people i doubt anyone is ever going to put in the effort to create a really good holdem game that takes advantage of modern computing power this may be as good as it getsthe game is predictable and will teach you bad habits if you are not a beginner
for the beginners this will give you the basic experience you need for a smooth transition to playing against other people but i would not stick with this game for to long
when you start to recognize patterns and regularly beat the computer then it is time to move on
recommended for beginners only then give it to another beginner when you feel confident you understand the basicsother reviewers have described the premise so i wont repeat it
the game is a multistage puzzle  a series of little shockwave games  some verbal some visual some involving a certain amount of dexterity not a lot fortunately
the games are infuriating at times but given that their author is supposed to be a serial killer one must make allowancesthe idea of searching the web for clues and receiving emails from other participants is quite innovative and adds to the immersion
since the game has been published in europe for some time though the searches also uncover walkthroughs
bit of a temptation thatthe production values are excellent  the video sections are slick with lots of very photogenic european locations the acting is good and the overall design is spot on
the story is compelling and the characters are sympatheticfor the most part i enjoyed this gameso why the star rating
some annoying technical issues and a lousy endingfirst the technical issues  when you first play the game you have to log on  using a user name you created yourself plus a password assigned by the game
better write this on a piece of paper because youll need it every time you play
dont these people know about cookies  you cant save the game  it decides on the restart point
it isnt always where you would like to restart  the game is supposed to integrate with your email client
mine didnt  i use eudora and it fixated on outlook expresswhich then tried to take over the way it does
i had to work around this by loading my email client before running the game
this is important because emails often contain clues  the game was a cpu hog
when it was running other applications didnt get a look in
since the whole point of the game is that it coexists with a web browser and email client this isnt good
a workaround is to use the xp task manager to drop the priority of the task missingexe
maybe its part of the gameand as for the endingno spoilers dont worry
imagine that youve spent several hours working towards the denouement
at the very last minute the screen goes blank and your only way of finding out what is going on is to wait for emails from the eye witnesses
these come in over a period of time
its either designed to heighten suspense or the developers ran out of moneyits a shame how this game turned out at the beginning i really liked itoh wellnexti bought this game when it first came out
i played it for about  hours trying to ignore the problems with it
i finally just stuck it on a shelf for  years waiting for them to patch itfix it
i paid  for the game and that was a rip offthe original version of this game v is basically the alpha test version
alpha testing is in house testing prior to beta testing
this is usually used to get rid of major bugs using a small amount of usually employees
after you patch the game to v you are now at the beta test level
this is a closed test by a larger amount of gamersthis game had potential
but it is missing major standard features even after patching
such as a decent in game map you get a minimap but nothing is marked on it and  many shops do not have signs outside the doors
meaning you have to go up to every door to get a popup on what the door leads too
explainations of some spellsskillsetc
also leveling up various parts of your character does not really make a noticable change in character performance there is much more wrong with this game
the combat system is kind of cheesy with no real contact even in melee
you can face one enemy and have another selectedpurplish pink triangle above their head and fire a bow at the selected enemy even at a  degree angle to that enemy
your arrow will shoot sideways at your target
you can stand in one spot  in some areas and get monster spawn after monster spawn for an endless supply of monsters
in many cases on normal and more spawn settings you have to try to move around the spawns to continue on your journey as killing them more spawn endlessly and you can spend hours just trying to move a couple of rooms
the monsters on this game are hard even on easy
like another person said this is the only game i have seen in which the usually pathetic rats can kill the player quite easily even at level  some loot is auto discarded though i have never figured out why as it is always unidentified
you will spend  hours plus to get to the first set of shops
i fought the last  hours before the  first city completely nude because of lack of armor clothing drops
though i had enough weapons to supply quite a large army
in order to load from a save which is better than reviving and losing stat points you must go back to the main menu which is a real pain
i could go on but you get the ideaif you are a novice gamer the graphics and gameplay might impress you
you will find this game hardish
you will die alot and you will probably be confused often
dont worry that is normal for this game
if you are an experienced gamer you will probably find this game laughable but may play it just to pass the time though you might find the fun factor just above bejeweled
you will die a lotsave often like every  minutes or less
if you are an expert gamer you probably wont like this game much at all
it is way below the standards you are use too even the ones at the time it was releasedthis is what is called a filler game
used to fill time until the release of a game you been waiting on
you would be better off getting the neverwinter nights series if you havent played it yet
if you have played nwn then you are better off downloading mods for it then playing this game
this game was such a failure it put the developer out of business and the publisher got bought out by another publisher
they have been punished for producing such a terrible product
but if you can get this game for under  you wont be out much and might actually like it
i would buy the collectors edition instead of the original though as it it version  and the original only goes to version there are no dungeons in dungeon lords
although nps will talk about it
they havent been implimented in yet
i was going to rate this  stars until i found out how rude customer support can be to people
downright smartelicky
someone reported that when he called about the lack of appearence change in this game they just said
well thats not important to us now is it
that is a perfect example of the big company with a big head
the game itself is fun enough but youll be disappointed to know that you cannot solve it
the objective is missing
not to mention all the dungeons
what you do get is a lot of skillswhich is a good thing if they work but the dont
it makes little difference if you  have a  or a  in your large shield because it is just a number and nothing more
my fighter moves no faster with a  in everythingexcept wheapons or a   that stinks
and so does thisthis game was horrible
the game play and graphics are poor and buggy
not worth the moneythis game had so many problems i dont know where to begin
the only reason i gave it  stars instead of  is because the concept deserved some recognitionthis game was horible
it got real good reviews and every one said it was real good and it even looked good 
so i rented it and played it for about  minuts and couldnt handle it any more
the game has a good idea to it and being a predator is a real sick role but they turned a good idea into a bad nightmare
the grahpics are realy bad and the people look like legos and and the building and suroundings look like card board cut outs
not only is the look bad but the game play is the worst its very boring and gets old in about  minuts because all you do is run around lookin for gangsters to cut up over and over again
the gadgets are realy cool just like the ones from the movies but the controls are sloppy and locking on to people is sloppy and takes too long when there shooting you and hitin you with bats
i didnt think it could get much worse than the second predator movie but i was very wrong this is the worstthe only reason i give it  stars is because of the potential and the idea of the game which is good but they just screwed up on the whole gameeven though i liked the first predator this just doesnt live up to it at all and all the predator freaks will be very mad when they play this
so listen to me and dont even rent it just forget they even made it and just think about how cool it could have been if it was a good gameif you are looking for something that realistically portrays being in vietnam then get conflict vietnamif you are looking for an arcade game then get shellshockmind you
shellshock doesnt even recreate the vietnam like jungle
it looks like you are going through the woods in your local areasith lords makes for a fun continuation of kotor with substantial advances in game play combat and even swoop racing
added features like jedi martial arts makes for an interesting change as does the idea of being able to create items
new npcs also add fun to the game where as with kotor you can engage in entertaining dialoguefor all that the game crashes with an inexcuasable frequency
my machine is new and video card first rate
the game will inexplicably fail to load new areas and just freeze the system
afterwards i have to reboot as the game will not reload
other times background graphics fail to load
ive had the game crash  times in a single  hour session of play which to me equals inexcusable quality controlin other ways the game seems rough and to lack the depth of kotor
several missions seem pointless and often for a mission to go forward you need to run around to find the one random guy to talk to
likewise the storyline lacks the epic scope of kotor partially because so much of it remains mysterious for so long that you have little idea what is happening or what is at staketruly sad is that many of the games failings might be solved with a good patchthe first thing you need to know about this game is that you absolutely have to download the latest patch before playing it the game is nearly unplayable otherwise
that patch addresses most of the worst complaints here but there are still annoying bugs in the game even after the b patch eg when you arrive at the hidden base on telos be sure not to select the dialog option well give up our weapons we didnt come here to fight or else youll be stuck there with no one to get out as i found out the hard way
your companions have a really hard time following you as you explore and if you try to move any place too quickly youll find yourself fighting alone
enemy ai is terrible opponents will always attack you on a straight line so if you want to win fights cheaply just hide behind a box or a tree and attack from there
the puzzles are even more simplistic than in the first game and the gameplay is much less challenging especially if youre playing on the light side and dont have to fight other jedi masters
every dialog featuring tm is pretty much messed up for some reason or other
and despite the fact that you can influence your party members towards the light or dark side theyll still always act the same way even if theyre purely dark side some characters will always object to killing innocents or helping the bad guys and vice versa
your choices really dont seem to effect the story one way or the otherand the story actually is the bigger part of the problem basically there is no real story here
dark sith lords have returned to plague the republic once again and they want you dead
you meet a bunch of characters who really cant tell you much more than what happened in kotor  so basically if you played the first game youll get tired of talking to your companions pretty quickly
there are probably more side quests here than in the first game but they are completely unconnected with the main plot of the game and end up feeling like drudgework needlessly making you go from one part of town to another and back again
the planets to explore in this game are actually a lot smaller than they were in kotor  because despite the fact that youre exploring many of the same worlds the gamemakers have not included nearly as many shops caves and tombs to explore as the original
this is especially the case with korriban where youll find all the old tombs sealed off or dantooine where about half the old planet is now off limits to exploration
carth and bastila make very very brief cameos in one of the many uncontrolled cutscenes scattered throughout the game which allegedly help to advance the plot
and they really are just cameos thrown in there at the last minute for the sake of including them as they do absolutely nothing to affect the storyline
and dont get your hopes up for the ending this game will leave you asking so what
when you see the horrendously short and unsatisfying five second generic ending sceneall in all its not an entirely terrible game
its probably worth three stars for big star wars fans
but the combination of easy game play uninteresting characters incomplete storyline and unsatisfying ending make it a bit of a let down and a huge disappointment for anyone who has played kotor i could not get this game to run on my state of the artsystem
the software is filled with bugs
the story certainly looks compelling and i loved the first game
it is a real shame i wont enjoy this one
i gave it  stars as i understand some people have been able to play it
my advice is wait for the patchi just have to get this off my chest  ive never played a game with so many blind alley bugs ones that you continue playing for an hour before you realise your in a bug that you cant get out of and have to go to a previous save hoping you dont trigger the same bug
  this is unacceptable im sort of ok with a bug that craches my system but this im actually going to stop playing in the middle of this game havent done that sience i made the mistake of buying mooremember a game way back when called outpost
probably not
but i remember it
hyped to death by the gaming press then much smaller and generally more honest it was a flaming car wreck
i mean not just a bad game basically almost no game and certainly nothing like the glowingly complimentary picture painted by gaming journaliststhe price of that game from my perspective was that it was a very long time before i bought a sierra game again
this time its going to be a very long time before i buy anything from lucasartslets be clear here
kotor  is a roleplaying game
its not a firstperson shooter
the combat is fun but its ultimately secondary to character development and storyline
so i can tolerate combat imbalance though its remarkably unbalanced at times in this game
what i cant tolerate is a poor execution of a story
and as every other reviewer has noted the story is a disaster
it would be one thing if it was overly short but coherent but instead its simply missing gaping chunks as you approach the last third of the gameyour character is someone who is supposedly regaining memory as time goes on rather like in the first kotor but in this game as your character regains memory you start to lose it
you ask yourself hey what happened to that character
or wasnt that droid destroyed
or what the hell is all that stuff about mandalore in the conclusion
i never heard any of that before
etceterathis really breaks faith with the gamer
there has got to a price paid for it
in my case its this no more lucas arts
period
not until i see them seriously apologize for this failure and seriously set out to make it rightnot just this game but reorganization so that it doesnt happen againwhen you start off playing the game your in your ship half dead then your droid pilots the ship into the peragus mineing facility
when you awaken you meet a women named kreabut what i dont understand is where did i come from
in the original knights of the old repuplic when you beat the game you become the new sith lord if you beat it on the evil side or the savior of the galaxy if you beat it on the good sidethats what really made me upset about this game i wanted to continue not start over again
im not saying this game wasnt fun because it was fun it just didnt follow the original story
this is a game that you could play before playing the first oneif only the idiot ceo of lucasarts hadnt rushed obsidion to release the game during the holiday rush
this gave has amazing potential and gamers waited for months at a time for the stupid lucasarts to release a patch
they finally did but it wasnt very goodremember when lucasarts was a good company
i cant be the only one
old games like escape from monkey island rogue squadron dark forces shadows of the empireall so much funthen we went into the second generation and we got more good results kotor  jedi outcast jedi academy indiana jones and the emperors tomb star wars obiwan bounty huntergaming never was so funthen we entered the grim third generation
games like kotor ii and republic commando
games that had good potential but behind all the good looks of the boxes and the great descriptions theres a greedy evil ceo with a smile a mile wide sitting behind a desk laughing his head offwhy you ask
hes greedy i said it before
all he cares about is cash
cash
cash
money
he prices kotor ii at  when it first came out when its worth about this game is sooooo cheap
it crashes a number of times and has various other glitches
for instance sometimes when i use a medpac the medpacs gone but my health bar stays the same
once i bought  grenades spending  republic credits on each oneand then due to the glitches i only was able to use onei cant believe i bought this game
i was so excited for the new kotor game
i bought it andboom
i stared blankly at the screen as it crashed over and over again
installation wasnt any problem but hell it took me two days to get the game running due to all the crashesblame yourself if you waste your hardearned money on this game
lucasarts may as well sell boxes stuffed with crap
theyd get better reviews im sure of itif you want a fun game heres a list of good lucasarts games before they were evil and greedyrogue squadron seriesjedi knight ii jedi outcastbounty hunterclone warskotor i my alltime favorite gamethanks for listening to my anger
oh and one more thingby looking at the game kotor ii was i hope theres no kotor iii
why
the original kotor is simply classic
it cannot have sequels
true classical games and movies dont have sequels because all the sequels seem towell suck
with the exception of the star wars films of courseoverall buy the first one and take pride in knowing you hold in your hands the best game that ever wasi was dissapointed with this game
this game follows the same traditional format
the game takes you by the hand and basically leads you sequentially through a series of events
you get a series of dialog boxes to choose what to say i hate this it is so old couldnt they do away with all the boring dialog boxes
i do not like the controls or the way combat is done in this gamestar war galaxies is  times better in my opinion
despite all the terrible reviews and complaints about players no other game comes close to the total star wars experience than star war galaxies
as much as people complain about the jedi system and how terrible the jedi look in swg it is way better than the jedi system in this gamenothing origonal in this game same old cookie cutter format same old taking player by the hand and guiding them through every step without much freedom of thought on his own
this game is like an old game made  years ago with an updated graphic engine
even the graphics in this game are poor compared to games with similar system requirementsfinally my last complaint
why did i decide to buy this game for the mac instead of the pc
i dont know i thought since it was on the mac it would be more stable and more enjoyable to play
what a joke
right after i installed the game it crashes on startup
i search the internet and find out this a common problem with os x tiger and i need to patch the game with an update in order for the game to work
the performance of this game is horrible
my mac mini meets all the system requirements and this game runs painfully slow in higher resolutions and higher detail settings
the mac version is over double about  times the cost of the pc version and it doesnt perform nearly as well as the pc version
what a rip off how come they cant write better code for the mac version
how come they cant better utilize altiveci bought this game the day it came out and was i ever wrong about doing that
this game is basically just a quick throw together effort by nintendo to capitalize on the renewed popularity that ruby and sapphire brought to the game
i mean consider this
time between crystal and ruby about  years
time between ruby and leaf green  half of that
the improvements that were made to the rubysapphire version are severely lacking here
the wireless adapter is pretty much a non factor
unless youre in a pokemon league and are around many people at once who would be playing this its not really good for much else
i feel that too much emphesis was put on getting the product out to the public first with little thought to improving the game
basically heres my thought which has been backed up by other players  if youve beat ruby and sapphire why bother
but if you never played the earlier games maybe this will be new and interesting to you
also if you enjoy battling endless amounts of trainers  this game is for you
otherwise dont botherthis game offers almost nothing beyond what transport tycoon had
there are no vr effects few changes to the economic engine and its buggy as heckdo not waste your moneynot a steam game and could not work it on windows   shame ill just use it on xp pc nowfirst let me tell you about the machine you must have to run this sucker  space age
i have a computer bought only last year and to get rct to run it took a call to atari whom were not helpful at all
i had to update so many trivial things ie
my direct x didnt run with my video card so i needed to install a software upgrade to that i recently bought sims  which is in my opinion a graphic intensive game and that installed very quicklyonto my opinion of the actual game  i like many reviewers was blown away by the graphics
but excellent graphics does not a good game make
ive been playing rct since  and expected an interface that would be comparable and improved over the older games
however i found in rct a herky jerky non instictive user interface
i played the game for approximately  minutes before i gave upmy advice is this  dont bother with this one but if you must check up down left and sideways to make sure your computer will handle the requirements especially with christmas coming up
most stores once the game is open will not allow anything but exchanges for the same item i work at toys r us in the rzone and what good will that dothe good   graphics look sharp lots of extra themed items that look good fireworks import your own music ride your ridesthe bad  the controls are clumsy and seem backward especially if you have play rct or rct lots of the scenery walls and things do not line up mesh with each other impossible to create a ride inside of a buildingthe ugly  the terrain application is horrible no more tunnel no more rides or paths underground the terrain is no longer broken up in grids that can be raised and lowered no when you do that work it pulls all of the land and looks like crapyou will be diappointed in this game if you are expecting anything like rct or rct dont waste your moneythis game wants to be great
the patch finally came out and it runs pretty good now
one more new patch and all the issues should be resolved
go buy this one now
if you enjoyed rc  this ones gonna make you wet your pantswe had a game when we was a few years younger hunting unlimited btw we was young and very very mean to disks so it has gotten really scratched up and wont play anymore so im looking for a game to replace hu i was told that dh was as good if not betterits not better
its not even  as good consthe range is very short controls are weirdi cant seem to get the bullet cam to work rather its marked on or offcrashes when i click the video tab in settingsprosworks on windows  hp  bit in xp compatible modeit was cheapits better than every other hunting unlimited not counting hunting unlimited animals dont die just from shooting them in the leg like almost all shooters on the marketit was here in one day thanks amazonthis is a game which survives on its predecessor
the combat system is revamped and i give credit where its due  they had a lot of good ideas
it needs a bit of finetuning but if it gets the tuning and appears in another game i think it has a good deal of potentialthe problem comes in the story
it isnt really engaging and plot points are few and far between
it is difficult to keep working through the combat to get to the story as turnbased games are pretty much designed around when you know you are like an hour away from the next cutsceneoverall it isnt a bad game it just fails to shine
it lacks polish and it has major pacing issues
if you can make it past those two issues you will probably enjoy this gamei love the first shadow hearts
this game does not have the same dark gothic theme that the original had and takes the storyline in a complete different direction
this is very disappointing to say the least
i hate to see sequels to wonderful games that turn out this wayi dont normally play video games but im a huge fan of civilization   too huge in fact  its a real problem for me
i find myself skipping meals when i play this game
civilization  is my favorite of the civilization series
i think the zone of controls concept is natural to the gameplay and the ability to have cultural takeovers of other cities is fun
some of the oddities and cheapness of the previous versions have been removed  its not really possible to build every single wonder for instancei hadnt played the game in a while so i decided to get this complete package when i saw it at the store
however the several years of updates have really hurt this game
the problems havent been addressed  most notably the diplomacy ai is terrible and the endgame with its emphasis on large amounts of indivisual military units is so ridiculously slow that i can still only rarely make it through without quitting frustrated
instead the main change is that resources are much more scarce
these recourses are essential to the progress of your game
however you have no way of knowing if youll have say a coal resource somewhere in your map until youve already been playing for  hoursif the scarcity was a matter of instigating small military attacks on your neighbors or heavy diplomacy that would be fine
however this weakness plays off the games other weakenesses
often the necessary resource will only be available halfway around the world
launching a military attack is so ridiculously slow that it isnt worth the time even for the most addictive player that being me
and the diplomacy ai is so worthless that other empires wont trade their essential resources even when you throw ridiculous sums of money and technology at themanyway its no fun to play for hours and hours before you find that your game is a lost cause due to the map you were given
also the expansion disks are to my mind worthless
so id strongly recommend just buying the earlier editions of civilization  which are much cheapersid meiers civilization iii complete is my very first experience when it comes to civilization games after discovering that it has been called the game of the year decade and lifetime by various computer game magazines
i am a big fan of strategy based games going back from mid s and i am pretty hard to impress when it comes to the originality fun factor and game play of such games
playing sid meiers civilization iii complete seemed to be a cool game from the outset
then i started to find things wrong with it that frustrated me to my wits forcing me to detest the game so badly
first of all while i enjoy the elements of the game that it offers some of them are later found useless such as diplomacy trading and government
the bigger my empire becomes the longer each turn will take
i wish that there was a feature that i can forego the minutiae details but rather focus on what i want to focus on which is warfare
basically any strategy game is always about warfare and sid meiers civilization iii complete shouldnt be any different
the idea of raising an army is painfully slow and mindnumbing while i wait for each turn to pass by
even worse is the government which i thought by each passing level upwards it was supposed to make my empire to be better and more efficiently run
but noooit actually made things worse
after a trial and error ive resigned to the fact that despotism the lowest level of government is the best over any others including democracy
another thing that made game play worse is the control of corruption which is i later learned basically inevitable
its impossible to work out trades with other countries because they are simply not interested in what i am offering unless they offer me ridiculous terms for their advantage
speaking of advantages whats up with the battles
it seems like i am being cheated on when i have an army of twenty men and horses against a pathetic team of five and lose the battle completely
it further gets worse whenever i try to take over a city because of the walls
incredulously although large wonders take a while to build up the other countries manage to finish many of the advanced ones in a recordsetting pace after i finish the first two
in end i could never try to finish the game although i invade a country and conquer towns and cities alike because it is quite timeconsuming and laborious to see it through that i am simply content giving up the game
i just cant do it because my time is better off spent elsewhere and ive played much better games that arent so unfair and taxing
if there are improvements upon sid meiers civilization iii complete and the fairness factor is restored with respect to my time spending then i would gladly play the gameoh how i remember the commodore  c version of pirates back in the day
staying up late building my fleets and running around the carribean
what went wrongthe gameplay is almost identical to pirates
released on the c years ago which was great for years ago but if gamers wanted the exact same gameplay they would go play the old game
i think on a whole the biggest letdown was the expectation of a classic title coming back which would give people the same entertainment level but in a new gameplay environment and in this it failed miserablysome positives is the graphics have been updated slightly
the water moves better the ships are more animated and umm thats about it
the game works out of the boxno patch requiredthe cons where do i begin
ill give a few highlightsfirst off the cutscenes make we want to vomit
they look like they come out of a disney film
really cheesy and cartoony
i dont get the feeling of being a pirate more like a backstreet boy with a cutlasscourting the governers daughter becomes something highly avoided
you cant just give her presents or obtain stature you have to play a nintendolike minigame to dance with her which is basically arrows flash and you have to hit the correct arrow key to move with her or you both stumble and she gets pissed and hates you
yeah thats super duper funthe game was fun for about a nights play and ended there
i wouldnt recommend picking this upis this sid meiers work
coulda fooled me
a very limited in gameplay rehash of the highly fun and original pirates done in a fisher price kinda world
nobodys nation ever gets mad at you for attacking their vessels so for example you can sink a hundred british traders and the guvnor of any british colony will still recieve you rather then putting a price on your head
the tasks are rather mundane and repetitive get the governor to this island  help the abbots out with their problem and in the end you really dont care wether you do or you dont
its that underwhelming
not fun as a fun game and definetly a downward step from the original
 stars only because its near christmas and you must be charitablethat is my main gripe
after playing it for a day or two it gets to be very repetitive and dull
the sword fights and dancing are nothing but ddr wo the catchy songs or flashy lights
want to build a fleet large enough to take over the world
good luck as you have to dump your crew and pick up a brand new one quite often
the main character hardly deserves to be called a pirate he looks like a baby faced pansy
since when did pirates start wearing such a clean cut look
where is his parrot his scars i want to hear him say arrrr
the reviews are almost right you can do almost anything you want in this game except be a piratei did just about everything there was to do in this game after about  hours of playing it
while its boasted to be a freeranged adventure i often think that the game basically boils down to doing  things sailing ship battles land battles walking dancing and sword fights
each of which is a pretty lackluster experience as well
the entire game has a cheap feel to it as if the designers just gave up on every area before it was finishedthe dancing and the sword fight scenes are mildly interesting at first but they become mind bogglingly boring and  quickly
repetitious
whats even more frustrating is that these are one of the main features of the game and they get old after you do each three or four times
if these were just minor minigames in a broad range of interactive gaming then they could get away with it as it is they feel like the semester project for a college game programer extremely simple and lacking anything resembling depththe most entertaining part of the game is the ship to ship battles even though they are fairly pointless
its actually much more convienent most of the time to just ram your opponent and initiate a swordfight as your ship takes a minimal amount of damage and swordfights are fairly easy once you get the hang of them
if you win the swordfight then the enemys ship is won as wellthe game boasts  or so ships however a good many of them are completely worthless
in fact the game basically only gives you three ships that you would actually want to use  or so of them are merchant ships and have no use at all in battle theyre only useful as having in your fleet to carry cargo
for your flagship youre basically limited toroyal sloopfast manuverable moderate firepowerbrig of warmoderate speed manuverable heavy firepowerlarge frigate or ship of the line if youre extremely lucky to find onefast not very manuverable intense firepowerevery other ship the game offers is just a downgraded version of the previous three with less crew capacity or a ship that has such a blaring weakness that it makes it useless
the only reason youd use any other ship than those three is if you just started the game out or you lost your ship in battle
its also worth mentioning that the three main ships are all basically the same ship just different advantages and disadvantages
you can destroy a royal galleon with either of the three fairly easy it just depends on your preference in stylethe game gives you the option to act as a trader buying low and selling high at different points but this as well is fairly pointless as theres much more money to be made by just attacking other ships as you dont have to worry about cargo space and added crew for additional merchant ships to carry all the goods
plus its much more fun to attack ships and most single ships will net as much cash as any good trade run willall in all i find its an almost embarrasingly sparse game
i can not believe that i actually paid  for it this really does seem like it should be on the  new titles shelf with all those other cheaply made games
frankly it just dosnt give you hardly any enjoyment for your moneyi realy love adventure games so i got this oneit seemed very fun and exiting at firstbut then later on it gets kinda boringalso as many people said it has quite a few problemsalthough i had only  problem my friend had a big problem with the game crashingand the worst thing is that there is no patch for this gameso to get to my point if you want a game that you want to enjoy for a long time like counter strike then dont get this gameoverall this game is realy fun to play but when you beat it  you wont wanna play this game aginhalo  is an alright game nothing really new and original about itsingle playerive been through the first two levels and its pretty much just a future battle scene in urban combat nothing that hasnt been done before
plus the ai isnt the smartest original halflife has better ai stillmultiplayer  i hate it
it takes forever to get a game going you cant choose to enter a certain game you have to wait for the server to place you in a random game
this results in almost never being in a type of game that you want to be in
you cant set up youre own game unless you invite your friends to play
the multiplayer levels themselves are also unoriginal and have been done beforehalo  isnt worth it im going to just going to return it for half life i loved halo
i even got my friends hooked and they bought xboxs just for halo
we stood in line to get this and we are all dissapointed
the weapons are watered down the campaign is dark and dreary and the multiplayer is filled with bugs and glitches
on the bonus dvd they keep saying over and over how they wish they had more time to do this or that
it is an unfinished and very unpolished game
in multiplayer you cant just start a room with the map or game options that you want
bungie has a playlist
one is team slayer
you cant control how many people play what map you play on or even what weapons you use
one of the biggest gripes people have is that bungie forces everyone to use the second weakest weapon in the game as their starting weapon
this makes for a lot of weapon whoring and just frustration on the part of a lot of gamers
not having a choice in what i want to play is a major downfall of this game
i dont see it having the legs that halo hadfirst of all i must say i dont own halo  infact i dont even own a xbox i have better things to do with 
however i did play this at my friends house who owns it and the xbox
first of all we played the copertive story mode it sucked
we got bored after  min
and then we played his little brothers vsmile yeah that thing on the annoying commerical
that was more fun than this game
a little later i got bored and i decided to give halo another try so i hit the single player story mode
it was fun for about  minutes but then i got bored again
the levels all seem kindof the same with the same plot for each  kill everything that moves then find your way through a maze of hallways and doors
on the positive side the graphics are amazing for a console anyway and the ai is decent for once
if you have a good computer check out half life or doom  they kick the heck out of this game
and if you have a ps get gta san andreas now thats a good gamethis is a frustrating game to review because it has some great features
however as everyone who has played this game for more than  hours quickly realized its a ripoff
this game is about onethird as long as the first halo and doesnt really add many features that werent available in the original
there is no excuse for hyping a game this much while the average player can defeat it in less than ten hours
if you dont have live this game is a rental at bestone of the first thing youll notice when you first play this game is the female characters
then again thats the only reason to buy this game at all
the story is pretty basic so i wont bore you with the details
all ill say is it involves two hot woman running around in tight fitting underwear to fight robots with a fully clothed male character
why have a male character
maybe so when you bring over your girlfriend shell have something to watch too
the graphics are actually pretty decent
they sort of make you feel like youre watching an anime film
unfortunately you wont want to watch the cut scenes because then youd have to sit through the horrible voice overs
not to mention the painful writing
of course there is gameplay too
at first youll manage to have some fun
then youll realize that the fight system is rather poor to say the least
your enemies are complete idiots and are rather easy to dispatch
the developers seemed to try and make up for this by having the enviorment attack you
this is just plain cheap
and then theres the camera
is it too much to ask to see your character fight
throw in some painfully long load times and you have a peice of crap
its hard to recoomend this game to anyone except an extremely lonely guy with a psyes this game will take the life out of youits so hard that to a point it gets boringbasically  you spent hours and hours trying to beat each level that by the way are very hard very short with lots of enemies and a huge unmerciful boss thats willing to tear you to shreads yes im talking about that cerberus ice doggy at the beginingi think that games should go from easyto mediumto hard as you progress thru itnot from stage 
also dante acts very stupid
yes i know hes supposed to be a teenager on this one but still to immature for the task he needed to accomplishlike for example he was always making jokes with the demon soldiers and calling them names and using them as a skateboard and swinging from strippoles screaming woooooooo
thats just plain stupid considering hes the son of spardai though demonknights had more seriousness to the jobshame on this sequel and definitely not devil may cry if you are into games like ffvii then this is your game
this isnt like the average mega man game you would be used to playing
i am not a fan at all of these type of rpgs
im more of a hack and slash or shoot em up bang bang gamer and this is not even close to that
too much talking and not enough actionsorry game way to easy really fun thoguht i give it that i kinda would rather watch it as a real movie and heres what i would expect to seeleonrido decaprio shoot nothing but infected germains see him take on the boss and the guy with a giant machine gun
and him and van damme from street fighter do the min knife fight and the last part of the game
i would rather watch as movie than play gamei had played the original fatal frame and loved it
very engaging and suspenseful
great story line
and it was possible to complete the game
this game falls short for one reason
it is near impossible to complete the game even on the normal level
the programmers make sure that you have hardly any life before you reach the end
this take away the fun value of the game
i was very disappointed
i can understand if the person is playing this on the nightmare level but this should not be the case for someone playing it on the normal levelcareful with the hype surrounding this gamethe list of flaws for bia is extremely long but ill try to sum it up herefirst it will pretty much be a miracle if you can install this game without any trouble
because bia was developed in a rush and on dvd it can provoke all kinds of conflicts with your hardware no matter how recent and uptodate it is
it also conflicts easily with a few softwares such as nero
just take a look at the ubisoft or gearbox forums and youll get an idea of how bad it is since half the questions and complaints are installationrelatedas far as the game itself i was also disappointed at least when i finally managed to install it which took a while since it messed up my whole system
even with a very good config the game does not look that great especially because of this useless blooming effect
i might be wrong but i dont think soldiers had some type of halo surrounding them  years agothe environments are poorly detailed and youll be left wondering how to pass a foottall wall or invisible barrierthe gameplay is where the difference should be made and its funat first
its probably much more realistic than other wwii shooters but it gets annoying very fast
the flanking stategy is fun at the beginning and relying on your buddies and giving them orders is cool too but when its the same thing over and over and over again it kinda takes the interest and the fun out of it pretty quickalso dont worry about your guys in case they might die theyll be resurrected in the next mission
and be prepared to shoot  bullets at an ememy whos right in front of you because ze germans were apparently made of steelanyway this game was a huge disappointment to me and it didnt take long for me to get rid of it
of course its nice to have a game thats not a rambolike rampage like most of the other wwii fps out there and the fact that its based on a true story with true characters existing environments and genuine military strategy is certainly a great idea
but whats the point if youre not even having fun playing it righti suggest you wait for call of duty  or play the previous one instead of wasting your money on this gamei cannot believe how much this game was hyped
it sure paid off the hype machine keeps rolling with the fanboys on this one
i found brothers in armspc very poorthey should rename brothers in arms to brothers in hype because thats all this game has hype and totally lacks substance and polish
well its definately a straight console port a big nono for pcs
heres my thoughts so far on brothers in arms the text on the menus is massive cartoony probably because it wasnt converted when ported from console the controls are very console like no keys are remappable to extra mouse buttons
ack music is overdone and voice acting is somewhat average overhead rts mode is quite poorly implemented graphics are substandard bit textures no shaders very very dated and blocky no eax support that i can find
big red dots overtop of enemy destroys immersion game is seriously on rails it even stops you from walking at random times so it can turn on story elements
lame ai is extremely questionable and sometimes downright lameit might have some good points but the flaws are so glarring i dont even think i can start to overlook them
this one might have been good on the console but for a pc its just average  at best
but the hype machine is rolling strong on this onei do not recommend this title
save your moneythe good news is this game only cost about  dollars
other than that not much good to say
on the good side the graphics are very well done with attractive rendering and details and nice iron sites on the weaponsthe badthe enemy doesnt move too much except when they are scripted to do so
you can sit forever in one position and keep shooting or just hide  they will never come look for youso far i have gotten about half way through the game you dont get to drive vehicles fly planes etc
compared to bf and medal of honor this is a disappointmentas other reviews said you basically just shoot and move
this gets rather repetitive very quickly especially since the computer seems to just sit around though perhaps thats my difficulty levelthe missions are basically get from point a to b by flankingfor  dollars this game is fine but i wouldnt spend much money or time on it overallyou know i am sick of all the hype about this game by a bunch of weenies that dont seem to know real combat real weapons or realism of any sort beyond what they see on their tv screensthis game is not the authentic real life war onthebattlefield war game that all the geeks are hyping and signing the party line the company puts outi bought two of these games after reading the reviews and i have to say that you people dont know what you are talking aboutthere is pseudorealism and that is about it
sure the maps are close the look and sounds of the weapons are close and even the dialog is about right but that is about as far as it goesthese games fall down severely on the accuracyauthenticity in several key areasludicrous restriction on the tactical options available to the soldiers and the squad leaders
some of this is bad level design some of it is probably trying to make up for the limitations of their ai and some of it is just plain dumb
ridiculous limitations on interaction with the environments
you cannot open doors or windows
you cannot climb fences
you cannot use the wire cutters that every paratroop carried
you cannot go under a normal barbed wire fence which thousands of hunters do several times a day in americabarrels and crates dont blow up or even move when hit by a tank
you cant even climb over a low wall that some other men just went overperhaps most unforgivable of all you cannot go into a prone position or crawl
you know the stuff they teach everyone in basic training
the gunsights are ludicrous
the amount of creep even in a crouching position is ridiculous
if i was that shakey id head for the retirement home
terrible path blocking and object collision detection
quite a few times when i had a perfect view of a target and as perfect a sight picture as you would ever want i could not hit the target no matter how many rounds i fired
in real life i would have put a round through both ears of my target
absurd size of the weapons relative to your field of vision when zoomed in
come on folks this is ridiculously unauthentic
there is a reason for the open sights on fast action weapons like the thompson and other smg weapons
really stupid scenario designs
there are several instances where you are put face to face with tanks and no tactical options except to run for enemy panzerfausts
making this worse of course are the level designs that force you to follow a relatively linear and restricted path to said antitank weapons
this is completely ridiculous
poor level designs
too many places you cannot go or step when you should be able to
places you cannot jump over or crawl under where you should
only in eib do you get to even blow holes in the hedges with the tnt that all paratroops carried as part of their standard pack during that theater of operations and then only in key places and one whole scenario
situational awareness mode
give me a break
this is supposed to substitute for the advance study done by the troops
its not even as good as a raw topo map dump
you are chained to camera angles around key points and there are no indications of any significant type for changes in elevation and quite often the terrain features are faded out due to the choices made for the camera angle
another limiting factor is that you cannot issue movement commands to a  location you know is there but are not lined up on directly yourself and you had better be on the side away from the enemy when you issue the order
this could have been easily fixed by using some option to issue commands while in situational mode especially if that were better done
lastly the much hyped authentic tactics
authentic sure in a very introductory and watered down way severely limited in permutations applications and variations due to all the other limitations of the gameby the way i am both a veteran and an experienced programmer and i am highly disappointed with this game on both countsif this is the latest in realism then it shows what a sorry state the gaming industry really is in
of course i still havent seen ai in a commercial game yet that matched up to what i saw undergrad programmers doing in college during the s
we deserve better and its not that hard to do
its time we stopped allowing these companies to hype this stuff up like it is so great when its all fluff like pretty pictures and soundoh one ps
the ai cheats
you can observe how the enemy becomes magically aware of things completely out of the blue such as someone being behind them not moving or firing and behind cover
this is inexcusablegame has no quick savesenemy shots are always accurateyours are notenemy shots go thru solid surfacesas combat vetern of vietnam this game is not realistichaving just completed this game the question on my mind is what were they thinking
since its early incarnation as an s d platformer prince of persia has been all about fluid animation traps and acrobatics
now we have warrior within  a game thats not even supposed to be played by anyone under   im an adult who enjoys a lot of m rated games
prince of persia should not be one of them
sands of time had a unique disneywithanedge feel that warrior within completely sneers at
did the halo guys call the ubi soft guys wusses at some game convention
who knows
somethings got to explain the abandonment of nearly everything that made sot a great gameand if you buy this game be prepared to spend a lot of time looking at loading screens
but what about that rewind button
theres been some industry talk of doing away with the you diedreload screens and sands of time took a huge step in that direction with its innovative rewind feature
warrior within still has rewind but it completely negates the system in parts of the game by giving you no sand and forcing you to navigate long series of traps under a strict time constraint
pause for a second and youre instantly murdered in a cut scene no fighting back and booted out to the you died screen for a reload that puts you at the beginning of the traps no quicksave
there are times i reloaded many times just to get a onesecond premurder look at where to move next
guess how much fun that is
it goes far beyond just negating the rewindtheres more reloading here than in the last  games i played combined at least the load time is quick
its amazing that ubi soft reversed direction and turned this sequel into a dieathon right up there with the worst tomb raider titlesby far the worst part is the level design
by that i do not mean the rooms full of obstacles the prince must navigatethose are clever as ever
i mean the overall pathways you must take to progress the game
or more specificaly the constant backtracking required
you can tell the developers were trying to stretch the game by reusing maps
but the frustrating part was that they didnt close off any of the wrong paths so you can burn an hour pursuing a dead end enemies respawn so no clues there
if thats not bad enough there are two time modes for all the areas so you can backtrack in the past as well as the present the time modes want to be as cool as the shifting phases in legacy of kain but just arent
i was constantly unsure of the path i was on even when on the correct one
with so little feedback from the game even the fun parts were very worrying because i seldom knew if i was actually progressing
the map they give you is a total joke
imagine navigating a tangle of streets with one of those kids jigsaw puzzles of colorcoded statesthe one silver lining is the combat system
its just beautiful
much better than sot which got old quickly
fighting in warrior within is like controlling a d ninja straight out of a pixar movie
even at the end of the game i was still pulling moves that surprised me
there arent too many games where i spend  minutes killing a room full of baddies and immediately reload for the pleasure of doing it all again
that and the obstacle rooms kept me slogging through the frustrating parts
warrior within has many faults but the work of the animators is beyond criticsm
just put them under new managementhopefully someone who gets what prince of persia should be abouti have just beat this game a few days ago thank godand must report to you good people here at amazon that this game was a headachefirst of all i would like to state that this game is much darker than the first
so dark that you wonder when you will ever see the light again and is so dark that you feel queasy inside whenever you play it
the heavy metal riffs during battle sequences were awesome at first but grew old very soon and is often misleading thanks to the horrible syncing with whats happening in the game it goes on for an extra  minutes after a battle sometimespopww focuses more on combat than the first
there are about a hundred combos you can perform to erradicate your enemies
which is good but you will find yourself sticking with only a handful of them
and this game rewards button mashing quite a bitthe controls in the game are a real kick in the crotch
especially when you are navigating through a large corridor filled with traps
example you want to wall run up to a ledge but you wall run off the edge instead which leads to certain death and a painful reload if you dont have any sands left one of the problems of the game is that you run out of sand very quicklyperhaps the best thing about this game are probably those scantily dressed females ohhhhkaileenaplease be mine someday
kaileena gives this game the edge it needs
but if you just want to admire her vibrant pixel body i urge you to just type in kaileena in google image searchoverall this game was a huge let me reemphasize huge disappointment
gamespot says this game is hard no kidding
i am playing tt right now and it is so far the best pop game out there simply put it features the best of both games and more
i urge you to avoid buying this game at all costs and just read the wikipedia plot synopsis if you just want to be kept in tuned with the story
let me just summarize the goods and bads of the game listed in no ordergood graphics
combat system
heavy metal guitars it would have been even cooler if they had blended the shredding with middle eastern tunes shadee and kaileenabad controls i shudder at the thought difficulty its hard even on the easy difficulty settings the darker theme
the enemies take forever to kill
lack of charm sot had lots of it the cuss words you will utter
the  of times you will pound your keyboard i managed to knock out  keys in one pound once and take the lords name in vain
the deep desire to uninstall the sucker and chuck the package out the windowim not sure about you but i think the bads do overweight the goods
but ill let you be the judgebeing a hardcore gamer since my teen years i spents hundreds of hours playing street fighter ii the world warrior hyper championship super and after not playing any version of it in about  years i thought that id own a piece of history by owning this
much to my surprise and disbelief it was nothing like i remember
i thought that i would be able to play all the different versions seperately much like tekken  has the first three installmentshowever i was not aware that i would be playing street fighter ii super turbo and i could choose my player from all the different street fighter games
it is not what i expected and i think that i have wasted money buying this item the only redeeming quality of this is street fighter iii which i never playing prior and street fighter iithe animated movie but still drops the ball in terms of editing and dubbingif youre a street fighter fan use extreme caution before buying if not then pass this bystreet fighter anniversary addition was a big disappointment
the only arcade version of the street figfhter series that is included is street fighter  third strike
there is only one other game on the disc and it combines all the other versions of street fighter  into one game making for one huge mess
they look good but play terrible
even on the easiest setting this game is rather difficult because it seems there are missing animations
what you see and what the life gauge shows are often very different
the default music is a horrible arranged version
i recommend using one of the original soundtracks
i have the street fighter collection that came out some years ago for the sega saturn and it is very superior to this later but very sloppy releasefortunately street fighter  third strike is quite good
after playing this i find no reason to revisit the messed up earlier versions on this disc
i also suggest setting the soundtrack on this one to original as well
i dont know why they wasted time with the arranged version
that time would have been better spent properly releasing the earlier versions of street fighter  included in this collectionsf third strike carries over only a few of the old characters from the sf and sf alpha series but most of the new ones are very diverse well thought out and very cool
there are many great new additions to the lineup but unfortunately has also included some of the most ridiculous weird and outofplace characters ever seen in a fighting game
theyd be more at home in capcoms vampire hunter series than they are in a street fighter game
fortunately most matches allow you to choose one of two characters to fight so you can avoid seeing the really weird ones by choosing the alternative characterthere is no survival mode in sf  third strike which is disappointing but overall it is a very fastpaced and fun game to play and in my opinion a significant improvement for a rather outdated series
in many ways it feels and plays more like an snk fighting game like garou mark of the wolves
i consider this to be a compliment to capcom
if you want an arcade conversion of sf id avoid this purchase at all costs
if you want the newer and more advanced sf third strike i think this is still a worthwhile purchase
for a better collection of older street fighter games the street fighter alpha anthology is an excellent choice and includes accurate arcade versions of all three entries in the series plus gem fighter and an updated version of sf alpha  called goldas most of you are probably aware the prequel to this game was simply fantastica truly interesting plot excellent gameplay mechanics and a real sense of immersion in the star wars universe
while this game could have been a worthy successor to the kotor title it was unfortunately butchered and rushed out the door before it was completedthe graphics and gameplay are pretty much identical to kotor  which isnt a bad thing at all
a few gameplay improvements were introduced such as the ability to influence your companions
this is an excellent idea though it was poorly implemented and doesnt really make much of a difference
anyway you can expect the game to play about the same and if you enjoyed the turn based strategic combat of the original game youll have plenty of opportunities for more carnage though youll still have the missing lightsaber problem for a goodly portion of the gamethe plot however is another story entirely
while it would admittedly have been hard to live up kotor s high standard it seems like this games plot would have been good perhaps not great but certainly good enough to justify the purchaseif only it had been completed
apparently the development team was forced to cut much of the games content just to meet their deadline and believe me it shows
basic exposition necessary to understand whats going on and why youre doing what youre doing was left on the cutting room floor
just to give you one example early in the game its clearly explained that if a certain event happens your character will die
later on when that event happens you are left unscathed with absolutely no explanation given
most of the plot just doesnt make sensetheres little coherence plot holes are big enough to fly the ebon hawk through and the ending is one of the biggest disappointments ive ever encountered in a video game
i kept waiting for the shocking event or revelation that would cleverly alter my view of what was happening and would make me care but it never happened
this game is just a messthen there are the bugs
and there are many many bugs
thankfully hard crashes were rare but certain sidequests were broken or could be broken  if you performed certain actions out of their intended sequence
the dialog trees were often humorously contradictoryone characters name would be accidentally substituted for another gender would be confused etc
i encountered one bug where i could gain an infinite amount of influence with one of my party members by just repeating the same conversation over and over again
the list goes on but my patience doesnt
i have come to expect that programs as complex as modern games will have bugs but by the time the game is released commercially i expect those bugs to be minor and hard to find
thats sadly not the case with kotor in the end i cant recommend this game to anyone
if you just want the action then fire up kotor  and go for some mindless slaughter and if you want a decent plot and engrossing role playing experience then look elsewhere because you wont find them herewhen kotor came out i fell in love from the second my first character had to fight for survival aboard the endar spire to the climactic battle deep within the star forge
the story just drew me in more and more and the characters connected just right
finally i found both endings hugely satisfying
when news of kotor  came around i was hooked instantlykotor i was really impressed with the prologue where you play as astroid driod t to repair the ebon hawk and guide it to a nearby mining facility
the game sloooooowed down from that point to a near halt
the inclusion of all new force powers and classes are a welcome new addition
waiting  of the game before you touch a lightsaber was in my opinion a poor decision
sure you have to appreciate having the weapon but you can appreciate it just fine mowing down enemies from an earlier point in the game with it as well as customizing it to the degree kotor allowsthe characters were uninspiring
they seemed to have little reason to be part of your party
their motives are kept secret as if it will build to something huge at the endbut no theyre just a group following you around
a huge part of kotor for me was being able to talk to your party constantly and always finding out a little something more about them
kotor on the other hand i found myself getting the same exact conversations from every character from the second i met them to the second the horrible endings occur
bottom line no character developmentfinally since there was so much i found lacking in an attmept to place as many charcaters on screen at a time the frame rate drops to a rediculous low at some battles
obviously the problem that lead to kotors overwhelming problems was the rush to get it out
the story and characters simply were not compelling enough
ive since traded in my kotor and still enjoy playing the originalit never gets oldprosfun prologue good new force powers and classesconsno character development bland areas to explore horrible frame rate at times poor endings rushed to get out in the marketbut like sleeping with a totall vapid yet beautiful woman i couldnt bring myself to enjoy the experience to its fullest
the biggest problem i have with this game is that it is a console game that is buggy
and by buggy i mean sometimes heads dont show there are severe clipping problems there is a stronger lag and a  ping connection to counter strike source etc
this is a console for crying out out and you can not update the software like you can with a pc version
game designers know this and own their customers betteranother intensive problem i have with this game is the story
i am currently on the last of the choose your order planets and i know these thingsit took me about  hours to get a lightsaber and that was purchasing everything because i was getting tired of swords
for most people it has been taking upwards of i have seen the main villian the dude with the facemask on the front of the cover twice
i have no idea who he is what he wants and the extent of his in game power
i know he is driven by a hunger and he is a bad bad mancurrently i only know im  a rouge jedi who got huffy at the counsel and walked off never to be seen from again until this horrible encounter with the facemask dude
do i know anything about him do i care
no its been  hours and no significant plot developments have been presented
the only thing that is keeping me going is the fact that they still have the old kotor game play which was a blastive got nice stuff to say about this game but first you need to know that this is a game full of glitches
obsidian didnt do enough test playing here
after weeks of gaming all of a sudden my game freezes up all the time
i cant go more than about three minutes without my system freezing
it freezes when i save leaving corrupt files
it freezes when the level is too big or theres too much action hapening which is always
looking at various blogs every site lists glitch after glitch after glitch
characters showing up and not talking when a dialogue screen pops up
glitches with lightsabers
trouble with characters in your party getting killed when you spar them to advance the story lineperosonally ive tried everything to fix my lockup glitch but i pretty much have to flush my  hours and start over
not a pleaseant prospect
i havent seen this many glitches since i played enter the matrix on xbox last yearaside from the glitches youll also be a bit lost at the story line
youre playing a character with memory loss and the interaction and discussion with other npcs never really fill you in
its a good  hours before any of that back story starts to make any senseon the positive side i love the game play
the new prestige classes and lightsaber forms are sweet
the improved interface the new powers and combat options those are great too
you can even play a martial artist who is on par with a jedi or a blaster king
its a fun game if it lets you play itif you liked the first kotr and dont mind random stupid glitches either slowing you down or in my case ruining yoru entire experience get this game
otherwise go get gta san andreasi really hated this game
i gave it two stars because the graphics are nice so that was the only thing that kept me playing and the fact that i hate to give up
but the game play was horrible
i hated that you could look at things that had no relation to the story or to help with puzzles
why on earth would i want to look in an empty cubby or pick up a tea pot that was not used elsewhere
the story is okay but the music and the over here this way voices are annoying because they dont actually mean anything
not to mention there is no closed caption and you cant figure out what people are saying in the few areas they do talk to you
the only interaction with other characters is contrived and boring
there was a lot of reading of materials that didnt really help move the story forward and could have been better done
the navigation was hopelessly annoying and very easy to get lostdont waste your money on this one
play syberia insteadthis is the first puzzle game ive purchased and it was hard
if it wasnt for the cheats and shortcuts site i found i would have never gotten past the first puzzle
the graphics are great but again not an easy puzzle
if your a novice at puzzle games like i am stay away from this one
wish i had found an easier game to start with that would have stirred my interest if looking for more puzzle games
think ill stick with my strategy games such as pharaohguild wars is a truly unique game indeed a mixture of genius and stupidity
i wont make my review long by repeating what others have pointed out i will talk about factors i havent read others mention yetas others have stated repeatedly guild wars requires no monthly payment to play
this premise could lead one to think that theyd have less money to pay good developers and hence might be a lesser game with mediocre graphics and cheesy content to make a quick buck
surprisingly not at all
i have played everquest  for several years and i have to say that guild wars graphics in terms of characters and environments are the best compared to any other online game ive ever played which are ultima online world of warcraft star wars galaxies and everquest 
their nature environments were created with excruciating detail and with stunning beauty ive seen only in singleplayer rpg games
this for me was a stunning positive surprise and their d terrain in my humble opinion is a work of artistic geniusbut there is one thing guild wars has done very poorly  their d camera angle management
this is the only game ive ever played that makes humongous automatic vertical angle adjustments on your view at the slightest move of a mouse
when you encounter an enemy mob youd want to adjust your vertical view so your target is in plain clear view but depending on your environment ie
if there are walls big rocks etc
the game could swing your vertical view almost  degrees up or down at the slightest move of your mouse
this has led to situations where i got killed because i could no longer see the enemy and could not move the camera angle to bring the enemy back in view
i have been in battles where it was such a major struggle just to stablize my view of the enemy mob and this factor has caused me an inordinate amount of exasperation especially when it led to the death of my entire group
you see once you beat the primary game scenario you will have the option to explore the areas in hard mode where all mobs are pumped up in level and in number
with this automatic vertical camera angle the game does to me i have died all the more frequently
ive stopped playing hard mode altogetheryou may also have read from the other reviews that this game is all instanced except in towns
this simply means you only get to see other people in towns or if you invite them into your group and adventure within an instance
communitywise this game is simply inferior to all the other online games ive ever played
in fact i will go so far as to say that i have felt  of the time that i was playing a singleplayer game
now im not the kind of player who likes to socialize that much in online games but even i started feeling lonelyoverall it is just too bad
guild wars is a very wellplanned game in many ways with the most beautiful environments i have ever seen to date but this laudible accomplishment is tainted by the difficulty of maneuvering within the game due to automatic camera angle adjustments
i think the developers didnt play this game if they did then they should kick themselves for allowing this to happen because for this player it really killed my funlastly guild wars  is underway and theyve announced that your characters in the current guild wars are not migratable
i dont know how wise this is but maybe they shouldve allowed a minor migration
for example maybe they couldve decided to give a slight credit to all the accomplishments of a character in guild wars  perhaps in the form of some ingame object something that wont give former players too much of an advantage over new players and yet make them feel that the playing time they did in guild wars  has not been all wastedguild wars is unique in their business model ie no monthly payments and clearly demonstrates talent amongst their art designers game designers and developers
it astounds me to see such enormous talent making glaring oversights which when rectified could easily establish guild wars as the top mmorpg game in the industryi frankly just burned my  bucks with this game
this game is bad with a capital b
there is something seriously missing from this gameif you are a star wars fanthe force is unusally weak with this one
i find it hard to fanthom how so many people are claiming this game to be the next best thing since sliced bread
trust me its notthis game doesnt feel like an mmo its mostly a persistent single player online game
one of the main attraction of an mmo is to be able to see other people running around in a persistent world
you can wave them help them out have a chitchat or maybe even duke it out if they are hostile to you
there is no such aspect to this game
every mission is instanced its just you or your guild or ai henchmanai lacks and they feel like npcs too
you dont get to see anyone elsethey are invisible walls in this game everywhere
unlike many other mmos you just cant walk over to where you please like in a real persistent world
instead you are forced to follow and play along a path chosen for you
for egyou are going on the road and there is a nice waterfall you see some distance away
so you decide to walk down the hill and check it out
surprisethere is a invisible wall blocking your way
you have to stay on the roadit was all just a illusion or some cosmetic matte painting
this cuts down the real virtual world factor right there and than
your only chance of seeing a group of people is in the cities and the way the game is setup you wont be spending much time in cities anyway
the city further lack the community feeling with no inns housing or gathering places everyone just stands in the middle of the townas far as rpg element is concerned the classes and their powers are poorly setup
only  of your skills can be used at any time
i want to be able to use more than  skills sometimes
combining two clases is a good idea but the  skills limitation further cuts down the charm of this aspectthere is no player run economy as to speakyou sell stuff to npcs ho hum
player run economy is an absolute must in my view for an mmo to get some sense of realismpvp is where this game really falls apart
this mmo strong point was its pvp aspect however this is where it fails the most
instead of providing a real war like feeling that is so well done in world of warcraft this game throws you in team based instanced arenas
just imagine playing a online fps like unreal tournament or counterstrike with fantasty characters as well as weapons and you will get the complete picture
dont expect to be the ubber champ if you havent first played the pve aspect of the game lvl   and unlocked specials skills
because you get the standard lvl  template for those classes if you decide to just go pvp but not the special skills that you can unlock if you had tried the pve aspect first
some of those pve learned special skills are clearly superior to the standard pvp template and players already know this aspect and have learned to exploit it
so it means that whether you want to do pve or not you will have to if you want to be really good in pvp and reaching to lvl  is still a timeintensive pve grind
now i come to my biggest complaint when it comes to pvp
so many people are touting strategy and true skillbased pvp in this game
well the truth is far from it
unless you have established guild with people you know you will be thrown into random  man teams with each player specilizing in certain skills like  is ranger  is tank etc you are forced to group to pvp whether you like it or not forget about any sniper or solo support role
not to my surprise this random team of unknown people falls apart rather quickly
most of the teams i have played in like to just rush in or charge without any ryhme or reason and resulting mayhem causes utter confusion with the victor being a warior or someone who can mash buttons the fastest
or everyone just go into different directions once they get into arena and you are pretty much on your own and good luck here if you a pure ranger
there is no strategy atall that i have seen any team discuss or even apply so far
another huge pitfall is those invisible walls blocking you from striking at the opposing player
if say you are on a hill and you see the opposing players down below
well you think that you have a strategic advantage here dont you escpecially if you are a full fledge rangerelementalist
surpriseyou just cant attack them in most cases because of those invisible costcutting walls and have to run down the long winding preset path to get them and in the meantime giving your position away
so forget about launching a surprise attack on anyone in most cases which is one of the major forte of true pvp
you will see many more pitfalls especially the feeling that there is no real war going on in this game
there is really no gain or charm from pvp except just for the thrill of doing pvp
you character dont gain anything
pvp should be a integral part of the game rpg aspect not some side wrestling matchlast but not least the character creation is worst of any recent mmos i have played so far
some of characters look like misfits out of a bad gothic heavy metal groupjust have a look at the game necromancer
others look like drag queenssorry not to offend anyone its just a quip
ontop of it you just have few templates and cosmetic choices to apply
as a result most people end up looking much the same with a real bad wadrobe case
and dont get me started at the warior template
supposedly the warrior is the start all and end all class
what we get is an overweight and bald extra reject from the gladiator moviethis is the end of my rant
if you look at my other reviews i give credit where its due and discredit where it is also due
this game is far from what some people are making it to be
there is a reason this game is not charging you a monthly fee and it shows
read all the reviews and make a educated guess its just that there are far better real mmos out there too
dont let fanboys or overly exicited people mislead you
this game tries to do a lot of things all at the same time while cutting costs but in the end ends up doing nothing well
nomonthly fee here is a doubleedged sword here
i for one will throw this game into my garbage can and they can forget me ever getting buying their other expansions
i got suckered once because of all hoop laa that surrounds this gamebut no moreif you area someone who likes to spend a lot of time in chat rooms going lol lmao rotflmao
or repetitively typing other chat acronymsorb someone who enjoy press your mouse button over and over and killing monsters ie
hack and slashyou will probably enjoy this gameits really too bad
the developers obviously spent a lot of time making this game and there is even some good history and plot lines in the game
but it just doesnt pan out maybe its the other players that are involved im not sure but it just doesnt benefit the rping genre very welli think their intention was to take out all player conflict and relieve all consequences of dying or losing
the problem with having nothing to lose is that you really have nothing to gain
there is no player conflict between loot and you cant fight each other except in a controlled environment where there are no consequences to losingim sure the younger audiences will enjoy this game as it certainly looks pretty but it just doesnt cut it as an rpgmy views on games are always fair so i say this to be completely firm and honestdont buy this game unless you arent looking for a mmorpgthis clearly isnt one
when i tried it out i wasnt impressed
it was boring
the limited cities
only encounting other players in cities
no feel for real growth in my character
no real endgame or set purpose in leveling
again this may be good for a quick log on and play but i wasnt even remotedly impressed overallnow the graphics are really nice but unless you are seeking a arcade type game
so id have to say all the other reviewers are blowing this up more than it is
i found it not fun and rather boringtake your basic diablo  hack and slash model upgrade the graphics a little cut the level cap to  and make it online only and you get guildwarsyes its an mmo and yes you dont have to pay per month but this game gets old fast
if you play the game for  minutes then youve might as well have played the entire game
there are very few difference between classes and the pvp system is incredibly limited
also the social structure of the whole game was murdered
unlike the good mmos of today your interaction with other players is very limited
altogether i feel this game was a huge failurehere are the positives of the gamenice graphics yet little system straina half way decent computer can play this game with easecolorful sceinairyand now for the bad parts of the gamerepeative gameplayno original ideas inventedmissions are boringlack of character classeslack of character modelssmall level cappoor player verse playertoo easyweak player interactionlimited item selection for armoraltogether i strongly advise against getting this game
if you want to play an mmorpg get world of warcraft
guild wars just doesnt cut itconcept your home country of osea is under attack by an invading nation
lead a handful of fighter pilots on a variety of missions in a variety of planes to repel the invadersgraphics wow
photorealistc aircraft and terrain make this game absolutely beautiful
realistic weather and altitude effects add to the mix to provide an absolutely stunning visual experiencesound aircraft engine and weapon sound effects were great as were the sound of targets being destroyed
you see the explosion then you hear it
very nice now the game sound is another point that i dont like
the radio chatter although nice at first gets very annoying very fast
you hear ground forces arguing about who is better and your fellow pilots also complain about some of the most inane stuff imaginable all during the heat of battle
however the catch is that the radio chatter sometimes provides key mission updates
radio or no radio
that is the questioncontrol nice and tight just like ace combat  although now you use the dpad to issue wingman orders
nothing much new to report as far as controls are concernedwhats new now you can issue wingman orders and decide what fighters the three other pilots in your squadron fly
you can have some in airsuperiority fighters while others buzz the deck in ground attackers
its all up to youoverall i had this game for about  days before i took it back
i got so sick of the lame dialogue and the silly cant we all just get along
message that was so pervasive throughout this game
dont get me wrong i think that real war is terrible and should be avoided especially if it isnt necessary current world events but a game with combat in its title shouldnt be so dn preachy
also there is very little variety to the combat
some missions are airtoair others are airtoground and others are a mix
but after a while the idea of fly around do some rolls and loops shoot down some fighters take out some tanks end of mission gets old
anyway fans of the ace combat series will dig this one i guess i just lost interestthis is a pretty good game
challenging levels outstanding graphics good gameplay semieasy controlsm but it sucks for just one tiny reason
when you get to the last level you will not see the ending
the last level is impossible
just for that reason that one reason is why this game turned from  to  stars
i say rent it for fun but do not waste your moneythis boring waste of money is one of the best games to make you fall asleep
you have to fly for minutes to find a enemy and then you have to find nine more
while it takes forever to shoot them with your machine guns because you run out of missiles from the first five enemies
if i were you i would get somthing thats actually funprepare to hear that a few thousand times because the npcs yell it in every encounter
also the ever popular i have visual contacti am very disappointed with this game
its hard after playing the pc version not to compare the two
the graphics are really subpar compared to the pc version
it was crystal clear and you could see forever
in this game everything seems a bit blurry and far away objects are in a mist
lighting and colors seem a little off at timesprobably the worst aspect of this game is the terrible ai
the npcs just kind of mope around
even when they see you they just stand in one place and shoot you maybe move around a bit but even their movements look very awkward
i find no need for stealth at all
i can simply run up to them and shoot them in the face
in the pc version i had to plan my attacks because the npcs were smartin a way i think there are too many vehicles
my problem with them is that you can jump on a vehicle and bypass tons of content
youll pass little groups of npcs and have no reason to shoot them just drive right past them
ive probably bypassed half the content in this game by simply driving past itsniping was amazing in the pc version
now there just isnt much of a need for itvoice acting can be rather lacking
sometimes i cant even hear important parts of the dialog because background music or sounds drowned it out
and some text that explains certain aspects of the story flash by so fast you dont have a chance to read themget yourself ready for the f word
im   i have no problem with cursing if it serves a purpose and creates the right emotion
it seems they use profanity in this just for the sake of using profanity
maybe they think it will impress  year olds but i just found it cheesynot backwards compatible with the   thank goodness i didnt have to pay for this game as i got it from a friend who cant use it on his im not going to go into the story because i really dont care about the story
they didnt do anything to peak my interests with the story
i just ran around shooting stuffmuch more linier than the original
i find invisible walls everywhere
even in boats
i got in a small boat and couldnt figure out what i kept running into
i wasnt near the edge of the map i was in a little cove
i jumped out too see if i was hitting some kind of reef or other obstruction
nope just an invisible wall
all i wanted to do was go around the island to flank them
you dont have near as many choices in paths to takethe pc version was a masterpiece
trying to compare farcry instincts with farcry is like trying to compare halo  to halo   sometimes they just cant top the original or you just expect way too much
it really feels like a whole different team or company made this gameok the single player is great with sweet tropical island graphics and make your own tropical island in map editor which could have been way better
ok get this  if your signed off when you make a map you cant share that map online ever not even when you sign on you have to be signed on while making a map to share it with other people
the online play sux
thats wear the gameplay goes down
horrible servers with many stupid people on the game
finding a room without a stupid annoying trash talking person in it is like winning the lottery
unfairness rules over this game so you constantly are running into people with duel guns and you only have one
if you get annoyed by snipeing stay far far away cause you will get a lot of that
everytime you leave a room you have to resign in which takes a bit and gets annoying
if you want a game worthwhile trade in farcry for battlefield  thats what i did
even though i only got  bucks for farcry when i paid  id rather get rid of that piece of junk
this game has very bad online supportthis game is mediocre at best
it is a fantasy medieval war game with mixes of rpg action and tactics thrown in
you command a squad of soldiers with certain skills and equipment and you get to control the leader in combat hacking up the enemies and doing special movesthe first few missions were fun and getting to improve the leader and the army was fun as well  but it gets old very fast
there is very little surprise or innovation on the part of the character development or story progression
in fact if youve played other rpg or fantasy games youll notice the typical formula in this one  which is not bad if you like that stylethe graphics sound and performance were great  but it had a modern musical score with electric guitars and hard rock
doesnt bother me but it does detract from the flavor of the gameall said the game is repetitive early on with very little in the way of excitement to offer
players may enjoy the action  if you like buttonmashing this is full of it
the graphics and bloodshed are great and will satisfy the action  gore fanatics out theretake carei gave this game about  hours to become fun and ultimately i wish i had those  hours back
youll be excited when you get cavalry but that excitement will disappear quickly when you realize you have to manually run them back and forth through the enemy while your hero is getting sliced up and that you have to do this with a very clunky camera system
i think for realtime strategic war games youre better off on a pc
pick up starcraft or any of a thousand other rts title out there that blow kuf awaythis is a down grade from pop 
i cannot believe ubisoft did this the whole game is unbalanced
it goes from ez to hard in seconds the puzzels anit fun
the graphics and the music rox though
the combo system is cheap
i beat it but im never playin it again
hopefully pop  will be betteri dont like popww as much as popsot
its ok i think they changed the entire game by focusing too much on the battle system including a lot of bloodyou still have the cool moves like running along the wall but this game reminds me of a shooter game
all fight and nothing else
the first one had a sense of humor a good story puzzles a perfect amount of fighting and a fun side kick
now you have this ugly obnoxious barely clothed woman that you have to fight through the game and its really boring
why do game developers always have to make drastic changes
pop sands of time was a great game
if it aint broke dont fix it
im just sorry that i bought it
i should have rented it firstwhen i completed the first prince of persia video game i felt that i had acutally accomplished something rather challenging and fun the gameplay and graphics in the first pop
was indeed a sight to be hold with its share of flaws the storyline was straight forward and didnt try to hide itself behind large words that have smaller rephrases if you catch my meaning
in other words the sands of time needed not a sequel because the ending felt as though it had completed the story in and of itself see van helsingi thought the first game was absoultely great but the sales for the game were sadly not what ubisoft had hoped for but they shouldve expected that the usa is in the middle of a war with iraq formerly known as persia and the prince is indeed a persian there arent many people who like iraq im not pointing fingers or being racial most of the us population does not like iraq or its people because they believe their the cause of the war and possibly  in my opinionso when i heard there was going to be a sequel i wasnt jumping for joy
the gameplay is no major improvement the prince still does most of his usual attacks and wall running although there were tweaks and new attacksmoves put in the game the puzzles are tougher and your bound to get lost within the dark laybrinth of the island the prince is on there are boss battles and as far as a story goes its mot muchten years after the first game the prince is on the run from his socalled fate because he was supposed to have died because he released the sands of time so in order to save his life he embarks on a quest to destroy the sands of time before they are ever created thus stopping his ever opening the hourglass that started the entire mess hes in
during this time the prince meets two scantly dressed women in red and black who either want to kill him or supposedly help him
the princes new look and darker persona is anythiing but appealing they dont even keep the same voice actor that used in the first game
the warrior within is basically a game spawned from sales tatics the violence bloodgore swearing and mildnudity and suggestive themes is simply ubisofts tatical plan to draw more sales because the first one didnt have as much as theyd hoped as i said before
which is a sad thing in their case because the mature content in this sequel is a sign of despration
now im not complaining im simply giving you my opinion
if youre going to buy the warrior within then expect major changes and overkill in some of the content
 no ratingthese opinions are strictly based on the demoubis version of prince of persia came as a surprise last year because this franchise had so many bad sequels that nobody really thought it still has a future
but ubi managed to create an excellent game with a distinct look and excellent controls and level design
they also brought and implemented perfectly the concept of controlling time thus avoiding the main complaints about the pop games most of them dealt with frustrating jumping puzzles and instant deathunfortunately though even if it was a critic darling sands of time sot did not sell as expected  mostly the effect of having so many bad sequels
so for the second installment on xbox ubi was forced to listen to the complaints and change the game
this though is the main problem with this sequel
while changes tend to be good in general these ones do not applythe main change is the fighting system
warrior within ww made the transition from a tomb raider type of gameplay to a ninja gaiden one
for some this may be a blessing and especially early magazine reviewers seem to enjoy it
to me though this pretty much ruined the game
from an intelligent and interesting game this became nothing else than random button pressing trying to get the perfect combo
i would have preffered to have more exploration not a mortal kombat fighting
in fact pop always seemed to be more about avoiding traps and solving puzzles than about doing combos
and while the fighting system in sot was indeed flawed at least it was not a big part of the game
now  like it or not  you will have to either learn these combos or avoid the game entirelythe second change is with the graphics
what made sot so special was its distinct look and gorgeous graphics
ww should have improved on this but instead this is a step back
the blur effect and vivid colors are gone replaced by two colors black and brown
the game looks common and uninteresting and the lack of blur makes the textures look very poor
why would ubi change  again  something that was working still a mystery to me
especially now when the blur effect is copied in all games fable being the latestin the end it looks like a group of players and reviewers changed the direction this game was following and ww is the end product
while some may enjoy this changes for the fans of exploration and solving puzzles this is a major step back
to me this game was dumbed down to appeal to the masses and in the process it lost its identityi will not buy this game but i hope the sequel  if there will be any  will return to its roots as captured in soti just got finished playing the demo of this game and i have to say that it feels like the developers are pandering to the  year old grundge beat em up gamers out there
what was once a charming and enthralling experience is now a mountain dew commercial
worst of all theres far more fighting and rediculously hard bosses so you can just forget about completing this one until the cheats come out
why do developers do things like thisthis game was okay it was to quick meaning the bar health like virtua fighter soul calibar and dead or alive the bar health goes down to fast being that the attacks are powerfull that makes the game less as fun cause you play for like  minute then the computer is defeted or you are defeted thats to quick but this game was okay the story mode sucked and this is kinda the same as part so this was an okay game if you want to play it then rent it its not worth buyingi have always been a fan of fighting games
as far as d ones go i have great experience in the dead or alive series and proficiency with soul calibur   i fear that dead or alive and soul calibur may have spoiled me though
recently i bought mortal kombat deception and found it horribly awkward compared to the fluid battles of soul calibur or dead or alive
i felt the same way when i played tekken   unlike the graceful and awesome animations of dead or alive or soul calibur the movements of the characters in tekken  are unrealistic and absurd
try out christie in tekken  for example
her idle animation is preposterous
if you have access to dead or alive  try putting out leifang
her idle animation is a thing of beauty
every one of her moves flows perfectly from one to the next
this kind of grace is seriously lacking in the clunky tekken and now let us speak of character design
tekken s characters are boring and uninspired
they run the gamut from miscellaneous boxer    and  to miscellaneous karate fighter    and   oh
there are also a few shrieky girls in tight clothing some of which seem to be asian if thats your thing
and then theres a guy in a cat mask
as awesome as that sounds it looks silly in the gameif you have ever played practice mode on dead or alive you will probably recall with fondness that there is a feature that shows each move command at the top of the screen and keeps it there until you successfully perform that move
this feature as useful as it is is not present in tekken   to be fair it isnt found in any other fighting game that i have played but it really should bewithout further ado let me simply say that i do not recommend buying tekken  if you have ever played soul calibur or dead or alive
the intro video is about as much excitement as the game can offer i especially enjoyed the suicidal bicycle girl that rescued the kitten
but at least mortal kombat deception had puzzle kombat which rocked my socksyes
tekken  i yelled at the top of my lungs running to the arcade to get my sweaty hands on top of those already greasy smelly  germ filled joysticksi would go through anything to play a new tekken gameor so i thought
nevertheless when heading to the arcade it was already packed duh japan right
though i waited my turn and eventually headed to the station
when first playing the game i was amazed by the graphics but was equally discouraged due to the terrible musicits like cheap techno made by pots and pans
anyways everyone their seeing me as a foreigner laughed their asses off when seeing me sit downwondering why i soon did
picking some of my favorite characters like jin and kazuya and even law i lost everytime no contest
but i then picked raven one character i never experienced due to the newness of the game
i said what the hell and just started going berserk on the keyboardwhat do you know i beat the opponent and was feeling proudwell not really
all i did was press a whole bunch of buttons
it feels like tekken is changing
me being the giant tekken fan i am not big enough to make my own joystick pad knew that playing tekken was no laughing matter and it took all skill from what i remember
but tekken  has turned a new coin over
as i pulled out my few more yen out for exchange for tokens i immediatley stopped my hand for the outcome of that deed
i knew what was going to happen
either i randomly press buttons and win or play like i mean it and loose
so i waited until my friend got it
i bought it too around  weeks ago being in the heart of tokyo but i was confused on what namco is doing
i called up some of my friends and we emailed the namco designers themselves
they described their need in changing tekken from its former self
if i recall soul calibur and its series was full of pointless punching and kicking and took no skill at all
similar to the great hit guilty gear which involved no skill whatsoever
so what do i doi complain my heart out
tekken is turning into shty old soul calibur who wants that
the music sucks and so does the fighting systems
i loved the old tekken i think ill just stick to that
i am a diehard tekken fan and still love tekken but whoever you are rent tekken before you waste your money
if only i could get my hands on soul reaverwow
this game looks great
when it comes out ive got to buy ityeah the commericals made this game look way better than it is it almost was made to look better than socom iiwell awhile back i rented this game to give it a shot
i absolutely hated this game fromt he start
here are the reasons totally unacceptable loading times they litterally take up to  or  minutes each time
the camera view the angle you play your character at is horrible
its like you are playing over his shoulder and its just really hard to control him
also bad thing about this game is how the map is useless and doesnt tell you how to complete the missions so you have to use your headdont buy this game as a favor to me and youre well earned moneywow
this game is awful
i rented it to compare it to the xbox version
ooh
that wasnt a good idea
the graphics are nowhere as good the gameplay is terrible
ps got gyped on the online play as well
no coop
i dont know if either ubisoft is just lazy or dont know how to utilize the ps hardware
id stay away from this game
i recommend ghost recon jungle storm
its more fun  better onlineits not even the same game as other ghost recon games
they shouldve just named it something else
you cant operate two teams or even control your squad
it might as well be a single shooter game
also when an area is cleared unlimited enemy soldiers will spawn out of nowhere to ambush you making it impossible to snipe attack or use any real tactics
also the whole way through a level your stuck in a funnel making it impossible to flank maneuver any or the opposition
prepare to be repeatedly killed until you learn where your enemy is shooting you from
start in a kill box stay in the kill box be killed like the fish in the bucket that you are
i was so aggravated i never even finished itif anyone ever compares the ghost recon series to socom they are completely insane
socom is so far and away the better game ghost recon  is so linear it forces you to play every mission the same way
your teammates are useless and will actually grenade themselves more often than not
at least in socom they would follow your orders once in awhile
ghost recon just has you in front all the time getting shot at while they wait behind
youre forced to run into ambushes constantly and you cant leave certain sections of the map to try different attack angles
there are invisible walls set up to keep you trapped like a rat
please pass on this series and stick w socom   or this game 
its very hard and the camera angles are annoying
i got to the rd level and then i gave up
the missions are long and you cant save
even if you liked ghost recon ghost recon jungle storm or any other tom clancy game dont get thisthe game simply doesnt live up to its prequel
you no longer have the option to switch between soliders there is no strategy as you now comand only one team and can not order them around a map only give them useless comands that you will hardly use
the maps are extreamly linear and you cant choose youre own path but go down the one the computer forces you to
there are fewer weapons to choose from and most of them are very similar and the ai is just terrible or maybe its the oppisite the ai is too good unrealisticly good
example i was playing a mission where it is pitch black you use night vision and raining hard
i was sticking to the bushes and hiding behind rocks sneaking up on an enemy camp i knew was ahead
then all of a sudden through the darkness rain bushes and boulders every solider in the camp instantly turns tward me and just opens fire with  of all the bullets hitting me square in the headthis might be forgivable if you could switch to other team members after dieing but this is not so if you die its game over
and missions can get very long and ther is no inmission quick save
in short i hve played for almost  hours and am still on level four
and over time ive just come to like this game less and less
the only reason i have given this game  stars is because online is decient but not nearly good enough to warent a purchase if youa re a hard core fan of the original rent it but every one else i would recomend the first ghost recon over this one any dayi bought this game with a great deal of anticipation
i had absolutely loved the first game and i even hail that game as one of the best scifi rpgs of all time
i got this game and was immediately immersed in the opening scenes and first few steps of gameplay
when i got to the first boss fight that wasnt a flash back i was swept with a deep despairi realized that i absolutely hated this game with all my heart and soulthis game is the biggest disappointment ive experienced since i played final fantasy  which i personally think was the worst game in that series
they kept the same characters though with a few disappointing voice cast changes  they upgraded the character design models well most of them and they still had the same amazing story that made me love the first one
the story in this game actually delves deeper into the complexity of the world this game is set in and answers several questions left over from the first game as well as adding new ones
everything was generally kept the same but as with all rpgs in a series people always assume that they need to completely change part of the operational makeup of the game to add a new feel something that doesnt make you feel like youre playing the same game again
more often than not its the battle system in this case it was one of the biggest mistakes in gaming historygame informer called this game a dropped ball of devil may cry  proportions and they were right
the battle system in this game has something to do with zones and certain attack forms that correspond to them it really doesnt matter
all you need to know is that the enemies remain at about the same level of strength as they were in the previous game but the strength of your characters is severely handicapped
all of the relished special attacks and super moves from the first game are gone and replaced with pale little sissy slaps that conveniently have the same names
i actually had to have characters wait to charge up points to launch a succession of attacks much like you did in the first game to use special moves just to be able to inflict as much damage as a casual kick did in the first game
this makes fighting in this game the most frustrating and completely uninteresting part of the entire game and this being an rpg after all it encompasses  of the freaking gamei played through to the end dont ask me how i tolerated doing it itll just piss me off more and in terms of the story it was a homerun
the story is once again amazing but sadly carries all the depth the game has to offer
if this had been a  hour animated film it would have been worthwhile but as a game this is a pale imitation of the greatness of xenosaga  if youre curious about the story buy a cheap copy of it use a cheat machine to blast through the game quick soak up all there is to the story and then sell it or return it
you wont feel bad there isnt any game to be played here beyond watching the cutscenesin all honestly how could a game series take this big of a step backward
i mean even the best or most average of game series take a while and a few bad sequels to degrade to such a point example mega man xx
how could one even work on the development team with a straight consciousnesses knowing you were developing and planned to release such a inferior product
these are the questions about xenosaga ii that keep me up at nightbut seriously no i dont say up at odd hours of the night pondering about what xenosaga ii could have should have been for as great as the original was and the amount of hype this game received xenosaga ii is a perfect example of a almost complete bustfirst off the game is way to short
i was really surprised i was on disc  after  hours of gameplay
im not quite sure but does xenosaga ii use dual layer dvds like the first xenosaga cause if it does and thats all they put on the first disc thats pretty sad
its almost seems they put it on two normal dvds instead of a dual layer disc just to give the player the illusion that because its two discs it must be a  long game
nice marketing tactic guys gamers arent as dumb as you thinkxenosaga iis battle system is absolutely horrendous its up there with legend of dragoons battle system in my book i love to bash that game to no end
expect to die a few times and spend a few hours taking a severe beating especially if your battle party is surrounded by enemies  thats the definition of fun
until you get the hang of it
add to the fact the longer you take to enter a command the more likely the enemy is going to boost and slap you around in the next turn
to add to this atrocity add the fun of constantly stocking and boosting attacks in conjunction with airing and downing a opponent to cause any kind of reasonable damage
then add to that fact not all characters can damage airborne opponents
combat in xenosaga i may have been a little basic and simplistic but at least it was easy to pickup and learn you almost need a degree or a really good guide to get anywhere in xenoaga ii
oh and dont get me started on the mech or es
combat
while character combat is confusing to no end es
combat is so pathetically simple it makes the gear combat in xenogears look good in comparisonas for side quests add another point to the lame column
 sub quests helping complete strangers out of their stupid insignificant daily problems they wont remember a week from now while the fate of the universe swings in the balance of your quests success
yeah sure that sounds like fun as well
if i dont like to help complete strangers within the real world with their problems what makes game developers think i want to do it in a video game
come ongraphically xenosaga ii is pretty much the same as the original which makes me wonder why they hyped up that part of the game so much
do they think gamers are so fixated on that lone aspect of a game they are willing to forgive flaws in execution and gameplay
i mean you can take the most graphically gorgeous game and if the gameplay stinks the game as whole suffers
xenosaga ii as a game proves this theory without a doubtas for sound or music you actually better off turning the volume off unless youre viewing a cut scene
most of the music is pretty bad a slim few interesting tracks do exist and the voice acting is decent outside battle that is
in battle the voices make you cringe where talking star ocean the nd story sound bite territory here
momo has to be the worst the first time you hear her say ill lend support you just want reach though the tv screen or hope she reaches puberty before the series is overon the plus side yes their is a plus side  surprisingly xenosaga iis story continues on the rich tale from the first game even if it seems a little touch and go and they seem to focus too long on certain characters the first disc is basically jr and momo centered the second disc plays like hey we forgot about the core of the story lets go find the zoharthe bottom line if you like the story you should play xenosaga ii despite all it shortcomings
actually id recommend renting the game instead of buying it its short enough and itll teach the developers a very meaningful lesson
if this game becomes a greatest hit like the original id be very suprised but it probably will just because i said thati bought this game because i thought it might be a good game to play
but i didnt get very far in playing it
i was really disappointed and felt that i had waisted my money
the game strategy is very complicated
i just couldnt understand and handle itlong loading times at the start of every battle
a battle system that forces you to fight a certain way a certain way that makes even the trivial random encounters take  minutes per battle
a short main story arc with dozens of annoying side quests that will have you spend more time walking from point a to point b namely between nd miltia and the kukai foundation than you will doing everything else in the entire gamethe story even seems to lag a bit in the beggining but luckily the second half of the game or so seems to pick up the pace
as the cutscenes and story are good but seem lacking compared to the first one as well
albedo can only laugh maniacally for  minutes straight a couple of times before it gets olddid i enjoy playing the game
no
do i recomend it
no
butsince i plan on playing the rd episode as well which is supposed to be much better i trudged my way through itok heres the news on thug  and a comparison to thug  this game was a severe dissapointment i cant believe how much better thug  was
i have beaten all of the games in the tony hawk series but i just couldnt will myself into playing this for more than a half hour
the primary flaw in this game is the story mode or lack there of
the story mode starts completely randomly and has very little meaning due to the lack of cut scenes and poor concept
it starts by you getting kidnapped sounds intriging right
wrong
the next cut scene shows bam and tony standing over you and tell you that for no reason at all they want to go on a world destruction tour
ok the concepts still got you hooked but not for long
so you head off to a get acquainted level and then to boston
thats still just fine with me im still slightly interested
now this is where the boat sinksm youre skater has a list of goals that have absolutely no meaning at all
go find this guy in the level
what kind of mission id that and how does that relate to freakin skating
other missions are very similar in the fact that they dont relate to skating
these missions are designed to be destructive and punklike yet their just not entertaing
one of the new features is being able to switch characters on the run but they are often hard to unlock and their id a new set of goals with each character
even if you liked the idea of switching characters its impossible to switch and then switch back because you have to find a specific spot where your skaters are stationed and they are completely randomwhen you complete a level there bassicly is no significance to the following cut scene it just tells you about the next level
all the theatrical elements in the plot of thug just dissapeer in thug and i cant understand why
there is no reason to be doing what your doing theres no rival because you have to keep switching teams and the levels are horrible compared to thug
the only reason to by this game would be for classic mode which follows the thps format and is still fun
ive been playing tony hawk games since the original in  and have loved them all
i absolutely adored thugs concept and was able to complete that game in under  hours while loving every seconed of itthis is just not the way to follow up a game of the year neversoft as a fan im upset with the lack of creativity
the comparison is pathetic but ill give you my opinion of the score card anywaythug  thugcontrolls    stroy mode plot    sound    fun    levels    lasting ability   still playin   give it a  hourtotal out of     i loved underground
it is one of the best games i have ever played and i still enjoy playing it
thug  is disappointing
the graphics dont seem as good as the original underground and the plot which made underground so different from the previous games in the series is weak
i have owned all the games in the series and this game is the first one i feel did not meet expectationspros it has the moves of underground along with a few new additions
when you get special you can increase your adreline and slow time down to make moves seem more intense and even a little easier
when you are not on your board you can graffiti you can put stickers on wallscons the graphics do not seem as good
the plot is weak
it is not as easy to figure out where to go for the goals
the game feels more like work then play and because of that is not as much fun as the originalit seems like the game was thrown together so it could be ready for christmas and try to exploit the original underground
save your money and rent it before you consider buying itok thug  is a well planned out well thought out and just plain fun game
i liked all the hidden characters you could be
i liked some of the crazy moves you could bust out beaver blasting construction workers was a personal favorite
i liked watching bam torment fellow skaters with some hillarios jokes
just admit it the game is very well doneif it were a movie game for the movie jackass
this game was not at all true skateboarding which threw me off though not entirely having played the first thug already i expected more skateboarding and less idiotic stunts and whose to say i was pleased
very dissapointed though the custom skater mode was top notch
but i expected more out of neversoft when they pulled out this game and i can only hope that tony hawk american wastland wont belong in the dusty old garbage bin that the thug games landed themselves inunless you just enjoy looking at nina skip this entry in the tekken spinoffsigh
ea sports has done it again created a basketball game that gets some things right but totally blows it on others
i guess ill break this thing up into catagoriesgraphics perfect example
everything looks really good even some  months later the players look like their reallife counterparts the arenas look good and are faithful recreations and then the plastic wrap
a few other reviewers mentioned it
basically it looks like the players were put in an oven with clear heat shrink
like they are silver and someone just polished it
despite this oddity how does stuff like this make it to the final product
because its honestly the first thing you notice id give graphics sound its fine
the commentary gets repetative but thats to be expected
they cant have a random comment generator
crowd is nice too although ea still lacks the capacity in any of their games to make the crowd explode when i hit a three to win it i want the place to explode and the commentators to flip outgameplay again they cant put it all together
each version does something really well others really badly
then they try to fix it in the next version and just flip the faulty areasthe difficulty can be set in  modesrookie you can beat the pistons with the bobcats your first time out
just drive to the hoop and press layup
pointsstarter glorified rookie mode
easy yet
might give you a close game your first week or so
once you learn to play the game expect to easily double the other teams scoreallstar suddenly the cpu can play defense
really good defense
like have a player fly from  feet away to block your open layup attempt
have shaq rocked from behind by shawn bradley
meanwhile your offense has run dry
expect to shoot in the  percents a majority of the time
you will only make threes if you are wide open even then stovakavic will clank at least half
meanwhile for the cpu players like gary payton will play like a  year old reggie miller
nail threes in your face
drive to the hoop do a  and reverse the ball in
if you try to block their shot foul
yet they slap away similar shots with ease on the other endanyways it just seems like the computer has to cheat to play decently
ea sports just hasnt come up with a way to make the game challeneging and fair
tim duncan running down allen iverson on the break is just not realistici am still able to win on this mode like  of the time
mostly with similar teams though
dont even try playing the raptors against detriot or anythingsuperstar basically like beating bobby fischer at chess while getting pelted with rubber bullets
oh and youre blindfeatures awesome features
dynasty mode cool
although you should be able to make the whole salary cap thing a little more lax
gets pretty frustrating
allstar weekend is cool as well
although the slam dunk thing is basically worthless without a gamepad
unless you have three hands then you could maybe do all the moves
nba live  is chucked full of features though its very cool
however i think they should have dumped a few of them and concentrated more on the gameplay issueoverall again nba live has lots of great features but just becomes frustrating
its fun at first when youre terrible and the starter level games are exciting
once you get good though it really becomes a frustrating experience
to the point where you dont even want to play
there needs to exsist a difficulty thats like starts and got robbed and probably shouldve been on the bench for the allstar game
then maybe itd be fun
again the cpu has to cheat to remain competive and thats just not funhowever all the other features are really fun and its great to see if you can take a team like the blazers to the championship i simulate all the games and so far in year six they are almost here
also if you have someone to play against via gamepad or lan its also fun
a fastbreaking slamfest yes but at least youre playing it with your buddyagain ea sports gives us sniffs of glory but falls short of making a realistic basketball game
it may not be their fault basketball is a complicated game and very hard to simulate
instead of chucking a new version out every year maybe take a year off and work extra hard on i remember using my honda civic on need for speed underground  but unfortunately i bought the uk version and it is sucksarghi gave gary grisbys world at war many chances and i hate the whole game
i play as nazi germany
when the going gets good the next thing i know germany declares war on russia without my permission
yeah i know hitler did itbut who is playing the game me or him
if i decide to invade russia the allies decide to go against me with all its fury
at the same time japan is not helping me at all the japanese is so close to russia that it refuses to do anything against russia even though japan has joined forces with my country
some of the factories i have are completely useless because they will only make supplies
come on
i need tanks planes and infantry
but nooooi got to worry about the partisan attacks
then the allies decide to take over north africa
but i have my hands full already
why cant the stupid boat carry the resources over from north africa to my factories to help me out some
i cant even win the sea battle because my country is pretty much in last place when it comes to naval ship total
whatisreallythepointofmakingthisgame
ive tried everything possible and i cant seem to catch a break
gary grisbys world at war is an addicting game but it is virtually impossible to win even at the easiest easiest easiest level
it is also timeconsuming because the turns take forever
i plan to uninstall the game and forget it ever existed because im so eternally frustrated to have come so close but cant quite seal the deal because of some stupid circumstances which didnt necessarily have to happen that way
i really hate this game
give me command and conquer anytime over this piece of crap because i simplylike to win games
ive thought about playing germany and japan at the same time but i just got better things to dops
i just beat the game conquering the whole world for germany and achieving total victory
the game is quite lame and boring and i spent three marathon sessions in doing it so
once i figured out the formula the game becomes onedimensionalthe name gary grigsby sold this game for me
i gotta say this is just not up to my expectations
i cut my teeth on war in russia way back when
id play wirif i had a copy over this any day
contrary to many reviews i found this game overly simplistic
its on too grand a scale
time passes away in huge chunks
before i know it its  and i never feel like ive accomplished anything even though i may have reach a goali initially had high hopes for this game but after playing through the single player mode which is tiny and playing the online game for a while this game just isnt up to the standards halo  created
although i loved halo  i grew weary of the cheaters and lack of maps that it continues to offer at least until it is patched
project snowblinds online component is a mix between halo and rainbow six  black arrow
the graphics are similar to rainbow six and so is the set up so if you liked it then you would probably like snowblind
this is where i have a problem with the game the character models dont move realistically and tend to glitch up
the levels are bland and most of them look the same
i expected more on the xbox but apperently this game was ported over after being designed for the ps or the pc
i wish that companies would just build games from bottom up for the xbox and use its full potential
rd party games seem to always be subpar because they look like their ps counterparts
i took a break from halo but this game led me right back to playing it
despite its flaws halo is still the game to beat on console shooters and project snowblind is just another speedbump that halo has crushedfirst off this game had me hooked all the way till i got stuck and put the game down for a week after that week i started to realize why i didnt like the game
first off the game is very tedious im not a big fan of mmorpgs and the battle system felt very much like one boring
second of all the story was great till the second disc and the ending was enough to make me want to throw this game into a trash compactor
the graphics were decent the cut scenes were great but the fun factor and replay value of this game are equvalant to that of superman the first two games are amazing with their colorful fantasy environments and memorable soundtrack but this one doesnt really have much of either of them
my real complaint lies within the gameplay though
while it takes your typical amount of time to gain stats in the first two games it takes forever in this game in comparison and fighting the enemies are a complete chore because the same stupid shield appears on the enemies that you fight over and over again not to mention that you can get killed extremely easily by even the weakest of the enemies
the soundtrack is not very good at all and i especially find the battle theme of the game incredibly bland compared to many other rpgs i have played
the characters can also become quite an annoyance at times with one of the characters later in the game posing halfway to the ground after battle with her finger up which gets annoying really really quickly
overall i find it extremely difficult to like this game and i have tried to like it but have given up trying to like it after trying to play this five years on and off
the first two games and the fourth one are much better than this id recommend those instead and please avoid this oneim a huge fan of rpgs
i grew up playing all different kinds from final fantasy to fallout and im still always on the lookout for gems
when i heard this was coming out i got my hands on its two prequels for the super nesfamicom and ps and tried them out
i never finished either one
like this latest installment both were tired and unoriginal with a far greater emphasis on fantasy than science fiction despite being set in the supposed real worldstar ocean till the end of time will take most players an exceedingly long time to complete not because of its difficulty or size but because of its immensely long cutscenes
this style of gamemaking is not necessarily a bad thing but because of the large number of hours the player will spend watching and listening to the action much of this review will treat it as much like a film as like a gamefirst the game features
battlelike its predecessors this star ocean has a relatively active battle system among the pantheon of rpgs
players can switch between characters and move them freely and in realtime around the field
the action pauses when a menu is opened such as for using items or casting magic symbology in the gameworld
three characters can take the field at a time so the two not directly controlled by the player are automated
i found the ai to be fairly decent and a certain amount of control can be given through strategy settings in the menu before entering a battle
in fact this combat system was rather refreshing and different though veterans of the series will find it familiar
however there were two very serious problems
one is the absence of any direct camera control
pans and rotation would be unnecessary provided the player could zoom in and out at will
when the playercontrolled character nears an enemy however the shot zooms in cutting off any view of the rest of the field
even camera control would have been unnecessary if the shot had simply stayed wide and overhead at all times
the second problem is the unintuitive method for switching targets
the player cannot simply cycle through the enemies by pressing the shoulder buttons she instead uses square a button most games assign to commands which also means the cycle only goes in one direction
it may sound unimportant but when many enemies are attacking at once in can make a big difference
explorationonce upon a time rpgs were a series of endless repetetive battles with a few lines of story sprinkled around at distant intervals to try and keep the players interest
in the past few generations of consoles this trend fortunately came to an end and most games now have players spending nearly as much time in the cities or other friendly areas as in the field furthering the story or completing noncombat quests
i think this has been a move in the right direction and star ocean is no exception to the trend
the game progresses rather linearly most of the time without the kind of world map players of star ocean the second story and most other rpgs might be familiar with
towns have people to talk to treasures to find and occasional sidequests to complete
difficultythe game is somewhat difficult by modern standards
what i mean by this is that a player may actually die once or twice during the course of the game due to carelessness or absentmindedness
think destiny of an emperordifficult not th sagadifficult
in most of todays rpgs the player really has to go out of their way to get killed
i found the difficulty balance here to be about right
some leveling up will probably be required but not so much that it should turn you off from playing
i want a small challenge but i also want to make consistent steady progress
star ocean hits the mark on that countnow the moviestory features
scriptheres where the problems begin
the script is weak
in fact its one of the weakest scripts ive ever read or heard
first of all its hokey and stereotypical even for a japanese rpg
the main characters name is fayt leingod it always makes me roll my eyes whenever i hear it
the heroine sophia is a typical japanese anime girl gushy cloying dinnerplateeyed and with the maturity of an yearold
shes supposed to be cute but i found her even more annoying than the whiny and overlysensitive pussyfooting fayt
the rest of the cast isnt much better
as usual the future of the universe rests on goofy characters like these plus some even worse like the foottall ultracutesy circus performer peppita for example
is it too much to ask that the heroes not always be children who act young even for their ages
is square trying to send a message with their perpetual sixteen and seventeenyearold heroes that anyone over  should just move into a nursing homeunfortunately this is true of many rpgs and most of those from japan
what sinks this one to the bottom of the storytelling barrel however is the sheer tonnage of wasted time
many games have lots of long cutscenes
sometimes the player spends more time watching them than playing
this can be done well
xenosaga episode i is a good example
this can also be done poorly
star ocean till the end of time is the epitome of the second category
i lost track of how many times the characters sat around talking about nothing or debating their options over and over and over again usually in the least appropriate circumstances without putting forth any new information or advancing the story in any way
any editor or professional writer knows that much like pieces of a machine every part of a story or script must have a purpose in the greater picture
one example without giving away much of the plot occurs near the beginning of the game
cliff and fayt are stuck in a prison cell
they talk about what has happened so far not adding any new insight
then they talk about how theyre stuck
then when someone comes to help them they talk about whether to accept or not going back and forth at least half a dozen times
all this takes close to  minutes in cutscenes and is framed by quite a few more on both sides
we the audience have learned nothing new about the characters their world or our own when its finished
this kind of conversation may be realistic but its not interesting and its bad writing
directionthis has problems beyond the ones mentioned above but most modern rpgs suffer from the same ones
there are a lot of unnatural pauses in the dialogue that are not the fault of the voice actors
for reasons i will never understand many games including star ocean record the characters dialogue one line at a time then splice them all together
this means theres loading time between each line so interruptions sound unnatural and reaction lines fall flat
again for an example of the right way to record dialogue all at once or in appropriatelydivided chunks as in a film look at xenosaga episode i character  location designthis is merely a matter of taste but i didnt like the universe of star ocean
it was too close to star trek only with magic thrown in
humanity lives alongside countless alien species almost all of which look as much like humans as mr spock have cultures barely distinguishable from our own and are progressing along the same lines
at least the writers didnt have the aliens all speaking english the characters in the game carry portable translators to avoid problemsalso for a space opera the story spent a disturbingly large amount of time in dungeons  dragonsesque locations dealing with knights and monstersfinally im sick of fanservice
it and inappropriate comic relief is the main reason i cant stand anime and its becoming a deterrent to my enjoyment of console rpgs as well
frankly the female characters dont need to be beautiful or sexy at all
even if they are they and the men as well should dress appropriately
this means not exposing shoulders and bellies in arctic weather or wearing skirts that would get them arrested in times square
sophia even starts the game in lowrider jeans then neglects to even zip up the fly
though shes supposed to be  when she looks and acts  this is a little disturbing
if game designers want to be taken seriously as artists and most do want to and should be then this kind of design has got to come to an end
plus i doubt people will still be wearing bluejeans thousands of years into the future actingid heard bad things about the acting before i bought this game but i found it to be decent if not exactly oscarworthy
certainly it was better than average for a redubbed videogame though sophias voice made me want to strangle her
the voices generally fit the characters and the actors remained true to their roles throughout the gameultimately the story fell flat for me mostly because i couldnt empathize with the characters
i didnt like them couldnt understand their decisions or motivations for those decisions and found their constant meaningless exposition annoying beyond what i wanted to put up with from a socalled game
in some cases i could have overlooked these negative aspects in the script and story and enjoyed the generally entertaining combat system for what it was but star ocean is  dialogue
unfortunately less than  of that is storyps for those of you who find my assessment of the dialogue in this game hard to believe some kind and possibly insane individual over at gamefaqs has taken the time to transcribe every spoken line of star ocean for your enjoymenti bought this game like a week after it came out and i was soooo excited when i brought it home so i can play it for the first timei thought the beginning of the game was okay until i got past the part when fayt and his family got seperatedeverything went downhill from therei thought the battle gameplay system okay i surprisingly enjoyed that part of the gamebut gosh i felt like playing this game made me watch a old show where all they do is talk talk talk sooooo long to the point where you are just really bored and start to doze off because you dont even know what they are talking about anymore
i think the problem was there was absolutely no humor the characters are boring and wayyy to serious and man where is the charismaand another complaint i have is its wayyy too difficult
some things i found were pointlessbattle trophiesinventingprivate actions there was way to much of them and you have to keep backtrackingoverall this game was a pain to play
and to top it all off horrible horrible camera
got dizzy everytime i tried to play at least  minutes of it but always tried sucking it up but in the end i always got really dizzyim sorry but i tried forcing myself to play this game at least twice but ended up giving up because of the boring talksthere are times where i didnt want to throw in the towel and lying to myself saying this is an awesome game
but man who am i kidding
why do i even try to torture myself to play this game any longer
howeverplaying this game helped me out despite of all its major flaws
it helped me to really research a game next time before i even rent or purchase something because i am definitely not wasting  on a crappy game again
if you liked the game good
im happy for you
i personally felt like i was just simply forcing myself to play itthe game maybe be good later
maybe i will try again somedaywhen i get really really really boredi bought this game because i loved the coollooking graphics plus it looked really deep with all its alternate endings and such
also it was by square enix and many of my favorite games of all time have been developed by them
so i picked it up anticipating another captivating adventurethe graphics were indeed all that had been promised
the character models were great especially in the cutscenes and the environments were pretty
this was the sole element of the game that i was completely satisfied withthe story was ok although i didnt get very far in it
before long though it began to get annoying
the characters had no personality beyond weak sterotypes and the dialogue had no surprises or hooks to keep you interested
it was all very bland and cliched
basically this was the story boy meets girl boy and girl hang out both kids parents disappear in tragic accident boy wakes up in mysterious land and is arrested for a crime he didnt commit boy meets sexy girl in thighhigh boots and a miniskirt and without much explanation is led through a mysterious secret passage
yawnperhaps if i had stuck with the story longer it would have improved
but what kept me from progressing in the game was the combat
it has an interesting concept behind it everything is in realtime and you can actively dodge an enemys attacks
try as i might though i couldnt get my character to do anything except rush the monster and wail on it until it died
i learned a few special skills but the game never explained how to use them
sometimes i would manage to pull one off but it was usually a surprise as i couldnt figure out what i had done to make it happen
i had heard that the combat was a joy to participate in but it was continually frustrating for me
i couldnt believe that not even the freaking ingame tutorial explained how to use skillsfinally the music sucks
i know this doesnt sound like a major issue but believe me ten minutes with this stuff and youll feel like jumping out the nearest window
the hotel where the game starts has an irritating japanesesounding pop song later a forest area has the loudest most banging heavy metal youll ever hear
the soundtrack never fits the situation and is always horriblei couldnt stand this game and i doubt youll be able to either
this is not squareenixs next masterpiece
if youre looking for an rpg with a fastpaced battle system try baten kaitos or tales of symphonia instead
dont even touch this thingit is a rare event indeed when i manage to play halfway through a game  hrs and then have to quit because of the overpowering desire to destroy my ps the controller and my entire living room furniture setup out of sheer rage and frustration
i say rare because most trash games are lucky to get a few hours out of me before they get flushed down the toilet
ill admit reluctantly that i tolerated the first part of the game
so when did the honeymoon end
wow where do i beginstory
to put it simply its dull
aside from the initial medieval planet you start on the rest of game failed to provide any form of intriguing plot
once the giant spaceship of doom appeared and starting blasting things with laser beams i yawned and lost interest
most of the story is cliched and that which is not tailors mostly to the star trek crowd of which i am not a fancharacters
the characters you control are lame and annoying with fayt being the worst offender by far
gee cliff i dont see why we cant just give that big dragon a big sloppy kiss and huggity hug so that we can all just live in glorious peace and harmony
do we have to kill it
never mind the fact that you just polished off  of his brothers and sisters in that cave you just trekked through fayt you moron
the other characters arent as bad personalitywise but theyre just as verbose
yada yada yada
be quietdialogue
mindnumbing
like someone else said in their review most of this game is dialogue and cutscenes
you know if a company is going to make this much of a game dialogue then why not make it any good
god i just wanted the characters to shut up already and go eat an blueberry or something
youre not philosophers youre monster hitmen
go do your job
suffice it to say this part of the game probably accounted for  of the  hrs i put into the game before ending the trauma altogether
too much talking about a boring story and not enough actionbattles
by far the most irritating part of this game
granted it was unique for a few hours but it quickly got old and stale
why
for several reasons
 enemy difficult is woefully inconsistent
youll be blazing through one dungeon killing enemies in  hits and then in the very next dungeon enemies take  hits before they die
i remember spending  hours in one area raising mad levels with my triple exp bonus gauge activated only to walk into the next dungeon and have the first group of enemies use me for toilet paper
wtf
bosses are the same way ridiculously easy in one battle and near impossible in the next without at least  attempts
enemies use a paralysis counteract if you hit them when their fury is full
this wouldnt be a problem if enemy fury actually dropped when they attacked like your players do
ill be lucky to get in one hit before clang now youre paralyzed
the enemy would usually follow up with a hit that took  hp off my my  hp total and my bonus gauge would break citing a critical hit
yeah thats a critical percentage
fun
gone are the days when just losing all your hp would kill you now you have to friggin worry about your mp too
if it hits  you die
hooray
my favorite part was in one cave where this one enemy used some vortex blade attack and killed off two of my highlevel characters immediately each had  hp full up mainly because the attack removed mp rather than hp
screw you
 enemy ai is cheap and stupid
they simply use the same powerful attacks over and over again
same goes for the lame bosses
your characters are wailing away on some boss lost in some  hit combo when all of a sudden fire breath happens and all your characters and blown across the screen with half their health gone nearly dead from mp loss and no fury
probably confused or poisoned too
rinse and repeat and you have the general battle experience provided by this gameexploringtreasure
i remember in the good ol days when exploring was productive and finding treasure chests was actually gasp enjoyable
why
because actual treasure was found
i think out of the  chests i managed to open before quitting  of them contained some form of freakin berry used for healing purposes
completely sucked the fun out of exploring
why cant you give me more weaponsitems
yay i can only carry  of each
umm why considering i use  of them after every battle
niceinventing
so dumb
just how complicated must you make this process
it would be nice to have potential inventors clue you in as to which item they are looking for and where they are rathing than spewing some more so plotgarbage that means nothing anyway
hooray cynthia is available to recruit
so where is she and what do i need to do to get her
who knows no one is going to tell you
why not even a little hint
oh i get it difficulty
righthidden things
this reminds me of the more recent final fantasy games
you have to complete  off the wall ridiculously hard tasks just to get one weapon or one inventor
sure ill win a bunny race  times in a row to get this one inventor
why on earth would you want to do that
how on earth would you even know to do that in the first place
its like they want you to purchase a strat guide with the game
thievesbattle trophies
stupid and not worth collecting seeing how most of them are earned from completing mindless and outrageous tasks such as win  battles or win  battles without getting hit and when you do collect enough of them the rewards are poor
costumes for a battle minigame
yawn
new difficulty level
oh wait do i get to play the game on a new harder difficulty level
oh boy another  hrs of absolute frustration and poor design awaitspuzzles
i just love trial and error puzzles
its a good thing too since this game is full of them
sigh
this category also needs to include the where do i go next puzzle where during a cutscene a character will mention offhand where you need to go next and ill miss it because i sneezed or something and then ill have absolutely no idea where to go
and townspeople wont even help me
wtf
how about a world map that indicates your next location or goal
noveli remember  years ago when games used to be fun and not a chore
you know you can still have difficulty in a video game without making the player suffer through some overly complicated battle system fighting enemies for hours on end because the stupid things wont die
if only the developers would take a little time to adjust the flow of the game start off easy and progressively get more difficult but never too difficult as long as youre leveling at a reasonable rate
i want my games to move at a brisk pace only slowing down when i choose to level or complete a sidequest
dont make me spend  hours fighting enemies to gain enough experience to raise another two levels so that maybe one of my characters can survive a boss battle
is that too much to asklastly let me end on a positive note
thanks to the glorious idea that is playstation greatest hits this pos was only  at least i didnt pay twice that for this dogthis game is very boring
i managed to play about  hours but could not do it anymorethe story line was lacking and the i found myself not caring if my character survived or noti had heard a lot of good things about this rpg and certainly am open to different types of rpgs but this one had me reaching for the power button 
perhaps i will try again but my first impression is i would rather watch paint drythis game was awesome
i love how you could have a freeroam battle system
it made the battles a lot more fun so basically even if you were really powerful there was still a chance for you to lose
however this was a  disk gamedisk  would not work for me
i got a black screen when trying to go on to disk  if you are planning on buying this game keep in mind that you might not be able to finish this game to see how it ends
just so you knowall in all i think this game gets a  but their technical support gets a 
dont expect a replacement after disk  wont work
good lucki dont know if anyone else experiences this but i get really dizzy playing this game
theres something about the visual effects coloring textures rendering etc
that makes me feel dizzy
dont know whats wrong as i still have  vision
this game is not playable for me eventhough it may be promising
shellshock is simpler and more playable no squad commands thoughfor the upside its one of the better handheld pinball games out there
it aint bad but the controls could be a lot better
if youve played metroid prime pinball and then tried to go back to this one youre going to be sadly disappointed
using the flippers and attempting to move mario to certain places on the screen can be irritating
this is truly one of those games id rather just cheat on from the beginning instead of being frustrated with the wobbly controls in trying to do what i need to donot particularly recommended unless you just love mario or pinball games in generalmario shows up once again this time in his own pinball game
im sure this one will sell a ton of copies
truth be told mario pinball land is like some cheap bubble gum that loses flavor after a couple of minutessure the graphics are detailed and colorful and all the gang of characters is here
the pinball action is simple yet works pretty well
so what is the problem
very repetitive
the screens vary with different locales pyramids caves deserts etc but the action never changes
i found myself getting bored with it early on
this one is for the kidsi love playing mario games so bought this one
i find it a very hard game to play and losing interest in it
i have beat one boss is about all
very easy to lose your marioball down the drain
doubt i will finish itfirst off i have to say that most people who played this game complained about the glitches
i have noticed none
no glitches no bugs
the framerate is bad true  think playing an mmorpg in a crowded city on a modem connection
well i have done that before so the framerate didnt bother meits the game itself that makes me wish i held on to that 
you can upgrade your firearms the more you use them
this sounds like a good thing
if you like a weapon a lot you can just keep using it to make it more effective
unfortunately you quickly realize that theres a little thing called ammunition and it barely appears enough in the levels to let you use the gun let alone let you blaze around with the leveledup firearm of your choosinghowever you wont be using your guns much once you get your psychic powers stolen directly from psiops  erm i mean once you get your legendary mystical powers that all humans possess
with these powers the levelingup concept is much more effective
use a power a lot and it levels up
the end
some of the powers are seriously taken directly from psiops though
except in that game you could pick up anything you like
in advent rising you can only pick up whatever the game developers want you to pick upstill the game has its moments
jump around a lot and your jumps get more evasive
soon diving to the side brings the world into slowmotion granting you the ability to throw enemies and shoot grenades all in one graceful leap
it looks pretty and its fun
the vehicle parts are also enjoyable
the flick targeting  flick the analog stick towards an enemy to target it  can get a little frustrating as the analog stick youre flicking also targets the camera
sometimes youll be trying to target a certain enemy but it insists on targeting the big object the enemy is standing by
or it will remain locked onto a target thats behind you when all you really want to do is see whats in front of you
but overall it worksthe music is just incrediblethe one part of the game that really lived up to all the excitement id built up after years of waiting for its releasehowever the story is really what disappoints me
the movies are so disconnected from the main game its absolutely ridiculous and pulls you out of any shaky atmosphere the music and graceful jumps managed to provide
ill just give you an example
youre running across a field
theres a group of aliens at your back
suddenly you notice a jeep sitting out in the open all alone
you run up to it thinking you can jump in turn around go back to the aliensbut lo and behold once you get within ten feet of the jeep the screen blackens a cutscene starts and suddenly theres about ten soldiers standing around the jeep chatting while your main characters walks up to them
i swear the soldiers werent there before
so instead of relaxing and enjoying a cutscene youre jarred from the game reality and enter cutscene reality
in game reality youre standing in a dusty desert with sand drifing in the wind
in cutscene reality youre standing in a grassy field the grass leaning and rippling in the wind
its just jarring lazy and it gets me angrythe game attempts to give you chances to make decisions that affect the story
the way its implemented would indeed have been novel and welldone if your xbox was actually an nes and the year was   as it is the decisions have no emotional involvement and most of them are resolved ten minutes later
there is one pretty heavy decision that occurs early in the game
well not as heavy as it could have been you dont know how drastic the consequences will be when you make it but its still a nice touch
however i choose wrong and as a result i was stuck with with a shallow poorlywritten character for hours afterward
my lesson no matter what your instincts tell you sometimes you have to leave the girl behindall in all advent rising is disappointing and not worth your 
the gameplay is all right but ive seen better much much better
the story is blah
unless youre an extreme scifi fan who experiences intense pleasure at the thought of aliens and spaceships then this game just isnt worth your timeim a little surprised at the great reviews this game is receiving
the players slow down when you run sideways it almost feels like ten yard fight for nintendo
the price is great but i still think im going to buy madden because it cant be worse than espn
for starters the moves are awkward and slow the spin move dive and jukes dont do much to get you past an opponent so youre better off trying to run them over
next the passing is simply awful
its very slooooow and the receivers drop a lot of balls right in the chest
the run defense is ok but playing pass defense is all luck and guess work
if you have a defender there hell usually knock it down wo you doing anything
the computer controls too many aspects of your team
kickoffs and punts stink too you have no chance to run a kick back on any setting higer than rookie
you get no blocking and the defense is on you after  yards
if you like very low scoring games this is for you
but im talking   games with less than  yards total offense
im checking out madden and i sure hope its better than this crapolaback in  i was looking for another quality ps wrestling game outside of thqs famed smackdown seriessadly this game wasnt itdespite utilizing a similiar graphics engine as the aforementioned seriessmackdownbyw is marred by characters with zero facial animation and  cartoony lookslaughable physics enginewhere female wrestlers can lift male wrestlers with utter easeno multiwrestler match upstriple threattagteamfatal  waysetcpoor hit detection and dualshock usageonly responds when performing or on the receiving end of attack throwsaside from the music tracksingame movies and video clips theres nothing remotely else of interest about this gameif you want a hardcoretheme wrestling game try the ps version of eas wcw backstage assault its the bit equivaliant of this gamethough slightly betterthis is a review of this productbackyard wrestling  there goes the neighborhood playstation  video game
amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product for which this review may not apply
after reading this review please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for
this is a review that i originally wrote on the first backyard wrestling game subtitled dont try this at home received poor reviews from just about everyone who played it so youd expect for eidos to learn and make a better sequel
of course youd be wrong
backyard wrestling  there goes the neighborhood byw is pretty much the same as byw for good and for badthe basicsthe game includes  playable wrestlers all unlocked from the start and  caw slots
of the  only  are female adrienne pain sunrise adams adult film actress tera patrick adult film actress and tylene buck
the other  are male andrew wk el drunko kelvin finn luke hadley madman pondo masked horn dog messiah new jack ruckus rude boy ryuji ito sandman shaggy  dope sick nick mondo sonjay dutt supreme vampiro vic grimes violent j and zandiga big problem with the game is that theres very little to do in it
up to two players can duke it out in a on exhibition match or a single player can go through the career mode you can have up to  saved careers
thats it
theres nothing else to do
one of the reasons wwe games are ranked so highly is because they give you a wide variety of match types
this game is just one match type on hardcore
although the game tries to give you the impression of variety the entire game consists of you playing this same exact match over and over and over again
theres no reason a byw game has to stick to nonringbased action
heck watch the byw videos in the games media room and youll see that  of the action in the reallive events takes place in a ring
there should be the following match types tag team handicap not the fight one guy then the other handicap match that this game has as its career finale lumberjack steel cage hell in the cell though theyd have to use a different name since wwe probably has that copyrighted plus the nonring hardcore action
in short everything you see in a wwe game should be here but with the violence and blood turned up to the extreme
the rings should have regular barb wire and electrified ropes players choice
there should be thumb tacks barb wire bats panes of glass they should be held and set up like tables in a wwe game and other assorted ultraviolent weapons
tables should not be part of the environment theyre enviromental throwsattacks in this game
they should be items you can pick up place somewhere stackable and do moves onto  like you see in the wwe smackdown
gamesloading times throughout the game are  seconds each but they happen right before every single opponent plus short ones before going back to the menus
i shutter to think of how many minutes total of loadings you will sit through by the time youre done with career modecreateawrestler caw sucks which is sad because youre forced to use it for career mode the first time you play it
there are so few options that i can practically list all of them here
there are only  body types  male athletic muscular overweight slim  female athletic muscular with  different skin tones most of which are useless unless you want funky colored wrestlers
there are  different face styles for each gender
there are  different hair styles for each gender with  different hair colors again most are rather funky
in terms of clothing each gender has  upper body shirts  lower body pants and  footwear including bare feet choices
you can choose two different colors for each assuming the piece of clothing has a base and a striperounding out the caw options are a few custom logostattoos a limited selection of moves and  mostly useless caw accessories that you can buy for  each in the shop section of career mode
how useless are they you may be wondering
take a look at this list and judge for yourself top hat cowboy hat football helmet do rag skater helmet headband bowler visor sun hat beanie beret headphones hard hat baseball cap ear muffs bikers helmet sunset shades round glasses d glasses eye patch painters mask clown nose corn cob pipe bandage big ears tiny shades left arm band double elbow pads double wrist bands gauntlets biker gloves bandoleer messenger bag backpack bow tie single gun belt double knee pads shin guards wallet chain tool belt knee brace spurs leg garter studded belt and snow shoes
nothing says im a hardcore brawler dont f with me more than a guy wearing a bowler hat d glasses a clown nose and a pair of snow shoes
to the games credit though a few of these looked great on a gal wearing the default thong outfit cowboy hat biker gloves and leg garteron top of that you cant even delete caws
the best you can do is revert them back to their default appearance and moves but the caw slot will still be filled  even after youve deleted your career save and the caw no longer has a use
also you cant import caws from another game savememory cardbesides the caw accessories the game has a few other unlockables but theyre really not worth the effort to unlock
if you can manage to make it through the game tedious and boring career mode you get the option to play it all over again but this time with one of the ingame wrestlers
since the story is exactly the same as the first time theres nothing new to see by playing it again with an established character instead of the caw you used the first time
as an added bonus completing career mode also unlocks all of the game videos in the media room
these are the same video youve seen throughout season mode actually each one is unlocked after you view it in the course of your careerthese videos are only marginally better than the ones you can buy from  each in the shop
the five purchasable videos are short highlight reels of these wrestlers zandig ryuji ito sick nick mondo vic grimes and sandman
before you get too excited you should know that they each run a mere  seconds and contain no audio at all
in fact almost all of the byw videos in the media room are  second audioless highlight reels
these are the same clips shown on the main menu
however there are more clips shown on the main menu than there are in the media room
all of the main menu videos should be viewable in the media room where theyre displayed full screen
i personally would have rather watched the clips of the ladies tylene buck tera patrick and sunrise adams in the media room than a clip of andrew wk singing made pointless by the fact that theres no audio in itthe only byw videos that have audio are three relatively short music videos and the promonewspiece pulse
i have never seen a wrestling match from byw or any of the other feds represented in the game
it would have been more beneficial for them to include one or two whole matches instead of all these pointless short and mostly audioless video clips
maybe that would get me interested in buying one of their videosthe pulse video is a techtv story about the game and a wrestling event held to promote it several months 
before its release
one of the game designers proudly mentions that byw was the first wrestling game with confirmed online capabilities
there is no online mode in the final product
oopsthe design of the different fighting areas is pretty good overall though of course some are better than others
i personally like the office because you can break all of the cubicles in the middle of the room and when thats done youre left with a ton of weapons and one open area to fight ingameplaythe game engine is essentially the same as in byw but with a few additions such as submission holds and a block button
theres also a new type of environmental attack appropriately titled an enviromental attack
you can perform these attacks when you have your opponent in a front grapple and youre positioned in the right spots of each fighting area
youll know when youre in the right spot because an exclamation point inside a triangle will appear on the screen
all you have to do is press the triangle button and a cutscene will pop up showing you doing an extreme move to your opponent like powerbombing him through a picnic table hitting him with beer bottles or frying his face on a fast food grillthe problem with the environmental attacks as with all attacks is that the wrestlers dont sell their moves
theyll pop right back up on their feet as if you just blew air in their face
in wcw kevin nash once sold a finger poke to the chest as if he had just gotten hit with a bowling ball yet here they act like nothing happened if you repeatedly slam their head in the truck of a car
the only time wrestlers act like a move really hurt them is when they miss a move that they were trying to performone of my biggest grievances about the game engine is that reversals require guesswork not skill
when in a grapple you have to guess which of the four face buttons your opponent will use for his next move and press it before he does his move
this is just like the reversal system introduced inwwe smackdown shut your mouthin  in that game it was the four dpad directions instead of the face buttons
a lot of people apparently hated this system such as me and it was changed to a much simpler button method one for strikes one for grapples forthe next wwe game in  why byw would use a reversal system that wasnt even kept for the wwe games is beyond me
i dont remember if byw used this reversal system or not
career modethe meat and potatoes of the single player experience is the career mode which replaces the short talk show mode from byw
the talk show mode was boring and repetitive and guess what
some things never changethe story is simple enough the backyard wrestling federation has come to your town with a  million prize to anyone who can plow through the competition and win all the regional championshipscareer mode consists of ten fighting areas
the first nine are grouped into three sets or tiers with the last area being the locale of the finale
each of the first nine areas contains five missions and five challenges each with the last in each tier also containing a title tournament
the finale area contains the final five challenges
thus bringing it to a grand total of  missions and  challenges plus  title tournamentsnot everything is unlocked from the start
you need to complete one tier in order to unlock the next and the tenth and final area is unlocked after the third tier
the game has a rather confusing way of setting this all up so im going to try to explain this as simple as possible
please try to follow along
ill use tier  as an example it contains the backyard trailer park and pool areas
you can play all  missions five per area remember in any order you want
however you must complete all  in order to unlock  of the  challenges again five per area and the title tournament in the pool area the last area in each tier has the tournament
completing the tournament four matches total not only unlocks the next tier set of three areas but also unlocks the three title defense challenges in the backyard trailer park and pool areas one defense per area
if you lose any of the three title defense challenge matches you have to play that tiers tournament all over again to reclaim the belt
this whole procedure of completing all  missions and the title tournament is required for all three tiers
its quite possible that you dont even need to do the challenges but i did them anyway so i cant tell you for certainif this all sounds like it makes perfect sense its because i explained it to you and you didnt have to figure it out for yourself using the rather disorganized menu in the game
the game doesnt even do anything to signify that you did all the missions and challenges in an area
youd think theyd put a big x over the locale on the useless why is it taking up space on the screen map
anyway if you think this doesnt sound so bad wait until i tell you specifically about the missions and challengesmissionsyou are given a specific objective for a match or a series of matches
some of these include performing a specific number of reversals using a weed whacker three times or just avoiding your opponents attacks  times
for objectives like these you dont even have to go on to win the match
once you perform the objective required you can just quit the match and go on to the next objective
later in the game some objectives will require you to win a match within a set period of time win a match with more or less than a certain percentage of health or just to fight without using certain moves
obviously in these cases you actually do need to finish the matchsome of the missions are downright stupid
no one in the right mind would do what they want you to do in a normal match on purpose
i mean who really would want to finish a match with less than  percent health if they didnt have to
since i hate the reversal system as ive previously mentioned you can imagine how thrilled i was when i had to reverse  moves as one of the mission objectivesthese missions should be in a separate challenge section outside of career ala wwe smackdown
vs raw with unlockables earned for completing them
they should never have been made a required part of completing career modewhat makes the missions even harder is that the game doesnt specifically tell you how to complete them
i rented this game so i had no manual to give me the controls
i had to rely on the information given on the loading screens
while this is good most of the time and i made sure to write down the controls as fast as i could  though the few screens repeat often enough that youll get all the info down soon enough the game has a nasty habit of giving you loading screens that dont relate to the objectives for the match youre about to play or giving you the information you need after you need it
for example i played a mission in which i was not allowed to grapple so guess what information was on the loading screen before the match
yup the grapple controls
better yet theres a mission in which i had to perform a guard break i believe thats what it was
the game decided not to tell me how to perform the move until after i quit the match out of frustration it was on the loading screen that takes you back to the menuchallengesthe five goals almost always are as follows fight a real wrestler
sometimes youll be required to finish him off specifically with a knockout pin or submission
on two instances you will be forced to hunt for a specific wrestler the game will give you several matches with random jobbers occassionally giving you the wrestler you need to fight and if you beat him three times you complete the challenge
 fight a jobber a freakylooking caw who will then by replaced with a real wrestler
 win three matches in a row
 win five matches in a row
 defend your title unlocked only after you win the tournamentfrom what i can tell the challenges are optional as it doesnt seem like you need to do them to progress in the career i did them anyway so i cant say for surethe challenges are what should have been required for career mode as they make more sense within the context of the storyat this point you should have realized that the missions should have been called challenges and vice versagraphicsthe graphics are decent but nothing more than whats required to get the job done
ive read that theyre better than what was in byw but without doing a sidebyside comparison they dont look that much better to mea nice touch is that a wrestler who is repeated pummeled will have blood stains all over his body by the end of the match
sadly the blood stains look like someone drew lines on them with red marker
theres no dripping blood hence why i call them stainssoundlikewwe smackdown
vs rawsvr the game features wrestler voiceovers used in introoutro cutscenes and a few career videos only
for the most part they are done by the real people though the following use substitutes sandman vampiro kelvin finn ruckus and adrienne pain im not sure if those last three are real people or characters made specifically for the game
also just like svr the voice acting is really bada big problem is that the sounds of impacts punches weapons and the such all sound very flat and underwhelming
there are also times when a sound effect should be heard but isnt
this completed undermines any power that a move should havesome of the artists on the licensed soundtrack include insane clown posse andrew wk kool keith bad brains body count and hoobastank
so if youre into that type of music youre sure to love the very large soundtrack there was over two and a half minutes of music listings in the end credits
i personally didnt like the music in the game so i turned it off
thats not to say the game didnt turn it back on itself every now and then
speaking of glitches glitchesive encountered many of them while playing the game
some of them are pretty bad and could actually make you lose matches or missionschallenges
heres a small list
 because i dont like the ingame music i turned it off by setting the volume to zero
every now and then while in career mode after a match as it autosaves my game before going back to the menu the music would come back on
it stays on while im on the menu only going back off when the match loading screen appears
 one time in the pool area and many times in the restaurant area i found my character inexplicably walking by herself towards the bottom of the screen
she would not move in the direction i wanted her to and would only stop her migration to screen bottom if i held the block button or got into a move with my opponent
 if doing a move on a ledge like in the pool area you may end up doing the move without even touching the opponent
sometimes both characters will even shake violently like theyre having a seizure or something
 wrestlers will sometimes fall out of grapples and teleport to standing positions in another part of the fighting area
 the enemy artificial intelligence is also quite bad and i dont think its because i had the ai difficulty set to low
almost every time a match started in the junkyard area my opponent would run straight to the red van on the right and just keep running into it for a few secondsi also came across a glitch that prevented me from getting  completion in career mode
office challenge title defense never becomes selectable its always greyed out
i had no problem playing the other eight title defense challenges
i completed career mode with  out of  missions completed and  out of  challenges completedi didnt even get all opponents seen
i would think that the game would have shown me all of them by the end of careerplay timereplayabilityif you use cheat device codes like infinite health  turbo for player  no turbo for player  you can probably work through career mode in six to ten hours  if you dont get bored first
if you play it straight then itll take a lot longer due to all of the stupid tasks the game forces you to complete
thats if you dont become bored and overlyfrustrated and just give up on the game altogetherreplayability is practically nonexistent for a single player because if you do complete career mode you will not want to play it again with the newly unlocked option to use an ingame wrestler this time
and even if you did it would be the exact same season you played through the first timeof course two players will get a little more replayability out of the game but not much more because theres only so many times you can play a on match against each other before you both get bored
its not like theres a plethora of areas to fight in anyway
if you do one match in each area after  matches you will have seen them allfinal recommendationif you must play this game rent it
its not worth the  asking price for a purchasedor is a very repetetive game in just about any way you look at it
the season mode is just doing pointless missions that are so easy its not funny or so annoying its terrible
i would only suggest this game to a wrestling fan that just dont have much to dowhy cant thq make a wrestling game decent
in wwe day of reckoning for gamecube and wwe raw for xbox has the best created wrestler feature of anything ive ever played
yet the game play of both games are complete garbagethen you have wwe smackdown vs raw and all smackdown games before smackdown vs raw for the ps and it has an amazing gameplay
but the created wrestler feature is pathetic
expecially in smackdown vs rawso here is what i dont understand
if thq makes smackdown vs raw and day of reckoning
cant they make a game that has good game play and good created wrestler featureshello
ive played every thq wrestling game ever made and i can honestly say that i now hate thq and i will never buy one of their games again until they get it rightbefore you dismiss my review hear me out
i loved the idea of starting from the modifieds and working your way up to the cup
a number of the features added are pretty cool  autograph sessions the building of your fan base money earned from merchandise sales etc
however the actual game play sucks
first off youre unable to change your career settings once youve began
typically i like to start these things with some of the driver assits turned on until i get the feel for the physics of the game
unlike previous nascar releases from ea you cannot increase the games difficulty after your season ends
basically you have to start at a difficult level and stumble your way through until your skills become polished
this drove me crazy
the driving physics are reprehensible
the most slight steering input especially the cup and busch series cars translates into major direction changes on the track
i found it nearly impossible to straighten out my vehicle exiting turns or on straights because it threw my car around the track
ea still needs to tweak the friendfoe interaction between other drivers
if someone slams into you or vice versa they get pissed no matter who is at fault
this translates into other drivers intentionally slamming your car later in the race or in later races
this is just totally unrealistic
sure nascar drivers get heated up with each other but ive yet to see a driver run the risk of taking himself out of a race so that he can get even with an enemyim a huge fan of the gran turismo series so i dont have a problem with realistic driving physics
in fact thats my gripe with this game
due to the first  flaws mentioned which really ruined any joy i had for the game i put it down and never picked it back up
i dont reccomend this gamei own a huge library of gamecube titles mostly purchased used and not once until now have i ever thought of trading in anything ive purchased
this is a bland generic shooter that ea slapped with the bond license for a quick cashinon some level i can see what ea was trying to go for here
goldeneye rogue agent is a throwback to early games like doom and duke nukem where the player goes around killing enemies and blowing stuff up with less emphasis on story and structured mission objectives
toss in some modern play mechanics with dual weapons and the ability to take hostages and the game plays reasonably well from a control standpoint
the problem is that this is supposed to be a james bondrelated game and except for a few disjointed cutscenes featuring familiar bond characters theres really nothing bond about this world at all
youre supposed to be evil but you dont really do much that feels evil aside from triggering some environmental traps that i suspect bond would use if he had the chance
the other problem is that the levels are simply big to the point of being mind numbing
the layout is fairly linear and theres not enough going on to sustain the runandshoot gameplay
i cant remember the last time i got bored in the midst of a room of thugs trying to kill metheres a decent multiplayer experience here because the guns and control are decent but theres so many more games that are worth your time that theres no point stopping for this one
hard to recommend even to  fansok you have to admit that this game has its good moments but i would have thought that with the success of all or nothing and the failure of angelfire that all of the bond games would have followed the obvious pattern of all or nothing
the part that i really hate is the fact that you have to shoot the guys  or more times to get a hit and they run around like a bunch of panzies while youre shooting at them
ok i expect them do do a certain bit of running around but after a while it gets to be like a game of ring around the rosies
while the game does have its enjoyable moments its not as enjoyable as it could have been
hopefully the next game theyll do betteri got this a few days back and i must say do not buy
sure you battle a couple of foes but you probably never will finish this game
youll waste more than  so do not buyits a great game but when you get everything you realize that theres nothing to do on it anymore
its not even fun building realtionships getting jobs getting promoted and winning driuss penthouse
i recommend the sims bustin out it is the sexiest gamma evai tried to get into this game but just couldnt the camera views were really confusing and there werent a whole lot of sims elements to make it feel like a sims gameim not a pinball expert or anything but i always enjoyed video game pinball  not the simulations of real machines  and i thought i should give this a try anyway despite the fact that this is afterall a sim
i was wrong
only two of the tables are any fun  black hole and teed off  and i just dont care about the history of the machines in general or gottlieb in particular
some may argue the older tables  s s  require more skill and finesse but i just found them to be dull and somewhat tacky
and only two worthwhile tables for  just doesnt cut it
i recommend these instead extreme pinball for the playstation pure pinball for the xbox the pinball of the dead for the gba  macabre and creative
 and even dragons revenge for the old sega genesisbought this game for the same reason i bet a lot of people did it was only twenty bucks so what the heck but man o man it is not much
yes you can customize your player yes there are a few interesting poker varitations and i am sure it is good online but if you are planning on playing it by yourself dont buy this gamethe play is very slow the computer very slowly pans to every player and after a while it becomes frustrating waiting for hands to finish when you dont have a dog in the hunt
the sound is also pretty awful and repetitive also the same music over and over the same player noises mostly badly done and the same terrible commentary track which makes the script for madden football look like it was written by the bard himself
oh and by the way you get to hear this commentary track over and over again no matter what type of game you play or how long it lastsi guess what i am saying is only buy this game if you have to have something for your ps or if you only have twenty dollars in your pocket otherwise buy a deck of cards and find some friends
i promise you will have more funi know im going to get a lot of unhelpful votes for this review
why
because people dont want to read a review that bashes the game they like
they just vote for the reviews that support their own views
so please dont give me like  unhelpful votes just for expressing an opinion
i didnt like it but a lot of people did and thats okhaving bought a used gamecube i got paper mario as one of the games
i thought i was missing out before but boy was i wrong
this game is horrifically boring in every way possiblelets start with the graphics
theyre good and as you probably guessed are d celshaded graphics for mario and the rest of the world
being a huge fan of super mario rpg for the snes i was extremely disappointed with this new appearance giving it an extremely kiddy feel rather than the more mature feeling of super mario rpg
what a shame
its comparable to the change in style between windwaker and ocarina of time in the zelda series except that they were able to retain good elements and keep it excellent
here they werent
still the graphics are decent and are part of the gameplay so i wont knock them down for it
the audio in paper mario is a mixed bag
it has sound effects down and everything but the music just stinks
it doesnt alternate and quickly gets boring
the lack of voice acting seals the deal especially considering theres a lot of dialogue
the gameplay is where it really shoots itself in the foot
the battle system is so boring and youre confined to using mario and a sidekick who is basically useless
there isnt even any equipment besides the badges you periodically get
finding the crystal stars is both boring and mindnumbingly predictable
the only decent parts are the boss battles
otherwise there is just nothing fun about the gameplay
the story is even worse
save peach and the world
thats the story in a nutshell
same one they used in super mario rpg and paper mario and every single mario game
characters are predictable and stereotypical plot is predictable and boring and it just feels like nintendo once again milking the mario franchise
i dont expect shin megami tensei here or anything but at least something respectable
conclusion dont even waste your time or money on this horrible game
its so incredibly over rated
i really wanted to like it but frankly this is just another horrible cube rpg
i know there are a lack of them on this system but rating this game high just to say you have a good rpg is just wrong
once again mario is just being milked for all hes worth
stay far far away
overall first of all im not some raging halo xbox or ps fanboy
i actually own and played this game
on top of all that im not a ranting gamecube fanboy either
so on with my reviewalright so this is one of the worst games i have ever been foolish enough to buy why
well pretty much everything ill break it down for yougraphics they look pretty good but they are far from realistic they have a very bright feel not that dark imersive feel that should be there
they are nicly detailed but i noticed when scanning stuff with your visor its pixalized and its very noticablesound there is nothing special here at all
you got your standard monsterlike sounds nothing that made my jaw drop oh and prolocic ii is there toocontrols this has to be the worst aspect of the game
why the classic control system
by that i mean that you move with only one stick oh this is fg annoying
it is impossible to simply turn the damn character and to move around the beautiful levels with any sort of ease
this is especially annoying in battle its fine when you actually lock onto the enemy but its hard to just turn toward the enemy unless you go into uh free aim mode by pressing r but you turn so damn slow that by the time your turner around the enemy has moved to another side of the arena
the shouldve switched to precision controls or at least gave you the option to which wouldve made the game worlds better
other than that major flaw the controls are acceptableactual gameplay  this should cover everything elseok so you have like  different weapons to pick from which all look similar
so anyway you travel through the same world the whole game shooting everything that moves and solving pointless puzzles with the occasional challenging boss battles
ahh past all that comes another thing that annoys the living hell outta me is savepoints where are they
there is a serious lack of save points in this crappy game
worst or all when you die after a boss fight you cant simply restart the fight nooooo you have to revert back to your last save point which is usually very long before that fight
if you wanna learn more about what you actually do read a fanboy review or a gamespot reviewthis concludes my review id say rent this game first
trust me on this one unless your some fanboy then just buy it as youll like it no matter how bad it is
final score dont get me wrong i love this game
so why do i give it a bad overall score
youll seeafter completing this game and the first twice i think i know what im talking abouton the  sideprime graphicsfrom the enviroments to the details it looks as fantastic as the firstprime gameplayas fun as the first
they got rid of the chozo ghosts tooprime controlsthey didnt change so theyre as good as the firston the  sideunprime soundthe effects are still great and the music still isntunprime multiplayerthis wins the pgoty award
pointless gimmick of the year it seems to pass through your mind as if affected by a jedi mind trickunprime similarnessif youve played prime  youve aleady played this gameall the new features feel more like gimmicks and the ammo system makes it frustratingoverall this game is fun but too similar to the originalretro how come you took no risks in your sequelthis game is similar and i mean really really similar to the first metroid prime except even more annoyingthe translation of style from sidescrolling metroid to d was handled beautifully
art sound level design etc is all top notch and the game sports some of the most impressive visuals to be found on the gamecube
beyond aesthetics though the game falls apartits simply not fun to play
it has a somewhat awkward control scheme that even after you adjust to is simply subpar to games that were being made in the n era
nentendo tries to say that this is not a first person shooter but a first person adventure game
well you do occasionally have to shoot things in the first person perspective and its handled quite poorly leading me to believe nintendos statement is really just a euphimism for bad first person shooteras already mentioned the control scheme is poor
you cannot strafe and move at the same time unless youre locked onto someething that moves your view while youre strafing so enemies the vast majority of which are extremely agile can very easily get behind you
aiming which you also cannot do while moving is so incredibly slow that it forces you to rely on the games lockon targetting system
unfortunately too many enemies especially bosses have moves that negate your lockon targetting making reaquring them a painstaking effort
in addition to general slow aiming your upwarddownward viewing angle maxes out at about  degrees abovebelow the horizon so when enemies get above you its very difficult to deal with them as many flying enemies or bosses will often do
it makes the game challenging but not in a fun way
its challenging kind of like running a  mile marathon after having someone break both your knees with a sledgehammerand then theres backtracking
there is way way too much backtracking in this game
its one thing to spend an hour in a game exploring new environments without making progress its another thing to constantly be forced to backtrack an hour through previously explored territory to retrieve a single item and then spend an hour getting back only to get another item and use it to backtrack an hour someplace else etcmaking the backtracking even worse is the frequent forced encounters where doors will lock preventing you from leaving and you have to fight a particular enemy dark pirte trooper until you either kill it or it leaves
either method takes upwards of  minutes because like many other annoying enemies in the game it spends most of its time being completely invinciblemetroid prime  was a basically good game with some large flaws
this game took it upon itself to be a copy of the first game and increase the size of all those flaws without adding anything goodlet me start this review off by saying that in  i tried to play through metroid prime and rented it i was only eleven years old and did not understand it or where to go
i was already a big gamer by this point and had played tons of gameboy snes and n games
it wasnt until  that i decided to purchase prime  and give it another run throughi always thought after the n and ps era that games began to decline in quality sure there were plenty of great games in the gamecube and ps era but how many of those were amazing
the quality of games like zelda a link to the past ocarina of time sonic knuckles crash bandicoot  goldeneye pokemon redblue starcraft and super mario brothers  are amazing
these are games that are timeless and never fail to impress me even to this very day
metroid prime a game released in  that i played  years later had an impact on me like those aforementioned games did when i first played theman expertly crafted world with fantastic mythology a near perfect map layout that links areas together as players progress diverse areas fantastic controls and a great level of challenge in both exploration and combat made metroid prime a great achievement for videogamesneedless to say once i beat prime i was really excited to buy and play through prime  i expected something along the lines of the first game what i got was a different storywhen prime  started we have samus entering a space station being overtaken by strange creatures and there is a standoff with the space pirates a boss fight ridley and you have to exit the whole thing as it self destructs
samus narrowly escapes and chases it to tallon iv the world of the gameprime s opening is samus going to trash world because of strange activity
while prime  started  you with all this combat action and adrenaline pumping through you as you use the new powerupsbefore they are taken away prime  has maybe  or  enemies you fight and that isnt until about  minutes into the game
when you lose the powerups in the beginning of prime  you wouldnt have even known that you had them because you never use themwhilst prime s gameplay was about exploration and combat in a single world that contains multiple sections linked up prime s has four main areas accessible from a temple that you dont get to until about an hour or  into the game because of pointless cutscenes and areas
prime  had the player seeing the game and world through the eyes of samus you had to scan and explore to gain information
prime  feels the need to show you everything with cutscenes whether it be a camera panning to a certain object or to show every new enemy
either way it takes you out of the game and is distracting
anyways prime s areas arent really interconnected at all making navigating back to certain areas a headache
the worst part is that all the areas are so similar that their seperation doesnt make any sense
we have the opening trash badlands area the trash desert area and the trash swamp area etc
do you see a cycle
having every single area in this game look like a trash dump drains any life out of the environment
everything just looks grey and dirty and its absolutely hideous
the lack of diversity is attrocious
the first one gave us ruins lava caverns ice palaces an industrialized mine shaft and the inside of a crater which contained the deadly element phazon
these areas were so unique yet due to a great map layout their were hidden access routes to commute between them fastly
nothing felt separated in prime  just interconnectedso there are  main things that prime  fails in comparison with prime  so you are probably asking what the game does new
well there is a whole light and dark world thing that is supposed to play a big part into the main game
while i was thinking this would be similar to link to the pasts great lightdarkworld system i was wrong
i assumed there would be one big darkworld map to correspond to the lightworld
however it is broken up into segments that you have to use special portals to access it and to get out of the darkworld
there are some areas where what you do in the dark world effects the lightworld but the game doesnt make it clear
the darkworld serves as an excercise in frustration as the player has to navigate through just to find a portal that transports them somewhere else in the lightworld
while in the darkworld you are always being damaged unless surrounded by these light crystals
what you have to do is run through and take pain just to get to the next light crystal
any game that forces the player to constantly take damage for no reason is terribly designed there is no excuse for it
being damaged and dying in the dark world does not help increase ones gameplay abilities
however in a confidential game when someone is fighting a boss and takes damage it teaches them how to play better and they learn how to be better at the said gamepeople say that the dark world thing just adds to the challenge of the game but a challenge is something that can be surpassed not something that is absolutely  unbeatable
its the difference between being able to jump over an oncoming car or being nailed to the ground
there is no challenge in always being hurt just frustration
the majority of the games challenge comes from boss fights in which the enemies have unrecognizable patterns attacks that take out  of your health and a ridiculously high amount of hit points
while this is an actual challenge because they are beatable i realized that it isnt practice that caused me to defeat these bosses it is luck
when these bosses with brutal attacks just appear out of the ground under you or quickly boost into you randomly you literally cant do anything to avoid being hit
you have to be lucky that these they dont appear or rush right into you and if that doesnt happen enough times and you are able to stay alive long enough to shoot them till they die you win
sure its difficult but these bosses and minibosses which are just as powerful as the main bosses cross the line of something being a challenge to being overpowered and feeling rigged
prime  had its fair share of difficult boss battles but i never felt that they were overpowered
even the last boss which was very hard i knew i improved on with every attempt and thats what caused my victory
when i beat the prime  bosses i felt a sense of joy and accomplishment with prime  i just felt like glad thats over
is prime  a terrible game
no there are much worse games to play
there is not one certain thing that prime  completely fails in which ruins the game it is a game that just has so many unpolished aspects to it that combined ruin the game
especially standing in the shadows of prime  this game is a huge dismantlement
i expected this game to tread completely new ground but with same mechanics like what majoras mask was to ocarina of time or be a carbon copy of the first prime but in a new area
if this game was one of those  examples i wouldve enjoyed it alot more
if it treaded new ground and failed then i would give it credit for trying something new
if it was the same as prime  in a new environment it would not be that fresh but would make for a fantastic game
prime  is a game that falls in between those  it adds certain new things and tries to do some things differently yet it feels like a bad version of prime  at the same time
i feel if this game was simply a new idea or a carbon copy it wouldve been fantasticfor star fox fans this is not your game
star fox on the n just had tank and flying and thats what we wanted
but when i got star fox  i wanted foot missions now that i got them i have to face the fact that it sucks
the flying missions are great and fun and so are the tank missions
but then u go to a foot mission and the action is stopped by the controls of the onfoot missions
its a good thing that there arent a lot of on foot missions
people dont buy this game
rent it
s of games to rent or buy just rent thiswow if you are a fan of previous star fox video games not including the horrendous star fox adventures that was one of the first releases for the gamecube i have bad news for youthe newest addition to the series star fox assault is a huge disappointment
it is horrible
sooooooo bad
i looked forward to this game so much and now i play it literally had to force myself just to continue and cling to the hope that it could get better
but it never did get better
in fact i think it is safe to say the game goes steadily downhill after you defeat the first boss
well maybe not so steady the fun of the game completely disappears the third or fourth time you have to wander around on foot and destroy some variation of shield generator
i am not going to get too much further into that in this format though
i want to make a list of all the reasons this game is horrible of the  levels i played through there were only  where you spent the majority of the time in your plane
the rest of the time you spent performing tedious tasks on foot or in the landmaster on the horribly designed ground levels
each time you are on foot you start with one of the crappiest guns i have ever used in a video game
it cannot kill anything in one shot has a painfully slow rate of fire and an even slower charge up time the enemies that only take damage from charged shots fire at a much faster rate
this could be solved by a handful of things
a if the controls allowed you to dodge charge your gun and aim at the same time
most console shooters incorporate a stick control system like that in halo or timesplitters
if you want stick control in this game you have to adjust to wacked out control in your plane
by wacked out i mean it makes you control the plane with one stick and the camera with the other
this is just stupid
the one stick control leads to several control problems
ill get to that in a minute
b easily obtained weapon upgrades
not only are new guns machine gun grenades etc
scarce but once you find one they have limited ammunition
and switching between them is a pain using cstick to change weapons
it also annoyed me that you do not get to hold onto your guns from level to level
the design of the foot levels is almost too bad to describe with words
everything is camoflauged
it is very difficult to distinguish enemies doors and important items from the surrounding area
enemies arent too bad in this case because they show up on your radar
but you are not given a map to any of these levels so finding doors and knowing where to go next is a huge pain in the ass
and as if the ground levels could get any worse the developers some how managed to ruin the landmaster
the landmaster is a tank that was introduced in star fox   it offered a nice change of pace in that game requiring quick side to side movement and well planned hops to clear obstacles
in this game not only is the landmaster lethargic it was very fast on the  but the hovering and rolling abilities are rarely needed the dodging that required these moves in the  game is what made the landmaster fun
there is really no need to have the landmaster in this game
this is the last thing i will say about the ground levels
while you are running around on foot with your crappy gun with the rest of the star fox team flying around above you they still request back up from you
they expect that you will be able to land multiple shots on multiple enemies at great distance while dealing with the phantom enemies that appear out of nowhere on the ground
this requires you to go into aim mode you cannot move while you are aiming lead one of the  enemies tailing your friend and land at least several shots from your pistol on each one within approximately  seconds of the original distress signal
after scrambling and failing miserably the first time this happened i decided to let my team mates die because unlike in the other games where you were punished for this and your team mates actually made a difference your team mates never appear to do anything helpful in this game and return for the next mission no matter what  the controls are horrible
i touched on this a little in the previous gripe
but i still cant believe just how bad they are
you cannot assign the buttons however you want to
you have schemes  to choose from
one is good for the plane but horrible for the footlandmaster portions of the game
the second one is good for the foot and landmaster portions but is terrible for the plane portions
the third one is horrible for everything i really dont know why they included it it is needlessly complicated
the challenge of a game should not be adjusting to the control scheme
they could have saved all of this trouble and restricted the game play to the plane i think everyone myself and any respectable star fox fan would have been just fine with that  the story is poorly written
the old star fox games did not have great stories but they made up for this by ignoring the story element of the game
this game tries to push the story as important and implies relationships between various characters which isnt a bad thing to do it is just executed poorly in this game
most of the voice acting is second rate at best
falco turned is no longer a cocky rebel with a quick tongue but a mellow surfer dude with an annoying attitude
the girl fox never really proves that she serves a purpose other than weak attempts to seduce fox
foxs voice switches between a keanu reeves type effect where he sounds perpetually lost and an over anxious i have done this a million times before i cant die i am the hero voice
which is annoying because in the snes and  games he always came off as someone who is humble but actively seeking revenge
oh and slippy is more homosexual than ever before
all the new enemies suck too
and i wont even get into the whole mess of a story where you team up with the star wolf team more often than you fight them  ok so running around on foot sucks driving the landmaster sucks i would have thought they would at least salvage the arwing portions of play
i mean it shouldnt be too hard there are only  levels that are exclusive to the arwing
well the flying sucks too
it is slower
you turn slower
you cant do the useful turn on one side move to get through tight spots which makes the arwings width a huge burden
whenever you spin to deflect enemy shots it makes this huge engine blast that prevents you from seeing anything happening ahead of you
the rail portions of the level are plagued by the stage moving into your plane and enemies flying into the back of your ship possibly the most frustrating part of the game
the free portions are hurt by the speed of the arwing so sloooooooooow and large stationary ships cluttering up the battlefield ally calls for help and they are on the other side of a huge ship there is no way to get there in time especially when your radar gives you no idea of how much distance is between the two of you
you also start with no bombs and do not retain the upgrades you find in the levels as you did in the previous games
this is very annoying in this game because the upgrades and pickups are very scarce so you spend most of the plane levels with a crappy single laser this sounds familiar
on top of all of this the flying bosses seem recycled and old
for example the first boss is identical to andross main boss in the snes and  versions
while im on the topic of bosses they are all very easy
not only easy to kill but easy to figure out
no thinking required here  the radar is barely helpful
in previous star fox games radar was only used in free flight periods of the game
when it was used though it showed you everything
so you knew the direction and had an idea of the distance between yourself and friends and foes
the area it displays now barely extends past your planelandmasterself
so you have lots of colored dots lining the perimeter of your radar this is not very helpful when an ally cries for help this may sound stupid but it annoyed me that peppy is no longer one of the star fox pilots
he has been replaced by the blue fox thing that you rescue in star fox adventures
he is still in the game but hangs out in the great fox and spoiler he dies
or at least he appeared to have killed himself at the point in the game that i stopped playing because it was killing me to see one of my favorite game franchises perverted like thisthere are probably more things that i have missed
this game is unbelievably bad
i quit playing on what i am pretty sure is the last level because i was fed up with enemies flying into the back of my ship in the rail portions of this game it is impossible to prevent this and my best efforts being wasted by the stage shifting into my ship when i would turn at high speeds it felt like the game was having to catch up to me
i dont know why they developers keep tampering with this game
star fox is not complicated
make enemies fly through in patterns award points for shooting them down have the stage collapsechange in front of you in time for you to get an idea of the pattern the gates will close but quick enough so you will be forced to make choices left or right up or down boost or break flip on your side or stay flat
it isnt hard it isnt even that complicated
grounding me fox mccloud leader of the star fox team makes no sense at all
the game is called star fox
not run around and collect stuff fox or shoot bugs with a sissy pistol fox or land locked destroyer of force fields fox
it is star fox
star like the things you find in outter space
a game with such an obvious name should not be spent running around searching for alien spawn pointsdespite the ridiculous controls this game was still very easy which just adds to the poor quality
bad story horrible gameplay really easy
i will give one of the other control schemes another run tomorrow but i doubt that will change anything
this game sucks
i am going to email nintendo and complain tell them how they are killing one of their best franchises not really
but it is true
i should have known by the disgusting remixed theme song that played at the openning screen that this would be a disgusting remixed version of the first d game i ever played going back to play the snes star fox and remembering how its graphics were once revelutionary wow progress is funnyi was about to give this game a  star due to frausration in the levels  but i decided to let it slide  now im a beginner to the starfox games and i saw starfox assault on the shelves so i picked it up today i played it and the levels and gameplay are confusing as hell you ll here a character call out for help but you ll half to shoot down the enemy who is after them but sometime the enemy is invisible from the attack making it impossible to hit even the ground enemies are sometime invisible from getting hit  maybe its because im a beginner but i doubt it  and the levels are hard and difficult  but if youre new to the starfox games get starfox adventures first because i think fox is not in no annoying wingi usually like to write reasonably thorough reviews ones that give some isight into the game rather than simply ranton this one ill have to suspend my policy
star fox adventures was my favorite game for a long time only surpassed by the ratchet and clank series recently and i hated star fox assaultit seems like every  minutes youre facing some hardtokill miniboss
they dumbeddown the look of fox mcloud himself  hes much more blocky and pixelated
i loved the velvety fur look from adventures
the graphics of what goes on around him are great but whats going on is little more than running around and shooting interspersed with flying missions that were frankly annoying
and will the rest of the star fox team please just shut upstar fox adventures was aptly named it was an adventure with great environmental variety a real plot and loaded with interesting concepts and mental challenges but assault is just senseless runningflying around overdone bosses and little real imaginationif youre a fan of preadventures star fox please disregard
oi had very high hopes for this game and went out to buy it as soon as it came out
now that ive been playing it i have some major gripesthis game is beyond what i would call linear you are confined to a set path unlike kotor where you ran around zones here you run down paths
dreadfulcombat looks stupid
all the fights seem predetermined
when you enter combat a large loud annoying start of combat screen pops up
you decide your attack you execute your attack then you run back to where you were to stand like an idiot waiting on the enemy to attack you
i just cant get over how bad that lookswhat it boils down to is that there is little to no exploration and all the game is is a series of battles you run too
rent this thing if you have to play itthis game was not fun and overpriced i paid  for a used copy
i wish i could get my money backim straight outta the hood and thought this game was vulgar at best and not representaive of th and crenshaw where i staydont buy this onethis game was not as fun as the newer version
it was a lot harder to understand but it was okay for those that have the time to read cheat codes to find out how to operate the sims
i rate this a cthis is one of the most annoying games ive ever playeddriving is frustrating as hell
you can grind against the walls nonstop never use breaks ignore cutting cornerscorrect driving lines etc
its a pretty cheap racing experience
however in this case its not at least fun like in others arcade racers
to win you have to use boost
to get boost you have to drive into oncoming traffic do nearmisses drifting etcbasically drive like a maniac
when you get boost you have to use it to stay ahead which puts you at up to  mph in city driving
then to maintain boost you will have to do all the same dangerous stuff while going this fast
this means that unless you are a total ace you will crash like every five seconds
then no matter how far ahead you are you will drop three places
always from st to th
then to catch up to the competitors you will have to drive even more recklessly to earn and use boost which makes crashing and falling even farther behind much more likely
you have two consecutive crashes and you might as well restart the race
crashing nonstop is incredibly annoying and all the time i just wished i could drive well and have a seemless continuous race like in other gamesalso winning is based more on luck than skill
the graphics dont distinguish oncoming cars well enough esp at huge speeds and on half the courses roads glisten which makes the road indistinguishable from headlights
on the other side of the road flares tunnel lights and dividers and their reflections on the road are often red and cant easily be distinguished from tail lights
there is no way to see cars approaching intersections and at  mps you cant slow down to avoid them
in the end you can barely see the cars in the way
hence if you are lucky there wont be cars in your path as you cross an intersection or come up a hill and if youre not youll crash into them
how the hell are you supposed to avoid a twocar tram taking up rds of an intersection at  mhp
there are other games where you go incredible fast like star wars episode one racer but there the obstacles are big and easily visible so if you hit them its because you were too reckless
here  of the time you crash into something you never sawfinally the presentation is crap
all cars handle the same and the only difference between different classes is speed
the cars also dont resemble anything from the real world
the tracks are lousy
i had high hopes for the world tour and actually expected it to be authentic looking tracks
however you end up in just one area in the us one in europe and one in asia
they are totally fake locations and done so poorly that you cant even recognize where theyre supposed to be
i still cant tell if far east is supposed to be singapore or hong kong
the level of detail is minimal so overall the game looks like cruising usa or something
also all the tracks in the same region are only like  different
i would say that there are only about six truly distinct tracks in the gamecity track and highway track for each of the three regions
everything else is a combination of parts of those six tracks
the soundtrack is absolutely horrible
its like just four lame songs youd never listen in real life
and that dj is so annoyingand the whole takedown angle is pointless
if a car anywhere near you crashes you get points for it
if you nudge a car from behind it crashes and you get points if you grind against it it crashes
if you crash steer your wreck in slowmo and hit another car they crash and you get points if the exact same thing happens but you didnt hold down the slow mo button you dont claim a takedown
and either way after you take someone down theyre right back on your tail after a couple of seconds so whether you do takedowns or not the gameplay is little affected
i mean its so easy and random and produces so little effect that there is no satisfaction from executing takedowns
if this were one of those games where you can choose a heavier vehicle that goes slower but pushes other vehicles around easily mario kart motorstorm there would be some depth and satisfaction to this aspect
but here its just a tacked on gimmickthe bottom line is if you know you will be incredibly frustrated crashing over and over on a course usually at no fault of yours dont get the game
also if you like serious driving games where you have to drive well you will find this one cheapi loved burnout  loved it
whenever a few friends would come round for drinks b would be slapped in
sure the racing was nice and opening cars and tracks added to the games longevity but for the most fun you had to have a crash party
when burnout  was announced i was stoked  new cars better graphics extra modes and of course  more crashesunfortunately this game is ruined for me for two reasons  firstly during racing burnout  has the single most cheating ai ever
full stop
you can be  seconds ahead and crash and be at the back
now i may not be a phd here but unless the crash took  seconds to happen there is no physical way they could have caught up
crashes take a couple of seconds
so how did the ai cars manage to catch up
simply put they cheat
the game uses rubberbanding to ensure the cars are only ever a certain distance away
want to check that  try going slow meander along at  mph and the opponents will too
this took any skill away from the racing aspect of the gameokay but theres still crash mode right
well amazingly enough the developers took the pure simplicity of bs crash mode and turned it into a fiasco
point one  crashing was all about chance
you chose a vehicle raced like mad and picked the most opportune time to crash
after that it was in the hands of the panelbeating gods
in b however you have aftertouch you can now control your cars direction to some degree in midair
this takes away chance and replaces it with skill and this is a step backward
the final nail in b crash modes coffin is the multilpliers
dotted around the crash levels are little childish bonus icons that give you extras and as such render the crash levels to be nothing more than collecting tasks
theres no point attempting to not go for the x multiplier
none
so once you have scored it youre pretty much done with that crash level
no more choosing the right time to crash or experimenting with various methods
in burnout  crashing is all about hitting that x
nothing more
the replay is also awful  its exactly what you saw during the game  just behind the vehicle
no cameras cuts to enhance the funyou also have to play the other modes to unlock crash modes first
again this is a departure from b  whyso that leaves road rage takedown  the only part of b that added from b but that didnt hold my interest for longgraphically its all candy for the eyes as to be expected but if youre a massive fan of burnout  then expect some major changes in b that in my opinion ruin the gamefor starters this game looks great
it plays greatthats  about itthe season modes when playing with an underdog are almost impossible to win
not only will you not win but the cpu will beat the holy crap out of you if you dont withstand its cheating
if you want a great player bball game this is the oneotherwise you might break something like you ps controller playing this gamegoldeneye rogue agent one heck of a bump in the roadgoldeneye rogue angent starts off in fort knox in a training virtual reality and from there you wish you didnt waste your moneygoldeneye rogue agent is an extreamly fustrating game hundreds of people looking to make you kickthebucket to die you as some rogue agent is sent to complete some objectives that have nothing to do with the story line
but that of course is because there barly is a story line within this game
youpretty much just shoot shoot and shoot some more
and most of the time id be okay with that but this game throws there  feel right out the window
it puts you in a futureistic age and put you in verry unbelievable levelsyou get an arrange of weapons some are awesome but have to actually warm up before you fire em or you get a pistol that dosnt do heck of alotthis game ranks verry low in my  lists of likes
it was a waste of money and most of all a waste of inginuity from the makers of  video games
it makes a farce out of a good  gamejrfi must say that im very disappointed in this game
i figured i would pick it up because of the  price tag but thats about what its worth
for starters the batterpitcher interface does not allow you to remove the strike zone box which interferes with seeing the pitchers windup and locating the ball out of his hand
secondly you cannot change the fielding view at all and the one the game gives you is too close
when youre fielding a base hit in the outfield you cant tell where the runners are in relation to the base because the screen is totally focused on your fielder
the fielders are also very sluggish and they are all the same andrew jones moves in center with the same speed as mo vaughn would out there plus the throwing arms are all the same as well
randy johnsons fastball has the same pop as tim wakefields
i hope mlb  from  sports is a better effort
if you ask me high heat  is the best baseball game ever made but do went out of business sadlyi should have known any game with jeter on the cover would be a cheap knockoff of real baseball
go metsespn ks basketball sim is very good
it is good in the graphics and commentary and offers a fine balance of a real nba game and what looks like while playing without actually stepping inside your tv or getting lucky by signing an nba contract
dont we all former gym rats wishbut k just does not cut it for me
not only has the game locked up in close th quarter games but the gameplay suffers from stiffness as if the players suddenly turned into politicans running for office
yes isomotion is better but does not compare to nba lives
however for  you get a somewhat fun and often cool basketball sim
im still staying with nba live as the game to get this yearthis first real mb card game to take a tumblenfsu installs and looks like the best car game ever made but it isnt
as the intro screen finishes its loading you find yourself inside grand theft auto a map in the corner someone telling you to go to a flashing icon and you drive off to some race to acquire more cash win more cars and get some turbo and tuning
the graphics on a mb card look smashing beautiful reflections fast driving through the city but it just falls short because that is all it is abouthaving played burnout  virtually the same type of game nothing like burnout  or  i have to say than  beats this games hands down not because of the quality of graphics or the accuracy of the car models but simply because it is more apt for this games title and also offers crash control physics where you can spin your car in slow motion win more points via damages oh wait i am reviewing another game now and really that says it allnfsu is really just a stfu in comparison to much better games out there
although it looks gorgeous and that first drive is a creamer burnout  just leaves this one spinning
it is just not as fast not as creative and not as enjoyable as the real new hot trail blazerplay it when it becomes a cheap classic in two years time and instead get in the better ride next door
you will thank yourself that you didpros
graphics are mb card worthy that first ride is like a bat of hellcons
just not fast enough nothing new crash physics are better elsewhere gameplay tries to be something it is not namely gtai am amazed at the negative votes on the reviews that say this game freezes
i along with numerous other gamers across both the xbox and ps platforms are experiencing significant locking up with the game in franchise mode
there are currently threads on the espn videogames official message board site about the problem
the main thread has over  twelve pages of individuals writing in with their own specific lockup problems
this cannot be ignoredi made the switch over from ea sports to espn nhl hockey k last year
this year with the  price there was no question
i was staying with k
do not make the same mistakeplease heed this warning and review this situation for yourself before making the decision to purchase this game
espn won me over in k but im going back to ea sports after this
id rather pay  for a game that i can play than  for one that freezes
i havent played my k for months nowok i am a fan of the lord of the rings i am a hard core fan of rpgs and i like adaptations that arent afriad to branch away from the original stories
the third age has all of this
when i first picked it up i thought it was great apart from the fact they blatently ripped the battle system directly out of final fantasy  but i can live with that
the sound and graphics were great and the environments  claustrophobic as they were didnt seem bad in the beginning of the game
however when i got through most of the mines of moria i realised the harsh truth that i had experienced the high point of the game that the game wasnt going to get any better cuz it really did suck this bad and that that claustrophobic linear environments were all this game had to offer
i wanted to finish the game and i wanted to see what they were going to do with the story so i chugged through the rest of the game
what they ended with was a game that grew more monotonous as it went on and the story revealed itself as a pale outline of a possibly good story
but they decided to drop the ball on a good story and make all of the characters remain as pale as they were when they arrived delve into a love triangle where they were truthfully only two people in it but in the end they decided to throw the guy together with a random wench you meet along the way which makes no sense and they decided to end the game with a climatic battle with sauron on the top of barraddur which is the most random ending they could have had
the dumb ass main character decides hey im gonna romance the random wench
then the screen fades away into a confrontation and suddenly youre fighting saurons eye on top of the tower
when the player gets to this point in the game if you play it long enough to get there all of the gameplay and story elements come together and you open your mouth and fill the air with a resopunding wtf
its sad cuz this couldve been a good game a little more effort would have turned this piece of crap into a decent rpg contender
but hey its the movie game market just sell the product even if it sucksthis game had a lot of potential it barely lived up to minimal expectations
if there is one thing a video game shouldnt be its boring
this game didnt challenge the player in any real way  once a strategy was found it could be used throughout the entire gameterrible characterization
after  hours of gameplay i dont even remember my main characters names
there was nothing memorable about anyone in my partybattles felt like ffx but without the fun
switching party members in and out of battle felt like a chore
all the monsters save a few bosses used the same animationartwork throughout the entire game
there are only so many times you can kill a party of orcsgoblins without getting tired of itan attempt to cross the lord of the rings with a final fantasystyle rpg the lord of the rings the third age is in most ways stuck in the shadow of many other greater thingsthe main characters are not the main characters of the lord of the rings but rather similar characters that share many connections with them
berethor is the captain of the gondor citadel guard and is looking for boromir
idrial is an elf woman serving galadriel
elegost is one of aragorns fellow rangers
and so on for the other three characters all are made in the shape of other similar characters
their activities and encounters all follow the fellowship even at one point finding the campsite used by them when in the mountains in the first film
the objectives are usually tantalizingly close to the fellowship  oh thats our campsite yeah so come find us in the mines of moria
oh wait we moved on
gandalf narrates the scenes speaking to berethor usually encouraging him to try and catch up with the group
many of the games boss fights are against noncanon enemies enemies the fellowship dealt with supposedly or enemies that it wouldnt make sense to have killed
as a whole the story appears more like a fanfiction than a professional workthe gameplay is reminiscent of most rpgs
characters have hp and mp or rather ap and various classspecific skills
they can fight use skills use magic or use items
items tend to be lotrspecific things like lembas bread or kingsfoil
most of the attacks in the beginning are simply hit harder or hit harder against certain things but this later evolves into magical abilities as well
for the most part the system is uninspired and not particularly exciting
the characters run around on the world map and have oldstyle random encounters that pop out of nowhere
the majority of the battles are fairly boring and have nothing to set them apartthe graphics are fairly terrible
the textures are blocky the characters seem misproportioned the animations are odd and unnatural and everything seems to be blurry for some reason
the voice acting is decent but not spectacular the characters seem chosen again for their resemblance to established charactersas a whole this game has nothing going for it
it seems amateur in many ways and isnt particularly fun either
even for fans of lotr this isnt that rewarding because of the many inaccuracies and oddities presentthere isnt that much to say about this game
its a pretty big rip off from final fantasy x except none of the characters have any special function beyond weapon type
in ffx one character note the correct spelling of character specialized against armored monsters another against flying monsters etc
the rate of random encounters is extremely annoying
you level up just about once per battle
you gain armor and have to reequip your characters just about every two battles
i understand that there isnt much to use from the movies beyond orcs and trolls but there just isnt enough enemy variety and practically no boss battlesthe story is nonexistant
basically its all a bunch of movie clips played out of order that the programmers are trying to shoehorn into places where they dont belong
the dialogue is sickening
its like they took the script for the lotr movies and randomly cut and pasted phrases all over the place
if you have any common sense at all you will be completely disgusted by some facets of the game
like how many times you face the nazgul and how easily they are beaten
yeah in the movie theyre almost unstoppable but you and your merry band will routinely pummel them
joining up with aragorn etc could be slightly plausible at helms deep but helping out eowyn at the end
the whole point in the movie and book was that she defeated him singlehandedly
and then the final battle  even if youre a pretty casual fan of either the book andor the movie you will fall out of your chair when you see the absolute height of lameness which is the final battle
the ending is almost just as badthe graphics are pretty good
its fun to see changes when you equip armor
i wish other rpgs would do this even though helmets tend to obscure the characters faces too much
not a big deal since the characters are basically just robots that spit out random lines from the movie verbatimif you want to try this game just rent it
if youre going to play any lotr game get the hack n slash return of the kinga sim game is a game where you get to build everyhting from stratch get family trees relationships but you cannot do anything like that in this game
all you do is just talk to people until you finally get to dariuss penthouse and talking was so boring you couldnt even fall in love until you did the act romantic act when it finally turned yellowthere are only  apartaments  districts amazing isnt it
and working was boring since you had to just press the buttons that it had on the middle of the screen who cares
and also it isnt educational entertaining at all
the sim games always had something to keep you hooked and what is this to keep you hooked
nothingdo your money a favor and dont buy itafter a solid outing with ddrmax  konami returns to its habit of screwing up north american ddr releases with the wildly misguided dance dance revolution extremeeven the name is a fiasco  it borrows from the latest last
incarnation of the arcade game but arcade gamers looking for their favorite extreme songs will be badly disappointed
the defining songs of the arcade extreme  graduation cartoon heroes irresistblement etc
 are completely absent
only a few alsorans like moba moga and pink rose made it across the pacific for this installmentwhats worse is a redesigned interface that tries to combine three functions of the maxmax interface  game type selection nonstop edit data etc
 song selection and difficulty  into a single screen
i guarantee you will see this screen and have no idea what to do
maybe it makes changing difficulty from one song to the next a little easier something that was obscure but possible in maxmax but that hardly seems worth the price of making the whole interface into an utter train wreckworkout mode is also a disaster as its no longer a separate mode
instead you essentially turn on a calorie meter go play arcade mode for a while and come back to the workout menu to check the results and turn off the calorie meter
they had it right for one game  ddrmax   and went right back and messed it upthe song list for extremeus is varied but its hard to get past the fact that a lot of these songs are just plain bad
five are insipid covers borrowed from karaoke revolution and the choice of licensed songs is a mix
ymca should be fun yet curiuosly isnt and the idea of dredging up pet shop boys and their bodysuited flying surfers only makes you wonder did we ever really like this stuff
to think that the previous game had kylie minogue and the crystal method sigh
a few points are due for bringing back some ddr oldies that hadnt previously made it to north america like wonderland and only you though were still waiting for the true classics paging butterfly and dam dariramsome new minigames are a nice addition  theyll only hold your attention for a few minutes each since theyre footstomping novelties and not dancing per se but konami at least deserves a point for trying something newtruthfully this game should have been called ddr festival the name given to an imminent japanese release with the same interface and largely the same song list
the japanese ddr gamers have already had their extreme  packing a whopping  songs and generally resembling its arcade version true ddr players have probably already imported this from japan or emulated it with the opensource stepmania game for computers  and its hard to imagine theyll be terribly impressed with this installmentmuch is left out of this game that could have made it a great game but the developerstook the cheap route and loaded it with an accounting program that makes it boring with low replaypros nice graphics intricate chart of the caribbeanneg  the program doesnt let you relax you are always trying to keep ahead ofthe enormous expenses throw at youyour wife is of little use and is made out to be a shrew instead of adependable life partnerthe pirate element is weak could have been much more realisticyou cannot spend money for a house or clothes etc just property businessessince its not fair to give a review on hype and promises alone im going to give you the review first and then list the promises that were made which is why i gave fable such a low ratingsound the game has wonderful sound to it with the npc voices and even the fighting music and traveling a music
its not the greatest but it did deliver when and where it was neededgraphics i am not one to base rpgs on graphics i can do well with sprites and old school nes and snes graphics
to me graphics are not what make an rpg an rpg its all about the story and character development
graphics are eyecandy when making an rpg
with that said this game delivers in all areas your character is wonderfully done i dont know technical terms with graphics so bare with me the towns and npcs are amazing and beautiful the magic and weapon designs are amazing and an treat for the eye
unfortunately with the trees and grass and the world looking amazing you cant run off the beaten path and enjoy itstory i dont give spoilers away and i wont here
im sorry to say that the story is lacking in all departments and when it finally starts picking up its the end of the game
i will give them this though the storyline to the sister in the gameabsolutely wonderful too bad it wasnt the main characters story
also the game can be finished and all sidequests done in under  hours i know this because i beat it the day i got itcombat system two words absolutely amazing i have played tons of rpgs and by far this one i enjoyed the most
its actually what kept me playing the game and beating it
i dont think i wouldve finished the game if the combat sucked
i havent played the game since its actual release years ago and it just got put up on the shelf and forgotten aboutyou do get to have different hairstyles tatoos gotees and mustaches as well as physical scars but it gets old after awhile and you start not to carewith all that being said it doesnt sound like a bad game and how is it that i give it a bad review
well ill explainill start off with promises that peter molyneux promised for the game and the absolute linear game that i am still mad aboutpromised a full world to roam around and explore
aging process
killing kids and kids dressing up like you when you enter towns if you are good
being able to turn a town into a ghost town
being able to be good during the day and evil during the night
kill a band of thieves for a town and return to the town and they hate you because a more evil band threatens them
plant an acorn and return to see it become a tree
having a wife and kids and the kid will either love you or hate youif the kid hates you the kid will try and kill you
body developments depending on wether you use magic or weaponswhat did you actually get a very linear game that doesnt let you go off the beaten path no exploration required
a side note my favorite video game magazine ever play reviewed this game and said its the most nonlinear game ive ever played
i dont think i got the same copy that reviewer got and i still love my play magazine and that has been one of the few reviews ive disagreed with them on
okay my character ages but what about everyone elseafter it said two weeks in the game my character was  something which made me older than my mom in the game before killing kids i guess thats bad in a video gameso you cant
the only town that has kids is protected to where you cant draw your weapon and do anything
also i think only one or two kids actually try to dress like you but most people didnt notice
i did
yes you can wipe out a town full of all the people however youll fight guards for hours until you leave the town and if you return the guards are waiting for you and guarding a town with noone in it
without being able to explore the world you can not be good during the day and bad during the night
there was supposed to be sheep or whatever like that and at night you could go wipe out the flock and if you did enough damage it would force some of the townspeople to leave and turn the town into a ghost town
there is only one band of thieves and they are on the linear path and when you kill them no other band moves in to take the place
you cant plant anything
you can have a wife and no kids
also you can only be with one woman in one town so if you want to have another woman you need to go to a different town
i know it is stupid to try to have  wives in the same village but why not try
try and fight without using a sword and only using magic its nearly impossible so you end up using a sword and your body starts gettin huge and you end up not using magic that muchso the game i was looking forward to and the game i actually got were two seperate games
i first heard about fable back when it was called project ego almost a year before the realease of the xbox which released  years later after the xbox came outthats why this game only gets a very dissapointing  out of  if youve never heard of the game before you will very much enjoy it however if youre like me you will definately want to skip this onedull
that coupled with jittery rendering bad physics and horrendously monochromatic enviroments make this rpg rather annoying to play
i was bored stiff within the first  minutes
i  figured id give it an houryawnthe cut scenes are not animated crude cartoon drawings made to look like theyre being clever
and talk about loading
i thought baldurs gate had a lot but this one wins the prize
sudeki beats the hell out of this gamekids may like and eventually come to master the complex battle engine with three concurrent modes of combat but the lack of a femme fatale playableinteractive character wont hold the adolescent mind very longworth the wait
no
beautiful to look at
no unless all youve been playing lately is quakeafter all the hype i feel cheated
ive been made to cough up  bucks for a crude psychology experimentone last note  why is voice talent in western rpgs so bad
sudekis talent made you grind your teeth
in the land of fable jamaica apparently lies just off the coast
once again annoyingmidnight club was terrible was good and  is being milkedhow is it fun to street race in a game no fun to merockstar should stick making fun violent games that push the elevlope instead of putting effort into making a dumb been there racing game it should aleast be sold for  dollars instead of  because the really good games deserve to be sold at here is a game by jocks for jocks
its an interesting idea tho
you have a couple of options to select from the main menuplay game watch extras or do a quickie challenge game
staring with the extras you get a few default picture galleries and a couple of videos to watch
nothing special you have google for finding much better stuff for free if you win any of the games you can unlock more pics and videos to which none are worth looking at
the mini games in quick challenge is round  of the regular game which is an actual game where you throw a ball into targets its ok but after  or  goes at it it gets pretty repetitive and boring
oh there is also a meet the babes option which i didnt even bother to go into as the babes of this game imho are absolutely hideous to look at
seriously barfnow onto the main game
you begin by selecting your rules and what not which there dont seem to be any rather than get the highest score you can
you also first choose your bonus babe whom you can watch do a striptease video for you if you win
as i said these babes are not worth looking at and need to go and eat something rather than oil up their hideously boney bodies or they need a paper bag over their ugly faces
why would you select these women when half the girls in the rest of the game picked from the crowds are  times better looking than themso once you begin you get introduced to the team euhh who cares press x to skip it all and get into your first question
the first set of questions in round  is about  or  questions
you are given the question and have a multiple choice to answer what you think the answer is
some answers are hard for those who know nothing of that field where as some are easy peasey japanesey
however what makes this game annoying is after you pick your answer you are then shown footage of the host on the beach who brings up a chick or two selected from the crowed who is being asked the same questions
for the first round you just have to guess if she gets the answer right or wrong
this is completely unfair as you may know the answer yourself but how would you know if these people know it or not
even the nitwits they pick out that couldnt work out how to tie their own shoelaces get an answer yelled to them from the crowed and get it rightthe reason this is not fair is because your correct answer gives you money which doesnt mean jack where as to advance to the later rounds you have to guess if these girls get the answer right or wrong in order to progress along the points meter of the game
this points meter is in  sections blue where if a lady answers wrong she has to flash but her breasts are censured by a guy game logo when you reach yellow the logo is replaced by pixel blurr and if you get into the red you blow the meter up and get to see them do what they do uncensored
yes you get to see them expose their breasticles however being that this is not an official ps game its a homebrew game made legal the video quality they where able to produce for the ps looks about  better than being in the yellow and they used the pixel blurr anyway
quite a lot of the videos jump around and some even freeze up from time to timeas i said before round  is the ball game and then onto round three where you play the same thing as round  only you have to guess what wrong answers the babes gave
how the hell are you supposed to know what they said
if this was based on movies you have seen and its quizzing you on the scene then ok thats one thing but to make you go  to see how clairvoyant you are
where is the fun in thathonestly i couldnt even reach the end of the game without cheating
you can answer  on all the questions given to you but it wont be enough to make it to the end if you cant guess  of  these dimwits say too
so i got on gamefaqs and used their faq to get through the game that tells you the answers to all questionsonce you complete round  you get to see the  women selected for that round compete against each other in a final the first video was a topless sack race and just about everything else so far seems to be a stupid jump rope contest
couldnt they mix things up a little
anyway the end video is not just a bonus to watch you also bet on who the winner will be
no the winner never changes nor do the questions of the round so you may as well look up who wins instead of just go for who you would like to win as their is no random factor to be played here
once the winner is declared its game over and if you bet all your money and got it right you get the quick strip tease from the ugly skank you where forced to choose at the start of the gamethere are about  rounds to play and not one of them is any different to the other
each game is  chicks are selected from the audience they compete with the questions and you have to guess if they are right or wrong or what stupid answer they gave then play a bonus game then do it all over again and progress till you blow up the meter till you get to see actual nudity that is not censoredoverall it was fun and funny at first but after a while how much of this repetitiveness can you take
especially when there is only about  of  girls in this game worth looking at and even then they arent all that special
and as for the price of the game this game should be given away for free when you purchase a box of matches from gas stationsps to any pervert who may ask
no boobs only
nothing else
not even jello mud or a lollypopmy son tried it and he didnt like it because it was so hard to control the movementa b x  y buttons do not respond wellyou push the buttons and they easily bottom out but do not register
after they bottom out if you press a little harder then they register
this is not a quality defect its the intended design obviously  not designed by a gameraiming is difficult with the thumbstick when playing fps games
the sticks resistence should be light when the stick is near the center
the resistence should then increase as you push it away from the center it does the exact oppositeit does fit your hand as well as the scontrollerthe triggers are poorly positioned and the springs are too stiffgood newsthe wireless feature works great
just dont play games withitfirst i had no issue with getting my copy to functionhaving said that you arent missing much if you cant get it to run
it is pretty boring and repetitive
it essentially boils down to moving from state to state giving speaches and buying ads
the problem is that doing these things consists of two mouse clicks
the screen shots show all these interview shows and such but they are pretty minor in the gamei was hoping it would be great fun but i got bored with it after and hourthere is no soul to this game
its all just about numbers
you have to visit every state regularly or the state begins to turn to the other opponentno matter what ads you have in that state
in the end its about visiting every state as often as possible and putting out more ads than the opponent
i got  organizations to back my candidate and still broke even with the opponent who had none so it appears the organization sponsorship is a temporary benefit
i played this game once took about  hours and now im ready to give it away
could have been much better
another gripe i have is this why cant you choose any other party besides the two big ones
what about libertarian etc
this game was too short sightedreading the title one may wonder why i bothered with  stars well because im a big dungeons  dragons fan
all of the dd games for the pc have been hit or miss  like em or hate em i suppose
this one the toee makes me writhe in hatredgraphics  sound the graphics were okay
they could have been much better and the other dd game contemporaneous with this one  the ruins of myth drannor  looked and sounded better
suffice to say the graphics music and sound effects are tolerable but not particularly engaging or well done i should redeem some points for the game in saying that graphics and sound arent the endall of pc rpg games
but in todays market with the hardware available for home gaming its a shame that we roleplayers cant have moregameplay vastly inferior to neverwinter nights ruins of myth drannor and baldurs gate character creation was very sloppy and somewhat removed from the real dd process
its not hard to create a superhero character in this game as in other games as well and there is no real chance to create a wrong character
it takes away from the responsibility playing in game was clunky and cumbersome
the interface for the game is not intuitive and those new to ddstyle rpg games will find navigating the various menus and commands a bit irritating the story was ghastly
the intro movie clip didnt make any sense  especially if you are unfamiliar with the world of greyhawk to begin with
there is no clear reason for your character to be embarking on his quest and no real sense while playing that youre accomplishing something signficant
sorry but the go here and do that model is too weakperformance the game performed well enough but had several noticable problems
movement in game was confusing and erratic
the requirements on the box seem to be adequate but the game didnt feel smooth and seamless
accessing and moving in certain terrains and environments was clumsy and the perspective on screen difficult to manage if your pc meets the minimum requirements you should have no problems
but as always check your video and sound drivers and disable any background programs if this game runs poorly
on multiple systems i found very different performance levelstake careman was i duped into buying this
pc gamer made it editors choice and gave it a rating that put in on par with half life and doom
but it not ever close
the game looks good but the gameplay is somewhat lame and its very difficult to get through the levels without a walkthrough
you rarely get any weapons and run around with a stun gun for a whole levelthis game could have been so much better but they blew it and most likely relied on a payola scam to get people to say it was goodhear is a program that should be put on ps but it remains not availiable thus i bought it to play and enjoyokay iam not a perverted person but i decided to play this game
when you have s all the clothes dont come off you walk around finding women to flirt with then her heart pumps up then thats your time to do it
this game is like the sims but with half nudity and s
the women gives you a lap dance but its just plain stupid
this game was not really fun to me it gotten boaringthe brutal difficulty level on the final boss battle in this game just ruined it for me
who in the world do they think is playing a game like this
hardcore halo fans
if you dont care about finishing a game i guess it doesnt matter
otherwise expect your little one to be in tears over thiswhen i watched the incredibles i remember thinking that would be a really fun game
a boy who can run over a hundred miles an hour
a woman whose entire body is elastic
sounds like it would make for an afternoon or two of sugary superhero fununfortunately i disliked the game so much i never finished playing it
the gameplay was a horrible mixture of repetition poor graphics and an absurd level of difficulty
a good video game should be challenging i know but this game left me feeling multiple times as though i was mere moments away from developing an eye twitchi loved the movie
i hated the gamei am giving this game two stars  one for the graphics and one for the first half of the game
as already mentioned the graphics in this game rival those of syberia i and ii
the details are incredible the fine grain of the wood individual hairs on the characters heads or the leaves on a tree branch
in addition the colors were rich and vibrant
i was really encouraged by the graphics and the storyline for the first half of the game a wealthy englishman is murdered in front of a hundred witnesses at a party being held for his daughter with whom he has been estranged
in fact the initial suspect is his daughter
in typical adventure gameplay you as sherlock holmes and occasionally watson wander throughout the deceaseds house and other locations collecting and examining clues and interviewing witnesses
while collecting evidence holmes encounters a number of puzzlesone puzzle involves placing numbered pieces on board resembling a chessboard so that each column and row of numbers adds up to the same total  very logical and easy although time consuming game
another puzzle involves placing animal statues into noahs ark in the correct order
this is a more difficult puzzle and requires examining a few clues for the answer
however two other puzzles a card game and the combination to a safe made no sense to me even after consulting a walkthrough
but even that wasnt as bad as the puzzles that occur during the second half of the gamethese are timed puzzles
for the first puzzle holmes has to get from one location to another without being caught by a guard and a watch dog
one problem with the puzzle is that the characters of holmes the dog and the guard are only about the size of a gnat making them almost impossible to distinguish
another problem was that i could not figure out where holmes was supposed end up
the only way i could figure out this puzzle was with a walkthrough along with a whole lot of persistence
it had to have taken me a dozen or more attempts to get holmes where he needed to go without being detected
i found this so frustrating and it made me so angry that the rest of the game was ruined for me
after all adventure games are supposed to be fun  not make you want to throw your computer out the window instead i threw my mouse across the room
but wait  once you get holmes to his destination successfully and he is done there theres a similar timed puzzle to get him to a second location without detectionthen just as you think and hope that this was the last of the timed puzzles youre stuck with another one
in this puzzle holmes goes through a maze set in a forest and then needs to retrace his steps to fetch a pail of water to put out a fire
this wouldnt have been too bad except that holmes can be very difficult to manipulate at times
theoretically the player should just half to click on an icon a set of footprints to get holmes to move
unfortunately holmes doesnt always move when this icon is clicked or the icon doesnt appear at all or is difficult to locate  a couple of times it is located on holmess body
this makes moving holmes quickly through a maze very frustrating
it took me another dozen or more attempts to accomplish this task this time i only screamed obscentities at my computer
even though i was mad frustrated and disappointed i had to finish the game to find out who the killers are a few more bodies pile up during the game
once all the clues are gathered it is time for holmes to reveal the killers
but instead of a nice tight conclusion holmes rambles on for at least fifteen minutes  the answer was so convoluted and contrived that i lost interest  even taking a bathroom break only to come back to find holmes still going on and on and onthis is a game i was really looking forward to
the first half of the game was very promising but then it took a dramatic turn for the worse  i cannot recommend itas i write this im about  of the way through this game
you play as snake a commando who must navigate his way through enemy territory to thwart the communist plans to develop a new icbm launcherthe first bad thing youll notice as you play this is the cut scenes
during the first three hours of the game youll only play for about  hour
the other two and a half hours youll be sitting there watching it
the cutscenes unfortunately are pretty awful
snake talks in a monotone throughout the whole thing making it almost comical in its badness
so much of the stuff is just incredibly boring to sit through
it would be really boring as a movie its even more boring when you were expecting a game you could actually play instead of sitting and watching
by the halfway point of the game the cutscenes decrease in volume and actually become pretty good but by then its just too late
youre so sick of watching the game that even good cutscenes cant save itthe other gigantic problem is the camera system
you get a third person view which only extends for a short distance around your character
enemies will almost always attack from beyond that distance so youll have bullets flying at you and you cant see where theyre coming from
so you switch to first person view  the problem being that you cant move while in this view  you can only stand still and turn
if youve got someone shooting at you it means that all the other bad guys in the area have been alerted so there will immediately be four or five guys after you
trying to fight five guys with the awful camera system is an exercise in frustration
you stand in place aiming your gun
just as you get one guy in your sights another guy who has run right up to you while you were aiming your gun but you couldnt see him will knock you down
you get up and try to aim again and just as youve got the enemy in your sights you get knocked down again
this is the routine throughout the entire gameoverall this game is completely ruined by the awful camera system and the ludicrous amounts of really bad cutscenes at the beginning
i hear that metal gear solid   subsistence is the same game except with an improved camera system and online play  i would definitely urge people to give that one a try instead
it speaks volumes that the manufacturer would go through all the trouble and expense to release the identical game with a new camera system
they wouldnt do that if the original camera system didnt suck so incredibly bad
i could almost sit through the cutscenes if there were some good game play to look forward to but this game leaves you with nothing but frustrationif somebody told me one year ago that there was actually going to be a metal gear solid game i wouldnt like i would have laughed and called them crazy
and yet here i am giving this a poor review
so what went wrong
well let me go through the gamefirst the story
this is the main thing thats been improved from part   this shows the backstory of series mainstay solid snakes genetic father big boss or naked snake as hes called here
it gives us a brief glimpse into his head and yes maybe even shows us a bit why he did what he did in the first two metal gear games
its impossible not to feel sorry for him to not somewhat sympathize with him
kojima did an excellent job on the incredibly character driven story
so why the cruddy score
well im not finished yetnext theres the graphics and the sound
these two once again are on par with the rest of the series
the graphics are incredibly detailed and its hard to not just stare at everything in first person view and marvel
likewise both the soundtrack including the catchy james bondesque theme snake eater as well as the voice acting are as good if not better than the originalfinally here comes the part i have been dreading to write about
we all know the main aspect of the mgs series has been stealth
the premise of this version was that it would also include new survival aspects such as eating wild life to stay healthy
unfortunately just about none of this works
the stealth has now been completely ruined as its now pretty much impossible for snake to go without being noticed no matter how stealthily he is
even the new camoflauge aspect is a best as no matter now well youre hidden even if its at a full  the guards still notice you
so if you cant even use stealth then whats the point
the survival parts dont really do much either
the eating food thing isnt really needed as even eating the animals that snake hates will restore most of his health
oh and i forgot one thing the pain in the butt cure menu
now throughout both cutscenes and the actual game when snake gets hurt you must now take the time to go into the menu and heal his injuries or as a result hell take more damage then usual
this little gameplay addition i feel could have been easily done away with as its more annoying than anything elsei honestly tried to like this game
i did the very best from the bottom of my heart to continue playing but im not even enjoying it enough to continue on with the excellent story
this is one mgs that even hardcore fans need to stay away fromim gonna have to go against all mgs fansthe games very frustatingwhile the graphics and storyline are really great its a very difficult gamewhile the object of the game is to stay invicible to the eye of the enemyi had to drag myself thru the whole gamecause as soon as i got on my knees i was spottedi think the ai was overdonei know its important in gamesbut this is ridiculousnot to the point of draging my a thru the whole stagesthe camouflage doesnt work to well eitherthe angles are really really terribleenemies come from all over the place yes  degreessometimes youre laying down and you dont have time to even turn around  and once you do its all over  spotted
enemies are really hard to grab as wellto me this is a dissapointment and for sure nothing compare to sons of libertydont waste your money on this puppy just rent if anythingthank god i rented this game first
id be committing suicide right now if id actually thrown away fiftybuck on this trash
this was suppose to be the game of the year but its terrible
ive seen better game for playstation  the camera angles what camera angle
are offal
you cant even tell where the enemy is half the time
but that doesnt really matter you can run around for hours being shot up and not die how realistic is thatthe dialogue is so cheesy it makes you want to vomit
the conversations between snake and the other characters are redundant and go on forever
the graphics are okay not great but good
i cant imagine why people compare this game to splinter cell
you might as well compare mario brothers  to splinter cell while youre at it
they couldnt be more different
dont buy this game take your money and buy a real stealth game like thief deadly shadows or splinter cell pandora tomorrow insteadok i got this game for christmas and was really looking foward to playing it then i played it and was i dissapointed whats up with the overhead camera view it sucks ruins the whole game they should of just stoped at metal gear solid anyone want a free game cause i would feel bad charging someone for a cheap ass gamethis game had so much potential so much hype and it did not deliver up to the expectation whatsoever
the horrendous camera anglesystem completely distorts the gameplay making it next to impossible to engage in combat effectively
the overhead camera cannot be rotated which means you cannot see more than  feet in front of you unless you go into st person perspective but if you do so you cannot movei really hoped this game would be much better but sadly it is extremely disappointing experience
do yourself a favor and rent before you buymetal gear solid for the psx was a mindblowing cinematic expeirence
i featured cutting edge graphics for the time revolutionary stealthbased gameplay powerful musical score excellent voicework and so fourth
metal gear solid  sons of liberty for the ps in  stood the test of time
while it did receive mixed results from critics and fans alike it was interepreted as a game more so than art
it sported ingame cinematics that sometimes went over  minutes and an intricate storyline to follow with many twists
i still find it to be the one of the greatest video gmaes of all time and definently the best mgs game so far in the franchisenow on with metal gear solid  let me tell you that this game is the biggest letdown i have ever come across
i dont know where to even begin with the major flaws of this game but i will start with the gameplay
the last two games played marvelously this one was a poor excuse for anything to be considered as highly polished gameplay as said by igncom
the controls are outdated the game sues the exact same control scheme from mgs and it does not work for the setting in the game
the camera angles are horrid allowing you to see very few guards within off sighto f your camera so you must constantly go into first person view to check for any guards
the overall gameplay is just sllloooo some new features sported in this game include hunting for animalsplants to regain your stamina as represneted in a bar no more rations
now this may be realistic but it was tedious and frusterating
you are in the middle of jungle and guards are surrounding you you are cleverly hidden in patches of grass and then all of sudden your stomach makes an obsurdly loud growl
the guards catch you and you die
food should be the least concern in this game but nooo the developers ha to make this a survival experience
a new feature is also the abililty to heal your wounds sounds cool huh
its cool until after you get tired of having to press the start button go through a plephora of menu screens and sub options to apply ointments and bandages every time you get hit with a bullet
becuase of how complex this systme is it laso makes savign the game take unusually looooong
this is by far the hugest flaw in the game it takes out the fun in the experience and makes you run at a very unstable pace
not fluid at all the boss fights are not very fun with the exception of the fury which very well resembles a classic mgs boss fightthe graphics are of course astounding and one of the few pros of this game
the attention of detail is amamzing and the amount of foliage is unsuprassed
the sound effects are pretty standard and typical and the voice work is exceptional for this game
definently no hwere near as good as thel ast two but exceptional
the cinematics and overall plot  great
its just too bad you have to play the friggin game to get through the story
memorable characters alike from the past games are present here but still kind of lame and cheesy
ocelot in this game sounds like a  year old american boy which was very aggravating considering he is a young russian adult
the musical score is not so great the theme song isnt as good as people say it is
like always hideos trademark subtle references appear thorughout the game and are cleverly funnyreally its a shame that so much work and money was put into creating this game but it played horribly
i beat it once played through it a second time and tried to love it like the previous games
i just couldnt do it
the only reason i am keeping my copy of the game is becuase i am an mgs fanatic
i plan to never tocuh the game for quite awhile and i have no desire to play it again
lets all hope mgs will be goodproblems way to easy no jumping even though there is an unused button the story is the worst video game story ever just buy shattered soliderthere is a reason why it came out first but still cost morei only hope this review is written quickly enough so people do not waste money on this gameim a hardcore fan of wrestling games but i cannot recommend rumble roses for any reason at all
ill describe every aspect of the game so that after reading this review you will know exactly what the game is likeguaranteedthis wrestling game is codeveloped by the same guys who made the wwe smackdown
series
rumble roses does have some decent gameplay but it is extremely limited and you can easily plow through the majority of the game in a weekends rentalthe gameplay is like that of the smackdown seriesonly much less wrestling moves to do
each female wrestler in this game has like  moves max compared to at least  moves per character in the smackdown series
and of those  moves per character about  of them are shared by at least  other girl wrestlers making each character similar to one another
again of those  moves  are ground attacks
get the message now
theres simply not enough moves to make a girl stand out from the crowd
pick one character and theyre pretty much all alikethere are only  game modes and  wrestling arenas
the  game modes are on and mud match
the mud match plays exactly like the  on  match except there is no wrestling ring
youd think that fighting in the mud makes your character move more slowly right
wrong
the mud in this game doesnt affect your character one bit
the mud can only go on your girls skin for  seconds after completely rubbing off
the mud match was obviously tossed in the game to attract buyers
let me explain when you slam your opponent her face is completely submeged in the mud
how does she  breathe
same goes with pinning your opponenther face is completely submerged
its as if the developers forgot all about the mud and its physicstheres  wrestling arenas  for  on  match  for mud
also those  arenas look very identical making each arena pretty much the same
theres only  mud arenanow onto the girls
about them theyre not as sexy as you thinkyou can make wayyyy sexier characters in the far superior smakdown games
serously
the girls here do not look too sexy and unfortunately sexy girls was supposed to be part of this game
each girl has her own entrance music which is decentnext is the games story mode
its like youre playing a bookyou win the match to move on
if you lose you get unlimited continues to fight again
losing doesnt affect the story at all so dont worry
no branching story lines at all
its all set which is horriblei cannot recommend this game for its  msrp
lower it down to  bucks and ill think about it
unfortunately i paid  bucks for mine which i regret
if you have  dollars buy the very much superior wwe smackdown vs raw game
rumble roses has around  of what wwe sd v r has to offer
so why is it  dollars
should be 
smackdown has online play rumble roses does notpros nice graphics good control great intro movie decent voice actingcons only  on  fightingno more than  people in the match almost none mud physics laughable story line very simplistic gameplay almost no secrets worth unlocking story mode is extremely shortfinish a story in  mins overpriced at  msrp no tables chairs ladders etc not online girls not sexy enough you can make much sexier girls in smackdowns create mode many moves shared by a lot of wrestlers most moves animations are recycled from the smackdown
series cannot configure controls cannot configure match options we cannot turn off submissions pins etc
 huge collision dection problems you know somethings wrong when you grapple your opponent and your hands go right through them and you miss your grapple entirelytheres at least  more problems with this game not a joke
forget about listing them allyou get the ideafinal verdictyou can see everything the game has to offer in a day rental or even less for fast players
i guaranteed that to youthis game is greatif your  or younger
i despies older people watching and enjoying spongebob as if he were some god
wearing shirts and boxers of him gloating about how they watched the show the day before
it is a time to put an end to this misery over this terrible creature
nevertheless the game is great
graphics gameplayhell a kid wont know the difference but its good for them
unfortunally the humor in the game is just as warped and subliminal as in the show and the movie though for kids it is alright
the overall apperance of the game is great and is certainly easy to play except for a few tough levels in which you can easily help your child through
if you catch any adult near this game officialy declare them an outcast and stay away from them at all costs
this game is awesome only if your  or youngerim actually playing through this series backwards
i bought the rd game despite it getting critically panned and i liked it so i figured id give the second game a try too
unfortunately this game deserves its horrible reviewsthe thing that seperates this game from the third and probably the first is the platforming elements
like a rdperson action game youll be forced to hop across platforms activate switches by jumping on them etc
this part of the game fails miserably
jumping is a stiff and painful affair and youll fall to your death several times in some of the levels
making matters worse is that once you lose all your life its back to the beginning
no midlevel saves here to make things easier
removing these platforming elements could have made the game a lot more enjoyablereally konami forgot they were making a brawler here
horrible jumping sections aside the levels arent that populated with bad guys and the attack combos arent satisfying
the old arcade game which can be unlocked on this disc was called a buttonmasher for a reason
it threw so many enemies at you that you were busy mashing buttons to stay alive
what tmnt  ends up being is neither a good adventure game nor a good brawler game
and in the oddest trick of all it asks all players to share a life bar
i guess this was to encourage cooperation to protect less experienced players but what it really does is put the burden on that player to not screw things up for everyoneits unfortunate the gameplay stinks because the production values are decent
i like the celshaded look they got the cartoon voice actors to reprise their roles and use a lot of clips from the series
theres even some new animation in here but its offmodel and stiffer than a bad anime program
whatever
and again the inclusion of the classic arcade game is a huge bonusi really cant recommend tmnt  except it might be worth it if you unlock the arcade game which is buried reasonably far in the main levels
unless you collect all things turtles skip this one and grab the third one which is a real buttonmasher and not this sorry excuse for funthis game really has too many strikes against it to call it anything but badits a hack  slash game continuing from another hack  slash game
you could go straight from playing the first game to playing battle nexus and it would seem like your still playing the same game without missing a beat
there are very few things this game has over the original
it doesnt have the irrating adam west batman popups every time you hit someone and it doesnt have the turtles saying the same thing every five seconds
other than that its the exact same thing you left off with in the first gameone good feature that made me at least give it that second star is the inclusion of the original arcade game
in reality id say this will be the main reason most people would even give battle nexus a try
its only for the diehard nostalgic collector however
players who never played the original arcade game would most likely find the game archaic by todays standardseven with the arcade game namco completely changed the music in it
it also allows infinite credits so you absolutely can not lose the game
so theres really no challenge to it anymore
its still a nice game to play if your only in it for the nostalgia factorfinal grade the main game has nothing to offer you didnt already get from the original
hack  slash gets boring after a while
plus one star for the original arcade game for the nostalgia hunters only
definetaly an easy one to pass upstick with d ninja turtles games konami cause they clearly cant make a fun d gameshouldnt you  people know by nowsay it with menever buy movie gamesa friend of mine bought it and it was horribleit was way too easy to die inetcetcetchey listenkeep you moneyyour investment isnt in herei await the release of this title every year
usually they screw around with the story mode
last year they added some excellent featuresthis year they add voices no choice story lines and absolutely horrible control
horrible  even with the manual arrow icons on
some will remember in last years installment you could switch very easily when coming off a move to be ready for your next opponentnon existent
i find myself sometimes pressing hard soft long and short and then just mashing on the change button
nothing helps
the icon eventually switches while i am beating the hell out of the button
just in time for me to get pasted by the opposition
this becomes increasingly frustrating as you venture through season mode and are thrown into repeated triple threats fatal  ways cages  and  on s
it seems to be rather luck that you come out the winner than skillother than that glaring weakness i really enjoyed the presentation of the game
but unfortunately with all the good games coming out right now this one will end up collecting dust because of itthe game was okay but it was too repetitive throughout
the season was constantly boring and repetitive and the graphics were decent but it could have been bettersmackdown vs raw is a big let down in the smackdown series
it was so bad
the game had like no characters
theres like  characters and thats it
and they all suck
everytime i did a season i created my own guy because there was nobody good
i did like the graphics but the game was badheres the good and bad pointsgood points there was good graphics they had the voices of the characters not all good season was alright create a character was good and this time it had the picture of your character in the chose character screen online really put the game up good legends to unlock lots of good matches and a new royal rumble well sort ofbad poitns not many characters the voice overs were bad because there mouth didnt move when they said the words it was like watching an old chinese movie the season was short and you do the same things over and over again the create a belt was sooo stupid overal the gameplay was really short and they didnt work on it hard they should have put more effort into the game and i mean common no brock lesnar really blows
he was the bestthis is my second review of smackdown vs raw
the first time i reviewed the game i was admittedly very harsh and perhaps overcritical
i only had the game for a day at that point and hadnt really explored many of the features
now that ive had time to really digest the game i urge those who were nay sayers to take a closer look at the game
one of the first aspects of the game i initially slammed was its skimpy roster
even though goldberg and stone cold have recently left the wwe to make a game without them is just bad
however with the improved createawrestler and much more user friendly experience system the task of creating these and any other wrestlers you want is exceedingly simple
some new additions include the ability to have different attire for matches entrances and cut scenes and the ability to buy experience points from the shopzone
this is a huge improvement over hctp because you had to take every created wrestler through season mode to beef up their statsanother easy target for criticism was the much anticipated online mode
i have played this mode several times with a broadband connection and must admit there is a lot of room for improvement
i experienced horrible lag in some matches
however the very fact that you can take a created wrestlers online is an increddible
some of the wrestlers i encountered spoke volumes for the creativity of fans smilesthe new additions to the game minigames face vs heel tactics bring the game much closer to the feel of an actual wrestling match
some fans were upset with the disposable nature of the weapons weapons disappear after several uses but the power of the weapons has been increased compensate
finally the graphic models look closer to their real life counterparts then ever before the sets are beautiful and the voiceovers though terrible at times at a new dimension of realism to the game experienceoverall this newest installment of the smackdown series has made a lot of new advancements even if some of them need some workafter playing suikoden  and three i was so excited and had high hopes for suikoden  to live up to the same expectations as the previous suikoden games i playedbut apparently noteverything seemed so flawed its hard to even describe
what was the makers of suikoden trying to do
try something new
here is some pros about it though first characters interesting as always and keeps it related to the suikoden serieshaving your own place for your characters to go to i like how its a boat this timeelementss of betrayal always a huge part of the suikoden seriesflawsbattle system o gosh this part was sooo frustrating i really hated fighting on the boats and i hated it how we could not have six people in our party like suikoden  and they made you switchh parties
it was sort of annoyingwar system it was extremely confusing
i did not where to shoot or who i was hitting and basically the controls were so confusingnavigating in the world yeah i hated sailing the boat to different islands because the controls of the boat were very confusing and would not go the way i wanted it to be
takes me like over an hour to get to another island and overall it got me dizzystory the story did not give me any emotional feeling at all
i mean i think there was one part but it was nto as extreme and most of the characters i collected were useless in the boatunlike the other suikodens every character you put would make creative things like theatercooking mini games
none of them did anything interestingalso to the endingoh boynot gonna spoil but i was clearly disappointedgraphics were the creators of suikoden  really trying to only aim for the graphics
because they were not doing a good job
horrible camera
could not play for a long timehave to quit every hour from my nauseous moodi mean suikoden  had terrible graphics but the story made up for it but this story suckedwell anyways suikoden  is not as great as the other suikodens
i mean if you want to try it go ahead but in comparison to other suikoden
this one was a disappointmentbefore i get into my review i want to make one thing clear suikoden iv or any game like it neverwinter nights final fantasy knights of the old republic etc
are not role playing games
the way i see it they are adventure games with limited character interactions
to me a role playing game involves sitting around a table with friends dice and rule books while game master weaves his tale of adventure
a video game cannot hope to capture the detail the immediacy and possibilities that can and do occur in a well constructed well balanced riproaring epic spread across medieval fantasy nations or starspanning empires
with that in mind i still enjoy many games like the ones i listed i just detach myself from any notion of actually playing a role and accepting that i will be following a carefully scripted series of eventson that note i have to say that suikoden iv is at best a mediocre outing from the video adventure game outing
the graphics are substandard even for the aging playstation  hardware the music is entertaining with its cheesy synthesizer sound track and the story and characters are weak
suikoden iv divorces the player so much from even most other socalled role playing games you have no control over any of your characters stats abilities or weapons and only limited input on magic items or equipment thanks to a limited number of equipment slots for items
most damming however is the almost criminal lack of input when it comes to making decisions in conversations asking questions etc
the main character often simply stands and stares complacent and bovine yet always looking dolefulyou play the role of a knight of gaien on the eve of graduation and the adventure takes place in an archipelago complete with ships and merry pirate crews
arrr
bad things happen to the hero when it runs up against the pirate brandeau and acquires the rune of punishment and is later accused of murder and forced into exile with a few of his close friends
you spend an utterly inordinate amount of time traveling between tiny islands on a relatively small map which isnt so bad except you can barely travel a boat length before having an encounter with monsters
the first few times is interesting as you learn the best combos of magic items and runes but when it turns into literally hundreds of encounters the battles get tedious very quickly
and combat is little more than selecting what you want your party to do then watch it happen then repeat as often as needed to kill the bad guys
at least travel time is cut done once you meet viki a wizard who teleports you where you want to gothe only other bright spot in the game are the naval battles but even they get dull fast because again your control and options are very minimal
you select which characters man the magical rune cannons then give your commands and watch it happen
there is very little pretense of strategy save for knowing which elemental rune beats the runes possessed by the other side
also the game provides you with no diaries logs or screens that list completed in progress or pending quests
graphically the game resembles first generation ps or any pc game circa  textures are dull low rez and bland
objects are low detail and clunky looking you cant pick up or interact with the environment in any way
map areas are small and load screens are often longer than it takes to move from one area to the next
you cant climb or jump and low curbs like sidewalks stop your guy cold
on the other hand the static character art from menu screens etc
is first rate which typical for the suikoden seriesall in all given the technology and capabilities provided by the current generation consoles this is a very substandard outing
even xenosaga had more interesting characters and story lines
suikoden iv seems like it continues through inertia rather than generating a real interest from the story and its people
its a dull lifeless spectacle
it doesnt reward cleverness or good ideas though there is little reason to since youre basically on rails through out the whole adventure
and like a six hour lecture on the differences between pre and post columbian pottery you start wondering when its going to endwhenever you have a series of games  you often run into a clunker somewhere along the line
for the suikoden series the th installment more than fits that descriptionin the other suikoden games the plot in depth characters and sheer enjoyment of finding the  stars of destiny are extremely well done
not only does this game fail miserably in those aspects but just moving around the world is a tedious actsince the game takes place in the island nations you spend much of your time sailing around in your ship
unfortunately the random battles in this game are also very high
i have nothing against random battles and often enjoy them
however a battle every couple seconds while moving around the world map is a bit extremethis game is extremely shortactually a blessing which is probably why you have random encounters every  seconds otherwise this  no plot game would last  hours
the only positives i can say for the game are the very nice looking graphics perhaps the best in the series
however i would gladly trade the graphics for a much better plot and character developmentfortunately suikoden got back on track with the th installment
i can only recommend this game for those of you who must have every game in the seriesi have two pss in two different places one in pennsylvania with my brother and the other here in nyc with me
it was becoming a hassle to keep track of which of us got which memory card we have two nykos so i bought the mb version of this card which amazon doesnt seem to have here to put everything worth backing up on one card
i have the max my brother has the nyko cardsi had no problem at all copying the files from the nykos to the max nor have i had any problem with loading files from the max
the problem comes in with trying to save
i tried to update my we love katamari save file and it no longer lets me
if i save to a different file it still fails
im currently leaving the system on until i can get to gamestop tomorrow to get a replacement for the maxsince i bought a mb card its not even near full capacity yet
its ended up being a waste of money as i could have saved everything to nykos
at least those workive never had a problem with either nyko memory cardin a nutshell its all right if all you want to do is backup your files but it seems that once the memory gets past a certain point saving becomes useless
youre better off with a sony or a nyko even if they arent as large
even the mb version of this card isnt worth it if you only have full access to your files up to mbi own the xbox version of this game and it is incredible
i rented the play station one just for fun
i knew it wouldnt come close but i just wanted to see how it stacked up
this game is of very mediocre quality by to days standards
the first splinter cell that came out for ps is better than this one
the ps chaos theory sort of looks like an early prototype of the xbox version before detail texture high quality graphics and nonlinear mapping were put in
if you dont have the xbox though its still a pretty fun game so id recommend at least renting iti have to agree with most of the reviews in that this game is truly a masterpiece of realtimestrategy rts
i have played many of these types of games and i found that this game offers all of the features that i always thought would make the ultimate game in this genre
you start in the ancient age and work your way all the way up to modern times
that fact alone is amazing
it is very satisfying to watch your units upgrade through the ages from cavalry to stealth bombers from wooden war ships to aircraft carriers
very coolwhat gets me is the replay value of the game
i started off with the conquer the world campaign which places you on a large risk type map and allows you to move armies around and invade countries with the ultimate goal of capturing the entire world
i picked the germans and thus started with my capital in berlin germany
the first few missions were fun
i captured some territory from the locals by forming raiding parties and sweeping through and destroying everything
no building and gathering resources in these missions
i was still having fun when i declared war on greece and began to fight my first real battles
the default objective is that if you are invading a territory held by another country you have  minutes to capture the enemy capital
if you are being invaded you need to hold out for  minutes
sounds fun
the only problem is every battle is set up the same way
how long to the expect me to keep fighting  minute battles that are complete replays of the last one
you start with one city and some troops and citizens you build up your economy and eventually you have the resources and army to defeat your enemy
thats it
over and over
i did it about  times before i had enoughi must admit that i didnt try any of the other campaigns i think there are  total such as alexander the great and the cold war
i just couldnt force myself to put this game in start gathering resources and do the exact same thing i had done the time before
im sure i missed something by not playing these other campaigns but i just couldnt force myself to play this over call of duty
and i am of the opinion that you should never have to force yourself to play a game to begin withwhile there is some satisfaction in building up a large army and destroying your enemy it quickly gets overshadowed by the repetition of the game
if you are thinking of buying this game in the hopes of conquering the world and are not the type of person who enjoys completing the same monotonous task over and over then i would look elsewhere
while i can see why so many people enjoy this game i wanted to present some reasons for why you may notthis game is a mix of well thought out missions and some that defy military tacticsstrategy even common sensest air cav and air mobile when you can holeup in a bunkers and fight off swarms of enemy  it would only take a few lobbed gernades to wipe everyone out or on sneaky enemy to wristflick one in sideways  when youre in a huey and youre not able to controlaim any of the door gunners well thats pretty weak  when theres multiple gunshots within a room containing prisoners coupled with sounds of struggle yet the guards dont investigate well thats pretty weak russian roulette however the game does deliver various types of missions over different terrainenvironments  its just that one doesnt know when to think rationallytactics  strategy or think irrationally and do what one shouldnt do  the game is hit andor missblah blah what can i say
nothing ever turns out as well as they advertise
it would be nice if they gave all the full details before purchasing it such as which games exactly it is forsome levels are far too difficult to be fun even on the easy settingthe foy church tower comes to mind among several others
its a thin line between challenge and frustration
its no fun to do the same levels over and over without result and it should not be necessary to constantly use cheats to get through the levelsthis is commonly referred to as one of the worst video games in history
i agree its the least successful but ive actually played games that are far less playable then thisthe graphics in this game suck even for atari  standards with the exception of the title screen which looks a lot like the real et
in fact this game is so bad the title screen is the best part of the gamethe goal in this game is to control et
and look for parts of a phone while avoiding pits to get out of a pit you have to extend et
s neck by pressing the fire button and keep holding it until you touch the ground outside the pit never let go as soon as you are out or youll fall back in fbi
agents who take your items and doctors who take et
to a government building
there are a lot of glitches in this game that make it almost unplayable
this is also where the  do i go kind of games
youll have no idea where to go or what to do without a guide on youtube or the interneti bought this game simple for collection and i have no plans to ever play it again unless im really boredi love sniping
in most shooting games i tend to pick the sniper rifle or anything to snipe people outwhen i saw this title i had to get itwhen i started to play the first chapter i had doubts that itd be that greatthe sound of the guns even how they fired looked old and very dullthe graphics werent even that sharp and impressiveit did at times give me a sniper feeling but the game ended so quicklythis just isnt a promising gameas my title suggests a disappointing gameas a sniper in this game you spent most of your time as an infantry man trudging the towns fields streets etc but rather than being a true sniper specialist you play an infantry soldier who just happens to have a sniper riflethe graphics are fairly good and the fps perspective is well done but where this game really falls down is in the gameplay
let me explain
the play is very linear you cant stray from the chosen path by more than a yard or two at which point youll hit an invisible wall
you have a compass that dictates which way to go next
your fellow soldiers simply stand around and watch not all but a lot of the time even when they are in the midst of a firefight especially when youre in desperate need of assistance
the enemy is repeatedly regenerated from one or two areas and you must kill all of them before you move on to the next encounter
this became drawn out and tedious after a short whileall in all a call of duty wannabe but poor play makes this effort a game to avoidim not a kid writing a review but a  year old who has played more computer games in the last year then most do in a life timenot putting down the young but this game is clearly geared toward a younger generation
why
well lets say that i bought rome total war and comparing the two there is no comparisonthis game is just a overgrown arcade game not a true rts
it does not even compare to rtw or mtw or even ages of empires which was released in the mid nineties
come on ea games
activision has the upperhand when it come to true rts stradegy
i know this is just my opinion but if you are a true gamer and a avide rts player you will not like this game at all
i would go into the game play but it is not even worth it to me or my typing figures
very disapointed in this game
it lacks everything that makes a rts great
most of these great reviews are just kids no offense but they dont really understand or have the taste for true rts stradegy why
it is tooooooooo complicated for them no offense again but they are just not mature enough to understand a hardcore stradegy game including economy upkeep technology tree advancements and your faction stats including managing money etc
that is in rtwmtw and if they do have rtw they probably let the computer manage all this for them
if not they are very advanced for there age and are sure to achieve greatness later in life
at that age i didnt even have a clue about stradegy and played mario brothers on my nitendo the first version kiddies
if you compare lotrbfme to the great rts games that have came out recently there is no comparison simply put
if you want a good rts game the best that ive played thus far get rome total war do not buy this pieace of software junk its for the kiddiesno really its not a bad gamebut its really nothing great
it has its moments if youre just looking to kill some time or if youre really into strong bloody violence i know i amvery good graphics and the character designs are mostly great
animations and so forth are also examplorylow points very frequent and long loading screens  very complex and difficulttoexecute combos necessary to complete konquest mode or play on high difficulties  ai which often just spams unbreakable combos there are breakers but they often seem not to work unless of course the computer uses them then they never failits a good way to kill some time and it becomes infinitely more fun with friends and alcoholim a nut for daytona usa and seeing as how there is barely a home console version of it i thought maybe sega vr racing might have been a simmilar game
in some ways it looks a bit like it but its far from it behind the wheel
i found the cars controls to not be perfected and there is no sense of speed when playing so it wasnt looking good the rest of the games on this disc after that gamenext up was outrun it used to be a cool arcade game i guess you need the wheel and stick to appreciate it
no wait i have that game on mame so why is it not fun on this version
probably because it seems harder now you have to drive flawlessly to make it to the end
thumbs downmonaco gp  what an annoying birds eye view racing game the second you pick up any speed you crash into another car or wall who the heck designed the controls of this
two thumbs downcolumns as a ps game
really
if it was played with a mouse or touch screen then this would be ok but its a half arsed watered down version of bejeweled and not even half the fun
i dont care which game came first the one here is a terrible idea to be playing with a controllergolden axe  something tells me this is not the original arcade in fact i dont think any of the games on here are the original arcade versions
i remember this game being fun and easy where as this one it seemed like collisions werent colliding or certain moves couldnt be defended it looked ok graphics wise but it has become just another button mashertant r  never heard of this before
its like a bunch of mini games you play you have to complete  or  mini games to catch a bad guy
seems logical
the games range from something a  year old could do to something your grandmother might play
it was interesting for a few minutes but grew very repetitive and boring quicklyby this time i turned the thing off and am done with i cant image the other two games on here would save the overall ratingoutrun  golden axe vr  monaco  bbros  columns  space harrierfantasy zonealien syndrometant rbbrosonly buy it if you loved the original game and just must have it on ps even if its a remasteredremade versionthought this would be a fun always been a fan of sonic and my  year old loves him
this collection doesnt even allow you to play all the games listed
the graphis are awful compared to crash bandicoot star wars and cars for the same system
maybe because it was meant for sega
i dont know but dont waste your moneyi bought atari anthology primarily for asteroids and tempest
while i must admit it was definitely fun to see these games again they were somewhat of a disappointment
not that ive been spoiled by pss recent high tech games of  but because the game play from this anthology was just bad
first on tempest as well as asteroids theres a huge blue inanimate bordor around the screen
thus it makes my  inch tv screen look like a  inch
second when i pressed the buttons on my ps controller the games just didnt move very well for me while playing tempest the little thing you have to move around in a circleshape is very hard to do utilizing all  ps buttons on the controller
other games featured this useless bordor as well and others mostly from the atari  system did not
the picture itself seems dull
i remember asteroids being so basically simple  yet the little triangular white ship and the white boulders flying across the screen were so sharp against the black background
my  eyes dont see these shapes very sharp almost blurry at all on this game
the sound is also lacking like its totally mono sound quality
the cover of this game boasts  game titles  of which were actually found in the arcades but after you play a majority of them once i guarantee youll probably never look at them again
definitely a fond throw back to see games i grew up on like missile command battlezone red baron centipede and even the grandaddy of them all pong
however as stated before the game play is difficult on most the picture quality is average at best and the sound is poor overall a poor representation for ps
looking for a halfway decent attempt to bring back some of the old classic games  check out museum by nameco featuring galaga and dig dug  both look and sound greatits is okay if you are a dbz fan but it is horrible graphics and it gets boring fast
i have played better games but it is a okay gamethe first game was entirely new and fresh
this one on the other hand is nowhere near new and fresh
the only thing that couldve saved it was multiplayer and hey lucky us there is no multiplayerone star
big waste o time
thats what id like to rate this and probably should rate this but there were a couple decent boss fights and powerups that prevented me from totally hating it but still doesnt stop me from disliking itget the first one for a good time but skip the second one because really youve already played that one when you played the first onewell lets compare the awsome x with this versionhere we get the annoyance of having to turn your character around uglier stages one stage is so bright its hard to see which way zappa is facing  character battle which is kinda fun no story mode or at least not near as good as x  new characters the exact same charactersprites and combos as before character screen that is so small you have trouble finding the character you want to play withreally just skip this game and get x
this is just an uglier version with some extras that just arent worth iteverywhere i went to research the best d fighting games mentioned the guilty gear series as being epic the best
the major review websites sung their praises and i heard that i should get either isuka or accent core xx for the best version of guilty gearlet me tell you people who read the same things i did that isuka is not the guilty gear you wantcontrols are frustrating manually turn your character around in d
and the actual gaming experience is survival mode
there is no arcade mode
what you get is something that looks like arcade mode but has something called a daredevil
whenever you are doing well against one on one opponents suddenly the word daredevil flashes across the screen
it interrupts your battle and suddenly you have to fight two or three different characters at once with no health recovery instead
oh and you can chain daredevils until your fighting score hits  and the daredevil is a boss named leopold who is invulnerable except for his head
not good timeslet me repeat one last time  this is not the guilty gear you want to buy
tryguilty gear xx accent coreinsteadhalf life  could have been an all around excellent game
unfortunately its flaws bring it down into the levels of mediocrity for many playersfirst off lets start with the bugs in this game
no matter what brand processor motherboard videocard or soundcard you have no matter how fast your system is there is a very good chance you will suffer from crashes sound stuttering and frequent  second freezes in this game
there are many things valve will tell you is wrong with your system that is causing the problem but in the end it is a problem with their programming of the source engine  which has some unforseen compatibility problems with a wide spectrum of hardware
valve has still not delivered a satisfactory patch addressing the bugs in the gamenext up is inefficient shader programming
though the game runs beautifully on modern nvidia geforce  videocards at max detail buyers with older cards are not so lucky
if you have a geforce fx  card you will be forced into using a lower quality directx  mode even though the geforce fx supports directx   this is because valve coded the shaders inefficiently and failed to use partial precision fp in their game unlike all the other directx games available
by using a mixed precision path which valve stated would be in the game and benchmarked over a year ago they could have made directx available to owners of older geforce fx cards
however much like the rest of the game the graphic implementation here appears rushed and again we have less than desirable results for a large amount of people
so dont expect anything approaching the best quality unless you have the latest  videocardbut the disappointment does not end there
most games you type in your cdkey hit install wait a  minutes and you are done
not half life   after doing the initial standard  minute cdkeyinstall you then have to install a program called steam on your hard drive and setup an online account
this takes another  minutes
after you have setup the steam account you then have to wait for the files to be decrypted on your hard drive
this takes about  minutes for the games on the ce
so now you are talking an hour just to install the game
you think boy after all that it must be real easy to play right
no way
you have to keep the cd in the drive like any other game and on top of that you have to launch the steam program wait for it to connect to the internet then you can play half life   every time you play the game
there is a hassle you can go through to play hl offline but you still have to install activate and decrypt the files on steam at least once
major major major intrusive pain in the rear that no buyer of a retail cd should have to endure
this is a case where antipiracy measures have hurt the consumer more than the piratesif you are not fed up with the game after the long and intrusive install the missed opportunity in terms of graphic performance and the bugs that may bring your game to a grinding halt on a frequent basis then you may actually enjoy this game
but thats a big ifproceed with caution with this title
what could have been a great gaming experience has been marred by sloppy general programming  bugs inefficient graphics programming for older graphics cards and a horribly intrusive and painful install procedure that persists past the install and into your gameplaying experience
if you think you can deal with these issues this is definitely a cool game
on the other hand you just might want to skip it and go for doom which is just as fun and doesnt have all the technical issues this game doesmetroid prime is definitely overrated
let me list all the reasons why the game totally rips off mega man legends  a playstation game released two years before this game came out on the gamecube
the fire snakes that pop out of the lava and the beetles that pop out of the ground are two things in particular that are way too similar to aspects of mml for me to buy this is supposed to be some kind of coincidence the music is severely disappointing
the main theme song where the spaceship is located in the beginning of the game is a remake of the classic theme from the original metroid released in  but done much much worse
oh sure it may have sounded beautiful and epic back in  to signal the realistic approach to the d movement video games were taking at the time but nowadays this particular theme lacks inspiration melody and any distinctive qualities
in other words despite the epic beauty of the music its just bland and pointless to me
ill take the original  version with its inspirational melody thank you very much i mention this game feels like a ripoff of mega man legends  its also a ripoff of quake ii the classic pc shooter
the environments and many of the dark areas feel exactly like quake ii which makes me wonder why im playing metroid prime when i could be playing quake ii instead
metroid prime is nothing more than a corridor shooter the enemies you encounter are quite uninspiring for the most part
you have these suicidal bats that dart down from the ceiling but theyre small boring and lack inventiveness
you have vines that pop out of walls and pretend like theyre snakes these are just annoying to shoot
you have wasps that swarm from hives and dive at you it is very irritating to take out a swarm of these
there was nothing like this in super metroid
nothing was irritating about the enemies in that game
enemies are not only annoying to take out completely but unacceptable to look at because of the bland way they were designed boss battles are flatout horrible
that gigantic plant you have to take out is underwhelming compared to the plant boss in super metroid not to mention it takes way too much time to actually defeat despite your best efforts to use the charge beam and morph ball
the very first fight in fact is the worst one of them all repeatedly and needlessly shooting wasps over and over again ugh
im not impressed at all here boss battles are for the most part overlong and boring with no usage of creativity on the part of the developers metroid prime overall suffers from the same problem that resident evil  suffers from the movielike cinematic feel of the entire game used for no other reason than a cheap attempt to make the game look as much like a movie as possible
i dont see the appeal of these kind of games to be totally honest going for that grand and pretentious movie theater effect in video games has been done so many times by this point that its just not worth the time or energy to create them in this way anymore not to mention graphics arent nearly as important as many gamers would have you believe graphics mean crap to me the game is trying to go for a perfect d update to super metroid but metroid prime is nothing like super metroid
how can it be
metroid prime is just one of literally hundreds of generic d shooters out there where one man or in this case one woman goes through a huge world narrow corridors and shooting and exploring and before you say this game is all about exploration let me respond by saying not really
the exploration aspect has been greatly exaggerated because youre honestly not exploring more in this game than you are in say quake ii and that game never gets credit for the exploratory features it implements so neither should this one the game is so easy that you can literally just rush through enemies while running down hallways and actually allow enemies to take off small chunks of your energy
it doesnt matter because youll have plenty of energy by the time you reach your destination anyway
the game isnt hard enough four words why all the scanning
this is perhaps the most annoying thing ive ever seen in all the years ive been playing video games
if this feature was implemented for storyline purposes only i wouldnt have a problem with it
but theres actually a purpose to all that scanning you do throughout the game it effects achievements at the end of the game
who actually feels like scanning enemies and bosses every time you play this game
not me not ever
you dont have a choice though that is if you care about the achievements
terrible game development platform jumps
the excessive amount of platform jumps featured in this game are completely unnecessary not to mention a hassle half the time
i dont care if nintendo fanboys defend the abundance of platforms in metroid prime by claiming this is not a platform game that doesnt make the many platforms suddenly become nonexistent theyre still there and we still have to deal with them
at least make jumping from platform to platform more creative like mario or spyro games
that would help the game a loti just dont like this game very much
its boring overrated and not very fun
this game gets a  out of  despite the fact amazon keeps saying im giving it a  out of  trust me im notit can be programmed to work like the ps controller and works just fine except for a few problems with the game i play star wars battlefront  when you push down on the left analog stick it doesnt respond right away and sometimes has to be pushed really hard to do what it needs to
also this stick tends to keep moving to the left when left alone after using
i dont knwo if i got a defective one or not but its quite annoying
otherwise its not bad
for the game though too not sure if game or stick i have to reprogram the buttons every so offten because it resets to defaults
anyway not sure about others out there but this was a disappointment especially coming from logitechi accidently wrote a review for the wired version of this gamepad but will update here because this is what i boughtafter i wrote my comments in the wired version a few folks wrote in their review that i didnt know what i was talking aboutwell im a computer expert ive tried every avenue to make this dang thing work right but no matter what i do there is no feedback for ea sports madden  even though this game is featured on the logitech rumblepad box
the rumble works for ea sports need for speed but not for madden  or the only conclusion i can come to is this thing is still experimental and not ready for releaseive sought help from logitech ea sports microsoft online forums updated drivers tried clean boots reinstallations galorehours and hours later still not working right
no more logitech for me
maybe no ea sports either
i dont need the aggravationi wish to god id never heard of god of war
this game sucks big time  ok lets start off
the story lame lame lame
honestly they would have been better off putting no story in at all it sucks so bad
why do people criticize the story in some games but not a game like this
i dont get it
the story sucks
the gameplay  decent
not as good as spartan total warrior but better than a typical game
graphics good enough no problem there
fun factor not too hot
not enough variety to keep my interest just bashing a bunch of heads over and over
in a game like spartan total warrior this worked to its advantage because it became addictive
but in this game it just gets boringok so far we have a decent game where does god of war really go wrong
it oversteps its bounds
it doesnt know its place
a game like this should be somewhatmindless violent fun
instead it tries to be a smart game and interjects with stupid puzzles and the like
the boss killing kind of sucks because it will give you a task to do like keep pushing triangle and if you do it right the boss is dead
if you do it wrong you have to wait again for your instructions
gee kind of like the way they train rats  do this and ill give you cheese
i hate that kind of gameplay because its boring
of course people think that feature is good because its new
but being new doesnt equal goodand now to the clincher even though the game isnt that great i was going to keep playing until i got stuck
you must be kidding me
its the year  now and theyre still making games that dont work
so at this particular point i go around and around trying to find every conceivable way to get to the next part of the level and there is none
now if for example i was playing halflife  id just say oh im too dumb and impatient for puzzles ill consult a walkthrough
but thats halflife   this is an action game trying to be too smart for its own good
either that or it was simply a bug in the game that got me stuck somehow
either way its frustrating and i hate it
and no im not a bad gamer so dont blame it on me
i play online games and often score so if youre looking for an average game you can play it and hope you dont get stuck like me
if youre looking for a game very much like this but done better play spartan total warriorhmm after constantly swearing at this game and punching the wall from dying falling off things and dying a billion times i finally gave up
i was very near the end at zeus mountain where you fight harpies and archers on rollers and i just couldnt handle the stupid frustrating disappointment that is god of war anymore
the game started off pretty fun and innovative but after a few levels it just disintegrated into a very uncool and boring hey lets make you jump from platform to platform oops you missed it your dead type of boring wasteful blah gameavoidi bought this for kids that play sly cooper ratchet  clank jak and daxter hoping this would be a nice diversion
ugh it was awful i thought
i tried to be enthusiastic about it but it was so slow the graphics were dated looking and it just seemed tedious to play
there was more dialogue than i wanted and it just never captured anyones attention
i feel bad for the person who bought it from methe incessant jumping and being knocked down everytime by flying bats is enough to drive even the most mild mannered of gamers stark raving mad
do not buy if you want a casual waste of time only buy if you are hardcore and enjoy challenges that are near impossibleah the original metroid
i love the original
however this is a waste of money
why could such a classic game be a waste
cuz if you buy metroid zero mission and beat it which actually only takes about  hours for an average gamer youll unlock this game
so basically you get  games in  with m
but still this game is fun insanely tough and its just classic
zero mission may give you all the updates to the metroid series like wall jump and speed booster and combining of beams but its a cakewalk compared to the original
this is a good game but if you want more moneys worth just get it with msome reviews are easy to write like a review for the gba rerelease of metroid
well review the  gba title and then metroid itself
the classic nes series can be seen as a forerunner to the far superior virtual console on the wii wii u and ds
unless you are a collector dont bother getting these games
of course in  when this review was written only collectors would be seriously scouring the globe for such titles as pretty much all twelve titles in the classic nes series are now available on the far superior virtual console for a fraction of the costgba metroid review  with the advent of the gameboy advance nintendo decided to rerelease select titles from the nes library of titles
in japan the series was known as the famicom mini product line and in uspal as the classic nes titles
while japan got thirty titles in all the uspal regions only got a simpering twelve titles bomberman donkey kong excitebike ice climber the legend of zelda pacman super mario bros xevious castlevania dr mario metroid zelda ii the adventure of linkcritical reception to the series was mixed to say the least with complaints about changes maded to various games and price issues
of the twelve titles released only the legend of zelda metroid zelda ii castlevania and perhaps super mario bros really justified the twenty dollar purchase price which was the msrp
the other eight titles simply did not justify the high purchase price generally due to short gameplay
super mario bros had already been rereleased in  as super mario bros deluxe which featured superior features and an unlockable version of the lost levels although the aspect ratio was off due to the smaller screen size of the gameboy colour
likewise there were also aspect ratio issues with this rerelease of super mario brosthe two legend of zelda nes titles along with the two n titles had been recently rereleased in  as part of the zelda promo anthology that nintendo literally gave away which takes away from the appeal of the classic nes series
the only advantage of the gba versions were they were handheld versions of these early classic essential titles
both zelda titles had been out of print since the nes days so their rerelease was fantastic but i had gotten them alreadyso now we get to metroid
like the two zelda titles the value of the classic nes gba version was questionable to say the least due to then recent commercial products formally issued by nintendo to the marketplace
and unlike the two zelda rereleases the metroid rerelease did not even have that advantage of exclusive handheld gaming that could have possibly allured a gamer to purchase said titlebarring the original nes release by  games could access metroid in three different titles
by using a special cable connecting a gameboy advance to a gamecube when you linked the gba metroid fusion to the gamecube metroid prime unlocked the nes version
also after completing the gba metroid zero mission itself a remake of metroid the player again could unlock metroid
i used both methods to play metroid back in that era
because i owned and loved zero mission i passed on buying the classic nes rereleasewhy should you pay for something that you have gotten free as an unlockable bonus for in a far superior release
like the two zelda rereleases i simply gave this one a passand that was largely the problem with the classic nes series
there simply wasnt much value to the games nintendo chose to release due to the aforementioned reasons already given in this reviewthe real heartbreaker and the one title i would have bought back in  without a doubt was nintendo released super mario bros  the lost levels on the famicom mini series
unfortunately they did not publish that game across the waters leaving it only as yet another japan exclusivemetroid review  metroid the original  nes classic designed by shigeru miyamotos mentor gunpei yokoi stands tall in nintendos back catalogue as an undisputed classic and the start of a heavy hitting franchise to boot
general consensus is while metroid is easily one of the best of the early nes titles as a series the game is rather rough around the edgeswhat can pass as marketready game design in  simply doesnt fly in subsequent years
like the  title  the legend of zelda a link to the past did to the original  the legend of zelda super metroid took the basic blueprint of metroid and so drastically and radically built and improved upon said blueprint that sometimes its hard to go back to the originalin regards to my own play history my parents bought me lttp in the early s and i played through link to the past countless times throughout that decade
it was only in  that i actually played through the original the legend of zelda
having grown up with lttp i found the original zelda somewhat lacking simply because lttp takes everything that is so brilliant about the original zelda and exponentially improves upon itin the metroid my play history is completely reversed
i seriously began playing metroid in  having never played super metroid other than a few brief instances in the s
aalthough i briefly played the game in the s i but never got out of brinstar
in  i completed the game several times over and then went on to super metroid
to me metroid will always remind me of my college daysthe game is a massive maze
there is no map which really isnt surprising since this is 
a lot of the areas look similiar or have idential room layouts this is especially true of kraids hideout and parts of ridleys hideout norfair and brinstar
the similarities and copy and paste design of certain sections of metroid can make it rather hard to know where you are at unless you are intimately familiar with the game and can be rather disconcerting and confusing to say the least
the game features substantial amounts of backtracking which may or may not been seen as a flaw personally metroid is by definition an exploration so some the backtracking is to be expectedthere are frequent transitions from one room to the next again common in kraids hideout which features a fast moving flying enemy where an enemy can pass through a door as samus exitsenters thus sustaining unavoidable damage
samus cannot shoot diagnally and also cannot shoot while ducking which can be rather challenging
samus is able to get two different projectiles the wave beam and the ice beam
unfortunately you cannot have both and the ice beam is required for the last section of the game tourian
so if you get the wave beam during the course of gameplay ultimately you will have to get the ice beam again which is available in two locations and somewhat close to tourians entraceanother big complaint is that like kid icarus samus starts out very underpowered
while being underpowered is not necessarily a bad thing metroid can be rather unforgiving to first time players
kid icarus is one of the few platforming titles that actually gets easier the further you progress due to leveling up pits powers
in regards to metroid a significant draw back is how the energy refilling works
you are able to get up to six energy tanks of  health each
however if you die you start out the game with only  health and essentially have to grind your way up by killing these various enemies to regain your health
the more energy tanks you have the longer this process takes and is rather monotonoushowever for  the game is classic
while these gameplay issues can be frustrating the game is tremendously fun especially compared to what was on the market in 
metroid was an indepth expansive game among the first to feature multiple endings contigent upon how much time you took to beat the game filled to the brim with secrets with some amazing sound effects still love the sound for finding an item
and music
samus aran is also famous for being one of the first female video game protaganist antagonists in a medium dominated by males male characters and her secret identity was a big plot twist in an era notable for its lack of narrativeyes everything metroid does super metroid does better while removing all the commonly accepted flaws of the original
still for my money ill always love metroid more probably because unlike the legend of zelda and a link to the past i first played through the original before going to the snes title
that may have made its rough edges far more paltable to me than had i been a super metroid junkie and then tried playing through the original
i have a much more emotional attachment to it than the snes one despite how amazing the snes game truly isthe good takes you back to those early days of gaming  frustration and all cool music original idea at the timethe bad difficulty is insane why buy this when you can get zero missiondifficulty impossiblethe original metroid introduced us back in the day to a game where exploration was key
total exploration without any clues or maps or even so much as a convenient save system thankfully this version saves automatically when you die
now while this sounds all well and good the idea with the technology back then was way ahead of itself
while its great to provide such an idea the challenge that went along with it was unpolished mostly because controls back then just didnt provide an adequate job of what the game was supposed to represent
see the problem is that samus back then jumped like a bouncy ball a tap would do a small jump but holding more than that would cause her to stay in the air longer than necessary and since she flowed downwards like honey landing on objects became an incredible trial of a persons frustation levels
this wasnt so bad at first but once you get into the game and have to start landing on very small platforms while trying to avoid enemy attacks and hitting enemies with your very limited shooting directions later enemies move into spots which makes them near impossible to even shoot it was an instant recipe for anger management courses that would later come
now unlike the remake zero mission samus doesnt power up as quickly therefore making the game even unnecessarily harder
at some points you may scratch your head wondering where in the hell youre supposed to go basically because you may have to blast some random wall you never knew needed to be blasted in order for you to progressthough all this is annoying the graphics were killer at the time and the music is some of the most memorable in gaming history
of course this all only lasts for so longin closing this game really is unnecessary because the much better and more balanced zero mission is available for only a few dollars more and this original nes game is unlockable after you beat that game
so this is pretty much a waste of moneybottom line buy zero mission instead
its actually get this fair and you get more for your moneyi am a big zelda fan and this game was different from other zelda games like it was a sidescroling rpg type game
that idea could acctully have made this a great game but the thing i realy hated is that this game is like the hardest game ever
if you die three times your done for
also the enimies are way too hard
being able to use magic was preaty cool though and unlike the first zelda game you can see people walk through the towns instead of standing in one spot which was preaty facinating back than
i wouldnt recomend buying this game but if you do see it for like a dollar or two than go check it out
i think every zelda game is worth trying out even this onethe first painkiller was a ton of mindless violent fun
booh takes the exact same formula and adds a few new weapons and new maps
the problem i have with the game is the very steep jump in the difficulty level half way through
on the map called stalingrad they suddenly give all the baddies guns grenades and damn good aim
you go from losing life in  percent chunks to taking hits that kill a third of your life meter
you take a few of those hits die and then stare at a very long reload time while trying to memorize a new path that wont instantly kill you
rinse and repeat
not funso why not just turn down the difficulty
because if you do the game will disable the cards that grant you special powers and the game wont be half as much fun
so basically the developers all but demands you play it on default difficulty then cranks it up to an absurd level half way through
of course the fan boys who consider it an acomplishment to beat a video game will eat this up
but this game is rated mature and should therefore be designed with adults in mind
i dont know many adults who will put up with the frustrationyou know the drill
alone on an island you search forfindcollectcombinemake things
that is the essence of the game
the challenge is to use your ingenuity to cope with your present circumstance
there are only two action sequences in the game
both are arcade games
the first sequence you can and should ignore
it is a tedious waste of time
there is another way
the second sequence is essential to the gameas you would expect this is an inventory game
when i finished the game i had over  items in inventory
this is due to the fact that redundancy is built into the game
at the beginning of the game the screen displays a health meter
you must find water and sufficient food to restore you to full health
you will have no problem finding more than enough food
what is left over remains in inventory
if you are dilligent in finding things you will have enough items in inventory to solve several problems in more than one way
when the problem is solved the other items remain in inventory
i never found a way to organize the inventory
there are simply too many items and you are always discovering new onesthis is not a puzzle game
rather there are problems to be solved
there is only one puzzle during the game
you can obviate solving this puzzle with your inventory
the important puzzles are stacked at the end of the game
there is redundancy here alsothe graphics are quite good and sufficiently detailed that it is not difficult to find things
i can remember only two instances where pixel hunting was requiredthose of you who are scientifically challenged will find a few rough patches
scientific purists on the other hand will object to several features in the game such as a maple tree in fall color on an island with palm treesall in all return to mysterious island is a game that will keep you interested but it is not a game that you simply must keep playingi like what this team does at least they are trying to take adventure gaming into a modern arena but they still have not incorporated their own sense of story into their gamesthe interesting premise does not sustain itself and the insistence to imitate the cryptic puzzle based myst game style does not compliment the d interactivity of the gameive had silent hill  installed on my pc now for about a week
and it sucks
the controls are very hard to manage without a joystick or something
i was using the default controls which consist of using your keyboard and mouse sometimes at the same time
also the spoken dialog is heard about  seconds prior to the characters mouths actually moving
the spoken dialog is also heard about  seconds prior to seeing it spelled out in subtitles
i dont know what is causing this large delay but it suckseven though i havent played a ps version of this game im sure it has to be much better in terms of control and the dialog problem
i have played all the other silent hill games for the ps and ps and i never had a problem with themi visited the various tech support sites listed in the instruction manual to get help with the sounddialog problem but there is absolutely no help for sh tech problems as of yet
perhaps this is because the game is still relatively new and pc players of the game are still in the process of getting royally pissed off like i just didonly buy the pc version of silent hill  if you have a joystick or something
using the keyboard and mouse controls is just too difficult and very frustrating
better yet stick with the ps version
believe me youll be glad you didps
anybody wanna buy a slightly used silent hill  for the pc
ha ha hai have played and completed the pc versions of silent hill  and silent hill  and they are both great games
i am a huge fan of the entire silent hill game series especially sh
however silent hill  is dramatically hampered by not only unbelievably terrible character movement controls whether using a mousekeyboard combination or a pc gamepad but the computer selected camera that follows the main character around makes the game truly unplayable
the camera will many times decide to be in front of the character pointing towards his face during critical or exploratory situations while at other times it will be hovering over him
both camera angles make it almost impossible to see more than a few inches in front of your character
this is incredibly annoying and gets you killed a lot and takes much of the fun out of looking around and checking things out  because you simply cant easily do it
there is a key that is suppose to force the camera back behind the character but it rarely works as it should
this is one of the few major pc games that i have attempted to play for a few days but found it so unenjoyable that i have uninstalled it from my computer
i never thought i would do that to any silent hill gamethis game would be great if they would leave out the stupid mindless puzzles
i spent hours in a darkened maze that i finally had to get on the internet and get the solution
and then i immediately get to another puzzle played against the computer and i cannot win even though i had the solution
on another segment i also had the solution and couldnt get it to work for what seemed an eterntiy
it finally did but geezi used to play the kings quest games and they had some logic to them
on nancy drew you just go from one puzzle to another
or you have to read pages and pages of junk in case you need it later
oh why cant someone invent some good adventure games
i played ghost dogs of moon lake and i liked it but they had to give you hints in order to make it through because theres no logic to the game whatsoever and thats because they would have to actually work instead of just making stupid mindless puzzlesif i wanted a puzzle i could go buy one of those gamesthese games have such potential if they would limit their use of the puzzlesmy first nancy drew mystery game based on reviews i was very disappointed
yes graphics are great but there is no direction of what i need to achieve i fumbled from room to room repeatedly then figured out i have to make my own checklist no map to jump quickly from one location to another i just gave up initially but will try again later
not thrilled with having to get a walkthrough from other sites just to play some of the games
i like to figure things out myself not rely on a walkthroughive only played a few but this one is not nearly as good as the other nancy drew games that i have played
theres just too much walking around the same places in the house over and overand over
at the very least there should have been some clues outside so you could have a change of scenery to wake you up but once you go in the manor house at the very beginning youre not allowed to leave
i couldnt finish it its just too boringi think im pretty much gonna give up on any game that is based off of anything from a movie
it seems like no one can do it right
awesome ideas for most of the games just bad execution of them
predator concrete jungle joins the many badgamesbasedoffmoviesthatcouldvebeenreallycoolbutsucked list
other games on this list include fight club and the thingthe only real reason i gave this game  stars was that at first i thought it was really cool using the predators cloaking devices his different visualizations and his shoulder cannon
but these cool things rapidly diminished
the biggest drawback for me in this game was the controls
they just sucked
not easy to get down at all and very inefficient for the gameanother thing lacking in the game was the story line which wasnt as great as it sounded and the graphics were nothing to get your panties up in a twist fora thing they couldve done better was to make the city enviornment more open as well as a better city and give the player more freedom to roam around to give him more an actual hunting feeling
i never felt like i was hunting anything in this game at all
this was your standard objective level third person action game in a limited environment
it wouldve been so much cooler to be able to roam the city at will and find missions as well as being able to just about whatever you wanted inbetween
i guess a kind of a grand theft auto game only predator style
that wouldve been sweet
too bad so sadthe idea of playing as the modern day classic movie monster the predator in a sprawling urban landscape is enough to entice any gamer into playing predator concrete jungle whether they be a fan of the character or not
however as promising as this game may appear it is sadly disappointing
a choppy frame rate muddy graphics clumsy controls and migraine inducing camera angles really ruin what could have been a great gaming experience and the usage of the predators various abilities doesnt go as well as one might hope
not to mention that once upon completion there is practically no replay value whatsoever and the games story doesnt delve into the predator mythology as much as it proclaims to
all in all for predator fans this game is worth a rental at best but for the rest of us this is better left on the shelfwith an interesrsting storyline that will give you a chance to play as predator and restore your honor  years in the future the game is rather original for a predator on screen creation but not without its so many flawsfirst this game is not a free roaming game
and if it is then forget grand theft auto or spiderman s deffinition of free roaming and think more like a small level that will actually let you go anywhere you can jump or crawl to
other than that you cant go just anywhere and not only that to make matters worse you cant just kill anyone
now lets think predator thats pretty close to the real thing
but as far as sneakiness and staulking your pray is concerned you just have to stay invisible you dont have to watch your prey for very long before you can lock and flay dismember grab punture slam burn knock out or even just completly destroy your victim into a heap of trembling flesh
with that said this is a very violent game more so than grandtheft auto in some respectsill hand it to the creaters that they held true to predator style looking cut scenes and did a great job at the first person vision viewers
but i take one star away just simply because the graphics are beautiful for a  game
the graphics are horrible
predator looks beautifully like predator everything else looks like an early playstation  games graphics
the graphics are horrible for a  playstation game
the cut scenes are wonderful but you have to get unshocked to really see it since you notice your victims barly look like people sometimesthe sounds arent too much to hear either
theres more quiet than any actual car noise or just city noise
and the score is on a ten second playback its almost like they pooled al their rescources into just making the story and left the quality of game play in the dust
the controls are easily mastered and most levels that dont involve you killing your prey are pretty challenging
and for the most part the last  levels of this  something level game are very challenging indeed on hardill hand it to the game it is fun to play once you realize there are new weapons costumes and a host of other goodies hidden mind you hidden within each level one finds himself going back just to find the goodies
the storyline is really good and played out enough so that the mini clips could probably amount to a ten minute minimovie but dont worry you get plenty of game playill take another star off for not letting predator swim or for that matter for just falling through the water as if it were an abyss they do this for half of the barriers in this game and with the exception of one level the warf you dont really have to apply yourself in the art of staulking and in the movies thats s of what predator does
 once you engage the enemy he usually knows where youre at no matter what
bosses can see through your cloak which makes it more challenging but takes away the feeling of predator since even good old arnold had trouble seeing him in the moviewith all of that said who needs combos
 i doi like to keep games interesting with mixed attacks and creative killing capabilities you can see all the combos and killing methods within  seconds flat
then you have to resort to using tools plasma mines spears shoulder mounted plasma gun and so on
but i will thank them for giving us three weapon choices telescope stick and the maul to name two
but other than that killing your prey is very very very very repedative and mundane
so much so ill take another star off for the sheer repedativness of attacks and kills
once youve seen all the attacks twice you rarly go looking for enemies to kill and just try to finish the level
thats how boring the moves arelaslty there is a level where you get to go up against your arche nemesis alien
and i wasnt thoroughly disapointed in that in fact that was one of the more interesting levels though if only it was a little bigger with more to doin the end if you just want a game youll be entertained with for a few days this is a good rent  is a bit too much to ask in the long run
it will save you the embarassment of buying it and totally wishing you hadntdont get me wrong i give it two stars just because it was so much fun to play
for its funness alone i give it two stars and with such a great story to follow it really was that much more fun
but i am very disapointed in that its not free roaming the graphics are horrible and once youve gotten all the little goodies hiding in all the levels and you must finish the game to do so there is absolutly no reason absolutly no reasonto play the game again even on a more difficulty level it just isnt worth itthis game is ruined by repedativeness and riddled with unrelentingly bad graphics that made me laugh at the opening words  trade mark the second time i turned the game on
very fun the first time around first few levels  replay value unless you wait for  months to play it again like i didmidway through the game then at least you make it a little funon a fun scale this game is a  because you actually get t play as predator and he looks way better than spidy did in spiderman the game
you get to kill as him and for the first  seconds of being himitshe whatever it is i add two stars for that alone
throughout the game the begining when things are simple and fairly realistic and your enemies cannot see through the cloak this game is very very very fun hence two more stars when you get creative and come in at different angles use your secondary weapons grab your victims and make a sport of throwing them off rooftops or kicking and of course just ripping them apart in a methodical rage
this game is so much fun in the first five minutes but its worth four stars for just those five minutes
the rest is one star minus fivedont buy this game rent it you wont be as disapointedwe have not been able to get this to work with our computer
it should be a match and our computer doesnt seem to want to play this accessory
sounded easy and was priced right but now not so goodwhat always brought me to the world of legend of zelda was the classic idea of good versus evil
as we learned in wind waker whenever a grand evil reveals itself one in green appears to battle for good
this of course is link and or his descendents
is he hyrulian is he a kokori
it doesnt matter in that the mantle of this hero of the triforce of courage that passes to the next incarnation of the onemy favorite zelda game is by far link to the past
first available on super nintendo then reissued for gba
it is the classic elements of this game that does so well in ocarina of time and majoras mask
however minnish cannot capture the successes of these games magiczelda has always been about solid puzzle solving
push block a and lay pot on switch b to open door reveal chest etc
minish of course has these elements and the dungeons are pretty true to the classic structure seen in link to the past
but its the kinstones that ruin this game
the idea that to unlock areas you have to find a small piece of stone behind an unmarked wall to bomb then find the person whom it can be fused to made me loose interest so quickly
i planted tons of bombs used up tons of time just to find a kinstone piece then to have to find someone to fuse it with
then i could continue with the adventure
now perhaps if they add some sort of stroy as to what the heck these kinstones were or why everyone has them was never develpoed
and so my interest in finding them too waned
maybe a checklist of the kinstones and where they are fused to much like the mask chart in majoras maskseems that games today leave story gameplay and good level design in the back burner for collectothons
pokemon may be to blame and its popularity of having to catchem all
but pokemons game is that
to collect the best to battle with and in turn kick the butt out of your friends and computer
i dont play a zelda game to collect hundereds of kinstones and figurines
who cares
i want a good story cool dungeons weapons and abilities that its not the finding out how to use them that are hard its the using them correctly that is hardthe game also tries hard to ripoff four swords ideas with multiple links doing things single links cannot
good idea
all the elements are here for this game to rule
it just seems to fall flat and be pretty uninteresting to play
maybe its the never knowing where to go next that makes it no fun
you basically try everything until you give up and look at the players guide
so it makes me think that this game was developed just to sell those players guidesminish cap was not released during the holiday season and now i see why
it is lackluster and quite mind numbing
i am not swearing off zelda games just this one
i will definitely be playing the new upcoming zelda on the gamecube with the more realistic graphics
wind waker though cool to look at had huge problems with goofy characters that really seemed to keep the true terror of ganon at bay
i never felt threat as i did in link to the past or ocarina
minish trys to look just like wind waker
the minish themselves are akin to the ewoks and are too cutesy for their own good
this makes for a weird looking link and goofy side kick
truthfully i dont mind illustrative graphics
but these counteract the underlying story of threat and fear that propels me through other nintendo games like metroid or the original zeldasplay it and see for yourself but i rather spend my time replaying link to the past or a final fantasy
or better yet world of warcrafti purchased this for arma  bf mainlythe joystick is extremely tritchy even after playing with the settings i can barely fly
i ended up just going back to a gamepad for flyingmay be a better experience for flight sims but if you are looking to purchase for a fps i would passwhen this game came out in 
it was a blast
now the graphics are dated and the fact that nova logic doesnt stay on top of punk buster like they should turns this once great game into a nonplayable
i give it  stars for what it once wasthey sent me a ugly grey memory card
buyer beware
but it does worknice way not to share quite as much with yet another game that wants your credit card information
though at the time of writing this it was still cheaper to buy game time on the website with a credit card after shipping and handling or sales tax
very nice way to limit game time with children and make it not quite so automatic for a company to directly charge new fundsthis is sfmf speaking and a sudden uproar of disses go to mario power tennis
a local residant from volcano islands says that a waste of money
all you do is run back and forth and hit the ball
ill be back later with more inforating  cgraphics total mess
n had better clearer graphics and most of the games looks like they belong on gbagames i dont see any games worth owning
yoshi touch and go is just stupidgimmicktouch screen totally stupid and pointlesslook it looks like a toy for a little kid
a freind of mine has one and whenever he plays it on the bus i pretend i dont know himavoid
it has no online and in order to talk to people you have to be like  feet awayplus who else will have a dsget psp
nuff saidi have both a ds and a psp and i have to say that the ds isnt as great as all these kids are saying
it has an ok design clamshell but its real flaw is that the people who have  to spend are looking for more mature games
i honestly enjoy mario  ds and tiger woods and im not saying that the ds is kiddy but the games need to lose the cartoony look
so far almost all the games have been mini game type games  ex
wario ware pac pix polarium feel the magic etc
there is yet to be a complete game story and all on the ds
mario doesnt count as it was released  years ago
spiderman  looks like a game boy advance gamenow if you read the previous paragraph and you still want a ds get yoshis touch and go
if you want to know why it might be worth your money to go for for a psp read onpsp is a great system a good selection of games for kids  ape escape hot shots golf lumines and adults  twisted metal head on tony hawks underground  remix and a lot of sports games though movies do look amazing this isnt why you buy a portable gaming system and the music feature is flawed as the transfer is a pain
so assuming that this is a gameonly system it still is a great choice
it doesnt break like some of the reviewers have said it does when you drop it and it comes with the sleeve for a reason
if you use the black sleeve the comes with the system the screen wont scratch
there is a solid selection of games and three more come out on june th  dead to rights reckoning midnight club  dub edition and coded arms  all three of these games are more adult oriented as the ratings go from e to m for those three
grand theft auto is coming out later this summer and  percent of the psp movies out right now are rated pg to r  well you make your decision but i think that it is better to hear about the two systems from someone who has both and uses bothi am here to review this system from a older persons point of view to help many out
i have played the ds a couple of times and tested with many of its options
i have rated it in  categories that discuss different aspects of the handheld
overall quality the ds is a dual screen handheld gaming systemthe dual screen is a great addition for the fact to protect the screen
the ds itself feels somewhat solid and has a nice build for  people as of myself who play systems for a substantial amount of time
overall  
graphics this is where the ds falls extremely short
even though graphics dont make the game they sure do enhance in many different ways
the visuals mostly remind of the old nintendo  except that the colors arent as vibrant
all games i have played so far have jagged edges and lack the polish of its rival psp
overall 
gaming library another aspect of the ds that falls short
this system was released here in the us in late november
to this day there is a extremly lack of games availible on the market
i have noticed that more advance games are being released then the supposedly future handheld out at this moment
compared to the psp this a total flop
the psp has a wide range out already and have over  releases scheduled over the next upcoming months
overall  
extras the touch screen personally to me is kinda of a waste but is an interesting feature
this is a solid part to this system
the picto chat on the other hand is worthless and so is the microphone since no games yet as i know of use these capabilitiesoverall perfomance  nintendo has a whole lot of catching up to do to keep making a decent profit
i award them for staying with all other companies but this product seems unfinished and yet to be finished in the futureedit   after buying the ds a second time and playing kirby canvas curse which for my money is one of the most innovative games ever made and the best platformer of the past year and playing an advance copy of nintendogs id up my ratings to a  out of  for fun and a  out of  overall some of  my complaints in the review below still hold true
overall i would definitely recommend this handhelddisappointment in the psp led me to buying a ds today probably not sonys intention
while the system is more innovative than the psp its still a huge letdown one of the first from nintendo
if i could change one thing it would be the ergonomics of the console
the worst thing is how hard it is to hold when using the stylus
it physically hurts your wrist and fingers if you play a stylus heavy game for more than  minutes
the stylus control setup also seems to only be half there  a gimmick with potential
nintendo needs to either take it one step forward or one step back
as it is now theyre dangling in some weird limbo thats simultaneously too innovative and not quite innovative enough
im returning my ds tomorrow and will only consider buying a new one ifits lighter and thinnerits easier to hold while using the stylusit has at least  good games and  great ones of the  games i played only mario  ds was great and i played that one almost a decade ago on my nintendo   and it had better controls then
metroid hunters has potential though
i dont have to turn it off and on when leaving a chat whats up with having to reboot when changing the functionality of the system
it is online enabled with at least  or  online enabled games mario kart and wave race would be a good starti think nintendo should consider knocking  off of the price by dropping the gameboy advance support which would also automatically make the machine lighter and slimmer
or keep it at  drop the gba support making the system thinner and include full pda software right now you get a noninteractive clock and noninteractive calendar
dropping gba support would then prevent nintendo from falling back on its incredible gba library possibly pushing them to create an equally incredible library for the ds
i think the company needs to make the ds a worthwhile purchase in and of itself
metroid hunters full game not available until august th
cmon nintendo  we need at least one killer new app
unique to the ds
the potential is there
i could see it in the amazingly addictive mini games on mario ds and i could see it again playing yoshi
the stylus could make for some of the most innovative inventive and fun gaming since video gaming began  if the big n would only take that extra step forward and made full use of the unique control setup they came up with
as it stands i think the ds and the psp are both wasted machines
until something better comes along or until the ds improves ill stick with the gameboy advance for my portable gamingdont get me wrong here but when i was waiting for the ds to come out i was nearly exploding with excitement
but when i actually got it i was disapointed
the sound is ok and the graphics are great on some games but everything else is pretty lamehonestly i think this system is a dual sceen brick
i have had two good games out of it one of which was a remake of a n game
the touch screen is just an attraction to customers
how much does it use the touch screen other than the opening screen
what  games
most of the games are incredibly pointless or are just badly laid out
the features other than gaming are useless or dont work
the psp has at least one better game in every genre than every game on the ds
there are things on the ds that are better than the psp but really there arent that many
here is a rating of one to ten of its featuressound the soundtrack on most games are limited by a lot but the speakers are loud and dont get fuzzygraphics the graphics in super mario ds are a  but the rest arent nearly as goodmultiplayer the multiplayer on the ds is lame so far except for a few games like mario kart ds but other games are a lot less well doneextra features the fact that you dont have to keep fixing a linkcable every five seconds is useful but the things like pictochat are useless
why would you use some lousy styluspunch in typing accessory to talk with people who have to be less than  feet away
the batterylife is subpar with  hours to play your ds game with out it dying and although is better than the psp in that area it really isnt in anything elseoverall to put it mildly the extra features made the system not worth buying
there are a few good games but not very many
that about sums up this dual screened brickafterthoughtsi will admit it is hard to say something like that about nintendo but all i really want to say now is i hope the next portable console by nintendo is betterfirst off i do think we can compare the two systems
we always compare items
i mean in the s the tiny tvs with like  channels seemed cool but many people today say why would you buy that when you could buy something much better
well that is a comparrison
i would say that the ds is ok but again you can get something way better
the psp is a true masterpiece
and you cant believe the people who cant spell claiming that nintendo is planning to make these addons that dont exist
i will now compare the two systems
by the way i own both systems and use psp way moregraphicspsp equal to ps with  million colors and  bit graphicsds a bit over n quality wih over  colors and  bitsmoviespsp dvd quality with full length moviesds well according to one of the retards who wrote a review here says that they are making movies in japan now but i can assure you thats not true
right now you have spongebobmusicpsp ipod quality and memory cards are less money than an ipod with equal memoryds  uhh none
game selectionpsp great games and wide selection
when psp released they had more launch games than ds had total
ds came out over four months earlier
games include  thug mvp twisted metal madden wipeout nba street nfl street gta nfsu midnight club ridge racer lummies and fifa
games can hold  gigs and are 
that is only about  a gig while ds holds  gigs and is 
that is over  a gigds obviously not as good of value as psp games as i explained
games include  nfs mario  warioware touched and raymanbatterypsp  hoursds   hours well they win at somethingthe touchscreen is annoying because there are no good ideas for it or at least nobody has one
id rather play a ps than play with some stupid penmorrowind is a funny game
its a like or hate experience and for some reason beyond my comprehension a lot of people seem to love it
guess where i standlets start with what many people called the good parts
i understand this game is a couple of years old so i would expect the graphics to have aged quite a bit but not this much
the hideous graphics first struck me when i was talking to people
their faces were all pixelated mouths not in sync with talking etc
the environments were mildly nice but felt awfully bland
this was supposed to be the power of the xbox
yeah right
the sound is absolutely pathetic and uninspired
in fact its really not very noticeable at all but it reminds me of the soundtracks for old dd pc rpgs like baldurs gate
except that bg was a far greater game
the game boasts that you can create a character of any race and customize them with tons of skills
the truth is that most of the skills are useless
some examples that come to mind are medium armor hand to hand combat and a ton more
really only about  or  of the skills are worthwhilethe combat system in morrowind is absolutely flawed
this is due in part to the first person view and lack of targeting
you basically have to come as close as possible to the enemy and attack while trying to notice some type of blood
keep hacking until they die
repeat about  times
yep
you will battle so much in this game
not to mention the flawed magic system with its incredibly difficult targeting and awkward hotkeys
i will give them credit for the races and signs but otherwise nothing
did i mention the loading times
for an xbox game they are painfully long from building to building
were they taking cues from kotor or somethinginteraction with npcs is gruelingly painful
you basically talk to people and are given a list of about  items to ask them about most of which are absolutely retarted and useless like history of the town or your location
you will hear the same exact things from different people
the worst thing is that you have to read and scan the text in order to make sure you havent skipped some important detail
and lets face it reading  pages of text for every npc isnt exactly anyones idea of fun
although it is true that you can scan over the responses youve already heard ultimately youre going to experience alot of repetitivenessthe towns in morrowind are incredibly bland
most are really just brown and filled with similar looking people with hard as heck to pronounce names
the map is decent but couldve benefitted from easier access
the journal is perhaps the most frusturating element of all
missions arent sorted into completed and active missions in some kind of easy to access system like in kotor
nope
they are written in hardly legible writing in hundreds and hundreds of pages where you have to go back and forth constantly to find your mission
this was fixed in the pc version but unfortunately the developers didnt want to waste the time to save the player alot of frusturationfor all the freedom youre supposed to get in this game there really isnt that much
when it comes to monsters you have to hack and slash or run
there really isnt any other way
you can kill people but it seems that the guards have eyes everywhere even though you could be in the upstairs bedroom of some obscure persons house when youre commiting the murder
its ridiculous
you can try to steal from people but the guards instantly know and youre doomed to fail
steal any stinkin item from any store even if the owner isnt looking and you will be attacked by every last person in the shop
fun huhthe last thing i want to talk about is the scope of the game
i like a good long game and im accustomed to the unnatural length of many pc rpgs
but morrowinds is simply too big
scary even
theres just too much to do
running from place to place takes forever
missions are obscure convoluted and you often wont know what to do after hours and hours
the game is simply too big for its own good
ive heard of players going for  hours and not even seeing everything available
youd probably need to play it for a good decade or so to see all that the developers wanted to cram in
rather than focusing on quantity the developers should have focused on quality
dont put  obscure quests with no story but rather make  with quality story and meaning more than just the fetch that kill this
this has been a lengthy review for a very lengthy game but i need to tell you that if youre considering this game think twice
nowadays its extremely cheap and you can probably get a copy off of ebay for  bucks max
rent it for  bucks and then buy it on ebay or here for  bucks
dont spend  bucks on this game
i simply hated morrowind but for every hater of this game there seem to be  fanboys
this has been an honest review of my experience with the game
undoubtedly many will criticize my views but i really think that the game is highly flawedthe elder scrolls series concentrates on stuffing a ton of mindless stuff into one game
why not focus on quality over quantity
maybe elder scrolls  will do the trick
but given the history of elder scrolls i highly doubt iti started to play the game at first and had fun beating up the bad guys untill i got into the bulding and had to rescue the pepole i couldnt find any of them
this game sucks and is the worst ds game ever
however ultimate spider man rulz so buy that
well that all i can really sayno actually you and i are very different
i should wonder why vicarious visions would let out a game like this
the game is so unfinished
my goodness
the graphics in the game are pretty well done untill you get a closer look at it then the horrible truth comes out
dont get me wrong there are some strong points in this game and theres a whole lot more of down points
the really strong point in this game is the sound
the sound actually almost sounds as if it came from the console versions
but further down the road things just get ugly
the qoutes in the game really are stupid
like you may have destoryed my robots spiderman
but youll never defeat me
things like that are really stupid
you got to hand it to these guys they use the most overly used and abused sayings in the book
i personally feel that there was alot more potential in this game
there again developers are getting lazy and lazyer by the moment
i think the key thing wrong with games today is they lack imagination and thats one of the unique things god created in us
so thats my reveiw
remember  be a customer
not a consumer
period
 jake smithersi was filled with promise that a punisher game was finally coming out on a gaming console
to be honest i was prepared to purchase the game before i even played it because of the fact that it is based off of the punisher franchise that is owned by marvel comics
at the very least because i am a comic book collector i had to give the game a try
i can admit now that i would have really been upset if i purchased this game before i played it
marvel and the game developers messed up making this a rd person game it shoudl have been more like a st person shooter like halo
actually halo is a little more than a st person shooter but enough on that
after playing this game for several hours i can honestly say that red faction on ps was much more enjoyable than the punisher on xbox and that is shame
the game play mechanics are really bad and the aiming and over the shoulder view is horrible too
rent this game for sure but dont buy it or you will be sorry and left with a  game that is worth  of your timeit really is a shame that such a bad game was put out on the market
i am sure im not the only true comic book fan who was left wondering where in the world did they dig up the concept of this game
it is as if they threw a bunch of comic book stories together
there is so much more to frank castle than just shooting bad guys read the comic book if you dont believe methe most recent punisher movie was okay
this video game truly stinks
and the comic book is awesome so take your  and invest in the comic book you will enjoy it much betterwhoever is responsible for butchering the settlers series into this title should be fired
i suspect ubi is to blame for wanting to make the game more mainstream
in the process they destroyed everything that settlers was supposed to be about and what we are left with is a pretty lousy gameits truely sad what has happened to this series this title is best avoidedwell let me tell you i hate gta clones like roadkill
now its the freakin popular resident evil  to get cloned
sure the graphics are pretty look at but its just plain sucky
and if theyre gonna clone re at least stick witha rd person camera instead of bad loading times and original resident evil camerasplus when you get grabbed by the zombies it looks like tom and the zombies are g
people
plus they must have a hate for bald pale guys
there are some scary moments in the game
but its just a bad clone of a much better game out of
