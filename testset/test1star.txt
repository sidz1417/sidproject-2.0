installing the game was a struggle because of games for windows live bugssome championship races and cars can only be unlocked by buying them as an addon to the game
i paid nearly  dollars when the game was new
i dont like the idea that i have to keep paying to keep playingi noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to dirt i tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game
im really tired of arcade style rallyracing games anywayill continue to get my fix from richard burns rally and you should to
httpwwwamazoncomrichardburnsrallypcdpbcrefsrieutfqidsrkeywordsrichardburnsrallythank you for reading my review
if you enjoyed it be sure to rate it as helpfulst shipment received a book instead of the gamend shipment got a fake one
game arrived with a wrong key inside on sealed box
i got in contact with codemasters and send them pictures of the dvd and the content
they said nothing they can do its a fake dvdreturned it good byei cant tell you what a piece of dog this game is
like everything else microsoft makes it doesnt work
when are they going to take a cue from apple and make things that actually work the first time and every time
to log onto this game they make you jump through a series of hoops that takes like  min
to accomplish
if you want another disappointment from microsoft buy some games for windows live games
i just wanted a simple arcade like driving game when i have a young boy visiting
if thats what you want dont buy this
if you want to hire a consultant to help you run this game then buy it
oh one more thing every time i do get this game to play my joystick stops working theres windows  for youi bought this and the key didnt work
it was a gift and the recipient wasnt able to solve the problem
it might have been a good game but i never found out because the key failedcrashed in vista
codemasters told me they dont support it in windows   couldnt get it to work even after looking on the internetthis game was a ripoff
it has less terrain less tracks and less features than dirt   the graphics are about the same
not worth the money at allthis game is bug landfirst had problems installing because it required some windows market software
then it did not have any voice sounds
then it was running on windowed mode only
now everytime i end a track it just crashes the computer bsodi give up
codemasters next time dont rush a game out just because you have to
test the game
if not for yourself for colin himself
if he was alive he would be embarrassedand dont buy the game using steam because if it does not work steam will show you the finger dirt  was like this
im becoming more  more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open internet to play
it just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for
does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason
i dont care what they say publicly
any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight and nobodys looking
its quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know youre being tracked but this type of continuous spying is something more
that aside this carrot on a stick has more problems than just securitycons  requires open internet windows live to play
annoying interface
continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do
most settings dont keep between sessions
setting up a race takes way too long
irritating music you cant turn off it keeps coming back
takes too long to unlock things
entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating i just wanted out
video stuttering possibly my equipmentpros  eye candy
plenty of game modes
enough tracks to get going
fairly good variety of cars
scaled difficulty levels from casual to advancedi think this franchise like many others continues soley for the purpose of farming user information where it seems the real money is
if i cant turn it off and some else controls the onoff switch thats a problem
sometimes it might be worth it but not here
i found some entertainment value but very briefly
anyway  just my opinioni would like give this game  or  stars if i could get it to run
like others the game crashes on startup or in the game and codemasters has been absolutely no help in correcting it
why they cant get their asses in gear pun intended and fix it i dont know but with so many folks reporting the problem it isnt just occasional
i assume they either cant replicate the problem or just dont care
lacking any help from codemasters ive tried the various fan fixes including uninstalling rapture d
also tried installing on vista and win  and that didnt help either which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing simi cannot get this thing to work with my wii rockband it might be related to the usb hub that im using but it simply refuses to be detected by the gamecosmetically its a microphone
bit on the ugly sidei would be wary of compatibility issues with this onethe greatest bait and switch betrayal of a fanbase in videogaming history and most hated game of all timeto begin i will provide amazons customer base the tale of the turd as i call it in relation to this abominations quality or rather lackthereofgameplay utterly challengeless
a lobotomy patient a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort
just mash buttons or spam the controls as pc gamers would say and youll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face disney level aonuma dreckgraphics hideous vomit inducing ridiculous teletubbiesesque bait and switch from what we were originally promised at spaceworld  realistic style epic cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly lord of the rings style flare also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout wand wacker indicating nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release
oh what a shamesound the only redeemable inspiring thing about this aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by koji kondo
the rest is detestable saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel
soccer moms and grandparents should approve
real zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect nintendo has stooped to in order to insult ustheme near total rip off of kevin costners water world to such a great extent i fully believe costner could probably win a lawsuit against nintendo for royalties if he so desired
needless to say this watery environment is not what true zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new zelda game
no what were looking for is the green forests and fields of hyrule proper not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to aonumas child learning how to bathe for the first time and aonuma getting inspired to make zelda into a giant bathing simulator via wand wacker
ive said it before and ill say it again nintendo needs to fire eiji aonuma and his entire zelda team and get normal people developing the zelda series again for it to return to healthcommentary the online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to rewrite history all they like but the legend of celda wand wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming historythis was nintendo miyamoto and eiji aonumas vince mcmahon esque screw you to the true zelda fanbase and by true zelda fanbase im not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twicetwo whole times on that wand wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original gamecube release and second with its wii u hd rerelease that this is not the way that they envisioned the legend of zelda series this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result wand wacker flopped mightily both times as such a benedict arnold or rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to doto rephrase a quote from ridley scotts gladiator marcus aurelius had a dream that was zelda and this is not it this is not itwe were lied to and led to believe that the epic cool badass spaceworld  realistically presented zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed celda wand wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and nintendos way before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love wand wacker in order to shill and run damage control for nintendo while real zelda fans have abandoned nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or pc gaming if they havent simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of zeldas true fanseiji aonuma the hack no talent jimmy fallon of japan enabled by the out of touch shigeru miyamoto has been ruining the zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as majoras maskaonumas first game marvelous failed marvelously
and he had no credentials at all to be given the zelda series but insanely nintendo gave it to him and ever since hes been driving zelda along with its sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad npc filled faux zelda game after anotherwhen the truth of the matter is zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light rpg elements thrown in for good measureaonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongsin anycase to reiterate so as to set this very important point in stone once morewand wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient as is typical of aonuma offeringsconclusion my rating of this turd is  star since i cant give it lower due to how amazons system is set upare  out of  gamecube games like this little kids game terrible
answer yesi bought the game and i regret it so muchi was very disappointed in this item
we thought we would get a better picture than the standard wii video cables but definatley took a leap in the wrong direction
i would not recommendthere are at least  missions that cannot be completed without joining the forum then the creators forum and a lot of research downloading etc
 of these defective missions were built by bottmansomeone that should definitely find another occupationbutdo not waste your time because the missions are incredibly boring and far from challenging
the ones they label as hard are as easy as those labeled easy
my year granddaughter could do most of them after  minutes of instructiondo not buy this product
the gfx are circa  the user interface far from intuitive and the support abysmal
its a waste of money  timetoo bad
shipsim  was actually betterand all the missions worked
vstep took one giant step backwardthis thing was doa
it wasnt even worth returning for the money i spent on it
dont waste your money on this cardi bought this game way back and recently played it again wellthe game was easy to beat when i was  and its still as easywell my problemsnot enough characters and its just not very fun and yeah that makes it boring but if ur a fan of the older games  like me  you may like this game  unlike me its cheap now so i guess it wouldnt hurt to pick it up it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostoreso do what you want with itthis is an excellent game that really has some substance
the graphics are not the best and it is oversahdowed by the bigger game final fantasy vii
if ff was too long for you get breath of fire  the story is good and the battle system is greati spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game
im a true batman fan and even i had to put this game down after several attempts
it was either too dark so you didnt know where the character was going or you couldnt establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys
not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well it was hard to locate where you were going unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of gothem city
unfortunately the writers expected us to know as wellyes ill review batman  robin to the playstation and why couldnt have been like batman forever arcade
its wrose than batman forever on snes and genesis
i dont know which is wrose this game or the joel schumacer film
becuse i dont know what to do after i get the diamond
i know what im getting with the film a very bad one
just leave them both alonethis game is complete crapthe graphics look decentbut the gameplay is for shi cant even begin to tell you how bad batman  robin isfirst offthe controls are terribleyou have a hell of a time trying to figure out how to fightdrive the batmobileswimuse the gadgetsits even a pain to try and walkthe map of gotham is very small and all of the buildings of the area look the samethe game is also almost impossibleyou get one lifeafter you dieits game overand right back to the beginningyou can also die quickly as wellyou can play as either batmanrobin or batgirlbut their combat moves look absolutley retardedoverallthis is the worst batman game i have ever played
batman forever on genesis was better then this dudand we all know how bad that game wasi highly recommend that you do not buy thisthe only reason why you might wanna purchase thisis because its a pretty rare gameand it could be a part of your game collectionbut as far as the game itself goesit sucksi was only  years old my first time playing this game back in christmas of  i was never able to get past the first couple levels then
but i always loved this game
it was magic back then
the graphics were also great then
second time around i was  and it was  i was able to finally finish the entire game and find all the secrets to
now in  i had the urge to replay this game again
to get those feeling of being so young
im  and the magic is completely gone and for one reasonbe warned if you have a full hd tv and have a ps and bought a physical copy of this gamethe playback visuals of this game will be absolutely horrible
it completely hinders your ability to even play through the game because everything is so pixelated if you will
like i never remembered this game looking so bad before but i have to assume it had always looked this way but i was in a different era of technology then
hd tvs are completely unforgiving to these types of games
im not sure if the the digital copy available on the psn is any better but the actual physical copy is not meant for a hd display even in it respective aspect ratio
maybe just playing this game on standard definition tv might help but i havent tried that either
i will just have to remember the game like when i was young as the best ps game i ever played and then later the only one i ever beat
to the future gamersi hate this game
let me state right away graphics in a wwe wrestling game mean absolutely nothing to me
the graphics in wwf war zone are pretty good and original back in the day but who cares
it seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic and their movements true to life
who cares
when war zone first hit the scene in the late s yeah the graphics were cool
not now especially when the only thing the wwe cares about these days is impressing gamers with realismyou know wwf war zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new d level
a whole new level of crap
you see it makes me sick that the wwe wrestling games for  years now are all basically the same
let me explain why this is a bad thingyou know when you buy an updated sports video game such as football or hockey and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names and maybe some new options here and there
thats exactly what the wwe has done with their video games
for the last  years all the wwe games have been way too similar to each other and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years gameit doesnt matter if its smackdown smackdown  wwe raw for the xbox wwe wrestlemania for the gamecube etc
those games are all the same a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism
im all for realism but it does not matter in a wrestling game
a wrestling game is like any other video game in that it should be all about having fun with it
and i cant have fun with a wrestling game released today that more or less is exactly the same as a wrestling game from  years ago
it makes me sick to think  years later hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video gamesbefore wwf war zone you had wwf in your house which to this day is a game that completely stands apart from other wwe wrestling games along with wwf wrestlemania the arcade game
before those games you had the buttonsmashing delight of wwf raw on the super nes and sega genesis
once again the formula in those oldschool wrestling games didnt stick around and overstay its welcome
over  years with games just like wwf war zone is too muchthe very second wwf war zone came out on the playstation and n it all went wrong
game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games so from that point on all the wwe games had to be about having realisticlooking gameplay and wrestler appearances and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach
its hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing
after a while you get sick of itwwf war zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights but it was the worst thing that could have happened
graphically wwf war zone is the first of its kind
being the first means its bound to have some flaws despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw
another major problem with the game is how slow it is
after the adrenalinerushing wwf in your house we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring very slowly
painfully slow in fact
going from wwf in your house to wwf war zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race
your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game
to be fair the only thing wwf wrestling games today have improved is the speed
everything else is the same as it was  years agowwf war zone also started the popular create a wrestler mode
but it doesnt matter because as i mention above wrestling games for  years have had that option
its an option that has lost its charm because of overkill and its time game companies got rid of it or did something to drastically change it
it was a fun and interesting idea at first but now  years later i dont want to have it in a wrestling game ever againi tried getting rid of wwf war zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it so i had to get rid of it by throwing it away
no way was i keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with much more deserving playstation gamesif only wwe was more innovative with their wrestling games today instead of repeating the same formula every year i wouldnt have to keep going back and pointing out wwf war zone as the game where the downfall began
after  years updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesnt get the job donethis wwf game sucksboringgraphics are alrightit was just plain awful even for its timeugh this game was slo get this gameget no mercy
best wwf game everthis game was very dull and boringif i could give it a zero i wouldthis game flat out sucksgood thing i baught this for a  bucksbut still that was a wastelatergetting this game would be a waste of time and money
for halfthe price of this id rather get a game that offers better graphicsbetter realism and better everything
if you havent already guessed its red alert
even though it looks pretty good after about a week you wont want to play it anymore
with red alert i continually go back to try just one more strategy i think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it
right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there quotred alertquot and buy that game you will have a way better game and not spend as muchunless you intend to cheat and mod the game dont waste your moneyuneven gameplayand few options plague this gameit is also way too short even at this reduced pricespend your money on a gamejust not this onehope this helpsi hate to have games collecting dustbut this is one of those and i own about  recent games so i know whats whati thought red alert was a pretty fun game
this was just a clone of red alert though
the people that make campc need to come up with some more ideas
all the campc games are exactly the same
i didnt like red alert to start with so tiberian sun has to be worsethe games okay although i dont think making the charactersin d was a very good idea plus at some points game gets outrightboringand all the main characters smoke  although the game will crash sometimes and it might get stuck overall the game is pretty much okay if you dont count crashes and how the characters act and look  endi found halflife to be somewhat interesting although it started to run thin by the ending levels
not many of the levels were amazing either
just long hallways small rooms and an occasional elevator shaft that you  climb up
i like d games that let you be outside looking over vast plains  of enemies and obstacles
halflife just didnt cut it in this  arenaanother thing that i found most disturbing was the extreme  goreviolence that is present throughout the game
when your science  project goes wrong you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground  with about  gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor
were  the programmers just trying to be sick here or what
when you reach the  levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts who are the best  enemies it gets even more grotesque
if you let off an entire clip of  bullets at one guy expect to see a wall covered with blood
sure you can  turn it off but it does very little good
the blood is still very  disturbing
this is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable
i am not a parent saying this either im a teenageraside from the  violence and lack of interesting levels the game is pretty much void of  any lasting qualities
if you want a weekend of pure hell both keeping you  stuck to your computer and grossing you out entirely then buy this game
otherwise dont botherthis is the stuppidiest game ive ever played
i advise everyone not to play it or buy it
it really suckedthis game is the hardest game ive ever played and that takes away the fun
also graphics very poor even for nintendo  cannot even recommend for people i dislike dont waste your time or money worst n game everwhen i looked for the game i was looking for this for a tear play station  the view on this game i liked
when i received it was not discovered for version  but i am very upseti have played this game before and it is very fun
that is why i came to amazon to order myself another copy of the game so that i could go back in time and enjoy a classic game
however i bought it from the seller warehouse deals inc and i did not get my game and there is no place for me to get in contact with them
watch outthis game is ok but mostly mediocre
this is the best that the n had to offer alongside the wrestling games and resident evil 
just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark
the sony playstation  had better games and far better immersion due to having the cd storage
this game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be
the production of the game is basically weak with the menu intro being pathetic and the music repeating over and over and over on each board
the gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the missionfinally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated
i remember playing it with  other players all day for  a couple days and never feeling into it
the quad split screen was a big nuisance
thank goodness for online play today  the games today completely own goldeneye in every category especially the funfactorso yeah  there you go nintendrones  the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title
oh yeah rare is now exposed as being mediocre  your cult like devotion to nintendo made them rich at least
they havent made anything decent since thoughi just wanna review out something no ones said yetif you still ever play this game it is a great game its  stars provided your into this sort of thingbut recently when i played the playstation version i noticed they jibbed out and didnt include certain things that the pc version and better version hadfirst off  there is no train
the pc version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse sure it may be useless to crash into another train but it was entertaining
the ps version doesnt have a train but yet it has the tracks for it so go figure that one outnext lack of vehicles
the pc version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost townand something no one can say wouldnt be better you can edit the pc version not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools
you can not just add cars you can add missions put more cars into things edit the exsisting map or hell make your own city from scratchwhen i play this game i like to ride around in knight rider or maybe the general lee try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis gourangaconvinced the pc versions better
makes you feel like the psx you played was lacking huhmario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret placesi think
i tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i dont like racing games
the producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatifiedi have the wii version and is horrible
just like you hit an opponent with a shell pass and with no item the cpu boosts way ahaed
horribleseriously this ranks up with some of the worst games i have ever played
it is a complete insult to anyone who respects the rpg genre as this is nothing more than a linear cutesy puzzle game
you run around playing a little harmonica by pressing certain buttons in certain orders and the rest of the time you are moving boxes around jumping from platform to platform and killing enemies with an awful targeting system that respawn as soon as you leave the roomi can guarantee that about  of all the  and  star votes are coming from children under the age of  as this is the type of game that would appeal to them
but if you are an older more experienced gamer do yourself a favor and steer clear from this hideous example of a good title gone badif youll excuse me i am going to balance out my wobbly kitcken table with the cartridgeseriously its one of the worst games ever
terrible graphics especially compared to the ps triples no voice acting boring puzzles and above all it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game
plus why is the main villian black
thats racistfor a good zelda game i recommend link the faces of evil the wand of gamelon or zeldas adventuretheres many that love this socalled masterpiece but the only thing i like about this boringrepetitive game is the great soundtrack
sticking to the superior originallara croft games have never been any good
i remember when the very first one came out  years ago
teens were practically drooling on their controller every time they saw laras pretty face
tomb raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin market
the thing is the games are boring and lara croft isnt very prettyif polygonbreasted girls are your thing go for it
but they arent my thing and i know im not the only one to think so
lara croft isnt goodlooking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blockylooking computer babe isnt going to automatically make a game any fun to play
ill give lara croft some credit
she was one of the originators of the running around halfnaked female shooteradventure type of video games
in fact you might even say she was a major influence because soon after her very first adventure more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games halfnaked chicks
lara brought something new to the world of video games and i will give her credit for thatsometimes influence doesnt matter when a game is really bad
this is one of those cases
the tomb raider series on the original playstation is a joke
i absolutely groan when i think about playing a tomb raider game because i remember how ugly and dark the environments are the glitchy problems that dominate all three tomb raider games the annoying and difficult jumping style of lara croft which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game
good luck she never jumps where you want her to and of course mentioned above laras supposed beautiful face shes not pretty remember
it also doesnt help that the puzzles you have to solve are always really awful and appear frequently and because of the jumping problem very frustrating to complete
trying to aim your gun at an emeny isnt exactly a walk in the park either
the whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this pointby the time tomb raider  was released people were really getting fed up with the series
now these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more tomb raider games but i actually think people got sick of tomb raider because games like resident evil and silent hill came along with a similar style and improved on it drastically making tomb raider look awfully dated by comparisonat least the third tomb raider game has some decentlooking background levels
i guess the company who created lara croft finally understood that laras pretty face alone isnt going to get the job done anymore
i mean at least in some places the backgrounds look good 
not exactly the prettiest environments available on the playstation of course and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight
but whats there is okay to look at at leasttomb raider  features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the abovementioned jumping problem
she simply doesnt jump the way you want her to
youd think the game company wouldve dealt with this problem with all the new moves for lara they added to the game but no none of these new moves make the game any easier
the artifactfinding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined itboy am i glad i never bought any of these games all these years ive been watching other people play them
reading reviews for the more recent tomb raider games on the playstation  i see no improvements have been made
let the series end alreadytwisted metal  is overrated  because its not normally considered the worst playstation game
i cant believe how unfun this game is
the  control is laughable
the gameplay is incredibly boring
the music is rob  zombie which is bad enough before you hear it  times in a row
the  game also adds almost nothing new
dont even rent this onetrust me do not buy this game
i am the local tm lover and knowall
i bought tm tm and tm sadly i cant find a copy of tm  after i bought tm i was looking forward to cool characters cool battlegrounds and semipixated graphics
i found none of these things
there are only  new characters club kid auger flamethrower and my favorite new driver flower power
the levels especially washington dc is a small open level which is no fun
the north pole is annoying and i hate the boring london level
the graphics are cheesy and  studios tried to make them look too real
the cars flip over with every tight turn you make when another car hits you or you drive onto a hill
this game is not realistic
this game should have  stars and is a disgrace to the tm title
i warn you do not even look at this game
it is the worst
the car combat genre is in shameto this very day i still cannot understand why everyone loves tomb raider so much
aside from the odd improvement here and there the games havent changed vastly i think doom to quake is vastly at all
i find controlling lara very clumsey the rd person view not help
plus lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting somethings head off from a distance is nonexistent
i found myself fart around half the time
wheres the fun in climbing up a rock face
im all for puzzles but i find these games boring and labourious
oh and lara croft is not fit because shes not real and if she was shed fall forwards due to her massive mammaries
so stop ogling at your screen you sad peopleeven when it first came out i tried out this game but could not get into it and i hate the n old style d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds espessially in pits
of all the mario games to date including the amazing wii titles except for super mario wii this has to be the worst mario game for me since mario nes
the graphics are terrible the music is annoying and its just boaringill admit right now that i hate all of the simcities that came out with the exception of the super nintendo version of the first simcity
im more of an action person not a sitbackandwatchmycitygrow person
sure  simcity  is good for a while with its catchy graphics and innovative  approach to buidling a city but a few hours later youll either want to  fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor depending upon whether  the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year
i  turned out to be one of the latter people
no matter how hard i tried i  could never get the income to come out positive
so i did what any  distraught and stuck person would dogo online for cheat codes
an hour  later i was bored
if youre a thinker by all means try simcity   out
but if youre a person that thinks actions speak louder than words  try dungeon keeper  a game like simcity  but not as complex and  more activewasnt the very first crash bandicoot game supposed to become one of the alltime greatest playstation games
thats what sony thought would happen back in the day
after all they promoted the game to death
well look at that didnt happen
and with good reason
the game is horrible
i cant believe anyone would prefer this junk over sonic the hedgehog or especially the mario bros seriesyou have to give sony a lot of credit for all the attention they put into crash bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as mario and sonic but gamers never really caught on to crash the same way
when you think about it the playstation already had a huge selection of games to choose from around the time crash was released therefore sony didnt even need a mascot
people were buying playstation games like crazy anyway
crash bandicoot never even had to existyoud think for a debut game a big debut considering all the advertisements on tv commercials sony would have made the game a little easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play
instead sony started off the crash series with impossible bonus levels impossible to complete and find i didnt even know the game had bonus levels until i looked it up in the instruction booklet
even if you ignore the bonus levels the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages such as the one where youre crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks a nightmare of a level
all the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away
a mascot debut game shouldnt have the difficulty this high because the idea is for players of all ages to enjoy the game
children will not like the nonstop frustrationi think the biggest reason crash bandicoot isnt remembered today the same way mario and sonics debut games are is because crash is basically just a blend of mario and sonic but featured in a d world
think about it
crash collects berries throughout the game mario collects coins sonic collects rings
crash has a spin attack mario and sonic already had spin attacks years before crashs existence
sony just didnt have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different and thats why most gamers tend to ignore crash bandicoot
when you already have the best mario and sonic you dont need imitationscrash bandicoot may have improved later on not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation however but the series certainly did not start with a bang
i will always remember the very first crash bandicoot game as being this uninteresting frustrating experience
heck just the fact that only  reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show crash bandicoots first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten
add to the fact that right now in the year  no one is talking about any crash bandicoot game anymore
this means you can ignore crash bandicoot entirely and not really miss out on anythingaugh
i found the first few levels of crash  harder than the rd world levels crash  and  it also uses a system of having to pass one level to get to the next
this becomes frustrating because i found myself having to repeat the same level over and over again because i either died or hell i dont know
i just had to repeat the level because it wouldnt let me continuealso there is no giant screen where you can save
you have to find the bonus platform and make it all the way through the bonus part to save
happen to fall through the cracks on the bonus
sorry
youre just going to have to hope you dont die or else youll have to repeat everything
over
againa little kid is going to get frustrated and give up on this game if you get it for him
be nice to your children
buy them crash  or  or games from the spyro series that would work tooif you really really want to play all the games in the crash series just rent it even though its dirt cheap to buy haha put the money towards something betterok here are the reasons this game is bad
the graphics arent very good and plus most of the levels look alike
its frustrating and there are millions of ways to die in one level
youll wish you never had this game
most of it doesnt make any sense and its unimaginativethere
are those good enough reasons not to get this game
dont get itif you like orange bandicoots and video games then get crash bandicoot the stuff of dreams and legends
i am ngin you fool
face my destructive robots
that is my fave quote
if you hop on the shrooms right before the end o the nd snow bear level and go to the central one you shall find none other but a secret teleport
you will go to an unknown warp room that makes no sense
congratseverytimes we loaded the game it would play for maybe  mins and then would keep freezing and not play and my gaming system is not messed up i cant return the game i threw away the bag i wish companies would test their damn games before selling them disapointedi bought it because it was cheaper than buying the original version which it is identical to except for item placementsthis game is horrible
first i bought this video quotgamequot because i thought it was fun
well in wasnt
st the graphics are poor
nd the computers difficulty level is so hard
if you play with one two or three people you always lose
the computer is way more expirenced than a human will ever be and it just degrades from the fun factor
so ignore the reviews that say it is so great
they are overexxagerating
my yearold brother got bored with it in  hoursthis game is so stupid like one of the reviers said all you do is find stuff and haveto find the exit door
and the last three levels are impossible to beat because they all look the same and you keep finding the same door you went through before
this game is like doom you know the one where you just see the weapon
dont get me wrong the graphics were cool but it just sucked and the only way to beat it is if you cheatthe product arrived in its original case with game booklet
the case was cracked and the cd had minor scratches on it
the gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult
it takes some getting used to
the image was very dark not sure if it was my tv but no other games have ever had this problem
the ingame options did not have and actual brightness setting to help me with this
the sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together
overall i was not happy with the game itself
i had no problems with the provider or the arrival of the product  in more ways then one it trys to match the style and fun of goldeneye but fails miserably
considering this game was made after goldeneye you would think it would at least have quality graphics but no
gameplay and control is horrible and frustrating where it offers only one controller set up and one camera angle where you are stuck behind the character
the missions are vrey booring too
this game is very hard even on the possible setting and has glitches where you loose the missions at the end after doing everything your supposed todo yourself a favor and never play this horrible gameavarage rpg with long and boring combact system less than avarage story dull characters poor dialogue and dull graphics
dont waste your money in such weak productproducts offered by many marketplace sellers are not original nintendo brand
often they are unlicensed third party knockoff expansion packs
ive personally had these damage a system and ruin games
look for sellers offering the real thing by nintendo
ive warned you
you can save a few bucks and take your chances
deviation from the actual product isnt even allowed on amazon
their very listings are a violation to begin with
their feedback speaks for itselfi have used a lot of third party expansion packs for the nintendo  and they all have been problematic causing crashes and other issues
the only one that works without a problem is the nintendo brand expansion pakthis game is so oold you cant even get the graphicsi suggets that if you didnt play this game but you all ready played rubysappire you will hate this game
i say wait for fire red and leaf green  come out its the same thing but the graphics are alot betterthis game is horrible first of all the play is slow
this game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging
the graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game
the voice overs are soo weak
it takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval
this doenst even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details
this is a must not buy and a huge letdown
star wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost  years and especially with all the new technology around
dont buy this gamethe gameboy color was good but i really like the  gameboy the grey one that takes  batterieshonestly theres nothing good about this game
the graphics are not at all what the playstation console has the ability for
the graphics are more like sega genesis or super nintendo or even the atari rather than the playstation
if you like games with good graphics do not get this gamethe gameplay isnt that great also
the n version is much better because the gameplay is more up to date and realistic and plus the graphics are what the graphics should be like on the new and modern consolesi swear play a demo or atleast rent the game i rented it and it was the worst money i ever spent and check out the graphics
plus in order to know the story of this game you have to read the direction book
i cant remember it word by word but it went something like this duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of la okay so the story sounds goodbut why wasnt there a sequence within the game showing us the story
and plus all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboardi think that whatever company or designers created this game obviously didnt have much money at the time so they decided to make a mediocre game
this was bad
believe meif you want a game with good gameplay excellent graphics wonderful and atmospheric feelings to it get some game on the playstation like a final fantasyif you want a game with awful graphics bad gameplay no storyline sequences and a sega genesis feel then get this gamethis game is not worth any money at allive been a duke nukem fan for a long time
i loved time to kill and enjoyed land of the babes
total meltdown is the most frustrating  fps i have ever played
the speed is so fast it is hard to move
looking up and down is a choreyou use l and l to look up and down
jumping puzzles are annoying and swimming is almost impossible
crouching is hard and the graphics are terrible
sound is bad as well
the only funny part about this duke nukem game is the rulebookit is funny
the only semidetailed part of this game is dukes weapons and hand animations
even the cutscenes are bad
please try to avoid this game and save some cashyes people this game sucks big time
this game came with the original nintendo system back in late s
i had a hard time trying to beat this game because the control was down right horrible
most of the time youll jump off edges by accident
and who  would pay  to relive the nightmare of this game
apparent  people who reviewed this game and my friend didwow superman
this game has earned the lowest review score i have ever given a game and ive given some rather sty scores and the second lowest score i have given a product ive reviewed
i find it absolutely sickening when some of the people who reviewed this game like shaqfu a guy who named himself after what many people would proclaim as the worst fighting game of all time and one of the worst games of all time mind you said that this game was a masterpiece and quote on quote this is by far the best game on the n
what
youre not serious are you
this is definitely not the best game on the n it is without a doubt the worst game to plague the n
thats like the stupid people who say the that the godawful gamecube was way better than the ps and xbox its not an opinion its the truth that those things suck
to show my love for the n instead i will give you a list of my personal favorite n titles you should play instead of this perfect dark
starfox  conkers bad fur day
resident evil  mario kart  tony hawks pro skater
spiderman
star wars episode i racer
road rash pilotwings san francisco rush seriesgoldeneye turok seriesetc etc etcthere go play those instead
those games are a million times better each than this game will ever be
now lets talk about the glorious superman  in all of its greatnesswhat the game is the story seems straight out of an awardwinning movie
supermans friends have been kidnapped by lex luthor and thrown into a virtual metropolis
superman must go save his friends and the world from the evil deeds of lex
this game feels like a pilotwingsbeat em upfind the button gamegraphics the people who gave this game star reviews said the graphics are amazing
are they
why yes if you think a game that looks like a psone game made on a budget of  or it looks someone vomited fruity pebbles all over the tv screen then yes it does look fantastic
absolutely mindblowing especially with the numerous glitches in the environments
the programming work done by titus is stunning indeed
superman can go through walls unexpectedly or can stuck in random places and will be unable to move for a brief period of time
wow titusmusic the musical score is truly amazing
its the kind of musical score that makes a person want to drown some kittens when they hear it
i want this composers hand then slap them across the face and tell them wow way to suck
sound the sound effects seem like they were recorded in a basement
everything is too quiet or it echoes
another accomplished feat for the guys who made this game
even something as simple as sound effects suckgameplay during my playthrough of the game this is how the missions went fly through the rings
pick up those cars before those people get crushed
fly through more rings
pick up that police car and take it to the other side of the road
fly through more rings
beat those four thugs armed with guns
fly through more rings
use your ice breath to stop those tornadoes from sucking up those people
fly though more rings
go into a building
beat up robots and find a keycard
insert keycard then go to an elevator to another with even more robots to beat up
destroy those robots open those doors and rescue those people underground
go disarm bombs and along the way beat up more robots a tank and a woman who has better skills than you do
the repetition goes on and on and on
this game is very repetitive
extremely repetitive to be exact
and very broken too
overall this game plays out like pilotwings except you break the controls and the make the dated visuals even worseoverall if you enjoy life and dont wish to pollute the classic n stay away from this horrible game
im surprised nintendo didnt do what atari did with et
for the atari  destroy thousands of copies and bury them in new mexico
worst of all theres a nintendo seal of quality on the box
how did nobody stand up to say this game sucks thats all it would have takenthe good this category has been left blank for obvious reasonsthe bad everything
every single thing is bad about this gameif flying through rings with bad handling and a time limit is fun then buy this game
all you do is fly through rings and fight enemies on a time limit and with special abilites you have to find with limited amounts
it would be fun to fly around and cruise the city but with the time limit you would run out before you get anywhere
even if this game was a buck its so bad it couldnt even be a novelty
people who know this game might even make fun of you
anyways i dont think there will ever be a good superman game its sadfly threw rings and pick up carsthis game is an insult and should be shoved up the developers anusbad games happen all the time but only the worst of the worst are talked about years after their release
superman  is just one of those games
receiving no positive reception when it was released in  it is a laughing joke and quite a disgrace to the man of steel
this looks like a job fora hammer to smash the cartridge withgraphics bad even for its time
blocky characters compiled with glitches in movement and glitches in general
the town is full of kryptonite fog which is just an excuse for the lack of perception in the town
simply inexcusablemusic the same repetitive tunes over and over and over and overstory how long did it take for titus to think of this epic story
pretty much lex luthor traps supermans friends in a virtual world and for some reason superman flies through rings and saves virtual people on his way to finding themcontrols i once recall someone on gamefaqs saying that superman controls like a  pound man on drugs
thats an understatement
taking off and flying requires lots of work while superman himself steers like a drunk drivergameplay before starting a stage you have to start a series of awful missions
for some reason superman flies through rings rings and more rings and this is quite difficult with the godawful controls
after that superman does odd missions such as saving people from cars beating shadows or stopping tornadoes with his ice breath
note that all of this is virtual so why is he bothering to save them
then after that he flies through more rings does a mission more rings and eventually the level begins
the levels themselves are terrible as well filled with glitches and the fact that superman is super weak
he is the man of steel yet an explosion is enough to kill him
after the level is completed the whole cycle starts all over again
as with all titus games to fully complete it you must play on the hardest difficulty which is just plain stupidbuy no
stay away at all costs and dont let it corrupt your n
well if you are interested get it on an emulator because even paying a dollar for this game is asking too muchthis is one of the worst games of all time
i remember playing this as a kid and just kept sucking at it
when i was a kid i didnt understand a game could be bad and simply thought i was doing something wrong and kept playing until i finally accepted this game is awful
the control in this game is really bad especially during the ring stages
youll just fly all over the place
the first instinct for such terrible control is to move slowly but you have a time limit so you dont have time to move slowly
when i got to a point where i could fight it was like a maze and had no idea where to go
the only reason anyone should buy this game is for game collecting only and even then they should save this when they are scraping the bottom of the barrelnintendo power voted it the worst game evergamestop and spot hate iti was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store
i thought superman ill have to try that
i have never seen a game more deserving of the following this is the worst game ever
it deserves to be burned
it is a disgrace to intelligent beings everywhere
makind should be ashamed of its poor ability to create games
it is utterly pointless
it makes south park look like shakespeare
it makes alien hominid seem easy and sophisticatedsomewhere far far away superman weepsi could go on and on but look it is really very simple
its hard to believe titus could have screwed up this game so badly
they should be ashamed of themselves for releasing itso to all always pronto pay attention to mister number one best sheriff students idiotic post i love you sophisticated people who drop the f bomb and think you are coolwhite trash that sums you up  have a nice dayand dont forget you hafta agree with me at all times click on the yes button under my review obey me everything that has to do with good things of methis game does not in fact star superman
it stars his genetically engineered clone created by lexcorp known as stuporman
stuporman staggers like a drunken person relies on powerups for super powers pulls punches so enemies beat him likes random time limits including ones that lead to an instant game over can pass through solid objects like they arent even there and can die from things that cannot hurt the real man of steel in a million years like ordinary bullets and explosions
he was created for the sole purpose of ruining supermans reputation by making him look pathetic and weak
all part of lex luthors evil plan
if you love superman dont buy this game or youll be buying into a liewhen i heard nintendo was coming out with superman i got all excited then they delayed the release date which usually means the game is going under even more improvements
when i bought superman i sped all the way home turned off my phone and sat in my chair
to my suprise this game is not worth the plastic its made of
i dont even have one good thing to say about it
i was extremely disappointed
superman used to be cooli didnt even play this game and i dont own an n but because there are so many bad reviews i will just give this game another bad review so people wont buy it since its supposed to be the worst game everin kill bill vol
 david carradine described superman as follows not a very good comic not particularly welldrawn
well i suppose if caine from kung fu is talking about this character then the game must be cool too right
its been almost  years since titus released the most unorthodox game to ever grace our solar system
it must be good since were still talking about all these years laterseriously theres a lot to like about superman   you wont need any sort of defect warranty because the second you flip the power switch it works every time
its refreshing to buy an electronic device knowing that its electrical circuits will never fail youequally cool is that superman flies in this gamei like it when he flies
every time i pop in this cartridge im even more eager to watch  the christopher reeve moviesall  of themthe plot is revealed to the gamer with great restraint
you see there are bizarre murky images that even david lynch or stanley kubrick wouldnt be able to visualize
for example lois lane and jimmy olsen are confined to uma blurry contraption that kidnaps them or does it imprison them
i personally couldnt tell if it was really jimmy and lois because its very hard for the gamer to completely understand the cutscenes
but isnt it neat to figure it out for yourself
you see because the graphics are so confusing and blurry you get to keep playing again to unearth the games secrets
and dont worry about completing superman  in a short period of time either
its a tough game and there are few games that equal its challengewhats most remarkable is how the game also addresses supermans emotional state
im sure kalel struggles to use his powers properly its not easy for a nearinvincible alien to do the right thing 
titus has tackled this concept very faithfully
you see when superman flies he wont always do what the n controller tells him to do
a freespirited main characterbrilliantlastly supermans powers are present here
he has his eyelasers and windfreeze breath
thats always neat huh
but whats even more most fascinating is that the man of steel  according to this game  has the ability to manipulate the physical dimensions in which he exists
he sometimes will be flying casually through the sky and then have a sudden urge to fly through the buildings of metropolis
how cool is that
on the other side of this spectrum there are moments where superman will get stuck in a wall or a drainage ditchyou know i still havent figured out how to beat those sections of the game
i wonder is there a higher power known only to superman
i ask because titus refuses to give us easy answers to this puzzling n entry
the most gifted scientists researchers cryptologists artists and gamers will not be able to solve this enigmasuperman  is one of the most unforgettable and original experiences in all of gaming
this review was meant to be sarcastic and satirical
i am not responsible if you buy this gamethis game was soooo bad i took it immediately back to the game store where i got it from
i got it since i am a superhero fan but trust me even if you are a diehard fan of superman resist the urge to purchase this game or trade for it or even accept it for free
this is one of those noway games that should be thrown in the microwave and have the molecules in it to be melted for goodwhen i first turned the game on the people in the first level looked like an oil painting
and it is nearly impossible to fly through those rings
miss one ring and words show up that saylex wins and you hear a really bad reproduction of baldys laughi put two stars for this being a fun game because it is so much fun to laugh at
i wonder why dc let titus make this horrific game
sobonce again we have an example of an amazon vendor claiming one thing and delivering something elsethis cdrom did not even come in a protective plastic jacket
i suppose little tommys parents wouldnt give him the money to purchase one so he could completely fool the amazon dupe customer that he paid good money for a legal copynot worth  cents graphics are very poor for nintendo  the game is very tedious finding pass cards in every level to open doors gets old very quick
the aliens also dont put up a fight just there to die
co op would be a nice feature but it is the same maps and bots running in circles is boring
after level  there seams to be missing the yellow card looked every where and my friend and i could not find it
a much better version of this is availible on the ps 
definately dont waste any money on this game it down right sucksoh here they come
can you hear it
the wimpy cries of the thousands and thousands of fanboys and fangirls of this failure of an rpg
i can certainly hear them because ive been listening to them for the past few years
i will admit i was excited to play this game at first seeing as i never played it before christmas of but honestly i wish i had never played it at all
why
well stick around sit back shut up and readstory atrocious
simply atrocious
you start the game as an exsoldier named cloud default name seeing as you have the option to name your main character who is currently an employed gun for a resistance group called avalanche
why these groups and names have big capital letters for seemingly no reason is beyond me seeing as they dont stand for anything
along the way youll meet and greet a number of people who have nothing to do with what youll be doing in the current area youre in get pissed off with the inability to comprehend even the slightest bit of dialogue spitting from the mouths of these characters and finally come to the climax of the game facing yet another completely overrated villain in a battle that will last about thirty minutesbut not because its hard
its not
i have so many problems with this games storyokay i have a lot of problems with this game period
you get a total of  characters in your party and guess what
seven of them have absolutely nothing to do with the main storyline whatsoever
the only reason they exist is for partyfilling seeing as they completely blew away any resemblance of a cast and crew of characters that actually mean something towell anything
two of them you dont even technically have to get in your party to begin with
you can literally beat the entire gameall  hours of itwith the drooling retards you pick up along the way
the game is so stale and boring in terms of taking your hand and walking you through the story and everywhere you turn you can see something you can bitch about for hours
party members includedgameplay same thing as every other final fantasy game released before its time
theres seriously nothing revolutionary about this game
its the same boring lazy turnbased system youre used to except they actually find ways to make it even less enjoyable
the movement of the battles themselves feels and looks glitched and every time you use an attack skill or spell youll be sitting there waiting for them to finish with your thumb up your ass
oh and if you plan on summoning a powerful magic creature from the summon materiawell i certainly hope you stocked up on food drinks and toilet paper youll be sitting there staring at the atrociouslylong summon animations for the next hour and a half before you can even make your next movepresentation what are you talking about
this game is clearly not even finished
do you know how many glitches bugs and excruciating errors i found while playing this game
hundreds
the sickest part
i didnt go out of my way to find them
they came to me
the character models look ridiculous nobody has anything interesting to say no matter where you are in the game the battles are boring and unworthy to the franchises name and youll be lucky if you can even make it to the end without exploiting a glitch or two
or ten
not only that but the game is way too easy
i literally played through the entire gamestory and allin less than  hours
in that time i never once died or even lost a member of my party if youre not counting aeris seeing as she dies in a cutscene
and hey if youre having trouble with something just exploit one of the hundreds of glitches in this game to allow yourself the ability to walk through walls gain infinite money and items level your entire party up to  in a single fight deal millions of damage to an enemy with a single hit or even reset every single ingame switch so you can replay absolutely everything in the game over again with all the stats items and equipment you already have
but seriously who the hell would play through this monstrosity anything more than once
this unfinished broken piece of cow dung is not worth the timesoundtrack what soundtrack
its just a bunch of clicks screeches and otherwise infuriating sounds
its not music
its a collaboration of angerinducing noises that will have your tv muted in less than thirty seconds or your money back
guaranteedoverall rating this game is even lucky i can give it the rating i did
its especially lucky that amazoncoms ability to rate its products only comes in five stars
if it was a standard  rating id hack my computer to give it less than  seeing as i cant stand this absolute travesty of a video game
its a downright abomination to the world and a big slap to the face of anybody who was seriously into final fantasy like myself
im glad i didnt play this game until years after it came out
if i had played it back then i probably would have been just like all of the other sniveling fanboys and girls and considered it the greatest game of all time
you cant rate a game based on how well it sold and you cant rate a game depending on the graphics
why
because both of those factors are meaningless when it comes to a true review
i strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in buying this game should steer way clear of it it is not worth even the effort to post a picture of it here on amazon
its not worth a penny out of your pocketoh hey those pixelated shemales are gonna save the world over  hours of boring gameplay
this game super mega dumbare you joking
this is by far the worst final fantasy in my opinion
man are you guys even trying anymore
i looked at final fantasy x and rented it and gosh you cant even make a good game out of thatmanbad graphics horrible gameplay sucky battle system hard to understand very difficult to get into it too confusing dumbxxx characters like cloud hes the worst
except sephiroth sometimes too long of cutscenes boring cutscenes you can barely see their eyes amp mouth etc
etc
etc
etc
times a millioni hate this gameid like to preface my review by saying i had heard a lot about this game
the main character cloud is pretty famous and pops up in a variety of games like kingdom hearts so i was really interested in trying it out
that coupled with the high reviews on gaming sites like ign which quotes that ffvii is the rpg by which all others are to be measured ffvii is a cinematic wonder had me thrilled to try this out
for some perspective ign quotes my favorite game of all time zelda ocarina of time as ign reviews the biggest game of the decade
does zelda  live up to the hype
i never owned a ps until the ps  ps so i was stoked to see this title come out on the ps network for now that you know a little bit about what i was expecting from this game ill provide a little bit about my gaming stylehistory before i go into the game review
im a huge rpg fan and i like a variety of games in that style turnbased timer real time strategy action
ive played a few ff games iii x tactics tactics ii and i liked them all except for x which i found to be a little too easy albeit very pretty
i also really enjoy the dragon quest games
ive been into video games since i was  and apart for a workinduced stint of abstinence in college i still enjoy video games when time permitsas soon as i started playing this game i kept telling myself it must get better
its just a slow start surely the story picks up
i pushed on for a few hours going through clouds background story and getting an idea of the main story arch before i finally gave it up as a bad job
im glad i only spent  to try this game out and not graphicsim not sure what ign is talking about but these graphic are terrible
yes i know the game is from  but zelda oct came out in  and its graphics have held up to the test of time much better
although the ps and n pregraphics expansion are supposed to be comparable a ps example of an older game with much better graphics is chrono cross  ps
the majority of the background for ffvii is a muddy brown that looks sort of like mulch
also since it was being released on the ps network sony and square enix could have taken the time to revamp the graphics like nintendo did for oct on the game cube instead of releasing a game whose graphics are so bad i get a bit of a headache on the newer tvs
maybe it would look better on an old tv
who knows
the cut scenes have slightly better graphics which are almost comparable to zelda octs in game graphicsstoryi wasnt really impressed by it although it its an interesting concept
ive done my best to be vague in this section so that potential buyers wont have the story spoiled for themgooduniquewhen you boil it down you are basically fighting as an ecoterrorist and thats an interesting conceptbadthe character integration into the story is very poor
when you look at all the characters background stories it doesnt make sense that they are all working together
if the game spent more time with them discussing why they have their common goal of being ecoterrorists it would fit better
aside from the fact that they are all ecoterrorists who live in the same beat down community they really have nothing in commoni did not like the characters i had been introduced to before i quite playing
cloud is incredibly angsty and selfcentered in the beginning and i found all the social scenes centered on him to be unpleasant
his friendship with tifa doesnt make much sense to me either
tifa is a sweet person and portrayed as kindhearted yet she seems to be obsessed with cloud who is nothing like her emotionally
barret um can we say racist
barret the only black person in the game consistently beats his chest like a gorilla
yes lets make the black person look and act like a gorillagameplaymediocrethis is the most important part for some people although i tend to find the story to be nearly as important
for me if the story is bad it would take phenomenal game play to keep me engaged in the game
the game play here was average it has a pretty typical timer setup nothing to write home about
im not sure if this game invented timer play if so kudos to square enix
the timer play did make the beginning more interesting in that you were literally thrown into the game with no instructions so it took a little while to get a hang of the game play
once i figured out the game play though hr of game time most of which is scenes i quickly grew tired of this gamesummarythis game has average game play terrible story horrific graphics even for a late s game and pretty pathetic characters
i played for  hours and then gave up on it
my free time is limited and i dont waste time on games that arent fun because they might get better
maybe ffvii really picks up in hour  all i know is that i was very disappointed in the game and im quite incredulous about the higher reviews here on amazon and on other gaming sitesupdatebarrett  when cloud is introduced to headquarters barrett beats on his chest like a gorilla which i found to be a poor choice for the only black character in the game to be doing
however his overall portrayal may not be that racist as i only played for  hours and many claim he is treated better in the later gamedespite the comments and emails ive gotten about this review i still leave it as star
without the nostalgia goggles i didnt enjoy the story the graphics the gameplay or the characterswhen i first bought my ps i got ff ff and ff
that was back in   ff  ff i liked
good stories  loveable characters
but ff was a dragthen i saw all the positive reviews best game ever so i decided to give ff a second playing in  to impress me
but i still did not like it
imho the major flaw is that ff has too many dry sections where you fightfightfight and almost nothing happens storywise example  climbing the floor building of your enemy or the dumb section where you waste an hour finding a dress
in some sections literally hours pass by with no story it feels like a step backwards to the nearnonexistent stories of the original nintendoalso the battle engine  totally unbalanced
a good rpg will provide balance between physical  magical attacks so they are nearequal
a good rpg will make each character unique with specific skills  weaknesses like real peoplesome are fighters others are healers
not so ff its all magic physical attacks are worthless about  the damage and the characters are completely interchangeable
you can equip fire to your man  heal to your girl
and then the next battle completely flip it around so the man is the healer  the girl is the killer
and then flip it again
no individuality
each character is identical
plus instant learning and instant forgetting not realistic at allalso the story while good is poorly executed
it basically boils down to a meteor poisoning the planets health  very simple concept  but the writer dances around  adds unnecessary complication
he takes    and turns it into     thats why so many gamers go huh
what just happened
it was a good story but a lousy scriptoverall ff is one of the weakest games in the ff series inferior to the other ps gameff super nintendo games ff ff ff even inferior to ffi got the pc version of this game and its a far cry from the others in the nfs series
the graphics are horrid the cars are weird not more normal cars like the ferraris or jaguars in the other need for speeds
the cars are hard to control its way to easy to spin out and crash
the menu controls are hard to use to for instance most of the options dont have a pulldown menu you have to cycle through all the options
if you want great racing get need for speed  high stakes or porsche unleashedif you want a game that you can master in  mins with any character then power stone is it
i beat the game as i got it once i discovered the formulaill list the pros and cons to give you a fair rundownpros characters are unique and fun with personality ie
personal story ending etc missing from ps backrounds are the boss and fully interactive the moves and effects are radical king capcom shines here fast action cool japanese voicescons one dimensional fighting sucks as a d fighting game
 weapons make no sense once you know the formula
they just slow you down and make you a prime target for the formula
overalloverall this is a disappointing attempt at a fighting game
the concept is good but the fighting engine is flawed
powerstone  got it right and is a blast read my reviewsoul calibur is a classic example of all icing and no cake
the game looks great and sounds great but its too easy
the game that is supposed to be the game for quotdie hard fighting fansquot is basically a walk in the park
the game is a button masher
i played the game and found that quotturtling upquot and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settingsmy major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines
no god fearing person should touch this quotdemon sword wieldingquot game i began to discover the different plots after i played it
im not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game
what sick minds came up with this anywayif the game had a better plot one that involved some thought then it would be a classic but as it standsnopeople i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this gamethis will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the windowthe games has most of the characterswhoopiewhich are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other thingsthe games boringi rented it and it literally got old after  minutes of gameplayif there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it isavoid this nerf dung at all costsi played this on the n when i was a kid and it was funny and hilarious
the problem with that is this isnt the n
this playstation version sucks
theres only about half the weapons and half the maps or the n version
this is more like a demothis is absolutly the worst wwe game ever created
thank god for thq
if thq came in all the wwe games would have sucked really bad
dont rent this game dont buy this game dont even ask for it
the gameplay sucks the voice overs suck create a character sucks
everything for this game sucks
dont buy iti bought mine a year ago and i am very pleased with the system
its graphics are great and it is a lot of fun to play
but the chances are that it will now be a dying system
with sega getting out of the hardware side means that the customer base will not grow
while more and more psx get into peoples homes the same cannot be said for the dc
there maybe  games still coming to the dc but as time goes on that number will deacrease
a company is not going to bother with so small a market and that is what the dc will become
over the last few months i have seen dc games disappearing from the local stores as they decided to drop the line
the local video stores around me have dropped dc
tonight i found one stores entire dc gear including the systems they rented out up for sale
the dc section had been replaced with psx games
sega will also be releasing games for the psx and that alone should be saying alot for what sega has in mind
sega has admited defeat and will leave those that supported it high and dry
the current price is very very good
but it is consol taking its last breaths
was the psx heaps better
i dont think so
not from what i saw
i enjoy my dc immensly and played it for many many hours
but its day is gone
the future is the psx
a shame really both for sega and for those who bought into what they thought was a excellent alternative to the big dollar consoles
because of this i personally will not buy sega gear in the futuresega does not even deserve a one star
the only good games for sega is sonic te hedgehog
sega announced the are making a deal with nintendo to send sonic to nintendo
sega has decided to give up to the competition
finally
they will now only make games
i am happy for that
i am a nintendo fan
zelda and mario and i will be glad to see soninc coming to nintendo
dreamcast starting in february will drop   at the end of the year goodbye sega
now our only compettioor is that damn playstation and the xbox will compete
but nintendo rulesi thought this would be a good console i was very very dissapointed
it has very few good games and the graphics arent all that i expected from iti sold my dc and now i am waiting for the x boxlets sum up what is great about dreamcast  sensational graphics equal to ps great sound good controller design and an excellent although not outstanding software line upnow what is so bad about the dreamcast that i would rate it so low  sega corporation
if you havent heard the announcement yet sega will not longer be making the dreamcast console
this means that the chances of many more great new titles being developed is low
i am basing this statement from my experience with the sega saturn
once the saturn production was stopped only a handful of additional titles were released and very few stores stocked themwhen i saw that dreamcast was based on directx the same programming api as windows for the pc i was very excited because i was sure that there would be a flood of titles for the dreamcast
there are many more titles for dreamcast but the flood of pc cross overs never materialized and the few that did come urban chaos rainbow six were badnow sega has given up on their console and wants to make software for other companies
i believe that sega owes its gamers a little more loyalty than it has shown and i hope that the gaming community reacts by not purchasing sega software for any platform
my investment in a ps was good for  years
my dreamcast lasted six months
goodbye sega purchases foreverthis controller has to be one of the worst out on the market
it has a horrible design is made of cheap plastic and to make matters worse its  also highly priced
dont even think about using it for games like marvel  vs capcom because even casual play will break this controller
if youre  serious about games find an import controller made by another company
dont even bother with the other dreamcast controllers out in america they  are all just as bad if not worsei dont mind if the graphics arent completely state of the art but this was ridiculous
not only were the graphics terrible but the rendering engine they used was pathetically slow and the effects were horrible
i  ran this game on a pmhz with a ddr geforce video card and could not  enjoy the game at any decent resolution because of the huge frame hits you  would receive depending upon where in the track you were
terrible
even  at high resolutions the cars and tracks looked pixellated and cartoonish
i which is many years older than this game has graphics which kill ns
i am unbelievably dissapointedto be quite honest i found this to be the most tedious roleplaying game ive ever played
the narrative sequences are ridiculously long the graphics are mediocre and the mechanics of controlling other characters in combat is poorly designed
i read a lot of good reviews of this game before i bought it and i was terribly disappointedive always been a thief fan especially thief  id read about this game over the years but never played it because i was busy playing other games
this game was developed by the same folks who made thief so i figured it had to be greati rate it with one star because i cannot install it on an sd card and play it on my netbook which lacks a cd drive
even after doing a full install the game refuses to start without a disk in the nonexistant drive
this is inexcusable because i paid for this game while those who obtain it through other means are able to do the aboveonce again i the honest customer get shafted
i regret buying this game and i will never ever touch another eapublished product again
thanks guysto all the gamers ask yourself this question how will you play all of these games that require a cd in the drive to run when modern computers eventually stop using optical media
oh but i forgot nobody is supposed to be playing games from a decade ago
were all supposed to get the shiny title of the monththis is just like an arcade game you play at a bowling alley or something
for those who like those kinds of games then maybe the game would work for you
but i found this game extremely boring and no funthis game was bought and rather farfetched
i hoped it would work and it doesnt play story mode at all
so im stuck in training mode and can only play the first training session
a shamecosting as much as fifty dollars new at the time i nevertheless was suckered into buying two of these back in  or so when i played my n a lotthe thing is insanely sensitive and easy to break
the first stupid thing it does is in its use you put the gameshark into the slot then stick the game up on top of it
as with many cartridge game systems it seems you need to wiggle it about and position it just right just for it to work
i remember spending several minutes during the last leg of my first gamesharks life trying to adjust the game on top to be slightly lopsided because it simply would not work if i just pushed the cartridge down all the way like its supposed toof all the functions it has half of them dont even work
the function of basically making up new cheat codes based on gameplay regularly froze up games and at worst caused catastrophic damage to the gameshark
i remember one instance i tried to create a new cheat code and ended up filling up my entire gamesharks memory with useless information
almost none of the preset games and codes worked names were screwed up with random characters and letters and largely i had to just guess which code would do what for which gamethe fifteen minute instructional vhs that came with the gameshark was a hilarious jokeboth vhss had the little plastic tab on the bottom still intact
if you still remember how vhss work this means anyone can record over the vhs if the plastic tab is still intact
i could literally have recorded gay porn over the vhs packaged it with the gameshark sent it back for a refund and they likely would have sent the vhs in a new package to be sold to someone elsewhatever benefits the gameshark gives are simply not worth it in the long run
it doesnt ruin your game permanently but it ruins itself just fine
there was never any justified reason for the way my two gamesharks just simply broke down and stopped workingi know what youre thinking i need another controller
the generic cant be that bad i might not like it but ill be able to playno you will not
you wll hate every minute of thisas others have said the buttons are actually ok but the dpad will drive you insane
rage quitinducing
dont bother go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual old snes controller
the price will be well worth it
ive pretty much thrown this in the garbage but i cant seem to bring myself to it for some reason but it deserves itthis is a very dissapointing system
slow loading bad graphics and terrible games
but it has a good controlleras usual interact accessories dissapoint
this tremor pak jumps too hard for what is taking place on screen and absolutely sucks
the slightest action on screen and it wants to jump out of you handnot good at all
instead of adding realism to a game it proves to ba an annoyanceavoid at all cost
get the official sega jump pak insteadthis thing does nothing but shake the heck out of your arms when you play
it is at times comical
it makes your controller rattle you hear shaking noises and feel like you are having some sort of seizurethis tremor pack thing will die off in my opinion
it will go the way of robbie the robot for the nes
remember him
neither does anybody elseit is an interesting idea but it doesnt really enhance the games
just because the controller shakes in your hands doesnt mean you feel like part of the game
in fact with all the shaking it might even disrupt your game play
you are much better off getting a visual vmu to put in the front slot at least that enhances your gaming experience
i have this tremor pack and after playing with it for a few hours i took it out and havent used it since
dont waste your money on it
that is the best advice i can givei thought this game looked like it would be great but it turned out that it was boring irritating not to mention that it has bugs my computer is almost brand new and this game would crash every five minutes
a few months later i bought roller coaster tycoon and i became addicted to it i love it
if you are interested in this game i recommend that you buy rollercoaster tycoon instead its a lot more fun and it doesnt have bugs dont waste your money on sim themeparkokim a huge fan of simstuff  i cant get over how clever they are how real they play out how absolutely consuming they can bethis product is not one of themits awkward its punchy and buggy
it  restricts your creativity in a way that ive yet to experience in any other  sim game
you are limited to two island scenarios to begin and they are in  themes like dinosaur and space ship  and they are very tiny  not much  to work with
creativewise you are stuck with rides that are typical to  that particular theme  ie your park attendees bounce up and down on a  dinosaurs stomache as one of the rides
shudderi think the game is  ideal for children  and under
its fun and quirky enough to entertain  them but its not what youd typically expect as an avid adult player  from a sim gametry roller coaster tycoon if youre an adult fan of  simulated amusement park game software but even that gets a bit dull after  a while  its easy to win and repetitiveor try the sims its quite  entertaining and very well put togetherthis is the worst game i ever bought the first time i bought it there was a problem with it and then the nd time its was still broken and had a problem with it dont waste ur money on it its so not worth it i still have the game but ive never been able to use it since its so messed upfirst in the series by blizzard
not something i would play nowadays but this was a very interesting rpg back in the day when i had been a gamerhope you like backtracking cause youll be doing that allot in this one
i bought this game at a yard sale for a buck and i still think i got ripped off
this game has no strategy none
the controls suck whatever happened to up down left right
guess the developers at blizard entertainment thought that is just way to convenient
i have no clue on how this game got so many good reviews over the years
this game is for anyone under the age of  to like it
you cant just fight a boss head on like they do in games that were actually worth playing no you have to run behind a door or somethin and cast a spell until hes dead
 yeah i know as if a boss doesnt know on how to open a freakin door
another thing that got me was when your backtracking outside some kid just outside of this underground church that goes ten stories down
the kid has some info on a place or a location or somethin he charges outrageous prices like if you want a sword or somethin its 
wtf
ya know a nickle use to go a long way in the s this is like s whats he fixin to buy a castle
i dont what my dollar back i want the  hours i wasted my life on playing it
so dont buy this game no matter how little of a price they want iti really did not like this game at all
it was way too fantasybased
do not get this game if you like games that are even slightly realisticstarcraft is one of the most annoying games ive ever played
sure terran  marines give u a little laugh now and then but the controls are  frustrating
you have to right clickwhy not the usual leftclick
to  select units and you cant deselect them
building times are extremely long  and so are the units
gameplay on my pc is overall boring and slow on a  pentium ii  voodoo mb ram
i have only got up to the third terran  mission then finally gave up
and whats up by only controlling  units at  a time
the command conquer series lets you control all units you have on  screenstarcrafts ingame graphics arent that good fmv qualty is terrible  and battlenet gives you a pain in the a because of its slow server and  few options
westwood online gives the player more options and is also  faster
all in all i say the command and conquer series is better  go  play tiberian sun or red alert or any other campc game  sc isnt worth  your time or moneyyawn very boring disapointing game
terrible gameplay graphics bla bla bla
the cinematics run at an extremely slow frame rate
at least the music is kinda good
i dont recommend this for any god damn gamerthe game will not load on my mac
the box says its supposed to
this was a very big disappointment
i was trying to get out of the shooter gameshey maybe im doing something wrong but i havent been able to get this game to do much of anything the graphics are poor for this day and age and the controls were even worse i didnt play very long though so its not fair to say it truly stinks maybe ill try it again and see if i missed somethingawful
a real disapointment
this game is confusing and boring much like civilization  the game cover made it sound much more exciting than it really was
i bought it a while ago from rinho and it was bran new then
i was sooo dissapointed
it takes forever to play the battles are cheesy and a waste of time
if you are considering buying this game i reccomend you try it before you buy it
belive me its not even worth 
ive always been dissapointed with sid meiers games
so i think ill stop trying them
if your considering this game try imperium galactica  its awsome
no comparison
i hope you found this reveiw helpfuli was a big fan of parappa the rapper and i was seriously disappointed with this sequel
its bad enough that you can beat it in  minutes but whats worse is that you wouldnt want to
the music is just bad and that is inexcusable for a music game
where are all the catchy tunes
i cant remember one line from this game whereas i have all of parappa the rappers songs memorized
its missing those great lyrics found in parappa like my favorite quotsunny in my life shes like a dice i cant tell which way to turn till i spicequot skip umjammer and get parappait doesnt make any sense
how can this game be considered a classic
it has way too many flaws for people to continue naming it best game of alltime or best castlevania game youll ever playi dont think so
if you want a real castlevania game go play castlevania  for the n
thats how a castlevania game should be done
not like symphony of the night which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problemsdont believe me
you will soon enough
first and foremost konami must think all castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb
you see the game begins with you playing as richter and youre back in the final stage of the previous castlevania game fighting dracula
this is ridiculous
i dont want to play that game i want to play symphony of the night
you dont have to redo the final fight with wart in the beginning of super mario bros   so you shouldnt have to start off symphony of the night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game
what the hell is wrong with konami
this whole richterdracula thing should have been removedafter thats over the real game begins but unfortunately thats not true
it doesnt begin yet
immediately a screen is shown of alucard running to the castle which you unfortunately have no control over
once hes inside and the gate closes you can now play as him but wait a minute
theres no music playing in the background
a game cant really start if theres no music because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexcitingluckily my worst fear didnt come true that konami forgot to put music in the game and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in
its about time
you had me worried therebut then more problems arise
in the same little area where the music kicks in you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you and many times you never see these zombies coming until its too late and you take a hit
pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearableeventually you meet up with a young lady named maria
shes extremely attractive and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons
and thats a big problem
the way she seems to come on to alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turnon to the player that its very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest
after a maria encounter you cant stop thinking about her beautiful pale face those big beautiful eyes that smooth relaxing voice and so then what happens after that is when you are in the middle of a serious battle you almost always die because you cant stop thinking about marias beautiful facekonami must not understand that mostly boys play video games
i shouldnt have to say it but i think its obvious that the creators of maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a goodlooking woman because one look at maria distracts boys everywhere
they shouldnt have made her look so pretty
because of this only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this castlevania adventure
had she been less attractive guys would be able to better concentrate on the gameyoure probably thinking by now alright talk about the actual game
okay i will but you wont like what i have to say
its just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic
basically it all boils down to one thing
the fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow weak and almost useless
yes im talking about the jewel sword and the sword of hador
konami never should have put these two weapons in the game
but because they did we have no choice but to put up with them and i have no choice but to complain
these two weapons really drag the game downi could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game
twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you which if you ask me lacks creativity
konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight but no they had to go with the old predictable mirror matchmany enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them forcing me and my children to look away from the tv screen
because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if were not careful
a little bit of blood is fine but some of the blood in symphony of the night is a bit too graphic and plentiful
its enough to terrorize you
so the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you wont have to attack them though in many places avoiding enemies wont be easyfinally the biggest problem
the second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down so its not really a new castle
now thats what i call clumsy
between the smutty actions of maria and the blood all over the place it feels like im watching a porno blood fest
not a pretty thought is it
so as you can see many problems prevent this game from being a classic
dont even think about buying itwtf is this crap this is metroid not castlevainiathis sucks
ps stop making castlevainia into gay manga garbage it takes all the thrills and scary aspects out of it by making everyone look like a woman with multi colored hairthis game is very difficult to control and it is extremely boring
it may have been a great game six years ago but by todays standards this one is a definite loser
save your moneyi saw the tv comercial for this game and it looked pretty cool but when i got it for christmas it got very boring i mean all u do is try to get to the other end of the level with ur ball and collect cards so there isnt much to this game i wouldnt reccomend this game  many peoplethis game can be described in a few simple words boring repeaditive  bad pointlesswell it wont work at all
i put it in my console and nothing
i looked it over carefully to make sure i didnt buy someknock off but it even has etched trademarks ext
it doesnt recognize the disk at all
so i went to the activision site to see if i could find some help on this game
and this is what they saidproblemdoes not load and playsolutionactivision has identified a manufacturing problem with regards to its dreamcast title blue stinger
the manufacturing issue involves only a limited percentage of the total product available in stores but will result in startup failure on certain dreamcast systemsif you experience this problem we encourage you to call  and the blue stinger hotline will send you a new disc free of charge
you will be asked to return the faulty copy of blue stinger directly to the fulfillment house
a prepaid selfaddressed mailer will be provided for their convenienceactivision is dedicated to promptly delivering replacement discs to affected consumers
we would like to extend an apology to you for the inconvenience but are confident that once this problem is corrected you will have an outstanding gaming experience with blue stinger and the dreamcast hardwareso i just wanted to post this for anyone else that has this problem or will have this problem in the future
so far i have only got their answering machine
lets see if they are still supporting this title and call me backocraigupdate  talked to someone from activision
he was kinda floored that there were still faulty copies out thereo  guess its been awhile since it was out
anyway they replaced it as promised
but the games really stinks
dont bother
its been a while since i even had my dreamcast hooked up so i dont remember what it was that i didnt like about the game
but i do remember that i knew this was a really bad game in about ten minutes of playing it
wasnt even worth my time getting it replacedpeople saying this a perfect game are either skateboarders are just crazy
this game is so outdated graphics are horrible gameplay is decent at best
there is no reason this should have higher then  stars and for that reason i am giving it a  so people will know its not a  or  out of  star gamehorrible graphics mindless games hnow the heck did u give it  starsa lot of good reviewstwo perfect  star reviews even
amazoncom gets to choose which reviews are featured so thats not really much of a surpriseyou should definitely read more reviews
the graphics are okay but the design of the graphics in this game are considered to be very cartoonish by many
bright oranges glowing blues and odd color assortments await you in this game
do yourself a favor and search for the original battlezone
that was a game i played so many years ago i cant even remember when but i remember clearly the missions and the specific gameplay elements because it was so good
the story made more sense the missions didnt tell you exactly what to do you had to figure it out which was the fun part and the overhead map was accessible from the push of a button rather than getting out of your vehicle all of the time
to summarize what these reviews on the first page are all leaving out youll have to get out of your vehicle constantly
because the drivers of other vehicles just arent smart enough to do the job themselves
youll also have to do this to access the tactical map the only way of ordering units around without actually driving there by which time the units in question will have already been destroyed too little too late missions arent involving and the story doesnt continue from the original game
in short theres really not much of a story as youll find yourself doing strange things that youve been ordered to do for no apparent reason interface is cluttered buttons rearrange themselves based on the order that you built things and its a nightmare finding the right keys to press during the heat of battle
in many games the only deciding factor of whether youll win or lose is if you find the right keys fast enoughi got this game for ten bucks on the bargain pile
it blows it is a boring extremely hard game
i liked the movie option graphics and real car phisics
the story was okay not great
the controls were horrible
the missions are extremely unforgiving and hard boring
the first mission took us  weeks to fufill
also your stuck in the car driving around
the missions are so hard by the time you know how to beat them its just memerizing a boring path
its not even challenging fun
it is more like boring impossible
also you cant see in front of you
im still on the first city
on the good side you can go to a option you have called take a ride which allows you to go out and wreck havac in the city and have cops chase and then turn the car chases into movies
also there are driving games like pursuit and getaway carnage surviver and time trials ect
there fun for a while you can also turn them into movies
also i think this has much improovement from the ps version by far
but still this game is horrible
the story mode is by far the most hard boring and unforgiving ive ever seen
if you want a fun wide variety driving game for the pc reserve gtapros lots of non story gamesgood graphicsway better than ps versionthere is movie editorreal car fisicssome might like storycons boringly hard story modebad controlsgame is uneccesasseraly hardcan only stay in carhuge lack of mission varietylarge lack of car varietygame gets incredably boring and hardmissions very unforgivingprobily takes at minimum  restarts to complete a average missionscops will start a dangerous car chase for speeding and dont stop when you stop to themcops to easily provokedcops go to dangerous lenghts to get you for a minor violationunrealistic and dangerous cop aicant run over padestriansso if you want a wide variety driving game where you can get out of a car and get in another and more mission variety reserve gtathis rumble pak is too big uses up batteries rapidly its so heavy that you hardly ever feel the rumble nintendo should have builtin rumble in thre controllers this sucksi rue the day this title came out for playstation
it was considered so original it influenced many many stealthtype games that followed it
too manywhere do i start with the things i hate about this game
its way too difficult
you get awfully sick of hearing snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake
every  seconds
there should have been a way to ratchet down the difficulty even further for tards like me
easy mode really isnt
sheesh
i wonder what hard mode was like
way too many cutscenes
ive never seen anything like it
theres one cut scene that goes on for like  minutes
this has got to be the talkiest video game ive ever played
and these dialogues are all so silly and youre pretty much forced to watch them or you wont be able to understand whats going on
in fact i would say that most of your time in this game will be spent watching cutscenes
its not so much a video game as a movie in which you are occasionally allowed to press buttons
i hate video games that wont let you pause at certain moments as this wont
i wouldnt advise playing this if you have a wife or mother whos gonna occasionally ask you to help her in the kitchen  youll find yourself saying yeah ill help you after this scene finishes 
in about half an hour
not allowed to pause it for some reason
even more excusably theres not way to pause the cutscenes
you cant even pause the codec dialogues
there are many scenes in which the game disables your weapons and accessories for no logical reason other than that if it didnt the scene would be too easy
there are far too many boss monsters
its like every other encounter is a boss monster
the first part of the game say up until the first encounter with revolver ocelot is pretty great but thats not representative of the game  after that its basically an unending series of boss monsters
frustratingly you have to fight several boss monsters twice because they never seem to die
having to kill the same boss monster over and over again makes you feel like youre going in circles
the principals having these deep discussions about delicate emotional issues while an enemy is shooting at them or while a timer is ticking down
was this written by a yearold
the system for flattening oneself against a wall is not ready for prime time  most of the time you find yourself flattened against the wall and you didnt mean to do this
this will get you killed several times as you are thus basically standing still allowing your enemies to shoot you
it should have been running up to a wall in combination with pressing l or something
the way your guy stands there uselessly for about two seconds after choking somebody
the way you can easily bypass critical lifesaving devices such as the thermal goggles
the way the game takes all these cheap shots at you  you cant look ahead because your radar is jammed and then you get shot by a security camera
or blown up by a mine
the way you are prevented after having killed a boss from going back into the battle area and collecting the stuff you didnt collect during the battle
is it there or not
so why cant i get it now
the absurd antinuclear message at the games finalei read lots of great reviews for this game that made me want to play it
it will not play on my xp
talked to a lot of other gamers that tried to help but nothing worked
am holding onto it in case i can get a chance to play it on another computer
i dont think it is xp compatiblei own a compaq desktop model  amp a hp pavillion laptop model ze
both have windows xp
i tried installing the game from  different cd rom drives  of which was my cd burner and the other a dvdcd drive
none of them worked
the disk kept getting stuck on the mapsmissionwot file
i may have just gotten a dud but i wouldnt try buying this game again unless i knew for sure that it worked on at least one computer that i ownwhat i expected was another total annihilation but obviously i was at err i dont know who made this game but if it was the original design team of ta then they were smoking somethin that made pretty colors dance across the screen
ok bottom line ta kingdoms is by far the worst possible  stradegy game ever
it is so slow on my p mhz computer after i got  about  units or so it was ridiculas
i mean it was like watching your  units walk through glue because the game slows down so bad it took my  little army of  units  minutes to reach the enemy base
also d  acceleration for this game is nonexistent
in the original ta the computer  cheated but it wasnt to an extream sence here they made it tenfold
whenever you arent looking over the enemys base they make units in   seconds or less they can make thousands of units with only one lodestone  in place
its ridiculously impossible in skirmishwhen you are just getting  your defences finished they will have those plus a  army coming to  attack your base and just plain weird in campaign mode
do not buy this  game buy the original ta its way better trust me
avoid kingdoms like it  is a urine cup used to serve apple juicei got this on sale and decided to have a look based on its low price and  star rating
what a jokeits like starcraft with bad graphics zilch instructions and awful controls
there are better games out there that are freewhile the curse began with cartoon studio for many simpsons fans it began with virtual springfield for me
now ill began by saying that this is one of the worst designed game ever
the developers attempted to use the kids game excuse but they even fail at thatusing myself as an example i first got this game when i was seven years old
at this particular time in my life i was extremely easy to please but this game couldnt even achieve thatthe first and instantly noticeable problem with this game is that it is choppy and poorly programmed
i first played this game on a poor pc but i later got a high end pc
i decided to give this game a second chance and i discovered something in the process
the game is choppy because it is poorly designed and programmed not because my old pc was bad
if you were to look at the requirements you could see that is is very low
the high end pc i had contained specs at least x higher than the requirements yet the game was still choppyand its not just some parts of the game its every part
when you turn when you walk when you do anything you will notice the choppiness
that is of course assuming you have  vision or are wearing your glasses
then again you might notice it either waythe next and the second most noticeable problem is that the game has no substance
there are very few things you could do and the few things you could gets boring quickly
for example the main thing you will be doing is simply exploring springfield
this is all nice and good but what happens when you explored everywhere
absolutely nothing
the game ends there
of course you could also collect cards but it is so ridiculously easy that you can probably finish by the time youre done exploring
hell at the time i first got this i couldnt solve any kind of puzzle yet i did it anyway
in addition to this the few minigames that are here are simply terrible
they were made to only take your attention for a minute or two
there are freeware online that are better than these minigamesnow virtual springfield has already committed two of the the worst possible crimes for pc games bad programming and no gameplay but to make the whole package even worse its expensive
at the current time of this review the lowest price offered for this game on amazon is 
selling a game this bad and that you could beat in less than one day for anything higher than  should be a federal offense punishable by  lashingsoverall it is a terrible game that has once again proven that the old saying dont judge a book by its cover
i had thought that since this was a free roaming simpsons game it would rock the casbah but i now realized my mistake
dont make the same mistake i didall u do is walk around springfield and look at things it is good at the start but then after u have looked at everything it stinks
there is nothing else to doseriously i am a huge fan of the simpsons but dont let the amazing tv show make you think that this game is good
its not
dont make the same mistake i did in buying it you will be dissapointedthis game is more fun than having a bag of hammers dropped on your head but not by much
a game where you rely on stealth and not your trigger finger is a good idea but i cant see anything
i knew that i was in trouble on the very first mission
it went like this  me quotwhere am i
is this a wall or a door
ill just open itquot guard quotheyquot me quotoopsquot guard kills me
the endwow
that was fun
hooboyafter all the years and all the hype i expected that this game would have something to recommend it
sure i realized it wasnt going to be the game to end all games
i always make sure to discount  for hype
but  my gods what a poor showing this isthere is next to no innovation
the graphics look like they were salvaged from quake the puzzles are of  the annoying quotfind the panel that opens the door way the hell over  there and backtrack etcquot style
the sense of immersion is zero
the  sounds are poorly choosen
the enemies are for the most part utterly  uninspired
the load times between segments which uses the halflife  formula are ridiculously long
its also utterly unstable and prone to  crashing at any given momentwell you get the point
if this were just  another generic first person shooter that was being sold from  on the  discount rack maybe i wouldnt feel so annoyed
as it was i went back  and exchanged it for quotsoldier of fortunequot which well also not  ground breaking is solidly entertaining and at least mildly  innovativeplease folks dont get sucked in by the hype
save your  money for something better
in the meanwhile ill be hoping that ion  storms next big product deus ex does a better job of living up to its  reputationquoti am only left asking quothow long until daikaitaina 
quotquot  hahahahahahahai really tried to like this gamei felt like screaming quotturn the lights onquot during the first level
what a murky morass
i installed this game twice and i still cant stand itwhat angers alot of gamers is this we wonder what games didnt get made because quotdaikajokeaquot sucked up so much cashdaikatana is to computer games as battlefield earth is to movies
the plot is onedimensional and does not let you stray even to the point of letting your supposedly smart teammates read more of a hindrance than a help keep you back
if a man cant figure out how to walk in a straight line across a bridge why should i trust him in a fight
additionally the enemy ai is alternately idiotic or lethal with little balance between which road is taken
the weapons range from the interesting to the downright twinkish
the program itself drains a system of precious resources to accomplish what most other games can outdo with less programming and with better results
this is a game to avoid
for a truly good game experience stick to something with more plot better game engine and more developed playertoai interfaceps
that one star should be  thats right zero stars buddyi am going to make this short but true
first off this game is hard or at least what i played
this game is no shoot them all like quake  or anything
i found this game repugent
i dont even want to try it again
i dont care if you have  weapons if you cant beat the first stage  with ease then forget about the rest
the graphics in this game are  dated back to the doom age
this  year opus did not pan out like i  wanted
i really thought john romero actually had some skill but it seems  not
the game might have good points but the save system save only if you  have a crystal
is an abomination
this is a horrible idea which is seen  way too much in console system games but never should have made it to the  pc
i admit ion storm made has made a killer game deus ex but this one  is just a pile of turds
bargin bin box
i also just want to close with  this
we can now see the real genius behind doom and doom  was john  carmack not john romero
sorry about being rude and mean but this game  is really horrible and i just want to be honestdont ever ever buy this game
i knew it was going to be bad
so far this game beat the record for the shortest stay in my hard drive even beating trespasser by  days
a game that took  years to develop well you know  somethings not right
lets start with the graphics
really very dated  opengl graphics
if this game came out  years ago it wouldve been  awesome
interface no ingame save
only way to say your progress is by  picking up save gems
no gems no save
control ok so its like any other  first person shooter which is why i gave this game its one and only star
ai very very bad
talk about having your ai teammates to back you up
youll be saving them most of the time instead of them helping you
also  there is a tendency that your artifical teammates to hit you by mistake
story just watch the old tv series quottime tunnelquot
overall spend  your money on another gamei have little patience when it comes to games like this
makes me wish i hadnt bought it and i am still trying to get rid of it
before buying take mine i will mail it to you before i hurl it through the wall
egm  said this was a good game and usually they are right
well they blew it  this time
dont get me wrong it might be fun
good concept interesting  story  terribly frustrating gameplay and absolutely ridiculous boss  fights
i never knew the playstation load time to be this irritating until  i died  times in a row
o ye of little patience avoid this onethe game its self was good but the ending was such a letdown i had fun playing it making the girls mad but the ending was just so bad that it killed the whole game for me i played  hours into itnever before in my gaming experience have i been turned off from a game in the first minute of game playthe biggest pro in this game is the fact that you can fart and burp and that my friends is a sad sad thing indeedthe programmers could have saved the gaming community the misery and not released this albatross at all
heck i probably would have paid them the  bucks i bought it for not to put it on the market and it would have been a winwin for everyonei love gta
its a great game but why does the  nes super mario bros have superior graphics to a ps game from  it defies rational explanation and this game defies all rationality itselfi am ashamed to call this a gta game or even a product from rockstargiven that i have upset many people with my controversial view of this cough classic i decided to give it a second chancelets see lets put it through the testgraphics  out of  it fits on the gameboy color thats pathetic for a psxsound  out of  fairly decent sound effects bad musiccontrols  out of  these are the worst controls everfun factor  out of  i still returned it the next dayso there you have it
this is a very bad game and i would rather have my tounge frozen to a pole with rabid poodles knawing at my ankles than play this again
word of advice buy a ps and get grand theft auto  you will not regret that financial investmentdo not buy this game
seriously
people might try to tell you it all great and dandy but as a very heavy gamer i think i can honestly rate it as one of the worst games i have ever playedthe graphics were terrible even for playstation the difficulty was ridiculous and through the roof your teammates were slow and stupid and the enemies all shot far more accurately then you couldthe difficulty was even backward from everything i have read on the game easy was hard and hard was easy
it was like the game wasnt even finishednow the game might not be that bad if it just let you relax and stealth through a mission
but no every map has an absurdly short timer forcing you to run headlong from start to finish shooting wildly at everything around you trying to get to the end before your team gets slaughtered or the time runs outi only ever managed to beat the first mission once and im pretty good at shooter games but the second mission was only that much worsei have a rule that i keep every game i own rather then trading it in forever and ever because you never know when one day you might want to go back and play it again
this is probably the only game ive ever owned that broke that rule
when i think of what the worst game i ever played was this is usually what comes to mindthe sound was terrible the graphics were terrible the controls were terrible the difficulty was terrible the timer was terrible what little i seen of the ai was not impressive teammates killing themselves like always and even the lighting was terrible forcing you to stare at this strange vista of green and black all the timeyou want a playstation one stealth shooter
try metal gear solid or syphon filter or anything
anything at allplease im warning you dont buy this game
not even for  dollar because it will only tempt you into the torture of playing it
you will get far more pleasure out a dollar double cheeseburger anyhowlooking for rise off of naked blue men with green capes reminding you of your hero to save you
well this game is for you
i first got introduced by one of my friends i mean an acquaintance
his favorite games soon showed me that he really wasnt all that bright
he said in a gay womenly voice hey try this game out
so i said hey what the hell
as i took it home i hid it away so no one would see it
so i popped it into my playstation and even it rejected it
so after a couple of trys it finally ran
so the title screen appearedi never knew this was an alienvampire porno flick
the idea of impailing naked green slaughs as their called in the game isnt my idea of a thrill
after killing them their balls shoot out numbing the mind into thinking why the main character would have to eat them to gain energy
wow now i know im scared
then the mysteriousnes of tredding through the two mystical worlds one retartedanother more retarted is as amazing as tredding through a piece of sht answer me this if a vampiregay alien has his mouth ripped off how can he eat balls or talk
its amazing
feed on the balls of your enemies explore the vast pieces of crap and an extra bonus its a ball buffet
the main character is not only a gay alien but is supposedly a vampire
his arch enemy is another vampire but is abouti dont know a billion times better then him just a rough estimate
the most amazing complex part of the gameplay is his amazing three hit combo
wow three hits
then press x to dodgelunge and triangle to impale
oh the complexity
my mind strains over this sht well if you like to get off to blue alien like mengo for but i suggest you dont waist your moneytake a game made by someone else change it use the tomb raider engine add some nonsense and you have the socalled lok seriesthe only game in this series worth mentioning and playing is blood omen the rest of these are tomb raider engine based made by someone else not silicon knights the creatorsi really wanted to like this game
i wanted to play it ever since i got my dreamcast
after many delays it finally came out so i rented it
thank god i did
im sorry to report but this is a horrible game
but why
heres why  the graphics
while theyre certainly not the worst ive ever seen they really leave too much to be desired especially for the fact that this is a dreamcast game
you can see the polygons sticking out of the characters and they dont look real at all
ive seen n games that look better than this
heck ive seen playstation games that look better
 the controls
they are the worst part of this game
using the x y b and a buttons to move isnt bad but on default a moves foward and y moves back
but thats not all
with almost unuseable menus and  commands put into the dreamcast controller it makes the game a real pain to learn and makes it barely playable
i can assure you the controls are much worse than they sound
plus the loading times are too darn long
but theres a good part to the game
the sounds are very good and draw you into the action
but thats it
i was hoping for a good spy game like goldeneye but on dreamcast but i just wasnt that lucky
dont bother wasting your time with this piece of junk
instead skip it and go immediately to perfect dark
trust me youll be glad you didthe absolute worst dreamcast game i have ever played
i would not even take this game if it was given to me for freei bought this game because i had lost my original and i wanted to play it again
the day i got it i played it for  hours
i had so much fun
then the next day i wanted to play with it again
but when i went to play it my data did not save and i thought it was maybe because i played it on the gamecube
so i took out my gameboy color and played it again
i played and then saved
i turned it back on within  minutes and it said my data saved so i thought my problem was done
but then i turned it back on within  hours and everything again was deleted
i tried to play it on my gameboy advance sp and it did the exact same thing as the gameboy color
i just contacted the buyer to see if i could get a refund or my money back
i am pissed that it didnt work and i wasted my money on it
but i am sad too because i love this game and i wanted to play it
make sure your game saves before you play it for  hours update i did receive a refund for the game back on my card
i paid shipping and handling to send it backi had this game a while ago
i loved it almost as much as i loved the snes version
i liked being able to play a girl and to get a cat and i also liked that this was back when you could decently play the game and turn a good ingame profit without the optional help of the sprites all other hm recently ive noticed you need themid rather do the farming myself than pay a stupid lil sprite to do itbut i was sorely disappointed that the marriage system is completely missing from this gameand thats not the worst of itthis is a real time game and after a while either it decides youre not playing enough or the time system just breakseither way unless you play it almost nonstop it will start killing your plants and your livestock will mysteriously hate youits good fun while it lastsbut it doesnt last long enough to even win iti love mortal kombat
i really do
i have always been a huge fan of the franchisebut i am very sorry to saythe mk adventure games sucked
is there anything good to say about this game
no
nothing at allof course
its just as bad as mk mythologies and mk shaolin monks
maybe even a little worse than those two
the gameplay is absolutley awful
it is unplayable
the controls will make you wanna throw the controller through your tv screen
its almost impossible to control jaxlet alone fight
the storyline is about how jax and sonya have to go after kanoor some kind of bullcrap like that
the graphics are eyeaching
just terrible
bad gameplaybad controlsbad storybad graphicsvery very bad game
the konquest modes in mk deception and mk armageddon were more fun and better than thisim ordering this game on super nes on ebay
its only 
i heard it was good so i want it
im also buying ultimate mk and mk annihilation
its only  all together
im so mad that baraka isnt in it
at least kung lao is in it
i like his friendship where he throws his hat like a frisbee
nightwolfs friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers
i like sindels animality
i am so buying this gamefirst of alllet me saythat i am a huge mk fanbut oh my godthis game sucks
this is a terrible version of mkthe fighters move very slowly and it is soooo hard to pull off a single special movelet alone a fatality
the sound is terriblethe music is all muffledalthough the graphics are decentthis game is a komplete letdownif you want a great mk game for the game boypass this piece of krap up and buy mortal kombat ii insteadits a whole lot betteri dont know where to begin
this is like the worst game i have ever played in my life
the graphics suck the gameplay reeks the sound is pathetic and on top of it all the characters are given no respect whatsoever as they are designed badly and their moves dont work the way i them or anyone would want them to
if you like mortal kombatlike i dostick to games like deadly alliance and deception
i mean mortal kombat advance was crummy but it was three times better than this piece of trash
you want the true mk games
do not waste money on an insult to the series such as thisthis is a terrible version of mortal kombat 
the graphics are awfulthe sound and music is ear achingand the gameplay is beyond hideousthis plays just like mk did on the gameboylike total krap
actuallyit may even be worse than mk
avoid this at all costsjust give up this game is so bad i dont how it got a seal of quality
its mk remade
choppy terrible graphics horrible sound moves and everything else
i cant even tell which character im choosing
you can tell they put noo effort into this game at all
if you want a fighting game try street fighter alpha on gbc and stay far away from thisokay is this a april fools joke this game is terrible mortal kombat in d what were they thinking this game is bad really bad mk in d that just puts the other ones to shame
so midway check your mk games before bringing them out because this game just sucks dont even buy it i dont recommend it to any mk fan the controls are terrible so i could go on but theres so much wrong with this game thats why i gave it  starsthis game is not the version i remember
it feels very clunky and the load times are hardly tolerable
try another version for your mk fixi first bought this game in a hastings book store a long time ago and ive been a mk fan for quit some time so i went ahead and bought it thinking this is great
ive got mk trilogy that has all of my favorite characters in it
and midway makes really great games
lol and i managed to find it in a five dollar bin
this is truly a lucky day for me
until i played itthen as time went on i kept it in my basement and then one day i decided to bring it out because i hadnt played it in a while and i forgotten all of the moves
so i went to the options menu and put it on a pansy level so i can get the feel for it again
then i remembered why i put it the basement
what i should have done was bury it in the back yard never to see the light of day againas soon as the first round said fight i might as well thrown in the towel
the game was gracious enough thou to just stand there for two seconds and let me get one shot in even thou i was  dead anyway i mean what the f is the point
i dont even think the skill level even worksthe only way to make it up the ladder without facing brutalities and stage fatalities is if you were to play as kintaro hes your best bet
if you play as motaro you will get your a handed to you literally
pun intended
the ai
actually puts any character to uppercut him and send him flying almost out of view of the screen
but if you were to uppercut the ai
motaro he only staggers cant have him flying into the air oh no that would require fairness in the gamemk has been known for the copy and paste routine on characters and mk trilogy is the crowning achievement of it
the male and female ninjas and if a guy has a bike helmet and armor pads that they bought down over at walmart and calling them cyborg ninjas you know this is a cheap a game
what the hell was this game made off of a  budget
i guess walmart was selling helmets and bike armor pads on a half off saleif the matrix was to take a glitchy h im sure that it would look something like this
i can actually hear my ps one groaning as it loads the next game and that happens every minute
if that ps could talk itd say oh god please get this fing virus out of me
hell i think that a virus would actually improve this game sense theres little it could do to fup an already broken a gamei can see now why it was in five dollar bin but i remember that there was a trash bin next to it and if i knew then before i bought it i would have said hey this is in the wrong bin
its hard to take this gory game seriously if that douche bag dan fordans big fat head keeps popping out saying toasty
i wouldnt be a damn bit surprised if i saw charley sheen popout of the corner and say already got your money dude
and when it says on the back of the game
seven humiliating stage fatalities that sends your opponent plummeting to there embarrassing death
thats you your the opponent
the ai
will make sure of thatas for brutalities who the hell takes the time to flush there life away to memorize twelve different moves just to do one lousy move so a guy explodes
wow
i never seen five skulls and twenty femur bones pop out of a guy a before
apparently ed or one of the designers of this pile of  game doesnt know a damn thing about the human anatomy
its bad enough that you have to remember all the fatalities and trademark moves now thisto sum it upthe game play was awfulthe ai
is cheapglitchy as hellthey copy and paste the characters as they always dothe option menu is uselessthe video resolution looks like it was filmed through a potatothe audio is averageand the story suckedforget waterboarding
forget guantanamo bay
it doesnt even come close to torture compared to this game
s force a terrorist to play this game for  hours strait and hell tell you on how to cure any form of canceri would not recommend this game to anyone unless you want to yell at your tv screen all nightmortal kombat mythologies sucked just as much as the other mk adventure gamesthose being of coursespecial forces and shaolin monksthe storyline in this game is set years and years before the first mk tournament took placei guess you could call it a prequelthe gameplay is absolutley terriblethe controls are very unresponsive and there are way too many cheap hits that you take in this gamemkm mixes both repetive digitized graphic gameplay and awful acting in fmv sequencesas many have saidthis game is extremly difficulthelli had a very hard time beating itwith cheat codesand with it being on very easyall this mostly due to all the cheap hits that you get hit with by different enemiesthere is also puzzle solving as wellmost of which will have you pulling out your hairoverallthis game is crap and you shouldnt waste one dollar on itavoid this and the other two mk adventure titles as wellthis controler stinks
the joystick is messed up and turned at a slight angle so you have to go slightly up and right to go straight up the rubber grips fall off in the first week and worst of all its confusing
i tried programing the buttons because its quotfully programablequot and believe it or not it works
sure you cant train whole sets of commands like moves in fighting games in only replot the buttons but it works
the only problem comes in when you accidently press the clear button with a light in it and all of the sudden none of the buttons perform the x action
then this controller will probably be unplugged and sent to the attic just like mine
enjoyits pretty simple here
ultima games only became worth purchasing beginning with ultima  so you want three games if want oldschool ultima ultima  ultima  serpents isle and ultima  the rest of the titles are just garbage and that they want to charge a fortune for them now is just laughable
is anybody really buying this
and will your pc even play the older titles
and would you even want it to
theyre bad
i mean really really badthis is a nostalgia purchase nothing more
it is to witness the evolution of rpg gaming but definitely not to empty your bank account doing itultima  and ultima  serpents isle are still great fun to play ultima 
a little less so mostly because it is smaller in scope
this is where the baldurs gate series began which eventually spawned the elder scroll games so there is an historical component
still its just not worth this price
i might pay ten bucks or so to play these titles again maybe
yeah maybei used to love playing quake  i played it for hours on end
when i heard about its impending release in  i was stoked and could hardly wait for it to come out
and what did i do when it did
i played it at least  to  days a week from  to early  and guess what
i became freakin sick of it
i do not want to play this game ever again for the rest of my existence on this earth
well at least for  years or so my point is after you log hours and hours of gameplay it starts to get old
fast
quake  may be a legendary game but i warn you dont overindulge
play max payne deus ex or unreal tournament  insteadim a huge final fantasy fan but this aint no ff viibefore you get all jumpy about the five star reviews for this game read this
ive been playing final fantasy games since  on the super nintendo  in japan
at this point ive beaten ivixsome of them up to  times
anyways my point is dont buy this game
if you play all the other final fantasies with their memorable soundtracks developed characters unforgettable plotlines etc and then play this youll wonder what you just payed for
the only thing this game has going for it are the graphics and pointless cinemas
this was one of those games where i would quotpretendquot that something good was going to happenyou know to make me feel like the game was worth playing
nope
the characters are insanely dull and just cant make up their mind
one second squall hates rinoa and the next he quotwants to be with her the rest of his lifequot and all that garbage
love storyyeah right
the soundtrack is nothing that youll remember like the other games and the plot is just soconfusing
i still have no idea what is going on in the last cinema
i mean the game just jumps to places with no explanation or reason
one second im protecting this fishermans town the next im in space and then im going to the future
thats another thing i dont understand
how will killing ultimecia in the future affect the present
more horrible storyline i guess
also ultimecia just comes out of nowhere
she is the quotthird magequot who comes out of nowhere
she says like  lines in the whole game and really isnt evil or spooky
like when i played ff vi and kefka poisoned the kingdom of domathat was a true act of evil among many
also when sephiroth killed aeris in ff vii i at least felt like she needed to be avenged
but ultimecia is just some chick who needs some english lessons
that is allgood gravy this is the absolute worst game that i have ever played in my entire life
not that the game was even that bad but it never lived up to its own hype
i have played all of the final fantasy games since i beat the very first game i have been a loyal follower and a ruthless critic
i cherished iv and i absolutely love vi which is indeed the very best one in the entire series in terms of story and music
and final fantasy vii blew my mind the final fantasy in a whole different perspective with three dimensions on the battlefield
when ffviii came out i already had a copy reserved i held the glowing package in my hands looked at the back of the cover and drooled over the beautiful graphics and in my head i could imagine the enchanting score that my ears would soon be treated to
but as my best friend and i put the disk in and beheld final fantasy viii there was a voice screaming in my head my mind kept saying something to me over and over again as i walked through balamb garden and then my friend said that very thought quotjay this game sucksquot yes it does
this game is a disgrace to the series
a storyline that is so slow so pointless that you actually look forward to the battle sequences
there was no final fantasy viii theme
the battle theme and the boss theme pale in comparison to the vicious relentless music of the ffvii score
there was not one piece of music that ever persuaded me to continue the journey
the disgustingly weak plot was made tolerable only by the cg movies
the character development was never there
never did we ever find out why seifer was such a jerk
or why the gfs ha ha erased the memories of the characters
the lead character squall answered every single question with the word quotwhateverquot compare that to the strongwilled heartbroken cloud from ffvii and it becomes obvious
allow me to say one more thing final fantasy vi gripped me
i captivated me with a spell that bound me
i played played and played that silly game with its cute  bit graphics as if i were possessed
the same goes for vii
i wanted to know what was going to happen next at that moment
i got as far as the mission to timber in ffviii and never gave it a second glance
only a year later after exams were done in college with no car or friends around did i pull final fantasy viii out again to give it a second chance
how sad
the only time i ever cried over a video game was when aeris died in clouds arms but when i first played final fantasy viii i know that i wanted to just bawlgood gravy
what was squaresoft thinking when they made this one
its terrible in almost every aspectfirst of all the battle system involves having to siphon off magic spells from the enemies and grafting them into your abilities
this means that if you use them your skills actually decrease
not only that but because the maximum level your characters can reach is  instead of  youre actually susceptible to the nervewracking level  death spellsecondly the cast is shallow and characterless
the main character is grumpy and unsociable and this reviewer could not relate to him as a player should be able to
also none of the other cast are very memorable like the characters of the other final fantasy gameslastly the story is about as intriguing and deep as a pile of well you get the idea
the story begins all right but then lapses into a nauseating mismatched soap opera between the main character and his rivals ex
not only that but the main characters attitude prevents the gamer from learning what the villain is really after they never give you a deep enough look at herso really if youre a final fantasy fan skip this one
you didnt miss anythingthe game is sow boring the story is not good at all final  is so much beter get that what a poor excuse for a final fantasy game this game should have never came to america
sure the graphics are great but the characters make me sick and the plot seems like it came right from a baby sitters club book
the main character squall is suffereing from teenaged agnst please
oh and the magic system the draw and juctioning system great idea ahahahahahahaha
if you want a good final fantasy get  and  or    and  for those people who think that they know japanese
just stay as far away from this game as you possibly canok i admit if i known how bad this game was i still would have bought the game but i wish i would had waited until the game went down to  before i wasted almost  for it
i hope square makes ff better before they waste millions of dollars on another crap  shootnow for my reasons for the  star
it was a rip off of ff
if you want to get ff  but havent played ff get ff
why no voice acting
i sooooooo recomend it
cmon square at least on the cg moviespease let ff have voice acting
the characters in the game not just the playable  ones but all of them seem to have no life to them its just boring how the characters are so dull i just cant  explain it
rushed rushed rushed and rushed
cmon  square where is this quality gaming i remember from your other stuff like chrono trigger and old classics like that
i dont have anough time to tell you the rest but there  is alot of other stuffcould have been a lot better
to put it simply to perhaps the biggest final fantasy fan everme i was totally diappointed by this game
i hate the whole modernfuturistic look that this game has
even ff had this to a point
i want this to be like fantasycastles swords mages kings knights wizards
i hate that there is no armor or accessories plus i hate that there are no magic points and magic is not earned
the experience points thing stinks
leveling upmoney mean nothin in this game
my favorite part of rpg is building up wrecking machine armies
ergo my sabin celes edgar and terra army from ff
in this game the enemies level up with you so theres no point in leveling yourself up
this game is soooo dumbed down
the villain or lack thereof is horrible
bring back kefka
the gfs take like  years to finish making battles so annoying instead of fun like in ff and chrono cross
the storyline is terrible and the characters are too real looking
plus every character is essentially the same each character does not have unique abilities except for the limit breaks
maybe if square had released this game under a different title not final fantasy  i woulnt have been disappointed
this remains the only ff game ever that i havent finished i stopped playing on disc  if u want a good rpg to play get ff which goes back to hardcore fantasy and the original ways that made final fantasy so great
also i recommend ff which is undoubtable the best ff game ever and arguably the best game ever
i also recommened chrono trigger and chrono cross which are totally awesome games
dont waste your time or money with final fantasy i am the type of rpg gamer who likes to chop heads off burn down castles pillage villages and slay dragons
i dont like to go to macys or talbots and buy a blowdryer so i can fight the next cosmomonster
this one sucks
final fantasy should go back to its roots and deal with a true story like ff ff or ff
the ending was a confused mess good graphics but what were the storywriters for this ending smoking
i am not chauvinistic but this is one chickflick game if there is any
not for headchopping castleburning dragonslaying guys like me
one star for the square title and graphicsif you want yet another dogfight game here it is
if you want a game where you feel as though you are commanding a starship as depicted in the star trek movies you had better pass
cut scenes
wow impressive and  with david warner no less
graphics
none better
neat way to blow stuff  up
oh yea
a great game for those under  with cat like reflexes
no  cunning needed here
however you had better be more practised in an  immelman turn than the corbomite bluff if you want to suceed at this game  and that precisly is the opposite of what is advertisedthis is rapeing the quake name now idget the quake  magic and actually interesting story of quake  back
quake   and  suckabsolutely the worst game in the excellent quakes
this certainly bombed the whole trilogy with its gameplay
what i hate about this game is the nonstop mindless shooting where you dont have to think
getting killed in this game also causes alot of anger because everyone just jumps around you and constantly fires
this game is just like ut bad
utterly bad
i have constantly tried to like it but failed at every attempt
avoid at all costswow look at the pretty engine
there i have said everyhting good about this
i swear progreammers are more interested in pretty than contenet
i would rather play doom than this
quake is all glitz and no depth
where  is the story
where
it left with romero when he went to form ionstormalthough a lot of people liked this game i hated it
for one thing this game was waaaayyyyyy too easy i beat this game in three days playing only   hour a day
the first game had me playing for mounths
youre supposed  to find this fairy to give you all your powers back and yet you start the  game with all your powers
plus i dont care how good the graphics are  rayman does not look good in d and does not belong in d
so get the first  game i dont recomend this game to anyone
and you know whats worse
this nintendo  vertion looks worse and plays worse than the dreamcast  vertion
now thats sad even though i never liked nthis game is civ ii meets dampd its horrible
one of my five least favorite gamesit sure does
old boring hard to play and hard to control
this game is more fun than a sharp stick to the eye but not by much
and the price when it first came out
sheesh
im betting that the only reason some people buy this is laras chest and that doesnt justify purchasing this accident of a gamei played this a lot when it first came out when my computer of the time had win   it was a fun game and still would be to play again
but i cannot play this on my windows xp or  pcs
its full of glitches that are impossible to fix
to play it youd have to skip levels because for instance you get to a point where you cannot make lara jump to a ledge she needs to get to to continue
then you skip a level and this happens again
like i said unplayable unless you maybe had an older compi dont know why the game will start and run but then glitch in the middle of a level and i dont know if there is a fix because ive never seen a game do thisbefore buying this game i strongly recommend downloading the demo off their website first
as a fan of many of the quotgod gamesquot out there i found this one very unintuitive
in short all of the people are  stupid and the game itself does some very dumb thingsfor instance  there are points in the demo where the farmworkers just sit there and drown  as the nile river rises
the question isnt quotwhats causing this  person to just sit therequot the question is quotwhy is this even  occurringquotthats just one example there are many many more
another example
ok i got to a point in the game where half of the  population would just leave
then six months later theyd all return  again just to repeat the same process again and again year after year
does this make any sensei found all the micromanagement to be very  tiring
the object of the game isnt to build an empire its to figure  out all the stupid little workarounds it takes to make these people do what  they should be doing without any thoughtthis is just the demo folks
i strongly suggest you see for yourself before you drop your cash on the  real dealderekif you like clicking banners and advertisements off your screen you will love this game cause thats all it is clicking annoying flyingpopping graphics off your screenwow
i bought this game hoping that blizzard had stopped going half way on their games which is clearly evident in games like starcraft warcraft diablowell i bought this game and it was stupid
this is what i affectionately call a clicker game
you know i left click on youi hit you i right clic on you i do a magic thing
boring
they try to make it interesting with the whole unique character thing but the fact that itll always be the same thing every time you play it doesnt really give you much replay value
also a killer is the mandatory questsyou must complete every quest in order to move on in the already dull plot
if you really want a real rpg buy baldurs gate its cheaper and you get to completely make your character and theres a totally nonlinear plot
do waht you want or dont but be prepared to suffer the consequences
baldurs gate puts you the gamer in control while diablo  you are just kinda along for the ride
diablo  is deffinitely a game for those simpleminded gamers who dont really like the whole variable plot thingthe ones that dont like having a choice where to go or what to do when they want to the ones who just want to click their way to victory
this game gets one star which is many  many more than it deservesat first i thought this game was good
the graphics are not very visually pleasing but the lighting affects were very nice
there were several different characters each with their own abilities and such
but with each waking moment i grew more and more bored and my mouse grew more and more worn out as all i basically had to do was point at something and click like crazy till it was dead not very entertaining
to add insult to injury the monsters i was encountering were pretty much the same old beasts with a new outfit on and maybe a different attack or special abilitysure there are tons of collectable items and blizzard claims that the items you wear change your appearance a halftruth as boots gloves and jewelry do not show up on your character
but you can only do the same thing over and over so much
the games quotquestsquot from what ive encountered are basically you go here kill this boss and come back
sure there may be a few things you need to do like a grab an item from point a an item from point b and put them in point c but the basic premise still standsthe game has its merits they did spend a great deal of time making the full motion video cut scenes beautiful ala squaresoft and there are alot of items and the areas are fairly sizable and the load times are next to nil since the entire game is on your hard drive instead of on the cd like diablo the install process is slow and requires you to swap several disks including one with large movies on it you should have the option of not viewing movies in any game
but the uninstall takes mere seconds
which leads me to believe the game doesnt get fully uninstalled
i also hear the multiplayer is very fun which can make the worst games greatwhat honestly kills the game in my opinion
the constant need to click the mouse in a rapid fasion the alternative is to hold the button down which is just as bad and the repetitiveness which is also a major flaw in phantasy star onlineif mindless clicking is your cup of tea then by all means pick up a copy today
but otherwise save your cashit is point and click
yeah the greatest rpg of all time
it certainly makes you gain weight faster than any other rpg
all my friends have been fattened and dumbed by this marvel in brainwashing
they are all now one with the chair that they sit in
greatest rpg
not even close
those who say it is are probably physically dependant upon it by now
i observe people play with their eyes two inches from the monitor and their mouths slack with saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths
the only thing that moves is the hand making quick convulsive movements
i say that even if it does expand your brain ha ha the other negative effects far outweigh the goodpoint click point click point click
need i say more
incase you missed that it was point click repeat
this game sucks
i doubt the expansion will be any better
i guess if you are twelve and you get your rocks off by having super items and being able to kill anyone in the game then its sorta fun but wheres the challenge
it took me ten minutes to master this game
i cannot say enough bad things about this waste of moneyits unfortunate that you have to buy these cards second hand nowsony will do anything to make you buy newer versions of their psthat have had constant complaints from customersthere are a lot of very good ps  games out thereand you cant play them without the memory cardweite to sony and complainmy best advise is to never buy a memory card online
i couldnt save at all with out it needing to be reformatted each time
i suggest not to buy memory cards onlinenes is the best ever snes was great but n for me had no games that were nearly as memorible
i enjoyed doom  wcwnwo games mk trilogy goldeneye banjo kazooie and thats about it but again nothing really memorible
the grapics were new at the time but look like total garbage now and i have no desire to play the n but i still play nes to this daythanks to nintendos bright idea to make a system and double the graphics from the bit sega saturn and playstation systems we get stuck with one of the worst sytems out there
true sega saturn had lousy d graphics and  bad thirdparty support no one can deniy the fact it had some great games  on it
and i hate playstation but because they shaped their graphics just  right the games somehow came out looking better than n
not only do we  get a really cheesy system they also had to turn many classic d games and  turn them into horrible d games like earthworm jim d zelda donkey kong   kirby rayman  and so much more
plus the controll drove me  bonkers the way they controll it
sometimes the controlls bother me so  much i have to stop playing the game
plus because the games are in  cartriges lousy sound and space because of this they cost a lot  and the games are usally short and dont last more than a couple of hours  before youre finished with the game
and this is from someone who has  loved all their other systems they made
which is why i was crying after i  played this thing i still think once was too painfull at a friends house
complete waste of money
i do not recomend
lets hope the nintendo cube  box turns out better than this piece of trashthis is argubaly the worst system ever
the music is horrible sounding comparing to the beauty of the playstation
there are no good rpg games for  this system
the graphics in most games are nowhere near they could be and  overall a pathetic system
the best game it had was goldeneye  and in my  mind that is the only good game besides perfect dark to appear on the  entire system during its  years on the american marketas a myst fan i looked forward to this game and was sure that since it was so difficult to find in my local store that it must have been great
boy was i wrong
i played through and found that the puzzles were pretty difficult simply because were totally unrelated to each other and the rest of the game in general
running a pii  mhz machine the game gave me no problems and the graphics ran fine
i am not an extremely picky gamer and with a bit of a plot this game could have been tolerable
 after playing this game i have yet to see any of the stunning d graphics and animation as movement causes the graphics to merge with an extremely grainy texture
in fact the landscapes were poorly rendered and did not impress me one bit
if this game was released about five or six years ago i might have been satisfied but since then ive seen and played a lot of games both good and bad
control is lousy because there are only a few selected paths on which you can travel
i should be thankful i only paid  for this otherwise i would be extremely unhappy
note the only reason i gave this game one star is because amazon wouldnt allow me to give it zero starsokay maybe not
but its the secondworst ive ever played entombed a  game so awful that amazon doesnt even have it having worse graphics and even more nonsensical puzzlesstory weakwho is ozgar
who are the arkonians
why do they hate each other
why does ozgar hate you
is ozgar really darth vader or does he just act like itthese questions alas shall go unanswered
i dont think im willing to buy the second game to see if therere any new revelationsgraphics mediocream i unique in not liking when when the resolution is better during movement cutscenes than when youre standing still
i dont think so
wave that picture around i need to get a good look at it
puzzles whatmuch too simple and uninventive
what is all this stuff and whats it for
if i can figure out a code simply by trying random combinations its too simpleendingyou get one screenshot
it doesnt even move
thats your reward for slogging through this awful gamereplay value whyif youre really bored and i mean really bored  maybe you might see how fast you can run through it or something
but only if your friends are all sick your internet connection is down and youve played all the minesweeper you can standverdict stay away
stay far away
play myst
its betterrayman  requires a more sophisticated video card than my year old computer hasalthough ive never had problems with any other program but when i emailed the technical support address several times to try to work out the problem i received no response
my stepdaughter tried to get it to run on her even newer computer but found it froze up every time
disappointed and dissatisfiednow let me tell you straight that rayman is one of the best games i have  ever played
with wonderous worlds challenging levels and memorable  charicters make it a game to be hold
that where rayman  comes in
gone  are all the great stuff i mentioned above clearly a fatele mistake on ubi  softs part
we have none of the returning cast except for rayman of  course choppy d graphics a lot of the graphics look like they were  painted on the game and very little challenge makes this a tradgity
ive had this game for little over three days and have unlocked all the  secrets and beat the game
the first had me playing for months
and  when i was finished with it i shed a tear of joy and said quotnow that  was a gamequot  im still wondering how this can be called a sequal  its terrible
im truly offended by this game
all those who praise this  game have probibly never played the first game
i beg of all those who  read this reveiw please play the first game first to see what rayman truly  has to offer you
this game is just a wasted game
i hope ubi soft wises  up with rayman  or ill just have to shelf the game as quota game that  got killed when turned to dquot  boo hoofirst let me start by saying i have nothing against this game
it is a classic and i recommend it to anyone who loves video games
i gave it one star because of the computer compatibilityif you have anything above windows me or maybe even xp do not buy this game
it will not even start on your computer
if you want to play rayman  go to gogcom and buy it for a few bucks
they make their games compatible with newer operating systemsget it through your head this game stinks first of all the graphics suckboring gameplayi usually like realistic military games coudnt acess campaign takes forever to installi would give this game  stars
i just bought it about  hour ago played it for  min
and then got bored try the unreal series  half life or rainbow i bought this game at a fairly low price and when i started playing i was totally amazed  at the incredibly bad graphicsthe game featured a basic hud with two annoyingly large bars placed above and below it
that was the first thing i noticed
next i saw that the terrain was sort of fuzzy and my gun wasnt all that impressive eitherquotokquot i said to myself
quotwhy dont i try walking around and see if this gets any betterquot so i did
guess what
no gun sway
every stinkin fps game ive every seen had some sort of movement with the gun ok maybe not wolfenstein d but still
so anyway i tried firing the gun  barely any recoil at all
i tried a pistol just to see if the hammer would pull back but it did notanywayz terrible graphics  boring game
enough saidi own this game
i have gotten a  star rating once but it is dumb because if you run out of money and go into debt you cant get your money back or build anything
the people get impatient and stressed out and then they start taking your money away
i would recommend that you buy spider man or the spider man movie game instead of this annoying game that never endslooking past the buggy engine and gameplay the game is incredibly inconstant with previous ultima games and itself
the avatar has to haswhat a paladin isthis is just ea squeezing the last bit of promise from this gameone of the avatars companions sir duprefor  gameswas a paladin and he sacrificed himself in the stead of the avatar in ultima  that one line of dialog killed the game for medont waste your money and get one of the better ultima gamesit is really a shame that this game was never updated for windows xp
you can run most of the features but the practice shooting range no longer works and this is an important feature
you need to practice to do well in solving the puzzles
i wrote to them a while back but they showed no interest in providing a fix
i guess they made their money and dont carethe controls are hard to use its almost imposible to order your units to attack enemy units because they move to fast
the d graphics are terrible and the sound is mediocre
the game says you can play multiplayer on k or better but you realy need dsl or something
the so called tricorder is imposible to use
the missions are way to hard and you can only save at the end of your mission so youle end up playing for hours trying to finish
if you want good d strategy dont look heremy god if this is a game it needs to be called destruction derby because of all the crashes
my computer is waaaaaaaay above minimun specs for this game and i experience crash after crash
the fact that there is no in game save option really stinks also because you have to start the mission over after your game crashes
the only reason this game got a star was because the graphics and movies are cool but as far as game play and interface it stinks
the game isnt hard its just time consuming and gets really frustrating when you have to restart you computer every half an hour or so because of the crashes
dont ask interplay if you there will be a patch out soon either they wont respond lately they have just been shoving games out on the market half finished and then not providing help to the customers who bought the games
i know im not the only person experiencing these problems because i bought the game with three other people and they have them also and feel the same as i do
quite frankly this is the last game i will ever purchase from themas im unable to fully review this game let me just say the game is not compatible with win xp
if you are lucky or foolish enough to still be running win  then you may be able to get the game to loadim giving  star because this is one of the cheapest packages i have ever bought it looks like a pirated copy
no wait a pirated copy would look better
all the disks came in a single case onve over the other which caused scratches in almost all of themoh and all the cool covers on the disks
horrible black and white labelsi regret buying thisokay here it is in a nutshell
the graphics bite and bite hard
the spell component system is so difficult that playing hack and slash by default is much more preferable
and there is little if any help by the  gms
my two cents
buy at your own riskthis game should have never been released in its current state
its load times are unacceptable
both games feel like chores playing because of how long everything takes due to very poor emulation
squaresoft wanted to make as much money as they could with the game without having to spend any money to hire someone who could make the game work properly with the ps
this is an extremely bad port of ff and ff
ff freezes very often when you try to save
also its load times are long
not to mention this is the original translation of the game so be prepared to have a certain character talk like a drunken brain damaged pirate the entire game
ff just butchers the english language
ff is the same as it was on snes except for extremely long load times
it becomes a chore trying to open the menu to heal your character or whatever
the long load times really take away from the games and just makes the whole thing a bad experience
stick to the snes or get these games on gameboy advance
also ff is exactly the same on psn as it was in anthology
long long load times as well as being incompatible with your ps half the time
shame on you square soft shamei dont like this game
it is terrible
terrible graphics and the fact that you cant use the joystick makes it harder to play
this is the worst james bond game ive ever played
im returning itwhen i was taking this game to the checkout line i anticipated a great classic on par with f zero x but what i got was a complete waste of moneytalk about a disaster this game was just like one huge train wrecknot fun at all and the graphics are some of the ugliest most bland landscapes ive ever seenthis game is an insult to the ninstead get ocarina of timeperfect darksuper smash bros or f zero xpass on thiswould have a good review if the developers spent more than five minutes slapping this together
by the second or third time through the questions were already repeating themselves  awful
plus multiplayer is just a quotfastestfingerquot question to determine who plays solo
big dealthe worst part is the game only runs about two or three times before it crashes on startup
this is on an intel pc with namebrand components no cheap swapmeet stuff
the only solution has been to uninstall and reinstall the game
a visit to the disney interactive site for tech support umm where is it
because of this i cant recommend anyone purchase this gametheyve come out with a second edition of this game wow so quick
perhaps this version workswhen millionaire first was on in the summer of  i was thoroughly addicted
this was novel new television
now of course its repetitive and boring but for a while there was really a spark therethe computer game however always it hogged memory was hard to control and wasnt very much fun
its sad but the online free version at abccom was a lot more fun
i generally dont like games where theres no flexibility and very little fun so if youre like me and i would hope so
 avoid this oneman i never knew phil regis could be this annoying
since some of the first few questions are ludicrously hard which is totally unlike the show and it gives you  seconds to answer the question which is also  totally unlike the show i have to restart the game a lot which means i  hear phil regis a lot
a quotskipquot button shouldve been put into  the game
i havent recieved any repeat questions after about  months of  owning the game
how
i uninstalled it after  minutes and never played  it again
trust me youd get more fun out of an electronic whoopee  cushion than this gameand its  cheaperi am  years old
this is my first review out of about  that is a star review
and i have  give or take a few reasons why i hate this game so much after the first game the questions started repeating
the game is basically the same  questions over and over again
you cant skip the introduction
i know its not too long but youd think that with todays technology thered be an option to skip it
regis is appallingly rude
once i won nothing and he said quotwelll there you go
dont spend it all in one place
in fact dont spend it at all
put it in the bank
in  years maybe youll be able to afford a marble or somethingquot once a  question appeared later as a  question
um thats not good
the questions from  to  are too difficult compared to the show
for example the show had a  question that was quothow many legs does a spider havequot but the game had a  question that was quotwhat kind of object is a ginsuquot once again regis is appallingly rude
once i won  and he said quotnot bad but at least you shouldve known the last one
come on
or at least you shouldve guessed betterquot regis only says quotis that your final answerquot whenever he wants to
most of the time your first answer is your final answer even if you happened to hit the wrong button by mistake
theres a ridiculous time limit of  seconds per question
ive seen people on the show take as long as  minutes
the fastest finger mode is a joke
youre supposed to hit a letter key when you think the four answers are in the correct sequence
you dont actually put them in order
regis is appallingly impatient
if you take too long on certain things like the fastest finger mode or saying how many contestants will play hell say quotthis game is over
im outta herequot and the game quits on you
yep youre back to windows
and guess what
once you load it back up again
youll have to sit through the introduction again
theres a general lack of options
when you hit the escape key you bring up the option menu and you have these options volume up volume down resume start over quit
theres no way to make the questions easier or harder and theres no way to skip the introduction
speaking of which when you select start over the whole program starts over
yep youll have to sit through the introduction again
once again regis is appallingly impatient
if you take too long to write your name regis will say quotcome on its not a big dealquot or quotthis isnt a trick question whats your namequot if you take too long hell type whatever he wants eg
kathie lee gifford when you use the phoneafriend lifeline regis calls one of his friends and they start chatting a little before they get to the question
then hell say to his friend quotive got a question for youquot as if youre not even there
i mean come on its your lifeline not regiss
whats wrong with having an option to use the mouse
when you say quotyesquot to the instructions regis only gives them to you once
this is especially annoying in the fastest finger mode in which youre pretty much doomed to load the game up again once it quits
did i mention that regis is appallingly rude and impatientwell there you have it
this review pretty much goes to all the games in this series  the makers were kind enough to make more than one edition of this trash
one of the few redeeming qualities of this game is the cd has pretty art on one side
that way the cd makes a colorful if fragile frisbee
aside from quottreasure mathstormquot and all the other quotgamesquot in that series this is the lamest excuse for a game i have ever played
and that is my final answerthis is the most meager cashin attempt ive ever seen
there may well be hundreds of questions but itll take you a thousand games to see them all
i was receiving a couple or three repeat questions by the fifth game and a  majority of repeats by game  there seems to be little or no gradual  increase in difficulty which was proven when i saw a  question later  repeated as a  question later in the gamean example of the  games inadequacy runs thusly i am cruising through the game easily until  the 
fine by now im expecting them to be tough
i use the   then the call a friend who says she is  certain the answer is a
just  to be sure i use the audience poll as well
guess what  say that a  is their choice
well now im convinced and go with a as well
im  wrong its b
that is just stupid beyond measure
if they wanted to  throw me off make the audience rating more like  or  somethingnice graphics nice sounds atrocious game mechanics
wait for  the improved version or play it on the netbelieve me i would give this game zero stars if amazoncom allowed mei received this for christmas as a gift and let me tell you
this is possibly the worst piece of garbage put on the market
i mean the questions run out fast leaving the game to replay old questions which are easy once you get to know them which means the replay value isnt very high
if you want a fun game try the sims or delta force landwarrior
your time would be better spent with those games i have to admit that i never was a victim of the quottomb raider hype machinequot
i liked the idea of a rd person perspective game where your character can do alot of tricks but the whole idea of the bigboobed lara croft just turned me off
i bought this for  bucks at the used software house and played it for about  hours
i liked the save game feature somewhat it should be more specific
i felt like banging my head against a wall after be killed for the th time because i didnt hit the quotjumpquot button in the right sequence with the quotrunquot button at the correct prescribed time
the interface is just too rigid for a game like this it reminded me alot of that old quotdragons lairquot game
and i got real tired of the stupid puzzles
i think the real reason for tr being so popular is that its the first nonadult game with a overlyendowed female protagonist
it cant be because of the gameplayi heard this game is crap
i have it for nes and its cool
but this is weird
why would they make a stupid easy game for gba
why wont they let you play as the cool people like baraka
you stubborn retards can make a better choice of system and game then thiswell here it is guys the worst mortal kombat game of alltime
yup the honor goes to the game boy version of mortal kombat iii bought this game when it first came out because i was stupidly riding on the success of the mortal kombat series at the time
i was very naive all my friends were right
time hasnt been kind to this game but who am i kidding
time wasnt kind to this game the day it came out because it was an absolute piece of plastic trash then and its trash now
it will forever remain trash
its so trashy the trashman wont even take it
he says it stinks too much and its not worth the risk of potentially sniffing the horrible odor just to put the game in the back of his truck
even if he were to wear the thickest pair of gloves in the world he doesnt want to risk the smell remaining on his skin permanentlyso why am i bashing the game so hard
because you get fewer fighters fewer levels horrible black and white graphics and the worst part an extremely slow framerate
the blood doesnt even exist
okay theres blood but watching it on a hardtosee black and white screen would you even call that blood
no you wouldnt and shouldnti would rather have a job being a janitor in an elementary school and having to clean up barf on the cafeteria floors every day than play the game boy version of mortal kombat ii ever again
its really that bad
at least then you can swirl the puke around with a mop and have some funfor the love of god and all his wonderful adorable earthly creatures do not buy this game
just when i thought the mortal kombat series couldnt get any crappier it happenedi only payed  for this game at a used game shop
i was very mad when i got home because it wasnt even worth 
there is nothing good about the game
the graphics such even for the sega genesis
the sound is the worst
the controls are sloppy
the gameplay sucks so bad you wouldnt believe it
dont but this game even if youre a batman fan
stay away from this gamethis is just too bad
for such a cool character batman has had some bad luck with video games
this is probably the worst and thats saying a lot
this game is no fun did you see the one star
and is not worth anyones timegod was this game awful
i played this game a while back and i got frustrated with the controls
one of the biggest gripes i had with this game was how the fighting resembled mortal kombats style
then again it was made by acclaim the same company that did the mortal kombat games
batman performs leg sweeps back kicks and even uppercuts just like mk
this fighting style doesnt belong in this game
it just slows things down
youll also have trouble navigating through the levels as the foreground will block your eyesight which makes seeing what youre doing a hassle
if youre a batman fan youll be disappointed with this game
neither version of this game is good
stay away from gulps batman foreverthis game is a jokethe graphics are pretty coolbecause they are digitizedbut other than thatthe game totally blows
batman is just some fat guy dressed up in a batman costumeand the guy playing robinlooks like he made up his costumeout of cheap used clothes that he bought from a thrift storethe sound is awfulthe game plays like a mortal kombat ripoffits just a bad gameif you wanna get a really good batman game for genesispick up the original batmanbased on the tim burton movie from and just stay away from this waste of timebatman forever was a game that wasnt even worth spending money on buying it those pour kids parents paid  bucks when it just came out and when they took it home to play it i bet you they said they spent all that money and it sucked this game was worse then atari s et
and that was the worst game ever made so you ever gave this game  stars i mean i like mortal kombat to but this game should be thrown in the trash with all the other garbage because it gave batman a bad reputationwhen i was a kid i thought this was fun but i played it lately this is so boring and dullthis game sucked big time you couldnt do nothing in it when you wanted to and was so hard you died after th first few shots and i was using a game genie for this game the first terminator game was betterthis is the version of mortal kombat  that you should definitely avoid
this game was horrible and it makes the super nintendo version look like a good game in comparison
the graphics are awful the music is annoying here the controls are bad and unless you have a  button controller for the sega genesis you cant do much of anything
this is a major dissapointment to those that have this game on genesis
avoid this version at all costs
this is a complete waste of time
this version just ruins this somewhat decent sequelthis game seems like it was thrown together to keep as much speed as possible
back in the early s genesis was the blistering fast system
as per the sega gargon
truth is it was slghtly faster then snes but couldnt handle the colors
so now was know why they left over half the colors of the orginial
now we are stock with this thing
they kept most of the moves and all the colors but doesnt have any intro or ending animation which means it looks half done
before you defend this game think of this
super street fighter looked great but they they just didnt take the time porting this game
and much like mortal kombat it looks drab choppy and well peiced togetheron the other hand if you are a collector and you want a pr port check out x
it is one of the best ports out there
this is one of the most ported games of all time and the genesis is one of the ones to try to see how much they took out and how bad it waslooks and plays nothing like pc or arcade version and the moves are too complicated
get mk instead
terriblei hated it and im an rpg fan
maybe i should of gave it more of a chance but the controls felt clunky and whilst trying to get to the next locale i would get shot down in flamesbut i also have terrible reflexes so and little to no patience for slow text which this also hasi remember burrowing this from a friend because i ran out of n games to play so i burrowed this and some other games for a few days
i have to say it was fun at first than it became frustrating and than i felt like i was going to throw up because of the weird controls and this and that moving around in weird places which i didnt intended in doing
it was also because i was really young then and i really didnt know what the game was really about which is puzzle solving sometimesi advise not buying the game instead tell your friend to buy it because its the best game ever and take it from him when he wants to throw it out
of course youll lose a friend but well worth it
game  friendship
im just playing kidsi wish they would make a gamecube sidescrolling donkey kong effort like the snes games just make the graphics better retain the music quality and make more levels and longer
they included some lovely old games like the original donkey kong arcade game and a spaceman game for computer
there are big worlds but that seems just about it
theres a lot of collecting but the problemsolving is no fun
this series became really removed from its huge snes appeali bought dk when it first came out in  and from the moment i started to play it i did not like it at all
it is way too complicated and difficult to play and i would not recommend this game
every time i tried to play it i just kept getting frustrated and i had to stop playing it
instead i would recommend banjokazooie or mario donkey kong is a stupid game the charaters are monkeys for the love of god monkeysthis game does not have a story line do not try this gamei borrowed this game from a friend
i played for half an hour then got bored
im glad i didnt pay money for it
its pretty much just banjokazooiewhich i also didnt like
i was upset especially when i got to the first door requiring gold bananas
why couldnt they have just put out another banjokazooie game and make an original donkey kong game for the nbanjokazooie was fun until the difficulty spiked out of nowhere
also the idea of making a cartoonish adventure somewhat nonlinear is poorly executed in iti didnt play far enough to see if donkey kong corrected any of this but it looks like it didnt
it just changed the setting from running around inside of a mountain to running around inside of islands
greatif you liked banjokazooie im sure youll love this
if not definitely skip donkey kongmischief makerswhat does make you think ofteenagers who get bored and break stufffirecrackerspractical jokesprankshow aboutnone of the abovehow about some crap that looks like it belongs on the original atarino mischiefjust a very poorly animated and quite bright super mario bros rip offsave your money a buy a box a paper clipsyoull have more funthis game was much more entertaining in its time
i bought it a while ago played it for  minutes then never touched it againwargods is a much better game made by the same people for the n
this game is somewhat glitchy and straining
save your money
buy a better mortal kombat game for a newer system
not worth havingblends  mortal kombats in one not the first three games that i expected
game play was lame
not for beginners very hardthis game is so stupid i dont understand why people like it
there is no real fun in it
for one thing you cant jump wich is dumb
and the attack moves are really duel
it sucks
do not buy this gameif by any chance you liked this game then check out all of the other bomberman gamesi bought this game way back when the n was in its heyday
i thought it wasnt very good and traded it in
now i see somebody is trying to sell it for 
if anybody is considering buying quest  at this ridiculous price i urge them to think twice
there are plenty of far far better games for your money
i know there werent that many rpgs for the n but that doesnt make this game a classic imho
youd be better off looking for some of the excellent snes rpgs like ff ii and iii or legend of zelda a link to the pastmario kart  will always be the best
i dont consider myself fully biased though
this game really is that badwhat can i say this game was dumb
its just a copycat of mario kart  and mario kart  has freakin fun
diddy kong racing is a joke
i would have rated it as  stars but unfortunately i dont have that option
if you want to give someone a hate gift i recommend this
but dont blame me if they surprisingly love itthe graphics is pretty good on this game but the game play sucks
its not worth your moneyanother lousey boring basketball game
where do they come up with these games
this game was stupidwhat a joke this game is worthless
i wouldnt have taken this game if it had been for free let alone  dollarsthis game sucks big time
it was boring and stupidi rented this game once thinking it might be a cool rpg puzzle solving
boy was i wrong
this game is very boring and has no real point
it is extremely hard to maneuver your character without a demon jumping on your back or your character falling to his death
i gave up after the first level
whatever you dodo not buy this gamethis review is hard to write because i am so mad that i wasted my money on this game
oh whoopie you can play as zero the fighter butt zero is how much i shouldve payed for this game
there isnt one thing about this game that i like
the story is bad and the fight and graphics are absolutely awful
if you want a real game dont waste your money on this
dont even rent this game
this game is so bad it make pong look goodit says it is in good condition but lots of scratches does not even work never played it  dont buyive heard about this game rainbow six for years
ive always been curious about it but i havent played it till recently
i must be missing something because for some reason i did not enjoy this game very muchone thing ive always heard about tom clancy games from players is they are so realistic
the realism is rainbow six is partly what drags the game down
everything is caught up in trying to be as real as possible that for me at least it sucked the fun right out of the game
the premise of the game is that you are leading an antiterrorist group called rainbow made up of the top special forces operatives in the world
but from the outset the game is bogged down in tedious details
mission planning is unncessarily over complicated
i spent maybe an hour planning a mission that my team was wiped on in under  minutes
it seems that three quarters of the game is spent in the planning stage
selecting team members equipment weapons mapping a mission plan all seem more important that actually performing the mission
this led me to bouts of oh come on
i just want to play the game
the online play doesnt fair much better either im sorry to say
the average online game is about  seconds in length and i was frequently shot in the back after the first  seconds
after which i was relegated to watching the other online players
also the problem of veteran players racking up stats for some game leagues by preying on lesser skilled players is rampant
unfortunatley theres not much that can be done about thatthe controls fair no better
the control scheme is complex to the point of frustration
other teams just stand there waiting for you to give them go codes
but they are more like ducks in a shooting gallery
being picked off one by one till you are the only player left
there is an option to remap the keyboard controls but that unfortunatly doesnt make things any easierthe graphics look a bit dated but the game ran very smoothley on my computerrainbow six is a game that has a really good idea but falls horribley short in its execution
its needlessly complex and overly tedious
if you are a playstation  owner id recomend socom us navy seals over rainbow six
for pc i would recomend operation flashpoint
both are alot more playable and more enjoyablethis was the most boring game ive ever bought
dont let the description of multiple games with multiple characters fool you
its one game that you go through with various times with different characters
the valiant  effort of a very nonlinear storyline was marred by the fact that it was so  nonlinear that the stories were often left being incoherent
its tedious  going through the same miniquests over and over
most of the characters  could have been a good choice to have their own full gamethis was a  good idea playing through multiple games where you meet up with past  characters that you played but the games needs a huge overhaul in order to  give it more varietyif you have a lot of time to kill and are very  easily amused and find this game for very cheap give it a whirl
otherwise find a decent game or play final fantasy vii for the th time
it will be much more interestingso i bought this game and when i recieved it it was tucked away in a paper envelope just the disk and nothing elseand lo and behold when i take it out it has a huge crack in it making it unplayable so not only did i have to pay for an unplayable copy of it i had to pay for a brand new copy of it at 
i might review the game when i actually play it but dont buy it without a case make sure when you order it it comes in some kind of protective casing not just a disk in a sleeveactual game review duke is still the man even todayscore  out of ok the only dn game i ever played fully was duke nukem zero hour so i decided to try antoher one and ttk seemed like a great choice since it resembled zero hourand its just as awesome the weapons are amazing with my personal favorite being the shotgun and the level design is fun and not to repetitive
graphics wise its not that bad but its a ps game from  but graphics dont make the game look at metal gear or resident evil and duke nukem is just as fun as those two
if youre an action game fan a duke nukem fan or just want pure action big explosions bigger guns and duke with an even bigger ego check this game outas the other reviews have stated this is a very boring game
you are batman or robin set out to save gotham from the riddler and twoface
an interesting thing to this game is that the buttons are set up like mortal kombat high punch low punch up to jump and select to use your grappling hook
when you start each level you make a choice of two extra weapons like smoke bombs gas guns and baterangs
theres not much to the game you move straight through on a set side scrolling platform path beating up bad guys
the graphics are pretty amazing being that the game is so much like mortal kombat so are the graphicsplease do not make the same mistake i did buying this game
the game play is terrible graphics are bad and there are tons of the gliches
i tried to resell and its worth  cents
enough saiddoesnt match the pic and i dont remember any mention of this by the seller again european version
im sure it would work on a european sneswhy do i rate this game  star
there are several reasons
first and foremost there is no savepoint
in short youll have to beat this game in one sitting
talk about patience
the second major problem that i have with this game is that it is trying to do too much
it is a topdown shooter and a firstperson shooter
the graphics in the topdown mode are fine but the graphics and textures in fp mode are dreadful
doom has far better variety texturewise
personally i got headaches after playing in fp mode after  minutesand remember you cant save
so the bottom line is this if you want to kill dinosaurs id recommend jurassic park for the old nes and the carnivores series for pc
n has a turok the dinosaur hunter series out
pass this game youll be glad you didthe game came in and had another persons name in white out on it and didnt even work
waist of my cashplease dont get extremist on me but i dont really like this game
its overrated and i will stick to the first legend of zelda thats way better than this
newer zelda games are not my thingpeople say this game is great
to what extent
its great horrendousness
if that is the case then yes
this game is so hard and cant be beat unless cheated after world  the game is impossible
just stick with sonic on sega genesis
the graphics look like the nes even genesis is better
just dont waste time with a snes console or gamesthis is one of the most overrated games of the mario series
first of all its extremely difficult and frustrating
theres always been a problem with mario games concerning the controls theyre slippery and not responsive enough for the difficulty of the game
also the fact that the only attack mario can do is jump on his enemies at least in this game which isnt enough arsenal for the amount of enemies that are set against you at one time armies of them
i know people who have been stuck on the same level for years and it makes me wonder why people bother with this gameanother dire problem is the process of saving your game
the game only lets you save at designated points instead of saving at the completion of each level which again makes this game seem frustrating when you complete a substantial amount of the game and suddenly die and get sent back five to eight levels for losing all your livesi wouldve given the game  stars for the graphics alone which look somewhat advanced for  but there are so many games from the  bit era that surpassed it that im going to ignore the graphics in this review because they simply dont make up for its lack of detail and intuitiveness in everything else
in comparison to donkey kong country and sonic the hedgehog  this game is dwarfed for its graphics
another reason to overlook the graphics is the blending of levels in which the same type of level looks nearly identical to every level of its kindand lets not forget the overrated soundtrack
the music is dull repetitive and juvenile and not in good way
its not uncommon to hear the same music being played for three or more consecutive levels which is  ridiculous because they didnt even do this on the nesnow dont get me wrong im a casual nintendo fan who immensely enjoyed other games on the super nintendo and nintendo games on newer consoles super mario world isnt one of them because its frustrating and it sucksok
ill put it out right now and bring the big gunscombined couldnt even compete with the hint of mint of this gamezoop was terrible
it was supposed to be the new tetris and it turned out to be the new garbage of the day
zoop was everywhere
it was in every magazine every commercial and every home system yet the game still flopped because of its horrid gameplayyou were a little triangle
your job match colors and shapes before a row of colors touches you  oh by the way thats all there is to this game
how fun rightof course not
zoop was the biggest hype and also the biggest flop ever or atleast that i can personally think of off hand
honestly it wasnt even worth playing
if you wanted to get frustrated all night long playing a game then all you needed to do was pop in zoop and then you could be angry all night longdo not play buy or even look at a screen shot of zoop
itll destroy your brain and erase all of your known gaming abilities for other games
avoid itthis was a fad where they were hoping to be the next tetris and they came out on every system and every platform people were hooked on matching colors of triangles with squares then the people playing this game got bored of it and it was never heard from again
the point is that you must select a triangle from the middle of the screen and point it toward an isle of squares and shoot it off to destroy the squares
if too many squares get lined up you loseits boring you play a triangle trying to poke balls into a squarein this game all you do is line up the colors and clear blocks using the color you a triangle have at the current time
if the blocks get to the square you are in the game ends
another thing that gets me is that this game lacks a player mode
do not even bother with this gamei had a friend who used to come over and make fun of me for owning killer instinct
hed constantly ask me when are you going to get rid of this crappy game
and id tell him oh eventually
but it took until  when the game didnt sell at a yard sale that i ended up throwing it in the trashbin 
that is when i got rid of it for goodthe fighting in killer instinct is even worse than in mortal kombat and i didnt think it was possible to defeat mortal kombat in sheer crappiness
the one thing killer instinct does better than mk is the combo system
its easier and more enjoyable to unleash combos to your opponent in this game
unfortunately just like mortal kombat the fighting system is severely dated and useless by todays standards
unless you like your fighting games to be in slowmotion along with neverending choppy graphics with badlooking fatalities included for additional pain pain that you feel you should never ever think about buying this game
just another super nes fighting game i hope people cant rememberhes a basketball player yet shaquille oneal made it so big with his basketball career that he thought that he could expose his name in the mid sshaq dieselanyone
that was hilarious
now look what shaq came up with a fighting game
just by having the biggest name on the front of the cover tells enough what the quality of this game really comes out tothe video game consists of bad punchline dialog before the fights a plot thats just predictable and stupid lame graphics and controls that are so agonizing to handle that its just completely pointlessthis game was voted one of the worst fighting games for a reason
no need to waste your time on this when there are far superior games released on the snes with much better plots and controlsthis was the worst fighting game on the snes system
even worse than the home version of snks art of fighting and fighters history
the game is not only stupid its easy and the characters are really lamegranted yes this game was released when shaquille was really really big in the mainstream but after this game notice how things started to go bad for him
after all he did kazaam
but anyway the controls are bad the graphics are bad fights are really predictable ex you know what the computer is going to do and all in all not a fun gameseriously snes had all of the better fighting games so im sure you could find one that you like because there are several to choose from
for instance street fighter ii series new challengers hyper etc mortal kombat ii and ultimate mortal kombat fatal fury  special and even ballz
skip shaq fu its a waste of your timelegendary basketball player shaquille oneil is in tokyo as he goes into a chinese store where an old man whisks you away into another dimension where you must combat enemies like a catlady a mummy and other baddiesone of the worst games of all time
this game is a complete disaster that i remembered thinking the game has an odd yet wacky concept as it has to be fun and rented it from one of my local video stores
the music is ok and the graphics are cartoony but this game has lousy controls that feel like they have been busted you keep getting killed without a fair chanceno wonder this has been a waste of rental money for those that rented it in fact there is a site that is dedicated to destroying this horrible abomination of a game
its as bad as dr jekyll and mr hyde xmen for nes and et
for atariyes cause hes fking you over rather ya like it or not
the controlls are not very good but you know this is a bad game when your storyline is i stumbled upon a dojo an old man says fight for me this was made when shaq was with the magic so the old man says you are the magic  so you fight a cat huminoid a boogger sheets a dude from aku locka polkistan a chick who uses voodoo guess what her name is voodoo beast and the boss sett ra a boss so stupid he would even be passable for a killer instinct character
m bison and shao khan were better bosses cheap but beatable and your attacks are difficult to pull off but everybody attacks you and there specials are more powerful this would have been a decent arcade game but but play it for  player mode and the bad  liners at the end of everty fight
good game if you need a good laughit all happens as soon as you read the title the acid in your stomache just churns upshaq fu was one of those gaming horrors of the s that should have never been just like his awful awful movie careeri feel like my intelligence decreased after playing it but back then i was but a mere child and i loved fighting games as well as rpgs
as such i was easily sucked into playing any fighter that rolled out of a factory thank god i had only rented this mediocre titlethe graphics were pretty good ill admit but then there was shaq to remind me that i was playing an absolute piece of crap
the characters clobber each other with puns before a battle ensues oh dear god
after your brain is crushed from the weight of sheer bad humor the fight starts
at this point you take a deep breath and think well at least thats over
that is if you havent gotten to the point where your thinking 
and believe me ill understand if you haveif youve lasted this long theni pity your soul
anyways the fight starts and its incredibly easyto the point that enjoyment is null and the fact that your playing shaq fu doesnt help cure that sudden acid reflux problem either
i beat it in about  minutes yawn or was it urk i forgoti beg of anyone thats even considering buying this or god forbid even playing this please
your not missing a thing in fact youll thank me and anyone else that has a similar opinion on the matter
playing a great d fighter like samurai showdown or street fighter ii is far better than having prematurely gray hair and vomit all over your favorite shirt and being mentally scarredif you own this game theres an easy cure
either melt it in a fire or throw it in the sea or anything that makes it dissapear from existance please dont sell this game to anyone
its an insult that this game was even madenext to sega cd the worst version of doom
the graphics suck and you can barely tell what anything is the sound is decent the one star the controls are horrid the gameplay is horrid and the shores of hell freezes up on start so all you really have is a butchered port of knee deep  inferno with horrid controls
terriblefirst of all here are the pros and consprosgood for the people who own a snes not pcconsreally bad graphicsslower animation than pcyou cant save the gameit is shorter than the pc version of doomoverall this is a pretty good game but not for snesget it on pc
that version is alot betternot that this game is bad but it is hard to play on console because pc makes everything so much easier for games like this
i would recommend playing this game but on the pc not the snes
 stars for this onetrust me the super nes version of super wrestlemania is awful in every sense of the word
the way the wrestlers very slowly walk across the screen just to deliver a simple generic wrestling move to your opponent because the game company didnt give any of the wrestlers many moves to work with is worse than any kind of pain you can imaginei cant believe anyone would consider buying this game unless they had personal childhood memories attached to it and they were buying it back after giving it away or something
the one thing it has going for it is the selection of legendary wrestlers
once you select one of those wrestlers and actually play the game youre in for a nasty snailpace surprise
so bad so boring so forgettablewell i guess the title for this review should essentially sum up the game
this game featured some of the greatest names in pro wrestling in the late s and early s
hulk hogan randy savage shawn michaels the undertaker hawk and animal the legion of doom earthquake and typhoon the natural disasters the million dollar man ted dibiase and sid justice make up quite an impressive roster for a wrestling game made during that era
i will concede that bret the hitaman hart not being in the game is kind of a snub but it does not matter since the game is lousythere is the typical oneonone matchup as well as tag team matchup and even a survivor series elimination match
but the biggest flaw is the fact that there are no finishers
you wont see hogans leg drop savages flying elbow earthquakes buttsplash or the doomsday device
it is just a simple fingerblistering grapple war and no tournament or campaign mode means that there is no real reason to play more than a single match of the game nor is there any point to selecting a characterthe sound is the typical recycled grunts and slams on the mat
while the music is halfway decent thats about the only redeeming factor
these flaws would be fixed in the sophomoric attempt royal rumble
this title however was best avoided then back in the day and now as wellthe fact that those two wrestlers arent in this version of wwf wrestlemania the arcade game is reason enough to avoid it
yoko zuna is a big guy with very powerful moves and bam bam is yet another big guy
its odd how they didnt include either of the two big guys on the super nes
its not like this game has a lot of options and wrestlers anyway so to take away two wrestlers and leave you with only six is just ridiculous
get the playstation versionthis game is crazy
in every possible meaning of the word
i mean nothing about this game make sense
infact ill bet you anythingin the remotest parts of southeast asiaplaying this game is considered the number one form of execution
the gameplay is childish  cartoony
some of the moves in the game you cant do in real life like doing a perfect piledriver on a superheavyweight like yokozuna
the game speed is so fast that you think it was high on sugar
when a wrestler punches another wrestlersstuff comes out of that guy like when you punch yokozuna so many times fishes fly out of his pants
all the wrestlers fly so high you think they were on speed or something like that
this makes the adventures of sonic the hedgehog cartoon look sane by comparison
the only good thing about this game is that the wreslters look like the wrestlers in real life but thats still not enough to save this game
i give this game a  out of i sadly remember the day when this game was released
i had waited long enough and finally i had the game in my hands
i remember being so excited until about  hour into the game
it was then that i realized that  this game was terriblethe graphics were nice and the cut scenes were  above average
the voices sounded good and the combat was a little fast  but adequatebut i wasnt having fun
i realized that the game was  pretty deep and dwelling deeper into the games cool storyline would  require more of the bad ai terrible  i mean horrible combat system and  scrappy mouse driven interface
i couldnt take it anymore
i wished i  could just watch the game instead of play it then i would of been  happyi did what i had to do and finally uninstalled it
i thought of  all the money i spent and went to find another game
what a tradgedy that  a game with that much potential had to be ruined by an obvious rushed  product
if your a gamer who likes fast action and addicting gameplay  then go buy icewind dale or diablo  not this gamethis game is too old to work on todays oss
after many attempts with dosbox and other emulation software i gave upi did however get it to startoncebut it locked up and pixelated then crashed with a fatal errorhey im a bit of a trekkie but this games is something of a terrible dissapointment
is it just me or are a lot of people trying to make money utilizing the magnificent star trek universe
dont waste your money on this this game is awufal
it has loads of bugs and gets slow towards the end of it
there are very few units also
i have had it for  days and i am already board
also the ai is really bad
i need to play on the hardest  setting and it is still easy
if you want a better game for less price  then buy starcraftoh
come on this game isnt that easy
it is so hard
this game has too many confusing puzzels
if you looking for something really fun try something a little easieri really never understood the craze of this game
if you can get past ryus ki blasts thdn he uppercuts you and starts shooting at you again
if you manage to make it to bison he stands on your head over and over until you die
same with chun li
if you can get past sagats flying discs then he uppercuts you
if you try to attack guile he does his knee saber thing
balrog gets you in a corner and stuns you with each hit and blocking still lowers your health but attacking makes you get hit and die
the game at medium difficulty abuses the meta knowledge it has where if you punch and it punches the favor is in the games timing and details so much that you are the one that gets hit
plainly the game is not fun due to a a computer tgat absurdly measures everything to its advantage to where every time you attack the game has measured and counter attacks flawlessly like a kid playing a master at chess
i hold my own in fighting games and am well versed in them but the meta knowledge kills this game for me
 star because i honestly dont enjoy this game anymore
as a kid with nosalgia maybe buy now as an adult nothis and every other street fighter game ever made is overrated garbagei cant believe how much people used to like this gameive always hated street fighteri think it was because i have always been a diehard mortal kombat fanand since mortal kombat and street fighter have always beenand always will be rivalsi haveand will alwaysside with mortal kombatmk had everything that this game did notsf had dull cartoonlooking characterswhile mks characters were digitized and looked very realisticsf was also more for kidswhile mk blew everybody away with its overthetop violence and buckets of blood n gorethe gameplay was also so much better in mk as wellcompared to sf iioverallif you want a real fighting game for your genesisget the mortal kombat gamesand dont bother wasting your time and money on this or any other street fighter game for that matteri know what youe thinkin
i love street fighter  especially the champion edition because it super cool fun and has the outstanding graphics for its time great selectable characters and fluent controls
thats good and all for super nes releases but what was sega thinking when releasing this game on the genesis
read carefully because there are two major things i find wrong with the release on this console
the buttons are limited
i know that the genesis has three main buttons other than start but a standard fighting game has six buttons hk mk lk hp mp lp not three
i dont know if this game is programmed for genesis new six button controller but in order to use punch and kick buttons you have to switch it up by pressing start but that sucks the fun out of the game when you are trying to use a combination of moves to make it possible to defeat your opponent
theres no pause button
in order to make a button to switch up from punches to kicks and vice versa they made it for the start button
theres absolutely no excuse for a bit game to not have a pause buttonif you dare to play this game on the genesis make sure you have no interruptions go to the bathroom before playing make sure your parents dont need anything for two hours and leave a message on your answering machine that says im playing street fighter  on the genesis that has no pause button leave a message after the beep
beep
what a rip off
if you want to play the same classic game with the same graphics but with more working control buttons and a pause button get it for super nesthis game while a decent port from the ps version as far as a port goes is very frustrating
first its difficult to learn and play and the graphics sometimes makes gameplay even more difficult
btw its not really scary
the most annoying thing for pc gamers is you cant save the game at any point
instead there are only a limited number of occasions where you can save your progress
the novelty factor is no longer than as there was with the original re which was not as novel as the truly original alone in the darkthis game is horrible
at the release of the movie i thought it would be fun to play the game series then go see the flick
i heard friends rave about this game so i purchased it and couldnt get myself through the first ten minutes
the camera angle is annoying the controls clumsy the gameplay corny
the graphics left this veteran gamer with a sour taste
however if you like zombies and dont mind its serious flaws give this one a try
maybe youll feel better about it than i didthere should be a very easy setting
the game is much too difficult for me which makes it unplayableokay the game isnt horribly bad
it ran fine on my computer
no problems with instal or starting or anything like that
default controls are weird but changeable
my major drawback to this game was what was the point
the graphic novel would have been interesteting if it was something you get at the comic shop
i feel cheated by lack of movies
the novel could have been made into movies and lasted a little longer
it was short
the weapons were cool but the bullettime should just have stayed in the matrix
the graphics were great but for a firstperson shooter the game was not all that good
when its in the price bin get it
but other than that save your moneythis might be a great game but i may never know
in spite of having a p with mb of ram and a mb graphics card this game has crashed frozen my windows me system three times in a row as ive tried to quotplayquot the tutorial
ive been trying to download a patch all day and the miserable connection speed eventually degrades to nothing and then restarts thankfully where it left off
if it ever downloads and installs perhaps it will resolve my freezes but not so farwhile this is a terrific game concept with some nice features it is far more work than play
the core of the game is a standard x space empire builder with colony management a complex tech tree tactical space and  ground combat espionage and diplomacy
but there is no centralized  display of colony status
a building must be supplied with both power and  workers in order to operate and if it doesnt have enough of either it  will simply shut down and the game gives you no warning or announcements
you are forced to pause the game every few months and personally inspect  every single colony to discover these problems
but the tech system is even  worse and has not been improved from ig
there are three types of tech  and so you have to have three types of labs
but you can only research one  invention at a time so while youre developing a new hyperdrive in your  ship labs your ground unit and colony facility labs are sitting idle  sucking up your colonys power and workers
if you cant afford that waste  and most of the time you cant you have to once again personally remember  where you placed each one of up to  labs go to the colony display for  each planet on which you have a lab and turn the idle ones off one at a  time
if you decide to develop a new building next you have to go around  and turn off all the ship labs and turn all the building labs on again
and  i dont have room here to go into the games futile diplomacy system or  the sluggish screen redraw or the constant nagging interruptions by  messages regarding random events and spies demanding orders
no offense to  the other reviewers here but only a hardcore strategy addict with a fetish  for micromanagement could enjoy this game
i returned it four days after i  bought itthis game is the typical quotgrab headlines and not deliverquot that im coming to expect from lucasarts
this is an rts  years behind in technology
ive never understood how the empire couldnt have a  battlefield mapped yet the quotzero field of visionquot persists in  this game
the controls are twitchy and the graphics are cant even  compete with lower class rts games like metal fatigue
i bought the game  bc im a fan but id rather spend my time reading the novels than play  this poorly done amateurish shrink wrapped goopthis would have been a great game except for the actual user interface
what a mess
unless you are a th dimensional being with  eyes you got lost while trying to manage the games meandering views
locking onto troops in order to give them orders is a tortuous exercisei gave up after two hours and uninstalled this programming mistake
this is another la game that doesnt live up to its promisedo not buy this game
this was a huge waste of money
the gameplay was horrible
the way you control pac man is with a sling shot
he gets mad when you dont do something fast enough its mpossible do stuff with the sling shot
you have to move stuff for him with the sling shot
seriuosly
how dumb
i ended up reterning it because it was so bad
save you money and buy yourself the good old original pacman gamewow
there isnt much to say about this game other than simply wow
sarcastically mind youlet me take you back to video game arcades in the s
namco developed a little game called pacman that featured a  yellow circle that had an insatiable appetite for dots that may or may not have a specific flavor
unfortunately there were four ghosts who werent too happy about this pacman eating all these dots so they would try their hardest to stop pacman at all costs
however some of those dots seemingly grown using some type of growth enhancer endowed pacman with an unusual power to totally eat the ghosts
every now and then someone would throw some fruit or a random food onto the play field for pacman to devour providing him with the ability to expand his palette a littlethis is the game that became a worldwide phenomenon
this is the game that created a character that is universally recognized as an icon representing all that is great about the heyday of classic gaming
this great sprite known as pacman leads the pack in the annals of classic gaming showing one and all where our xbox  and ps came fromknowing that namco still had the audacity to lower pacman to this sorry state
to portray pacman not as an iconic leader of the classic gaming era but rather as some overly emotional twit at the mercy of your slingshotthe entire object of the game is to eventually beat down some creature made entirely out of gum
thats fine and all but the game engine doesnt support the appropriate controls for combat of this nature let alone the simple and obvious fact that the missions really dont relate enough to put two and two together to get to a climatic battle with the gum monster
the missions just seem totally random in purpose and this doesnt account for the fact that simply completing the main game missions only adds up to just under  of the entire completion rating for the game
seeing as how annoying this game is i cant see any reason to try to complete  of the gamethe gameplay is somewhat autonomous in the sense that the game basically does whatever it wants until you sling a rock anywhere on the screen
pacman moves in a direction continually until either something attacks him or you hit him with either a rock or a super pacball or he just decides he doesnt like you anymore
the engine is based on pacmans emotions
if you keep pacman happy hell do whatever it is you want him to do and this is usually the only way to ensure that you complete any of the games missions because if you make pacman angry hell ignore your commands and ignore objects in the environment that youll need to have to complete missionsthe only real way to interact with pacman to make sure he does what you want him to do is to shoot at stuff in the environment
you can make him eat foods like apples and hot dogs youll have to shoot at things to get them to drop from trees or to keep things from hitting pacman youll need to shoot doors of stores surprisingly the glass on the doors doesnt break to make pacman go in and whats more youll have to shoot super pacballs at him to make him turn into super pacman so that hell attack the ghosts when they appearspeaking of that another annoying aspect of the game is the ghost encounters
essentially youll need to fight the ghosts off so that pacman will stop sniveling like a little wimp
you cant shoot at them with your normal rocks youll have to shoot a super pacball at pacman to turn him into super pacman
once this happens again you have absolutely no control over pacman
the game just makes him fly back and forth across the current screen until the time runs out and he attacks anything that resembles a ghost
this lack of control just becomes downright annoying
its basically a day in the life of pacman simulatorsometimes i get bored with trying to figure out what im supposed to do and just shoot at pacman until he gets really mad and gets attacked by a cat near the hot dog stand
thats more fun then actually trying to finish the game which if you did you wasted your time like i didthen there are these stages where you have to guide pacman while hes flying a hang glider or riding in a mine cart
now these arent that bad because there arent too many of them but theres one mine cart ride in particular that really just blew me away with its difficulty
the game goes from being totally cryptic to virtually unbeatable in under twenty seconds and the worst part is you have no choice but to continue through the mine shaft
it took me quite literally two hours to get though this shaft and the reward at the end wasnt even hardly the beginning of anything satisfying because it lead to the backyard of pacmans housei really dont know what namco was thinking with this game and honestly i dont want to know
while they did present some very original ideas to gameplay what they got was something far from satisfying not to mention they defamed pacmans reputation
this game is no where even close to a start of becoming anything like the game that made pacman famous
the game is definitely not worth the buy and should be avoided at all costs unless youre missing a piece in your snes collectionok first off no dotmatrix gameboy title is ever worth  this outdated game was bad then and worse now
get your metroid fix withmetroid prime huntersthe instead for about  bucksi have never heard of this game but am a big mario fan so i bougt it
unfortunately it did not work but the seller was glad to refund me the full price and i didnt have to return the gamethis is one of the worst rpgs ever in existance
besides being easy it also has an unoriginal plot and crap graphics
i think the atari s system is more advanced than this game
i mean whats an rpg without scantly clad women
this rpg has none except for a princess who is as clothed as a fememist is
and mallow and geno are loaded with fail and i dont see why people want them in smash brothers which is a crap game as well
the plot tries to be all original by not centering on bowser kidnapping and raping peach who is called toadstool for whatever reason but on some character named smithy who is trying to take over the world by getting stars
whatever
and the battle system is awful as well
i mean timed hitsfor a good mario game play mario is missing marios time machine or the cdi classic hotel mario
if you want a good rpg for the snes play dungeon master of final fantasy mystic questbest game ever but i wanted to long to test it and couldnt return it
my game didnt worki am just as aware as anyone that people do not base their opinions of popular videogames on intelligent scripting intelligent plot intelligent substance and intelligent thinking so no one has to remind me
if they did this colony wars never wouldve left a single draftfirst of all i too respect the abilities of developers of psygnosis as much as anybody and i would like to describe that respect but i feel i have to say my piece about this game and come to my pointthere isnt a single idea in this game that isnt founded on generic thinking the thievery of other games and on movie cliches
there isnt one single idea based in science fiction unlike its other competitor darklight conflict the true hero here a littleknown and original game released by electronic arts ea before colony wars was conceived
darklight conflict was a spaceshooter and the gameplay idea for colony wars merely replicated that gameheres the story of colony wars you are a militant fighter pilot in space on the side of the rebel alliance who is trying to force the evil emporer to his senses by shooting up his armies or so says the narrational voice of an actor that sounds exactly just like james earl jones the voice of darth vader during the fullmotion videos fmvs which were made by the same company who did special effects for independence day
sounds like a direct wordforword copy of the plot of star wars
herere the ideas of colony wars large firey explosions even if they dont really exist in space because fire needs oxygen to exist and space has no atmosphere
black holes even if they dont exist as large red whirlpools in the middle of space backgrounds because their gravity is so intense light cannot escape
spaceships even though they dont have wings like planes because there is no atmospheric friction to enable control using aero parts
also they dont make loud rumbling noises when they pass by the camera lense because sound needs atmosphere
here you get a future of imperialistic humans warring over the colonization and liquidation of the rest of the planetary systems in the universe for purposes of natural resources
the mission and battle drill instruction voice is male but it is okay for a female to narrate if limited to talking about other subjects like the options menus
space cowboys does not make science fiction only unoriginal action games captivating nonthinkersheres the story of eas darklight conflict  you are a top gun pilot in the middle of a dogfight when suddenly a beam of light surrounds you
when you awake you are in a completely foreign environment
you realize your arms and legs have been replaced with some kind of tentacles that are biologically grafted to what appears as the console of a space vehicle
a voice speaks in english to you but it is not the voice of any human
you have been inducted into the army of an alien race in the midst of interplanetary war to help defend their losing side which is why they recruited you with your expert fighter pilot experience
their vessels are signified by a symbol a fourfingered hand
at first you will begin with training
the small fighterships are oval with fins protruding from what could be their sides
the weaponry is a variety involving weird plasma cannons
your ship uses an electromagnetic field to shield itself but it consumes a great deal of energy
you venture through the wormhole warps and should carefully avoid the radiation waves that usurp your vessel energy during the traveleven the name darklight conflict is science fiction
i could connect some of the premise of the game with the old scifi film this island earth but not much of its premise
in that movie a group of scientists are helping an alien race that appear about human so the scientists dont find out theyre aliens immediately
when they do the aliens take them to their planet and the alien commander tells them their planet is being overrun by another planets race and they recruited earths best scientists to come up with new and advanced technology to help them survive the invasion
their enemies soon destroy the planet but the ship has enough energy to return the scientists to earth
after their safe return the aliens drive their ship into the sea never to be heard from againbut who remembers stuff like thati dont know what came upon sega when they made this socalled game i normally refer to it as digital vomit
when you hear sonic you normally think oh yeah that fasterthensound hedgehog who founded gaming with superfast paced action
sonic labyrinth is not any of that
instead of the superfast paced action you get a slow and tedious maze to explore on a time limit and not the  minutes you get in the normal games
when i say slow i dont mean long or boring i mean sonic moves slower then mario and that is saying something
it wasnt an accidental bug or hardware issues either
it was meant to be
if you dont mind watching your favorite hedgehog crawl around the areas you will probably mind the other diasters
music
makes atari  numbers sound good
graphics
makes pong look incredible
gameplay
i would rather play marios time machine for a week then this for  secondsdont buy this youll never see sonic the same way again
in fact close this page and dont look into labyrinth any fartheri sometimes wonder how people would react to this game if it did not have the final fantasy franchise name attached to iti can recommend two better tactical srpg games before you make this purchase  vandal hearts for psx and shining force  for the genesis or wii virtual consolei would go the latter since genesis and snes games have issues with the save battery due to age or if endless grinding is your thing then disgea series is another good recommendationnot that this game is bad but i wanted the one star rating to get everyones attention and let them know they have better options when its comes to srpgsi never did get to far playing this game
i just dont get the hang of it
so i quit this game soon after i started
i like a game i can get somewhere with
i guess i didnt understand what it was all about when i bought it
somebody else might do alright with it but not meafter the disappointment of ff xii was curious what makes that producer so well known and could mess up a frachise like this
so went back to the roots and try final fantasy tactics
i think there are really some people who enjoy frustrations in games and think that this is the only way to consider a game fun
final fantasy tactics is annoying frustrating and unrewarding
i dont know whats wrong with people who think that this is a great game
you think you can spend time to level up the characters to make the story battles easier
you are completely wrong
im stuck in a boss battle that after a  hours of level up you thought you have characters  levels higher than the enemies you should be ok
you are wrong
the boss is so strong that despite you are  levels higher than them it can wipe out your whole party in one go  despite all of them are  levels higher and have the best equipment on them at that point of the game
whats the point
i think ill give up the final fantasy frachise for good now if the next game is by the same producer
its not worth it at all
for people who think this kind of game challenging and fun i think id rather not be a gamer anymore
if i can i want to give  stars to this gamewho is giving this good reviews
this has to be the worst rpg on ps
interestingly sony initially believed that jrpgs wouldnt sell well in the west and they released japanese games only if they were action arcade games
this was the first jrpg released and it was something of a surprise hit
its strong sales showed that there was a ready western market for jrpgs and led to the later high profile releases of classic rpgs such as final fantasy  and breath of fire like many ps owners at that time i eagerly anticipated this game hoping for an epic experience similar to final fantasy  on the snes but with incredible psx graphics lol
instead i got this horrible rubbish
its completely generic with no personality whatsoever and includes every rpg cliche there is
its extremely easy with extremely simple mechanics and also very long and tedious with endless dull battleslots and lots of random battles dumb characters dumb gameplay graphics that would look bad on the snes except for the constant battles
i played this when there were no other rpgs on the playstation and i had the flu
with so many great rpgs out now there is no reason for this game
actually there was no reason for it in the first place
im an rpg nut but this one is just plain badi was given this game by a friend who didnt want it anymore
now i see why he was so quick to just give it away
this game is the worst of all rpgs
weak story repetitive gameplay bad music and graphics that make me wonder whether this is a playstation game or a gameboy color game
stay away from this at all costs
youll see it selling for about  at some ebgames stores
the price is that low for a reasoni bought my kids each one of these at christmas so that they could play with their gameboys in the car when the light was low
waste of time and moneythe light isnt very powerful doesnt illuminate much of the  screen and seems to suck the batteries dry much sooner
the glare makes my  eyes  hurt and i cant imagine its good for my kids either
we dont use  them any more
dont botheryesit may look neat and attractivebut trust meit is not worth it
the glare from the light covers the entire screen ofmy gbc and makes game play impossible
andif you try to cooperate with itit just gives you a big headache
i guess playing in the dark is just not a good idea for nowpokemon were cool yes there was a time when the great empire of little cuddly creature took america by storm
all  as the new ones dont matter a bit were great and were a lot of fun to see in the game
then the franchise went down hill shelling out nothing that could be considered nothing more than drivel
i know this may be a lot for a person of any age who loves pokemon to swallow
but the franchise is old and is nothing anymore but a waste of money
when i first got this game i will not lie a bit i was impressed it was a very fun game and i enjoyed owning it and being able to take pictures of various pokemon
when i finished the game though i was horribly disappointed
there were nowhere near the amount of pokemon in the game i expected and the game really left little to the imagination can you believe that a pokemon game that leaves little to the imagination
i wish i could rate this game higher and maybe if there were no alternative it may have rated higher but there are better games out there and im sorry but i wasted my money on this gamei throughly did not like this game at all
unless you enjoy being on a set track and taking pictures of pokemon with a limited amount of film and giving them food or bombing them or playing music for them and taking more pictures
then this game is not for youthis game really sucks
i rented it once for five days and i played it for one day and then i beat it
it was so stupid
it is worse than mario party 
if you are a first time game player dont get this game
if you have been playing games for  years  dont get this game
this is the worst game everthis game was an extremely easy game that you can beat in  minutes
all you do is take pictures of dumb pokemon
then when you beat the game you have to try to beat the computers impossible scores
thats it do not buyif i could pick the most boring esiest game in the worldi would pick this one
all you do is zaa picture
throughout the levels you get things like bait and stuff but unless your a serous camera fan this game should be reccomended to no onedont get this game
it is not worth the money
ok you can print the picture out but then you have to buy the pokemon snap card and it costs about  and it is just not worth the money
and it is to short
no plot no challange might as well go through your photo album it would be more entertainingstrange how some people regard grandia as the best saturn rpg and one of the best on the playstation
while grandia possesses some interesting qualities it is completely dismantled by a series of devastating flaws that cripple the game
this review will be formulaic but it will get the point acrossthe graphical engine was very good
d characters and d environments that can be rotated at will
i like nuances and grandia possesses many
i like knocking over teapots and making clotheslines as i walk into them
the spell effects were boring however and the fmv while technically good at the time just wasnt excitingthe music is overwrought and almost silly
the main themes seem bombastic and pretentious as if the game is saying quotcome look at me im importantquot the compositions are impressive musically but they feel emotionally hollow
there is one song a piano amp violin duet which i loved
it was completely gorgeous
i also liked how the combat music changed as the game continued
rpgs often frustrate me by giving me the same combat music through the entire  hour gamein grandia using specific kinds of magic or weapons makes you more skilled in that capacity
naive gamers have said that grandias character growth system is innovative and interesting
it is not innovative in my mind and not interesting
such systems have been done in bit final fantasy games and reams of japanese rpg with lower profiles the saga games come to mind
also because the game is so long youll probably learn every spell and weapon technique about  though the game
since this removes any real incentive to engage in combat all future battles are suffocating in how boring they arethe combat is boring
this is mainly because it is incredibly easy
i didnt spend extra time advancing my characters i tried to finish the game asap actually so i definitely wasnt too strong
still not a single boss offered any form of challenge
even the final boss felt like nothing more than a ponderous standard encounter
it seems evident to me that a game cannot be exciting when there is no threatno sense of danger or challenge
this wouldnt be that bad if the battles didnt take so long
so you get thousands of long boring simple fights over the course of the game
the dungeons are amateur in design and made about  times more dreadful because of the combat
theres also a gauge in combat that shows when when each character will take an action
however this does not create any real strategy because all the characters move at different speeds so its just a funky gimmickthe story is not bad but it is badly told
it uses about every hackneyed japanese rpg element imaginable but it doesnt remedy this problem with interesting characters or compelling twists
the translation is just dumb
sony broke it down to simple diction and pure fatuous juvenalia
the quotromanticquot relationship between justin and feena is basically insulting  it has the maturity of an elementary school infatuation
sue is an utterly pointless character whos involvement in the story is simple arbitrary and ridiculous
what is the creature quotpuffyquot
the game never explains
i expected some kind of enigmatic quality to the creature with a revelation disclosing all at some point like nall in lunar
this never happens
its stupid
the voice acting is hideous
attemps at humor fall flat
attempts at emotional expression are cringeinducingthe game took me about  hours to beat though i tend to be slower than some
in my mind the game is about  hours too long
so expect the quotmeatquot of the story to be padded with superfluous sidequests packed with obnoxious combat and torturous dialogue
i like sidequestswhen they are optional or purposeful
in this game the sidequests are neither
adventures in a ghost ship or on a mysterious prehistoric valley might sound fun on paper but without important story revelations or fun gameplay its boring
granted about  hours of the game is pretty interesting
but thats a mere  of the game
in school that would be an fa failing gradethe game is just tedious
its boring and insipid and hackneyed to death
im sure there will be many who say quotgrandia rulez
you liequot and give me a quotnot helpfulquot vote
i didnt write this to please anybodyi wrote it because i think grandia does not deserve the praise it receives
heed my word and perhaps you will save  hours of you life
thats a long time
 law amp order episodes
a genuinely good rpg
think about iti couldnt get passed the first level it is like impossible
you have to like be a pro at the game or somethini try to do a trick on the undercover sectionbut is hard to do thati try and try but i cant even pass the testthis game is not goodthe graphic look horribleyacki usualy like castlevania games so when i heard of their was one on gameboy i bought right away
that was  stupid
but ill start with its good qualities
it doesnt smell
thats something right
now the bad
you walk really really slow
you attack really really slow
everything else goes either as fast or faster than you
when you jump accross platforms unless you jump at the very edge of you wont make it
the music is just  seconds of sound repeated over and over and over and over  oh ya and the graphics look like i dont know about the other incarnations of batman returns but the sega mega drivegenesis version is downright atrocious
the controls are stiff and slow batman himself moves at a snails pace and is frequently unable to move out of the way of oncoming enemies
the sound effects are awful and the combat system is very very poor
such a shame consideringbatmanwas so good
even the music in this one disappoints in comparison to the brilliant tunes in the first game
the only positive thing i can mention about this waste of time and effort are the nice looking graphics which really evoke the gloomy wintry feel of a frozen gotham city
otherwise avoidgraphics bsound dgameplay flasting appeal di would say that video games dont come much simpler than this bore but the likes of pong and pacman while less technically sophisticated are still better
golden axe  is such a chore to play with no fun or enjoyment injected into the proceedings whatsoeveragain you can choose from barbarian ax battler amazonian tyris flare or dwarf gillius thunderhead as you slowly plod your way through a generic as hell fantasy kingdom hacking and slashing at conveyor belt enemies who sometimes kill themselves out of sheer stupidity before you get to the big guy in a suit of armour who has taken over the land because of his evilness or whatever nonsensei often associate golden axe with streets of rage since the gameplay in the first games was very similar i also bought them on the same day back in march 
but while the sor series only got better and more sophisticated i am afraid that golden axe just got crapper
it tries to be the gaming equivalent of a big budget conan movie but comes off as no more than a roger corman miniseries
youve never played a game so stripped down and bland as thisgraphics dsound dgameplay dlasting appeal fprosits a lot like golden axeconsits a lot like golden axesound effects are no more than white noisebaddies all look the sameno point systemvery very little in the way of power upsno combo movescollision detection is poormusic is just ghastlythought this would be a fun mario like game
controls are award and half the buttons are useless
also is frustrating in that you can get stuck on a part of level by destroying the blocks you need to jump on
then you have to wait till you die or time runs out to retry
buy an snes instead with mario and zeldaa fun arcade game it may well have been in its day but one cannot play moonwalker today without feeling dirty or somewhat guilty
based on the movie of the same name moonwalker is just as weird bizarre and outrageously selfglorifying as wacko jacko himselfyou take on the role of a suspected pedo dressed in a white gangster suit who must rescue children hidden in closets drawers garbage cans from the evil mr big
upon being rescued these kids respond joyously with michael knowing that they are now safe with the king of pop
you need to rescue all the little sprogs in every level before you meet the endlevel boss
but some children are too well hiddenand who is this mr big exactly
the jacko of  fighting against a childnapper whos motives for stealing kids is unknown in the game seems prophetic in a splitpersonality kind of way
just like in thriller where he played a ghoulish inhuman beast eerily foreshadowing the futurethe gameplay itself is ludicrous
as you moonwalk across the various levels some generic some inspired by his classic music videos youll encounter baddies like gangsters and zombies and your amazing way of killing them isdancing them do death
seriously
its not jesus juice its jacko jamming
you hit the special attack button and jacko will suddenly yell ow
before strutting his lethal stuff
after which the baddies will be vanquished somehow
after playing this game youll be exhilarated and mentally exhausted at jackos killer moves
youll be reduced to a dribbling wreck
hes so good that even passingby animals will join in and shake their asses
if you ever wanted to play a game in which even an innocent dog is hypnotised by jacko into dancing thriller then this is for you
but i dont want to know youthe music is no more than lowquality samples of smooth criminal and thriller as you should know this music follows jacko everywhere he goes in real life and will change depending on where he isin the later levels if you catch a falling star jacko will turn into a huge robot
of course
like in the film i just cant get over the feeling that jacko only included this because he wants to see himself  feet high
its ridiculous and has nothing to do with anything
but in a moronic hopelessly outdated video game i suppose its okay
it was kind of easy to finish too and i never really played it again afterwards
but these days it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and i can understand why no one would want to play it againgraphics csound cgameplay dlasting appeal fi couldnt stand this gamethis was nothing compared to s of r and s o r the gameplay was super fast and it was alot harder toothe soundtrack in this game was totally lameonce againnothing compared to the first two games of the trilogythe characters you choose from are about the sameexcept there is no adam againwhich sucks big time and no max thunder eitherwhich really sucks all there isis some old dude who is a humanrobot or somethingi dont even know what the hell this thing even isanywaythe graphics are about the only good thing that i would say this games got going for itoveralli would recommend avoiding this oneand just pick up streets of rage and streets of rage this controller is really a bad idea on segas part the six button is much more user friendly especially to anyone who enjoys fighting games such as myself given i do own a pair of these i never use them use my six buttons even on three button compatable games because the only difference is you dont use the x y z buttons lol plus on any six button genre games that incorporated the using start button to swap the threes functions you loose the pause feature defanatly not the best controller for the genesisi recieved the controller on time how ever it is not fully functional only the directional key works and the start button works from time to time the other three buttons are not working at all
probaly should have gone with a replica however ill give it another shot and order another form another amazon supplier good luck to us all who put our money and faith into second hand materialare you people stupid when it comes to telling what games are good and what games totally suck
i love the original doom but this shooter does a terrible job at ripping doom off
the graphics arent good for their time
hell the genesis has way better looking games than this
its like when i look at this game im reminded of vomit
why
picture this a friend has just barfed and to make fun of the situation you try and find what the colorful chunks of vomit look like
hell even with the radar screen you have to literally squint to see where the enemies are at because the graphics are so horrible and ugly come to think of vomit if you have problems with games with horrible graphics that cause you to get sick you will barf a storm
plus this game was made in  and has perhaps some of the worst graphics ever
doom was released in  and the graphics still hold well to this day
the controls are crappy the music is godawful along with the graphics and this is one of the worst shooters ive ever played
so whatever you do dont buy this fing awful game
also worth mentioning the graphics are so bad to point of where it looks worse than an nes gameive played a lot of games that to this day can be considered old
some of them have aged well thanks to their long lasting charms and innovations but from this ive earned an experience i have learned that if the opening music to the game is astronomically good its a bad game
few games apply to this rule but it is still present particularly in long forgotten manure fests like deep blue for the turbo grafix  and this gameright out the game starts with an incredible opening song one that sounds catchy jazzy and dire all at the same time
then you actually play the game and see the graphics and the hook has dislodged itself from your interestim not going to say that the graphics are bad especially not at a first glance but sa uses a very dull color palette consisting of almost limelight tints where the shirts of thugs will appear too green for their own good and the palette loves to overuse the color gray a lot
youll encounter a lot of gray backgrounds in this game save for maybe the park levels which actually resemble foreststhe game play on the other hand is criminal
i dont want to sound like the average game whiner that whines about older games and how hard they were but i know when a game is being unfair and when i just suck at a game and sa takes the former in astronomic measurements
i never thought venom or spidey could take so much damage from wimpy looking thugs athletic gymnast women who use their hair as whips and headband wearing drunks armed with flintlocks yes im seriousthe enemies in this game are a pain
some of them are really cheap particularly the wimpy saggyshorts jerks in the first level that leap at you from across the screen and the aforementioned gymnasts but they only get more cheap from there especially when they throw in guys with cablelike guns and iron man wannabesi think my favorite boss in the whole game was the first level boss hes one of the cheapest bosses youll encounter but the animation for him or it its a robot really is so funny that its actually cute
its like watching a cat walk over the dried surface of a previously rainproof coated deck as they shake their paws of the sticky feeling before taking another step its that funnyyou can climb on walls in some levels but your movement is restricted to the level
of course speak of the devil and he shall appear lets talk about the real nightmare in this unconscious dream state of a game that analogy sucksthe levels are long samey brawler levels consisting of streets a forestlike park a bridge and a factory and youre going to run through each one for what feels like five minutes straight encountering the exact same enemies and occasionally having the choice of taking different paths which wastes time more than the average game shouldnone of this is helped by the looped music of each level with only three level songs total imagine playing through eight levels with only three different songs over and over again all of which are dwarfed by the opening song that first playedyou do get additional help in the game such as marvel cameos who come out of nowhere once you pick up their icon but sometimes they dont really help you some of them have very specific reasons to help you like clearing the screen of enemies or blocking projectiles and in most cases theyll just run on screen do something for a few seconds disappear and leave you to continually get your posterior slammed into chewed gumand if youre hoping the ending and final boss is worth encountering they really arent
id say buy it for the opening music or a goofy gold robot but are any of those really valid reasons
i think id rather recoat the deck wait for it to dry find any spots that still have those dried but sticky patches on them and have the cat walk over it again and to add ill join in the fun by walking with her barefootif you want game with your nihilism however then come get somethis game has seen its life
it lacks the motivation and breathtaking function of others of its genre here on  i find clocktower for the snes to be more entertainingthe graphicsfuzzy character sprites blood that is so cheap that it looks like red paint
resident evil took a whipping in the visual department
the zombies look like redeads
and a brownishblack fuzzy blob is not scary its funny
theres been games like tomb raider and croc that visually look better yet they are both ps gameslike a sweet home spinoff resident evil starts out with very little weapons but with scarce ammo
the one major difference between these two however are the controlsthats right im talking about buttonbusting control schemes
all the earlier re games have an annoying tendency of allowing the character to die a lot
when other games came out and before the controls were smoother re insisted that the characters turn painfully slow away from an approaching zombie just giving the zombie enough ampletime to latch on to have lunch breakfast and dinnernow whats so scary about this gameis it given that mratings were considered rare back on the ps
the script
or knowing some zombie is gonna come out of that hallway sooner or later
the game starts with the player arriving on the grounds of the mansion in a grainy video then inside
immediately there is conversation
the voiceacting is dull unlively and boring
do i care that theres blood on the floor
no why
because it looks like paint thats why
dont mind the plaininsight deadbody laying in the corner there its decor
or not
again the voiceacting is as bland and convincing as a monologue brokenrecord
ahh
somethings there
ahhhhh
bad acting produces bad resultsgiven that it was the first re game may be the reason for its praising considering both its puzzlelike feature of finding itemsunlocking rooms and of course the zombies in a squashed polygonrendered environment
but by todays standards fallout  anyone
this game simply doesnt cut it
silent hill has a remake of its first game it may be worth a try
but as for re  original its a rent
try the other games before considering thisare we asking for to much like better music and a story line ive played games that had none all i cared about was fighting a game like this should be more responcive when you move but why dose everyone buy the japanese version the us version has a girila in the cover if you dont have the patients to learn to teleport figure out what moves combo then dont buy it remember this game dosnt have a strategy guide iether it came with a booklet or it didnt and the  booklet dosnt list all the movesif this was a launch title for the playstaion  than one could guarentee that the system would be in the garbage bin along with atari jaguar and virtual boy
this game is so horrible and unplayable that it is an embarassment to fighting games
i will go out on a limb and say that this is the single worst fighting game i have ever playedthe idea behind this game is that there are a cast of dragon ball gt characters all fighting it out
there is no plot to speak of in this game and for most outside of super obsessed fans who know extreme details of every characterthey would out this game shortly after the first fight or twothis comes down to my biggest complaint about this game the controls
with any video game you need to have responsive controls
you dont get that here
there is no combo system to speak of which even early fighting games held although did not go acknowledge
here is the idea of a typical fight on easy
fight begins  you move forward to attack in which you move painfully slow  you hit kick ten seconds pass and your character does the move  your opponent is hit and fights back  using the dash button you slowly move out of the way  you go to use a special which seems to be insta kill only to have it countered and you lose  controller then shatters on tv screen in utter frustration
this is an example of a fight that lasts possible a minute
like i said the controls are the worst i have ever seeni feel sorry for those who shell out x amount of dollars on this garbage and i challenge any one out there to give some reason at why this game is supposivly good
grand theft auto  has passed its mantle as worst game of all time to this game this is no buried treasure this is no lost artifact or holy grail this game is plain and simple garbagei have been playing video games my entire life and this game is the worst game i have ever played
you cant walk two steps without fighting an enemy and it takes hours to go through one very small castle because of this
the gameplay is horridand boring the music is painfully redunant
everything about this game sucks
i threw it in the trashthe gameplay is horrid the graphics sucks for snes and its just very very boring to playthis was one of the worst games ive ever seen in my life next to operation europe and populous
if your curious thinking this looks like mario well its not
far from such greatness as donkey kong or mario
i played this game for  mins the day i got it and aint touched it since
the nes versions of adventure island are alot better and more fun than this game
buy them but please unless you truly wish to own it for being an snes version of the nes classic dont buy it
its nothing like it
it is an oversized half naked fat man that resembles nothing to the classic mr higgins
your nowhere near as small as you used to be on the nes and your hathcets just dont throw like they used to
this game was definately made on a low budget and quickly produced for quick income
however i consider it one of the few snes flops
the only reason it truly sold was because people thought it was going to be like the original nes version only to find out when they got home teary eyed that its not
and it definately aint worth good ends neither
when you jump on the game he looks as though hes been busted by the police or going in to convulsions or something rather confusing exactly what it looks like hes doing
the graphics are good but the controls are not smooth and gets repetitive extremely fast leadin to boredom and eventually getting trashedthe game is pretty cheap and you cant realy do much because the game does all of the fighting for u kind of depressingthis really isnt a part of the final fantasy series
its just labeled as such so it would sell better here in the us
and yes you can really jump in this gameit takes two hits to kill every enemy except bosses
the undead bosses take one hit  one cureall spell
if your age is in the double digits in years this game will probably be too simple for you
not recommendedvery very very obsolete ffivii aged very poorly remakes improves over original  timesmy gripes for this version aregraphics are awful more then a snes game this looks as a nes gameeasy version for the us audience is too damn easyno dush button the game is terrible slowvery bad and censored script wheres the atb gauge
without gauge the atb is pointless conversion is terrible
cut everything
cut magics cut skills censored text cut out difficulty this is tolerablemy gripes for this game itself music is annoying  seconds midi endlessly repeatedshort game less then  hoursthe plot has absolutely zero depth or detailprimitive gameplay no job system no esper system no materia system nothing of nothingdon t even choose party members the story choose your party  most strategic game ever eh
the game world is too generic no information at all
the game has  countries but you do not know anything about them no description of items in the equipment shops you dont see the changes of statisticstoo large party so little time characters dont receive a true development besides kain or cecilrosa is the worst feminine character ever zero depht zero background i dont know any information about her besides shes the white mage of the castle and love cecilcecil start evil
dont make me laugh
in the very first scene its already a good guydungeons are boring
cave cave cave cave mountain  cave cave cavegraphics sound story characters development gameplay fun factor whit this unbiased review of ffim trying to help the new rpg gamers often deceived from nostalgic o fanboy reviewersmy advertise
if you want so badly play final fantasy  try the psp version the best version is  improvement over this or try the ds version if you like cartonish and blocking graphicsstay away from the terrible gba version loaded with bugs bad control bad sound and low difficultpsx version is basically uncensored japanese hardtype snes version with a couple of fmv and the dash button decent version but really no any real improvementthis has got to be one of the most boring mario games i ever played as a child
first of all theres no action no challenges which the bad guys cant kill you all your doing is just playing as luigi pointlessly running all around the world searching for pointless clues of history to find mario and thats absolutely no fun at all your better off going back to school studying world history than to play this game no lessif you want an epic mario game for your snes look no further than super mario rpg legend of the seven stars instead but yeah avoid this sorry excuse for entertainmentoverall  stars from methis game is about as exciting as going to the library to read ua history books
literally that is all you do find items find their place in history fill in your history book and thats it
plus hours of walking around looking for turtles which cant hurt you
the bosses or enemies in this game cannot hurt youwhere the hell is the fun in that
this is easily the worst game ever even worse than the nes versionthis game is dum
all you do is go around looking for mariotheres no action no fun no nothing
i cant beleive people bought this boring pointless and funless waste of moneymario is missing is the worst mario game on the face of earthnintendo shouldnt have given software toolworks the mario licensemario is missing is a horrible crummy educational game that isnt really educationali heard so many good things and how legendary this game was i bought it and wanted a refundthe framerate is so bad that its like watching a slideshow
virtua racer on the genesis is so much better then thisand the controls hohohohoyou go way too fast and the controls are so sluggishi played at least  minutes and trained but i couldnt do good enough i keep crashing
idk y nintendo thought there console was so cutting edge that they tried to make it do d polygons but it fails
leave that up to the ps and sega saturnthis game is so boring dont get confused this is nothing like the other kirby games
its in the style of tetris
and it gives tetris a bad name
this was a disapointmentif you liked this game check out all of the other kirby gamesthis is not a kirby game
it is another puzzle game like tetris but not as fun
it is exactly like a game i have on my computer called candy crisis but kirby charecters unstead of candy falling down
what u do is match the objects up and try not to over flow the placement
it gives u two different objects at once and u make sure u match the things falling up to what is on the ground which u can move them over or turn them in different directions to match them
i like the original kirby on the nes so i tried this one and its just a puzzle game
i like all of the other kirby games better because they have a storywow
its wolverine in his very own video game
lets all celebrate
lets throw a ing party
seriously though even if the controls werent disgusting the mere fact that it has one of the worlds most overrated comic book super heroes would destroy it for me anyway
some people actually worship this guy
you can probably find some geek with a shrine and a poster that says wolverine our savior is better than god
wolverine used to be my favorite until overexposure such as this ruined him
now im rooting for storm who is infinitely times  better than wolverine will ever be
what about the game though
id give you one if i could but i wasnt able to play the game long enough without getting bored out of my minddecent attempt at a knock off but its bootleg as hell
they should be selling these with crack so you can get something worth the money being spenti got this when i dug my snes out and started playing it
but when i wanted to play super mario world on multiplayer i could not find the second controller
i looked everywhere
anyway when i bought this one it looked great
but it was not
when u start to use it u notice that the cord is way shorter than the original controller it is not even the same as the other because it does not say snes on it it just says nintindo but that does not really matter and the worst of all the buttons stick and they r really stiff and hard to use
so now when u play multiplayer u r not even close to as good as u r with the original
save ur money and buy the original onei have never played a good addams family guy even though i have tried over  of there games
avoid this one
 starcomplicated storyline  there is often a limited sense of directionalthough your objectivesdirections are usually handed from an npc in a town a castle or a cave you may still find yourself having to keep a pen and paper handy so you wont forget where to goitem confusion  the magical properties of certain items arentalways clear such as the charm top the amulet and the magic sealrepetitive nature   the battles with enemies seem extemely repetitive at times enemies always respawn when you walk off the screen
if you come back into a room youll be fighting them again
in case you think there was something you missed at a castle all your enemies are back to greet youuntimely deaths  if theres enough powerful enemies on the screen theres also the risk that your party will get killed off before you cast a single spell
even though chrono trigger utilizes the beautiful secret of mana graphics engine  mana was not only an easier plot to follow but it also didnt have a turnbased battle dynamic like chrono trigger
with chrono you cant even evade enemies if theyre directly in your path
youll be rolling through every single enemy in the game unless you run away during the battlespoor shopping dynamic  nearly all the shops in game sell the same stuff
the shop in medina has cool stuff but the goods are hideously expensive
by the time you have enough coins the items in your inventory are likely already betterenemies in the game never drop anything but gold experience points and replenishment to your hpmp
all your gear is coming out of a treasure chest in some dungeonpoor characterization  all your playable characters are onedimensional and have very feeble personalities by this i mean theres very little feeling emotion or even romantic involvement between characters save for something shallow between marle and crono
compare this to final fantasy  which despite also having turnbased battles ff had a better soundtrack storyline items and graphics
ff is also a year older and was made by the same folks at squareonly in graphics is chrono trigger more relevant to secret of evermore however the boy and his dog still had more depth and character than any single character within chrono triggerbottom line  chrono triggers replay value doesnt come from the multiple endings the game has to offer or the handful of choices you can make to encounter those endings
replay value is associated with forgetting how bad this game is and in trying to overlook all its many drawbacks
the terrible cover art on the box shouldve been the first warningstreet fighter ii was a crappy fighting game that was completley unplayablethe gameplay is awful and the cartoon graphics just made it even worsemortal kombat had it all over street fighter ii in all of these areasmortal kombat really shines in the graphics compared to this heap of crapplaying as realistic digitized characters was just so much better than playing with animated cartoonie looking dorks like ryu or kenpass this up and get mortal kombat insteadi know mortal kombat  for snes did not have the blood and gorebut it was and still is better than thisbottom line isall street fighter games suck and mortal kombat is better in every waymk all the wayhow anyone can give this title a solid stars is beyond me
this title is by far the worst rpg game ever created
time stalkers is everything gone wrong with an rpg which had the potential of being a great title if just a little more time and effort were put into the project
dungeons are randomly picked which can be an either good or bad thing dependings on ones preference can only carry  items when entering a dungeon only level  weapons can be carried inside a dungeon since your character is started at level even time they enter a new  and worst of all if youre defeated in a battle guess what not only do have to start the entire dungeon from scratch but youre also started back at level  and lose all of strong weapons which you had gathered during your voyage
what were the creaters thinking
not only that but the list goes on and on
do not buy this title
ill make you want to play nes rpg titles
which are better may i add than this titlefrom what i read about metropolis street racer i expected a solid racing game with speed but got neither
the game favors no contact driving instead of funuh i mean speed
imagine a racing gamme with no speedwho on earth could think of such a dumb concept its like a sonic game without speed or a doom type game without gunsreally a sad disapointment
the graphics are okay but the game play sucks
avoid this like sarsrpgs are my favorite genre
especially action ones which are few and far between
i was hoping this would be another quotzeldaquot or quotalundraquot with better graphics
but it was simply annoying
i cringed the first time i heard musashis horrid voice and every other time i heard it
big disappointment
the game was promoted as an rpg but it doesnt remind me of an rpg
its an annoying adventure game with annoying voice acting
the quotheroquot looks and sounds like a bratty ten year old
definitely not for everyone especially someone expecting a typical rpg
dont disappoint yourself like i did
this is the first time i ever returned a game in the same night to boot
rent it firsti was reading through some of the glowing reviews for this and i still cant believe that no one has called this game for what it is a turkey
the fighting system is garbage
the graphics where ugly
the play controls are so awful it makes me wispful for pit fighter
there are cameos from final fantasy  that you can unlock if thats your thing
if you are like most people who enjoy a good fighting game for what it is i promise you will not be too moved by this novelty
you may care even less if you hated final fantasy  like myself
i would compare this fighting game license title to lucasarts star wars masters of teraumls kaumlsi
if you are a fan boy who gobbles up everything square pooped out in the last  years and called it candy then this is for you
you probably didnt read my review and already purchased this game along with a tifa body pillow
i would like to close with the inescapable truth that capcom can make good rpgs but square cannot make good fighting games deal with itthis is basically a chicks game with toned down action and horror themes designed to appeal to girls fears most guys wont like it
more basically its a failed experiment in game design
they had an interesting problem here with figuring out how to blend two contradictory game models rpg vs survival horror or leveling vs running away but it doesnt work
the only thing interesting to me in concept not execution are the battle and weapon upgrade systems
the battle system mixes real time evasion with rpg atb the problems are enemies too fast mostly undodgeable area attacks slow character and enemies cast a slow spell to make you slowerand theres no room to move in the field
the weapon system has its own problem with annoying penalties and inconveniences
there are serious problems with pacing and story development cutscenes vs playtime and level design
the writers think that techno babble is story when its just a plot device
the are parts in the game when youll watchread  minutes of cutscene go do something boring that takes  minuteslike pressing against a box tapping x trying to get it to open and then watchread  minutes of cutscenes
the difficulty of the game is annoying its mostly designed to move you along like a movie but then will drop in cheap insta kill attacks
a lot of the rooms are empty except for graphic decoration there is no dramatic action plot element or puzzle to solve and exist only to hold a key to the room next door
monsters infinitely respawn at doorways and theres no way to pass but to fight them again
the monster design ranges from silly and lame like random placement of arms and legs down to embarrassing like the final boss who has a giant peepee for a tail and a nt sack hanging off his ss
for most of the game youll hear the same two song overworld arpeggio and battle theme
camera angles suck
i could go on critisizing but its tedious
this game is obsolete and only of interest for game design studentsi own saga frontier one and it isnt as bad this is
why cant these saga frontier games be good
i thought that this game would be different
no longer competely nonlinear gameplay
there is a story that is very evident how who are supposed to follow it
not like saga frontier where you could wander around for three hours and still not know what you wher doing
the battle system reminded me of old game boy games
you can only use this weapon  times and the attacks are incredibly weak quick whack the enemy again
im sorry but i am a firm believer that weapons shouldnt have a fixed usage to them
i believe that they should break on a rare occasion but they shouldnt have fixed number of times to use
the story goes between two characters that you choose which one to follow
at least they took a better stab at making a better story for the characters than they did last time
the battle system is also very complex
there are three types and sometimes it really confuses the player as to the differences between the three and there are differences
the games music has never been a strong point
i didnt care for it at all
some of it was really good the rest sounded really bad
the graphics are beautiful though
they look very similar to those in legend of mana same artists i think and they will bowl you over
if you like graphics and dont care about anything else with a game enjoy
otherwise dont waste your moneythis game is boring and all you do is build very boring buildings with no detailyou take  hours to build a city that is not even detail enough to see people or cars or anything going onthe only advantage to purchasing the cd set is that it comes with a manual  playbook
but you will get the anoxexe encountered a problem and needs to close error so you will have to download the digital version from gog
i am playing the digital version and find it ok  you walk around talking to people and if you like games like that  
i prefer strategy games like starcraft and warcraft
homeworld is good alsowith homeworld i could put my system to standby and when it came out of standby i could pick up where i left off
it was that stable
homeworlds gameplay is flawless
just about the only other game that played this well of the classics is starseige tribes and you need to download an update to play that because all the original servers are no longer upi loved the stability of homeworld that it played perfectly out of the boxi cant say the same of arachronox which constantly gives me anoxexe encountered a problem and needs to close
i couldnt find a patch
i downloaded the gog version which plays wellxeno clash installed steam then stoppedmirrors edge wouldnt run without an internet connectionabout the gamei have never got to play arachronox without encountering some problem
the gameplay is horrible
get starseige or homeworld or starcraft
update ive been running the gog version of this game and it is stablethis game is boring because its all the same
if you get a different pokemon it doesnt matter
you do the same thing over and over
you attack and beat and attack and beat
its too easy too
i thought pokemon snap was much better
that game was one of my favorites
this game just has no point
fighting is the only thing you do
i mean the gameboy pokemon was better than this one
you get to go on an adventure and find things and get items
that was fun
this is fighting only
boring
if you want a good pokemon game get any of them for gameboy including yellow blue red gold silver
or even better get pokemon snapis it me or is this game really boring repetitive commentary pointless competitions no advancement for beginners to masters and even the fun little party games are quick and boring
there are several parts to the game the challenge road where you go through six pokemon categories each getting more difficult
there is the freestyle where you battle against other pokemasters or your friends
there are even nine party games which get old very fast
you are supposed to use your own pokemon from your gameboy pack but there is a way to cheat by using the rental pokemon which comes with all  pokemon instead of having to earn them
even children get bored quickly of the game
there is a good part to the pokemon stadium package it comes with a piece of hardware that lets you play your gameboy on the n
this also is not a rpg like the pokemon gameboy games areif you have a gameshark get this game
i thought it would be easy but now i need a gameshark
i named my pikachu rocky and it only says quotpikaquot on stadium
if youre good at stadium you could get this game too
get if you can beat red and blue without cheating
that is what yellow is like without a gameshark
i cant even pass celadon city because pikachu is so scaredi was really desprite to get this game because i wanted ahelicopter gunship game
i had commanche gold but that was good for beginers
i wanted something more advanced
i bought thishere is my two cents
this game was terrible
do not listen to anyone saying it is good
if you really want a good attack helicopter game get quoteenemy engaged rah commanche vs ka hokum b aligatorquot long name but good game
now back to gunship
as everyone said the waypoont system just plain doesnt work you have to go through a whole menu system and it only worked for me during the demo
the cpg is a usless jerk who never does anything you say
and if you play as the cpg the pilot always gets you killed
firing a missile at the target you want is nearly impossible and for the price this is just a real rip offso in a summary all i can say is dont buy this buy somethiung elseafter playing doa ultimate for xbox people may be tempted to buy this version for dreamcast
dont bother this version for dreamcast is extremely boring
it has zero replay value
this game is garbage compared to the better xbox versionsother dreamcast games that are  times better virtua fighter  soul calibur and project justice
these  games are excellent and are only available on dreamcastjust when you thought it was safe to put off baldurs gate here comes icewind dale
a magnificent combination of bg and the older games in the gold box series
dungeon hacking and roleplaying at their bestin  icewind dale you form an entire party of your player characters compared  other bg engine games in which you were allowed one main player
this  makes it more fun allowing you to watch your adventurers progress one at a  time as they grow so much more powerful than they were when the game  begananother added bonus is the addition of new spells and monsters
the enemy ai is stronger and the new monsters such as mind flayers will  provide enough fun and frustration to make this game a challenge for any  level playerlook out diablo  icewind dale is a major contender to  knock you off the number one spot
one error for diable  and its gone  because icewind dale is perfectthis game is the worst
it has bad gameplay and bad graphics so what ever you dodont buy this gamethis will also be my review for every subsequent smackdown
game
after wcw started to lose popularity thq started to do wwfthemed wrestling games
when it did even beginning on the n there were hints that they were turning what was a good system into complete crap
they finally succeded so to speak if that was their actual intent when they started the smackdown
series
i have no problems with the graphics the entrances or the sound in this game
i have the biggest problem however with the gameplay and how the game controlsfirst off they gave the game arcade style feel and controls
big mistake
they also made it more like the actual show you have to continually punch the guy before you can start doing grappling moves
i may be in the minority but constantly punching a guy gets old fast
i want to be able to start throwing suplexes and hitting piledrivers right off the bat
secondly the games ai
has gotten extremely intelligent
too intelligent
the game can kick your ass unless youre a great gamer and im just average maybe a little below
mainly because of the counter system
the game goes like this punch punch punch punch grapple movecounter movecounter move etc
youll get countered excessively and your counters wont work most of the time
yes it is a lot like the actual wrestling you watch on tv but for a wrestling game to be fun in my opinion it cant be realistic in terms of following how an actual wrestling match would go
i dont want to spend over an hour or more in a match  minutes is plenty unless its a royal rumbletype matchthq threw out the window the great grappling engine they had with the n games and has replaced it with this tripe
i honestly dont understand what the fans see in this series of game
i guess if you like your matches in the game to follow how the matches on the show work and you enjoy the actual wrestling to a be a chore and full of nonstop punching and countering than this is the game for you
if you want an actual fun wrestling game then i suggest you stick with thqs wcw games on the n
at least then they had the right ideawell where do i start
we all know about the basicsthe lack of tech support the missing roleplaying element and the incredible lag
but it isnt these things that make this game so horrid to play
one can wing  it without tech supportand i have on many occasions out of  necessityi can also wait out lag or just reconnect
i missed the  quotquestquot part of everquestbut still managed to get some  enjoyment out of the graphics
nowheres the real reason why you  shouldnt get everquest
after around level  or so if you are a  talented soloist you are forced to group to gain levels
thats right  folks
you have no choice in the matter
guess what this means
this  means you have to group with  other vicious backstabbing whining  complaining  year olds that have absolutely no respect and little if any  regard for you
id much rather put my trust in a rabid pit bull than  trust the life of my character to a cleric who plays like a  wizardenough said
you will probably buy this gameand probably  think back on this review and say quotwell he was right after allquot
and i have only one thing to say to thati told you soi tried playing this game but right from the start i knew i was in trouble
no matter what i changed in the video options or on my monitor this game was just too dark
the first guy i talked to i couldnt even see and the item he left me i couldnt find because it was just too dark
this is the only game i have had this problem with
it could be an awesome game but i will never knowthis game could have been so much more
the hack and slash action is not even fun it just gets tedious and boring
i have to admit the graphics are spectacular but that does not make this a great game
rune contains lots of jumping from object to object which will get boring after they first introduce it into the game
the game also had no depth whatsoever
i never just want to play it for fun because i felt there almost is no fun in this game
in my opinion if you are going to get a hack and slash action game get blade of darknesssent back did not workthis game kinda stinksyou go talk to this old dude who gives you these long drawn out battle plansthen you watch these long drawn out cut scenesthen you go into these mapworldswhen you get near an enemyyou fightwellsort ofthe computer does everythingtheres a lot of complicated planning involvedtheres no clear cut way to figure out anythingits a real pain in the hineywhats more is i dont belive i even saw any ogresof course im only on like level  since the game is totaly screwedi bought it used and the guy before me only got that far toono wonder i got this so cheapthis game will use up all of your extra brain spaceif you thought out how to beat ityou wouldnt have the brain sense left to eat cheeriossomeone would have to run you an ivyoud almost have to be like freakin fixated on its endedits totaly freakin ridiculousand then as youre being slain by little people with stickseven though youre sporting a dragonyou are helpless to defend yourselfit sucksmr cage
i love your games but this just sucked
oh why do they make me type so many wordsthis game was too easy too stupide not enough challange shall i go on
after so many good games for this creampuff he finally got into a bad game
lets hope this is only a fluke like for sonic who made a number of bad  games after quotsonic amp knucklesquot before we got quotsonic  adventurequotim a big time d fighting veteran and i can tell which fighter is worth playing all over and which is worth ditching
marvel vs capcom for the playstation is an example of one of those d fighters that needs to be ditched
but dont get me wrong 
i actually liked the gameon the dreamcast and arcade
the playstation version of marvel vs capcom is just swarming with a whole lot of flaws
trust me 
this is not arcade perfect 
most of the times arcade translations that go to the playstation come out imperfect like this one
the graphics are just horrible 
sure the characters and stages look colorful but if you pay attention to the framerates of the animations youll notice that the characters dont move smoothly or move faster
the audio sounds great
music tracks and sound effects are brilliant but nothing special at all
and as for the gameplay just horrible
and the lack of a tag feature 
now this is really going overboard 
just like in marvel super heroes vs street fighter for the playstation you have to call up your character to do a onehit special move
if you want the tag feature youll have use the cross over mode but this feature doesnt emulate the tag features on the superior arcade and dreamcast versions
the controls couldve been slicker but instead it ended up choppy
it seems that the playstation controller was not meant for great games like this
all in all the psx version of marvel vs capcom is a big letdown
choppy animation choppy controls lack of a tag feature and long loading times during the beginning of each fight really makes this game look like a zero
if you want the real marvel vs capcom experience id say buy the dreamcast version of marvel vs capcom or spare a few quarters or tokens to play the arcade version
the dc version of marvel vs capcom featured flawless animations awesome graphics hyper fast controls no loading times and a tag feature
now thats an arcade perfect translation of one of the best d arcade fighters of all time 
the dc version is definently worth the money and worth your time 
please 
whatever you do avoid the psx version 
this version of marvel vs capcom is a disgrace to capcoms ever expanding lineup of d fighters 
not really something to use your money on yes to a highschool kid working at mcdonalds for five fifteen have to spell it out for amazon an hour  bucks was a lot
even though there was the internet it was still growing
you still couldnt find a review for every game you were interested in buying
sometimes it still came down to word of mouth or hoping there was an open copy you could play at funcoland
i however went by word of mouth
sure this is a great game try it youll like it
like a sucker i put down my big  which was probably ths of my total paycheck
i smiled in joy as a road the bus home with my new found game
yiiipppieeeeee
i couldnt wait
i come home and pop this wonderful gem in
of course this game is badass
how can i go wrong look at that hardcore cover
a soldier thats ready for war what more could you want
then the game starts and i begin to play it
the screen is dark too dark i cant see anything
i adjust the brightness on my television
im a little green guy who shoots pellets or maybe bullets out his gun in a horrible looking world with horrible aiming and horrible controls that make the entire screen move awkwardly with each step
i think to myself this will get better this is probably just like this on the first stage
then as i play i realize that it doesnt change it never changes
its just green globe of pixels that shoots a horribly aimed weapon in a dimly lit world
how could this be
how could what could have been a fun game be so crappy
even in ps days this game was unacceptable
that comes from a guy that plays ps games still in 
this game slowly crushed my gaming dreams and made me hate the name do
i cursed it and spat at it
i immediately went back to the story and tried to make an excuse to return the game
i told them it was defective and that the game was too dark to see actually that was more of the truth than anything else
i begged and pleaded with the manager but unfortunately she showed me a new copy of the game opened it before my eyes smashing my hopes of returning it as new and handed it to me
i looked down in my hands at a new copy of the same turd i just tried to flush
i took the game and walked out the store with my head hung low
a month later that toys store burned down
i smiled as i passed by
a feel of ease that no one would have to suffer anymore and knowing that numerous copies of army men world war had perished in that fire
yes i had one that war
i lost the battle when i returned it but i won in the endps
i didnt start the firei bought xmenmutant academy as an xmen fan
i wanted to like it but it was just awful
the graphics suck the sounds are cheap and the whole game itself is all around cheesey
no way that this game is worth the money go buy some xmen comics insteadthis is the most boring game for game boy
all of the moves are kick punch rage
that is it
if you want a good game i would agree
i would get street fighter alpha here is yet another poor xmen game for the gbc courtesy of activision only this one is the worst
while the ps version of xmen mutant academy wasnt half bad this gbc conversion is downright terrible thanks to the clunky controls insanely easy difficulty bland backgrounds and scratchy sound
while the player animations are colorful they are quite jerky and while the selection of fighters is nice there is just something more to be desired
all in all even if your the biggest xmen fan leave this game on the shelf its terribleim a pretty good gamer but sometimes theres a few little hidden quotextrasquot in a game worth checking out
gameshark lets you do it
if youre patient
and have a lot of time
and dont mind hoping that your codes work after you swith the gs disc with the game
and dont care that it doesnt fit in port  so many games it works for cant even use ituntil i read rob matthews review of this game
i am also stuck on the training mission
i never got past it since i would go up the elevator shoot a guard and then wind up at the beginning
this is a bug to end all bugs
it felt like i was in that star trek episode where they kept repeating the same day over and over againi had high hopes for this gameyes this game is amazingly difficult as the quotconsquot say up above
the enemies do the same thing every time you play the level so basically you just play the same level over and over to find out the scripting of that level so you can make an attempt to beat it
and quick your hit might leave so its timed
also it took me an hour to beat the tutorial which is required
and even worse you cant save during levels which makes it frustrating
barely over  small maps
maybe a few more
bad gamei had looked forward to this game for months
it installed without incident
the problem i had was the tutorial beginning with the elevator lesson 
the booklet says to quotcall elevatorquot
i didnt have to because the elevator was already there with its door open
then the instructions are to click on the control panel and select quotbasement level quot
clicking on the control panel did not work
what did work was to spin wildly inside the elevator clicking on the walls and everything else until it moved
then i go to the very last lesson  with the sniper rifle
i could not put it down and was unable to finish the tutorial and as a result could not play the game
this game is loaded with bugs
dont take my word for itgo to eidosinteractivecom and look at the forums for hitman
i wasnt the only one to have trouble in the elevatorafter suffering through the first quotwho wants to be a millionairequot game i felt hopeless
i was dazed and confused
i didnt have a whisper of hope for the future of humanity
and then i saw the second game in the series on the shelves
i said quotid heard the questions arent repeated as muchquot and i decided to buy it just to see if it was trueits true the questions arent repeated as much as before
the problem is now theyre much harder
its impossible to get anything higher than  now
and since the questions dont repeat youll never get to the topbut whats the worst part
thats the only change that was made to this game
nothing else
its as if the first game had no problems whatsoever
regis is still appallingly rude and impatient the quotfastest fingerquot mode still doesnt let you put the four answers in order the game still quits if you take too long to do things you still cant skip the introduction sequence the phoneafriend lifeline is still worthless theres still no option to make the games easier or harder you still only get instructions once and theres still no option to use the mouse
regis even says exactly the same stuff as beforei bought the game out of total curiosity just to see if this game was really any better than the first
as it turns out it is virtually the exact same game
it has all the problems of the first except for one which was replaced by another onethis game has not been improved one bit over the first
the makers didnt even try to improve it
this game displays total laziness and lack of creativity
its not worth one second of your timeokay people its time for me to really point out reasons to not buy a ps  now that i actually got several hours of gaming with this system and five  different games to come up with my answer
to start out i visited my  friends house one day and saw his new playstation  he had gotten
when i  asked if we could play it he didnt really want to this from a guy who  has three and a half shelfs with nothing but playstation games
thats  practically every game sony made
 but finally agreed
i can now see  why
not only were the games nothing sony promised us they said the games  were going to be a revolution
i fail to see how
for one thing the  graphics are nothing that the dreamcast hasnt offered us
for onther  things were still getting the sames games over and over
just with better  graphics
no internet play sega already has an advantage with that in  mind
 and didnt sony promise us it would be compatable with playstation  games
i thought so too
but only  of the  games we tried to do this  with worked
and it didnt enhance the graphics
the dvd player is  nothing but trash also
it wont play many movies and those it does play  dont have very good quality
plus dvd players are on cell phones  practically why would we want them on a game counsel especally if youve  already got a dvd player
plus almost all games playstation or  playstation  games freeze up countless times
in tekken because i was  fighting too fast the system froze up on me but yet in sonic adventure on  dreamcast im running on walls jumping off buldings and zooming around  the place at  miles per hour and the game doesnt glich once
now  thats sad for sony anyway
and when it comes down to the worst games  ive played yet dont expect this system to last long
with that in mind  please be careful when buying this system it might be worse thanyou  thought it would beunlike the other reviews i was very disappointed with the game
i was very excited the the game game out
love the cartoon series
i made the mistake of purchasing it before testing it on a rental
i thought it moved too slowly and the battles with other digimon was unstimulating
the only good thing i can say about the game are the graphics are excellent and the sound fx are okay
rent this game if you can before you purchase it  just in case you dont like itthis was greatly disapointing at the time it was released i was highly anticipating this game
took some years later to get around to getting a copy and it definitely wasnt worth the waitthis is not worth even calling a game in my opinion
the fact you have to take your digimon partner to the bathroom every minutes made me giveup my first game after a while of torturing myself and hoping it got better but kept getting more disapointed
if you dont take your partner to the bathroom it poops on the ground and if you walk too close after he eats it
and the only way to clean it is for him to eat itand it gets harder to avoid the more accidents your partner makes
instead of a flash or something it makes you wait for your digimon to use the potty
the character who is human dont ever eat or use the toiletas far as i have seen which is odd since your character is supposed to be a boy from the physical world and your partner digimon is supposed to be a digital monsterso you would think the reverse would be more likelyso you are left with  options run to the bathroom to keep your partner from having an accident  or let him have accidents and once he eats so many hell digivolve into numemon who is supposed to happen to digimon who are poorly trained and dont have personal cleanlinessbut if you train and still make a few accidents but always feed your partner when hes hungry he will still end up numemon
and if your traveling to follow the story its hard to time it so you find your way to the next bathroom before the next accident occursi will not buy or rent any of the next games because this was such a failure
i mean do you train your dog to use the toilet then watch him everytime he goesagvn should review this i mean the game is not fun at all what i have played
the sims ill admit the characters have to use the toilet occasionally but its a longer time inbetween bathroom breaks and you can switch between characters when one is in the bathroom you dont have to watch and wait when you just want to play the darn gameokay i heard all the bad things about the game
but i thought nah it cant really be that bad people are just expecting too much
well i was wrong the game is that bad
and i tried so very very hard to like it
i love sports games and was addicted to nflk religiously so when i heard sega was doing a baseball game i was waiting desperatly for itunfortunatly it doesnt come close to even triple play  the graphics are at times very very good but  they have a tendency to repeat the same things all the time
the pitcher does the same thing on the mound every timethe biggest problem is gameplay it doesnt really have any
when you look at other baseball games out there on other systems this is sad
dreamcast has something to prove to both the people who have bought it and to psx addicts
that we havnt made a mistake in buying and supporting the system
but with a title as bad as this it doesnt help the causethe commentary is the flatest dullest most braindead there is
the difference in quality between nflk and wsk is huge
nflk is a very cool game and nflk looks even better
if this game had been to its standard we would have had something to really write aboutnow my hope goes to espn baseball early next yearsega has never let us down with every release of its topnotch baseball game world series baseball
it has always been the game to beat
until now
it boggles the mind how sega refused to even remotely worry about the people actually playing this piece of garbage
sure the graphics are the most superb ive ever witnessed
but the inability to control your fielders is not a good thing
add that to the fact that your fielders also seem to be playing for your opponentsim sorry but you just do not wait until a line drive is right next to you before deciding to move after it
and youve got the worst game ever
not the worst sports game the worst game ever
period
i wouldnt make my worst enemy play thisgraphics   it just dont get better control   yeah so you can throw and swing so what
sound   its a baseball game whatd you expect metallica
quotfunocityquot  me no like muchoverall  star  this game is a lot like those certain girls in high school looks good but you still wouldnt touch it with a foot poleeveryone who owned a dreamacst couldnt wait
they were sitting on the edge of their seat just waiting and waiting for the arrival of the first baseball game for the dreamcast
world series baseball keveryone who bought it including me was shocked
did sega forget that a great baseball video game is more than just graphics
when i got this game along with nba k and nfl k i was amazed by the graphics
preston wilson looked batted and threw exactly like he actually does and the stadiums were just breathtakingi couldnt wait to get into the game so i did an exhibition game
i was stunned
there was no maualfielding option hitting was nearly impossible and getting through an inning without getting shelled was just as hard
i played this game for about  minutes trying to figure out if it was just me that i was so bad and that there was no manualfielding but i realized thats the way the game is
after playing once or maybe twice i put this game away for good then traded it in along with a few other games for sonic adventure  and soul calibur
thats probably the best move i ever had madei now own world series baseball k because i knew it couldnt get any worse
the player graphics are worse but the stadiums are more detailed
the rosters are more uptodate the gameplay is excellent pitching is fun hitting has been improved a lot and of course you can actually field unlike this gamewsb k is a terrible game
if you want a baseball game for your dreamcast get wsb k
its awesomei wish that i used to review games as a job because the only way i can play world series baseball k is if i were paid to do itthis game has great graphics of course but the game play is equally reciprocated
in this game you are only allowed to throw and hit
all the  excitement of robbing your opponent of a home run with a stellar catch or a  taking away a base hit with a diving catch is taken away
you cannot play  defense at all
your job is to throw in the right direction but that is  even tasking because the response time is so slow that you have to press  the throw button repeatedly
even if you get the throw off in time your  player receiving the throw will take a couple seconds before he finally  attempts to make a tag and by then its obviously too late
speaking of  delayed reactions the commentary is too monotonous and belongs with the  ranks of genesis games
i would take the classic quotbases  loadedquot over this junk any dayplease dont get this game it sure aint worth any ten bucks heck i wouldnt pay  cents for it worst game i ownshen mue has received rave reviews from almost every online site and magazine that i have come across
but interestingly enough almost every reader board i have seen online has expressed a very different opinion this game was terribly disappointing
im an rpg fan so im used to running around towns and talking to people but when youre forced to do this for hours on end without any action it gets tediousand more tediousand frustratingand finally you want to throw your dreamcast out the window
i honestly think that the only reason this game received such great reviews was simply because it was one of the first rpgs on dreamcast
now that grandia ii phantasy star and skies of arcadia have been released rpglovers have a much better selection to choose from
pick up one of those great games instead and dont even bother with shen mue
from start to finish its just one big disappointment after anotherlet me start off by saying that i am a huge nintendo fan and the dk games are some of my all time favs
dk country on the super nes is a true platform classic
now when i heard that game was being ported to the gbc i was excited
i remembered how great the dk land games were on the gameboy so i knew that this game would be just as goodthe moment i got this for my birthday i hurridly popped it into my gameboy
the game at first seemed alright the sprites and graphics during gameplay looked like crap and moved super stiffly
even the older dk land games had better physics
but i chugged along with the game upon getting further in the game i just couldnt take it anymore the crappy gameplay got to me enough i could not play it anymore it kept pissing me off this was nowhere near as fun as the supernes versionin the end i ended up throwing the cartridge against the wall
be smart and stay away from this piece of junk go buy the gba version or supernes version or buy it off the vc
i love dk but this game is pure garbagei owned this game when i got a game boy advance and i can tell you it sucked
graphics  terrible graphics
even an arcade game would have better graphics
other gbc games would have better graphics
i am disgustedmusic  they screwed up the music and put other stuff in the gamegame play  harder and less funoverall  stay away from itits too late to have a refund but the rumble pak doesnt work
plus the seller didnt take out the batteries
really
want battery acid all over itthis is only a rumble if you are under  years old otherwise its tremble that is not worth the money or the aa batteries that you need for it
the rumble pack fits into the slot of your n controller and then a save pack fits into the rumble pack making the controller quite heavy
there are two settings for the pack low and high
another annoying part of the pack is that there are two modes one to turn the rumble pack on and the other to work your gamepack to save games
its just a hassle and the only games that really use it are zelda when you are fishing and sporting games so you can feel the actioni remember seeing previews for this game a couple of years ago beautiful sweeping lanscapes and dragons floating through the sky
i decided to buy the game about a year ago i was poor and waiting for the price drop
i had hoped that this could fill the void as i awaited the release of final fantasy x on the playstation well ffx has come and went as have countless other games and i still cannot muster the energy to put the sad sad legend of dragoon out of its misery
i dont even know where to begin damning this game so lets begin at the beginningfirstly who in the world conceived the lousy pitiful soundtrack
from the opening title screen on it seems as if the music was composed by some hairmetal band after a suicide attempt
and the plot
cant squaresoft sue
i mean i have never seen a bigger ripoff of final fantasy vii from the spiky haired lead character to the silver haired foe leading him by the nose across the world
unfortunately for all the results are far inferior to the square offeringalso who in the world translated this thing
i assume it is translated i hope it is translated i pray it is translated sigh
every character needs about a paragraph to say what could be thoroughly explained in a sentence
does anyone even care about these characters
i sure dontoh lets not forget the battle engine
before every random encounter the screen melts away like sand followed by a sweeping camera laying out the poorly drawn field of battle followed by a shot of the characters and then one of the monsters
this happens before every battle
i estimate a good ten hours of playtime is wasted just from thisoh and the battles
dont even get me started
i will describe but one of the uncountably infinite shortcomings a character can only cast magic while in the dragoon state
this makes every battle unbearably long and expect to be hit with a random encounter every  seconds or soi guess im left to ask what was the big deal
personally i feel sorry for the schmoes who plunked down full price for this stinker and apparently there were a lot of you this game is a bestseller
i suppose this is the reason for the ridiculously high rating this knockoff has received
well if there is anyone else thinking of buying this dont
i hope the rant has dissuaded you
zero starsi will stop you to go forward the portal watcher of ulara said to me the main protagonist
of course what she meant was i wont let you pass
above is just one hilarious example of the terrible dialogue in this game
the dialogue is consistently this bad throughout the entire game demeaning the characters story and entire game to amateur leveldungeons are the heart of this games gameplay which are long and tedious
same areas are used in different locations with at least one battle in each area
the numerous battles and repetitious dungeons make the gameplay incredibly slow and drysupposedly this game is well known for its cool battle quirks
this is true almost everything you do in a battle is effected in some way by player performance
however i did not find this to be enjoyable
after hundreds of battles i was pleading for the game to automate my attacks
repetition of buttontiming and buttonmashing mini games during battles became tiresome extremely fastsoundtrack was quite nice though paralleling final fantasy series quality
this however doesnt make up for the rest of this messwith poor story and gameplay this game is not something i enjoyed playingthere is no way this game could be fun at all
all you can do is select a ship you cant even build your own you have to choose a preselected class choose your crew you can read there bio but it most often wont help you choose then you install parts you cant even place the parts in your ship they just appear there and the part discription isnt helpfull at all then select a misson and just watch an icon travel over a d map of space in real time with an occasional mini movie
very boring dont waste your moneywhat in the name of creation led to the production of this revolting pile of poop
if starship creator and its deluxe edition werent enough of an embarrassment then the authors certainly achieved what has to be the greatest defacation of software garbage in the st gaming genre
i personally couldnt believe that i actually bought this worthless piece of junk but in saving face i can admit that i did so based on name alone lowering my opinion for the licensing standards of the st name that paramount retains
whoever created second edition of this game should be shot
it maintains the same rediculous promises that it never delivers in previous versions and worse yet it leaves out ships that were part of previous releases
on the upside it allows you to export the ships you create the into dominion wars ds game which might be useful
otherwise you are wasting time as far as a stand alone product especially if you are expecting to have a good time
evidently what passes for fun with simon amp schuster is the kind of game that plays like a dos reject without the frills bells or whistles
to make matters worse its graphic content reflects this philosophy making it the worst st game i have ever played
do not waste your money on this game
you will not experience any actual gameplay outside of selecting parts or crew members from a list
this game bitesi cant believe square soft put out a game with game play and a storyline as lame as vagrant story
the battle commands are unwieldy and  timeconsuming and the dialog balloons are rather childish and  distracting
granted some of the effects and characters are neat but i  have to say the best thing about this game was the opening sequence
after  that its a disappointment for experienced gamers
i played the game for  about three hours until i couldnt stand it anymore thinking i would get  used to it but i just didnt like itreally
i dont understand why some one would buy this
the ps isnt going to get any more stable with the help of it and is pretty stable without it and all it does is put a blue plastic bar in front of the ps
its a waste of money unless you want a blue plastic bar in front of your ps i dont see the point but if you think itll make your ps look better i guess that could be worth buying
but if you are buying it cause you think it will be functional for anything um sorry theres nothign it really does the vertical stand at least offers a little more stabilityi believe it was pt
barnum who said theres a sucker born every minute
if barnum knew anything about sonys vertical and horizontal stands for the ps he would have added and that sucker shells out  bucks for useless plasticim sure sony had some reasoning other than money to create and market this thing
the carpeting thing as many people mentioned is one but i dont see why anyone would do that in the first place
i think it even says in the ps instructions not to place it on carpet
and i know that its not for stability though the title of my review may be poking fun at it but this thing is all around uselesslook at the features air circulation
raises the gaming unit
stabilizes
sleek design and looks cool
whatever
wanna know how to get around this
circulation  dont put your ps on carpet under water buried in dirt or anywhere near your little brothers pokemon toys
raises the gaming unit  try putting it up on blocks as one reviewer suggested or if you like get a car jack and just raise the thing and lower it to your preference
stabilizes  i could go into a fifteen paragraph tangent about that one but i wont
you all know what i would say
sleek design and looks cool  if youre worried about your pss looks you probably have more issues than a horizontal stand can fix
and if youre that concerned the ps will always look cooler than that purple toaster ovenshaped minidisk playing game cube
no offense to nintendoi reviewed the vertical stand too and i basically said the same thing
i dont own either and i have no plans to buy them
i think its just a way for sony to rip people off
no other game system needs something like this and im sure the next generation playstation wont need it eitheruhoh gotta go
i put my ps in the horizontal position and its starting to teeter
agh
its falling right toward my metal gear solid  gameeveryone keeps reviewing ps in general and its completely irrelevant
this is a new version
so let me review the one i gotthis is the new smaller design a little bigger than a dvd case
while it may look cool it is not recommended
the only pro is how cool it looksthe conswill accept ps memory cards and old ps memory cards but will not let you use them until you reformat them
this means if you wanted to continue that game you had saved on there dont count on itthe door for the game tray is a flip up instead of a drawer
youd think theyd have learned not to go back to this since their last design failed so frequently with this functionthe only reason you should get this playstation is ifa  you have never owned a playstation beforeb  you have no friends that own playstations so you wont have to worry about bringing games over eachothers places or showing your pal where you are on the game via his playstationc  you dont intend on playing your old games on the new system in any way shape or form
except by starting at the beginning and replaying the game all over againmaybe i seem a little bitter but my main grudge is that i just got home from playing a game i started at a friends house put  hours of work into then brought home
then i popped the memory card in played for another  hours all the while saving and having the playstation tell me it saved successfully when i realized that the game i was overwriting was actually the same game over and over
it never overwrote anything
so now when i turn off my playstation there goes  hours of workand what happens when i put in the new ps formatted memory card to see if i can save on that
oh hell no
ofcourse not it wont even recognize the memory card while the game is still inthanks a lot playstation
atleast if my new xbox screws up i can save it to the hard drive
jerkssony deletes the functionality of the hard drive upgrade and calls this an improved design
i beg to differfind the original full sized model unless you plan on putting this in your car or live in a very small box or van down by the riveri wish i had done my homework before purchasing this system
it has half the ram of an regular xbox console
game performance was slow
navigating was slow
size is great
it will fit anywherei loved the size of the new pstwo but it is still overpriced
you can buy an xbox for this price
even though the xbox is larger it has a more powerful processor and comes with a harddrive so you dont need to shell out even more money for memory cards such as playstations require
true playstation has a larger number of games but xbox has many high quality games coming out in the next few months
such as fable halo  mechassault  lone wolf ectpros
small size and portable
large game selection from ps and ps titlescons
priced as much as an xbox when this hits  dollars next year i will be first in line to buy it
games graphically challenged compared to xbox
more money for memory cards including special memory cards for ps game savessonytake a hint and reduce the price of pstwo or bundle it with memory cards two controllers and a game for this pricei loved the original playstation like everyone else
it was a great platform and had all the great games
but in my opinion the playstation  has been a total bust
averageatbest games hardware problems i had to send in my first ps for repairs because it decided it didnt need to read discs anymore
then it decided to start grinding circular ruts in my discs
i finally had to take a  loss and trade that pos in for a new one
the psp is getting dominated by the nintendo ds in games and in console sales
the ps is going to lose tons of market share to the xbox  because the former new kid on the block microsoft is a veteran now and knows what it has to do to cream sony
sony makes problem ridden hardware and is struggling
sony online is known for the worst mmo support ever witness their totally inept and bungling mismanagement of a solid gold franchise in star wars galaxies
if it wasnt for the japanese mafiastyle interwoven companies sony would have found itself shut out quite a while ago
the japan that can say no
how about the usa that will say no to sony when the xbox  comes out and the nintendo ds continues to crush the psp
the playstation  will be the last sony product i ever buyi wish i would have had the foresight to buy an xbox instead of the ps it had better exclusive games ninja gaiden halo jade empire etc
and was a more powerful and smoother system
sony the new segashouldnt sony be focusing on the ps
since they are diverting their resources to the pstwo the ps must be throwing in the toweli got a ps and i only had it for one year and broke
then i got a refund and bought another one and that broke within a year to
so thats why i didnt buy another one because i knew it would brake in a year to
i dont know why it stoped working the stupid pice of crap keeps saying error reading disc and none of my ps games were scratched up
so dont buy itin my country i could buy a console with a higher number modern but you send me one a little old
so this console get burn 
i did not return this item because is very expensive for me i live in costa ricasony failed to consider one thing for this redesigna fan
i had to replace my original ps which finally died after about  years of abuse
it took me forever to find one of the newer slimmer ps consoles
i did manage to buy one and within  days of use it died
i took the stupid thing back for an exchange but the eb games where i bought it was out so i got a refund
great customer service by eb games by the way
i got to talking to the girl that was working there and she said that these have been recalled because they have been overheating
the fan that they put in it is just way too small to handle the heat generated by the unit and the design is too small to allow proper heat dispersion
apparently sony is being very hushhush about the recall but now i know why i couldnt find a single one at best buy circuit city walmart target hh gregg or kmart
i was driving around all of northeast ohio for a day getting more and more curious as to why none of these stores had any
i didnt think it was because they were superpopular and it seems as though it certainly wasnt that
way to go sony  unleashing a redesigned piece of crap instead of just investing the time and dollars into developing the ps
dummiesxbox is for the serious gamers
if you like crappy graphics horrible online play and little kid games like rachet and clink spongebob squarepants and crash bandicoot then my all means buy the chumpstation
if you are a serious gamer and like your unit with its own memory that you can download music to online play that is insane amazing graphics more serious and adult games like halo and mechassualt then buy the xboxchumpstation   ages    yrs oldxbox  ages  and overi unwittingly bought a ps not knowing that id get a god awfull small game controller
i used it for a month and now i cant hardly move my hands or my fingers
dont buy playstation  theyve ruined my future
im writing this review right now by using a voice typing program that microsoft published especially for people whove ended up in my poor situationdue to the fact that there are many reviews for gamecube that say that it sucks are are obviously written by people have no idea what theyre talking about i will write my own review for ps that reflects the tards that write for gcnasthis saystem is really suckyd i have horriblesd gframmer and cant typesr worth craap
anywaqys insteasd of syaying anytghinmg important i willl just saty that ps suxxx abnda get a gamecube
bnow all you crappy reviewesirs kn ow what o feel laikieanyways thats it
the disgustingly sad part is the fact that tons of these reviews get placed on amazon and no matter how often i report them nothing happens
welcome to my sad little worldthis game is so badd i dont even want to talk about it one thing to say is the car control is horrible
whats a racing game with no car control
sega how could you let this one out of the dooraaaaaarrrrrrrhhhhhhggggggthis game is so horrible
i loved the movies but this game is just horrible
its not even worth a penny plus free shipping
some of the atrocious things are the jumps you cant jump over anything but you can jump even though you will never make it over anything
ljn just decided to put marty mcfly in a game and one of your weapons is throwing bowling balls
when did marty go around throwing bowling balls at people in the movie
just stay away from this game at all costsljn has a bad reputation of medicore or terrible games but they made some decent or good games but this is one of their worst yet to comeloosely based on the  masterpiece back to the future it seems your in hill valley  as you must try everything to collect clocks to save the time and your life from being erased from existencein this game everything is out to get you from bullies girls with hulahoops men with glass plates bees and darts
here marty is all dressed up in black like a punk instead of wearing his red jacket like in the movies and the music in this game loops over and over again like it makes you a bit crazy
theres some good things in the game that help fight enemies such as bowling balls you can use to throw at them and bad things like the skateboard which makes you go fast but you cant stop as this game goes in a bit of paperboyesque route of racing
theres even some hard minigames which is a breath of air from the horrible music playing such as the hit the bullies game which you have to kill  of them with milkshakes a game where you have to avoid being seen by martys past mother and the hardest one where you play at the high school promall in all its a real piece of junk from ljn that should be avoided even if you are a fan of the moviesthis game has nothing to do with the movie
the only thing famileur is the logo and the clock tower that arnt anything more then the start screensyou run through the streets and have to collect a bunch of clocks while avoiding running into the hooler hoops girls and killer bees and the ever so deadly park benchthis game has nothing to do with the movie at all
its more like a run and dodge em game like frogger only on a scrolling screen that seems to go absolutly no wherethe next game was a little better but still only  stars but least that game had the deloreon in itback to the future is one of the more popular movie franchises inthe movie industry
the game based off of the moviewas a bombshell
it isnt even based off of the movie since theres barely anything that relates to ityou play as a guy whos supposed to be marty but doesnt look like him
you walk through streets collecting clocks and shooting bowling balls
that already sounds nothing like the movie
the music is as annoying as the game itself
it loops until you turn off the gamethere is this one scene however where you play the guitar in an awkward way and different music plays
however its not johnny be good
instead its a garbled bit messcould the game be any stupider
yes it caneven if this game costs a quarter stay away
nes produces crappy games from exciting movies on purpose and ljn is guilty for that
its a cruel marketing tool to get kids to spend their hard earn money on crappy games
i played it once on a website that allows you to play nes games and boy the controls suck
its horrible
why
ill tell you when did marty sport a black shirt
it wouldnt hurt if these game developers make it red creativity is horrible
throwing milkshakes at bullies dodging hulla hoop girls park benches bumble bees clumsy moving crews holding pieces of glass that you cant see until you knock into themwhat more can i say
what kind of deadline was ljn tryin to reach
no excuse
 graphics were horrible even for  nes game music score was horrible same song loops over and over and it wasnt even in the movie overhead view of game in play gives me a headace and jump button is worthless if you cant jump over anything
like i said controls are akward ending is short and it sucks
after all that work trying to beat this difficult and horrible game you get a crappy ending
many ljn games for nes have these so bewaredont buy this game
also stay away from the mario bros rip off sequel ii and iiido you like paperboy but hate the part of the game where you have to play as a paperboy
then back to the future is the game for youforget about a story line
you start as some guy i assume marty
running down the street
you have to dodge hoolahooping women charging beefcake men and bees or maybe humming birds
just like in the movie you can grab a bowling ball and shoot these obstacles before they hit you
occasionally youll have a chance to grab a skateboard but that just makes you crash quicker
can you make it to the end of the block before  seconds runs outthe only thing in the game that kinda ties it to the movie is a picture of marty his brother and his sister on the bottom of the screen which fades away as time passes
of course i only know this because ive seen the movie and it really looks more like a picture of george washington jack white and nosferatu with a bad toupe now thatd be a great game
you have to grab alarm clocks to keep it from fading which makes perfect senselets say you make it through the five or so levels like this which are all pretty much the same itll get you to lous cafe hey something from the movie
 but thats when it gets even weirder
bullies to go it says as marty walks in
he grabs someone from behind the counter and slides her down to the end of the room
then it says boy they sure threw you out in a hurry and you have to replay the last street level
once you beat it this happens again
and each time you lose a life until its game over
is it even possible to make it past this part of the game
after several attempts ive concluded that no it is not possibleif you want to flash back to a time when video games made no sense and slapped any random movie title on a cartridge so that itd sell then this is the game for you
but if youre looking for anything that has to do with back to the future  music characters story a delorean  then youve come to the wrong placebut of course  was a simpler time where video games were usually one or two impossible levels that created endless frustration and we liked it that waythis nes game is nothing like the movie
you ride a skateboard through a street and dodge very deadly objects such as soda cans bannana peels kidney beans etc  thats it the whole game is you on a skateboard a sidescrolling screen trying to avoid objects being thrown at you
why are objects flying at you
who the  knowsthis is another tough gane not too exciting but my nephew likes it so i gave it to himi wish the graphics were more like the nes batamanok the nes controller is a good controller just dont buy it off amazon
you can get it cheaper at your local video game store or ebay
also you dont have to wait for shipping trust me staring at a nes knowing you cant play it is painfulthis game has nothing to do with the epic looking cover label art
it is like this weird samurai ninja game where you can jump impossibley  if thats a word  high and kill monsters with a sword that is about the size of a butter knifedont play this is a horrible rd party game and a complete waste of moneya friend gave me money to order this for him
i personally didnt like this game
its the worst in the double dragon seriesdouble dribble is an awful basketball game despite what anybody says
ive hated it back then and i hate it today
the controls are pretty choppy and all the game amounts to dunk steal dunk and then some
the shooting is impossible to do i just have a lot better chance making a dunk than shooting from anywhere else
my teammates are quite useless when it comes to playing defense
the only best part of the game is the dunking scene
but since i do it like every time it gets really boring
whats with the halftime show
the game wont let me to skip that forcing me to watch the dreadful display of cheerleading
all in all playing double dribble is like trying to eat lots of mayonnaise and nothing elsehave you ever wondered why they didnt do an uncle fester spinoff movie where he fights aliens in a neighborhood
guess they couldnt talk hollywood into that nobrainer so it must have gotten bumped down to the video game world
hopefully cousin its barber school adventure is up nextthis is one of those games that makes you wonder about the video game industry back in the day
would they just greenlight anything that had a semirecognizable name on it
apparently yes
or at least theyd take some crappy game and slap a name on it because this clearly has no ties to the world of the adams family beyond the titlebut lets put the story flaws aside and focus on the fact that the game is impossible to play
fester only gets two life bars which go fast when his laser gun he has a laser gun proves relatively ineffective on the aliens
you can shoot the nonmoving ones four or five times to get an item but even with upgrades i was unable to kill the jumping aliens which look suspiciously like the legend of zelda jumping creatures
each venture into the world lasted a minute or two and once you die the game is over and you start againpressing pause only brings up further questions
you can select between a gun and a whip for a weapon but i couldnt figure out how to change it
there are various items you can collect including keys and money but i never got anywhere that they could be usedas far as i can tell this game is impossible to play forget about playing through to the end because even surviving five minutes seems like a grand achievement
does fester even have a quest beyond survivalthis game ranks up there with back to the future and karate kid as one of the worst movie tieins ever
i mean come oni had the misfortune of getting this game back at the end  for my nes
at that time i also owned an atari xl with ultima iii exodus and ultima iv quest of the avatar which are really enchanting rpg if you dont mind the crude graphics so i was hoping hydlide would be another ultima but boy was i wrong
lets get with the music its some of the worst video game music i have ever heard
cheap ripoff of the indiana jones theme song which keeps repeating itself over and over every  seconds
i never wanted to play this game unless the volume was turned off because the music will get on your nerves in no time flat
this quotmusicquot which i refuse to think of as music sounds like the worst garbage youd hear from a music box
the graphics are very crude looking and even for the bit nes capability its really horrible the graphics of bionic commando is miles better than this garbage
heck even the old atari bit adapation of the ultima series looks better
how about playability
well you have to run in to slimes and other monsters and press the a button to try to destroy them but more chances than not youll end up killed
often if you stand in the wrong vegetation or you stand in the cemetary your hit points drain without even monsters touching you until you gain enough experience points
basically in this game youre supposed to collect all three fairies before youre able to kill the dragon
it took me ten years to finally win the game
that was in  i finally won the game because i was finally able to find that third fairy
i didnt realize i was supposed to kill two wizards at once with the wave spell to get that last fairy
perhaps the worst of this game is when you want to save it
you need to obtain an unnecessiarly long password and write it down
more chances than not you have written the password incorrectly and you pretty much lost what you accomplished in this horrible game
the ultima series were wonderful spellbinding rpgs as long as you owned the atari apple or commodore  rather than the nes or snes adaptation
hydlide is now regarded as not only the worst fantasy rpg ever made but one of the worst ever made for nes
i have no idea what the makers of this game were thinking
perhaps they were trying to cash in on the legend of zelda fad of the time and fell horribly flat
i have played much better nes games including their adaptation of willow as well as shadowgate which means you are much better off checking out those games than hydlide unless you want to see just how bad games can getthere is a lot to be said about hydlide unfortunately all of it is bad
first off the game breaks the standard that you dont touch enemies because it hurts you
in this game you hold the a button to change to attack mode and then blindly run into the enemy to hope that you win
if you die you lose everything and start all over from the beginning and you will die a lot in this gamethe sound is horrible the music is the same seven second loop of a theme that sounds very much like the indiana jones theme songthe graphics are okay for the nes i suppose i cant knock those too much since the system wasnt that powerfulthe save system is misleading and led to a very angry me
in the menu there is an option to save load and password
i hate passwords and so i just saved and quit
well the carriage has no internal battery so the save only works for if it is still on
you have to use the really long password to reload your game
and of course it changes every single time you access the password screeni have only scratched the surface of the confusion and bad design choices that is hydlide
if you find a good price and you think you might hate yourself pick this up and see for yourself
i got my copy for a dollar and i felt like that was almost too muchi am appalled at how poorly this game was designed
the story is just lame and without the instruction booklet or a online faqwalkthroughm it is hard to figure out what youre supposed to do next because of the screwiness
most games one can easily figure out how to play it soon enough without a booklet but this game was just awful
the whole running at enemies bit was just shoddy and the seemingly random scavenger hunt for items seemed as if it was written by a idiotthe music terrible
the levelups weak
the mapquestworld horrid
the controls ugh
i seriously could not bring myself to continue this game i quit about halfway because i just didnt want to waste my time anymore not when this game had nothing to offer in way of fun or entertainment
this is easily one of the worst video games ever inventedall the megaman games are way to dawn hard esspessially mm  thats insane
i have played all these and the only one i enjoyed and played alot was megaman  on origional gameboy the rest just pissed me offso this is considered the greatest mega man game ever
really
i mean really
no one has the balls to be objective
i guess not so ill have to do it
suffering from more of the same syndrome mega man  was little more than a retread of that which made the first mega man as irritating as it was but a bit more playable focused and inspired in the level structures bosses and other necessities
gravity is still a harsh mistress to the megster and the overall look of the game is still very mids nes dreckish but it was around this time that the series started to better itself by way of adding a few more elements to the series namely the  boss rule the various little tools that helps mega man traverse hardtoreach areas and those blessed etanks
nevertheless mega man  did really nothing more than keep the franchise afloat for another game until things started to really take offhideo kojima the creator of metal gear was not involved in making this version of metal gear
check wikipedia if you are doubtful
this game was made by money grubbing game makersunlike all other metal gear games this one isnt about trying to be stealthy
its an imitation of a run nshoot type game
i repeat the creator of metal gear was not even involved in this
its only metal gear by namedidnt work at all
we tried eighty ways from sunday to get it to play but it would just do a weird little demoi could not believe how terrible this game was
the controlls are sloppy and the gameplay is horrible
you cant do anything
if you pick up a weapon or something you cant do anything with it
avoid this gamethis game is so so but the thing that kills it completely is the horrible stupid controls
mario seems to have greese on his boots as he always slides of edges and makes crappy jumps to his death no matter what you do
the graphics were pretty good for the time and the game is some what fun for about a half hour before it gets too repeditive to the point where you never want to see it again
mario  is the best one
this game only sold so many copies because it was shipped out with every nes  system
nintendo entertainment system saved the gaming market not this crappy gamesuper mario bros  is absolutely horrible
super mario bros  is a lot better but its a little overrated the original super mario bros beats them both easily
but super mario world is nearperfect making them all seem like nothing
mario has made a lot of great games in his day but super mario bros  was a terrible failure
the graphics and sound are bad
the gameplay isnt what youd expect from classic mario games
picking up enemies instead of stomping on them is too hard to do and takes too long
there arent a lot of powerups and theyre not good powerups either
super mario bros  and  are great especially  if you really want to know how bad this piece of junk is then get this i cant think of a single good thing to say about mario 
the best quality in the game is poor qualitypresentation graphics sound gameplay replay value overall dear god please let this horrible game be a figment of my imaginationnope its real
what an unbelievable piece of overrated garbage super mario bros  is
for the life of me i dont get the appeal of this game
through each of the eight boring worlds its just the same thing every time run to the end of each and every extremely short uncreative level collecting worthless crap so you can move on to the next short uncreative level
super mario bros  is complete baboon poop
it really is
nothing good about this game at all
no reason for mario or video game fans to remember this crappy adventure
no reason for this game to exist
thank god there are sensible people out there such as myself to give you the honest truthlets get right to the point and talk about all the stinky thingsone and this is the biggest reason super mario bros  isnt any good
you can only play as mario and luigi
in super mario bros  you can play as the princess and toad in addition to mario and luigi
not so here
in this game mario and luigi dont even have anything unique to separate the two so they are basically the same exact person except mario is red and luigi is green
remember how high luigi can jump in super mario bros 
well now he jumps just like mario
absolutely no reason for this
if anything luigi should have many more interesting things about him this time around since after all super mario bros  comes after super mario bros  and youd think the most logical thing would be to continue adding more things with each new series
but in this case you get less
i guess nintendo forgot to make luigi stand apart from marioanother problem this game is so freakin predictable
gee after the desert world i go to a water world
you dont say
what
theres an ice world and a plant world coming up
no way
and whats this i see
the final world will be big dark evil fire world
i didnt see that coming
thanks nintendo for making mario fans look like complete idiots
way to goother serious problems become noticeable after a couple hours of playtime such as the fact that you have to do so much boring jumping in this game
you have to jump on top of or over so many things that it becomes an absolute chore after world  if you even make it that far without shutting off the game that is
if you find anything exciting about jumping over pipes or jumping on top of goombas or picking up and kicking buzzy beetles then i recommend seeking professional helpok what else makes super mario bros  suck so much
it cant get any worse right
yes it can
after you beat the game a message comes up on the screen that says thank you but our princess is in another castle
just kidding hahaha
you mean to tell me after all that long hard and tedious work making it to the very end nintendo is going to joke around and make like the adventure isnt over yet
before the just kidding part you might very well rip apart your controller or punch a hole in your tv screen all because nintendo wants to play around and pretend theres still more to the adventure
i cant even think of appropriate words to describe how angry this makes me
tears of anger are almost dripping down my face
nintendo never should have done that
i bet that most people who first seen that message really thought the princess was in another castle and came this close to killing the nearest living thing next to them
bad nintendoand guess what
you have to face one of bowsers kids at the end of every world
im not kidding
i was honestly expecting to fight bowsers wife before fighting him but it never happened
thats probably for the better
who knows how horrific she looksim still trying to figure out what everyone sees in this game
its old and forgettable
honestly i think nowadays the only people who enjoy super mario bros  are older folks whose children have moved away to college or to start a family and they left behind their nes and super mario bros  cartridge so their parents had something to do
all these older folks miraculously happen to enjoy the game so now everyone acts like its the best game of alltime
well its notas a kid i actually somewhat enjoyed this game
it came to nintendos virtual console so i decided why not download it for a change
after all in the late s early s i really enjoyed this game
it was really something to have
years later its apparent of two things the game was horribly designed and it cant stand the test of time
the fact that on nintendos vc its also a dollar more than the other nes games is also questioning
its hard to make a game this badif you were a fan of the turtles a long time ago back in the early s the first thing youll notice about the game is that it hardly has anything to do with the show at all outside of some of the major characters
outside of that there are no foot soldiers and most of the enemies you encounter you never saw in the show in the first place
you will come across bebop and rocksteady but none of the other enemies were actually ever in the show in the first place
kind of dauntingwhat really makes the game horrible however lies within the gameplay
firstly the turtles themselves are unbalanced and put to unfair use
you can switch between any of the turtles at a time but for the most part only one of them is of any use to getting you through the adventure
michaelangelo and raphael are completely useless as their weapons lack to the range to actually do anything
leonardo is alright but donatello is the only real useful one here as hes the only one who can attack downward and at a range
more than likely youll only want to use the other three to sacrifice so that donatello can do some beating up on enemiesthe way the levels are designed is also horrendous
you basically walk around an overworld map and go into sewers warehouses and whatnot
the problem is that you never know where to go next
this nonlinear style wouldnt be so bad if there werent so many blasted dead ends
to make the experience even more grueling the game is just full of enemies that will respawn almost the second you turn around
you could go through a tough warehouse fighting tons of tough enemies only to find you cant go any further
so now youll have to backtrack and you may have to fight all those enemies again
so if you dont lose a turtle getting to a dead end youll probably lose him getting from itthe game isnt really difficult its just unfair and frustrating
the fact that two of your four players are completely useless tells you something
the later turtles games were far better than this
skip the first teenage mutant ninja turtles game
its so unfair that the experience is frustrating
teenage mutant ninja turtles ii and iii were far better and theres still no turtles game that beats the all time best turtles iv turtles in time
if you need a classic teenage mutant ninja turtles fix the first turtles game on the nes isnt going to do itbut thats to be expected
i got it for a decent enough price and its a pretty easy start for people looking to collect gamesnes top gunhated this game growing up
i never could land the freaking planeimpossiblei got this game back in the mid s when it came out
i hated it
namely because i never could land the damn plane on the freaking aircraft carrierfor a mid s game its a fairly decent if boring flight simulator
but dont think youll be getting a real flight simulator
you just chose your plane then you you fly in this big boring blue frame for a while and try to dodge missles
theres no real music
thats the whole game
there are four missions but i only got to the third mission
theres a good reason for thatbut what makes this game so notorious for those who remember it my generation basically is landing the plane on the aircraft carrier
when you land the plane you get a long approach in which the game will continually tell you to press up or down on the control pad to made sure you are aligned properly
and no matter how meticulously you follow the instructions you almost always crash
i can remember being a little kid and getting so frustrated at this game because i could never land
my brother landed once or twice but thats about itthe other bad part is i think in mission  you have to fuel midair when a big fuel plane comes up on top of you
just like landing you have to press up or down to make sure the cable that will transport the gas from the fuel plane to your aircraft is properly aligned
just like the landing on the aircraft you can never make the connection
if the connection is not made then the fuel aircraft will break the connection leaving you to certain death as you will run out of fuel  before you reach the aircraft carrier which you wont be able to land on anywaythe reason why i could never get past mission three is if i remember correctly you have three lives
you lose the first two lives on the first two missions because you cant land then you lose your life because you cant fuel
i think the fourth mission has to do with a space shuttle but i never knew any of my friends who had the game to get to that leveljust a really bad game
google angry video game nerds review of it he is as usual spot on beware he has a lot of adult language to the point his reviews are borderline obscene but still funny as helloh also this game has nothing to do with the movie
the movie even came out well before the game
no connection at allthe controls suck the animations are terrible all you can do is kick punch and dropkick
theme music is the only good thing they got right here and it plays during the match
the graphics are really bad the difficulty is due to the crippling controls is horrid and overall there is zero enjoyment that can be had with this aweful gameits been said that everyone has to start somewhere but man what a stinker of a starting point
the prerequisites of all that is mega man are present the multitiered platform stages those wacky bosses the rockpaperscissors weapon mentality and it all wouldve been great if it wasnt made with  nes technology
many of the major sins present include slow and choppy scrolling uninspired level art repetitive level design and mega man climbing a ladder way too slow and dropping like a rock when falling from a great height
it couldve been more much much more and looking back after being spoiled on the later games its hard to consider this the genius it was meant to beif only it were possible to rate a zero this game would have earned it
not only should this game never have been made every copy found to exist should be destroyed
its an abomination to the license and one of the worst games ever created in the history of nintendo
yeah im a fan of zelda
no i dont like easy games
i like games which challenge my skill  intellect not my patience  sanity
i disliked zelda ii when it first came out but gave it a second chance when offered as a free download to my ds from nintendo
after a very solid second shot its now deleted from my system
where can i even begin
there are no rewards for defeating opponents
the control is appalling
theres no strategy involved
its too easy to get hurt almost impossible to heal and no matter where you are in the game dying forces you to start over at the beginning
this isnt a game
this is a violation of the geneva convention
unless you have a mental disorder which causes you to enjoy having to complete the same monotonous tasks over and over dont bother
in fact the game could even cost you hundreds to play
for some the torment  frustration could cause you to destroy a perfectly good console
it wouldnt have taken much to turn this into an enjoyable game
its as though the designers were trying to kill the zelda license
thank god it survived to have a third title
but the second title should have been recalled  buriedthe nintendo revolution will be backward campatable through the nes games of the s so why would you waste your money on this
in with the new out with the olddo not buy unless you collect old game systems
for those with newer systems you can get the sonic games for those sysemsi loved secret of mana the earlier mana game on the super nintendo and loved it  among many other square games
i was really happy to get my hands on this new mana game but i am incredibly disappointed in itthe game has no storyline
after a neat intro you control a very generic guy or girl character named quotyouquot that rarely speaks
you choose a spot on a blank map for your home then place other areas of the game on joining spaces eventually building up a big worldother characters in the game come and go as little quotminiquestsquot pop up bookended by a cute title and little quotthe endquot scene whenever you complete the quest
completing the quests basically consists of walking around an area on your map and killing enemies and a boss enemythis brings up the battle system which is a step back from secret of mana
instead of the fastpaced gameplay of som you are drawn into little battles when you near enemies
battling mainly consists of pushing buttons quickly while near enemies
the graphics dont allow for much detail so any sense of strategy is hopeless
you have little real control over the other characters in your team unless you go through the trouble of setting up twoplayer play which is often more hassle than its worththe graphics are nice though incredibly happy
still it is as if players are controlling a small part of a nice piece of animation the animation however has no plot or sense of coherency
the graphics do not make up for the incredibly bad gameplay and lack of storyeven if you were a fan of secret of mana or love squares other games do not rush out and buy legend of mana
instead rent the game and if you like what you see then consider buying it
i am disappointed i bought the game without previewing it first
i dont think i would have wanted to see the game through after seeing its poor qualitydespite all that there is a right way to do them as well as the wrong way which they just did
if you want a plot that works make every action depending upon your specific reaction have roughly ten possible outcomes but then merge them later weave  or  separate plots depending on what you have done and that can suddenly shift if you do something really odd and make the story alter entirely
instead legend of mana appeared from when i played it to be nothing more than a bunch of loosely strung together garbage go to a town solve the puzzle hear a bunch of drivel that doesnt add up to anything else in your head get the item and build a new town
the only thing that was recurring was that the faerie princess kept losing her way from what i played but what did that have to do with anythingthis is an example of a good nonlinear plotyou are a child in a town that gets destroyed by an evil overlord
the survivors worship you as the hero and fully expect you to right wrongs and destroy the overlord base plot
now as you set out youre swinging your sword about like a fool and you kill a cat by accident
you get arrested for animal cruelty and put in prison
so then in prison you meet a rogue girl who sets you free and she tell you that the overlord is small potatoes that the real problem is this organization that is supposed to be the law but is imposing too harse penalties on minor offenses so under her tutelage you become a career criminal
or you continue on your way and the overlord send an assassin to poison your drink but she has a change of heart and drug it instead
you get sent as a slave to be a gladiator but you fight well and impress the army and instead fight in a war
or you continue unswayed and finally reach the overlords castle only it seems the townspeople were lying the guy is really a paladin who saw extreme corruption in the town and put an end to it and he has proof
so you march right back tothe town and see that he was rightthis is nonlinear plotline the plot can make any twist imaginable throughout the game even sacricing the original antagonize or even the hero
assume the hero died in the thief story the plot might now revolve around the rogue girl and her adventuresi was very disappointed in the technical aspects of this game
i really enjoyed quotthe th guestquot and i thought that i would enjoy this one as well
unfortunately getting the disk to run was a major nightmare
after spending an hour and a half trying to get the game to start the game  required me to change and configure audio drivers without giving any help  doing it
 i was finally able to get it to go but even then the sound was  pretty much shot
other problems i had with it  it wouldnt remember the  sound settings that took forever to change
when i would try to play the  next time i would have to quotuninstallquot the game and reinstall   losing any saved games
 the puzzles when i could access them were  insanely hard
without the help of a good cheat guide forget itall in  all it looked like it had potential but i would not recommend this to  anyone
what were the designers thinking
give me a game that i can just  stick in and playlet me first say i love sim city  and  i am one of those guys who waited for  years for  to come out
and it wasok not great but ok maxis had promised all kinds of things like a transportation package that would let you build monorailswhere is it
another thing this is  the rd installmentexcuse me th installment and you still see the same  buildings over and over again in your city
oh come on
if you have sim  city  dont spend money on this
aside from the building creator that  you can download and buildings you can also get from others there really  isnt anything new here worth plunking down 
thumbs downdont get me wrong sim city  was great i loved it
but this game is just sim city  with better graphics
thats all i have to say
im mad i bought it when i already have sim city   oh yea you can not make farms i tried its imposiblethis game was so icky i didnt even finish it
the rendered characters all appeared to have some sort of unhealthy skin condition and tended to rock back and forth while delivering their bad voice bits
the locations were pretty but the nodetonode navigation was extremely frustrating
some of the puzzles werent too bad but others were pretty far fetched
between the creepy characters the dizzying navigation and the inane puzzles i just couldnt bring myself to continuewow what a let down
having played and enjoyed both mario party games on the n i was looking forward to seeing what the dreamcast could do with a sonic board game
while sonic and friends have never really reached the same level of character recognition as the mario and luigi crowd i was hoping the graphic muscle of the dc would at least squeeze some light hearted fun out of sonic shuffle
what we found when we played for many hours last night was dissappointment and frustration
first the graphics look just plain bad in my opinion
the opening shots and menus look promising but the actual game screens made me think i had seen better on the n
in particular some of the environmental effects like water looked awful like the animations were running about  frames per second
very choppy and unpleasant to stare at while you are waiting  for the computer players to take their turns
you cant turn them off by the way so there is no such thing as short game
between that and the long load times you can expect to be spending alot of time just sitting around yawningits the gameplay stupid
even with lousy looks this game could have emerged from the depths if it had good engaging gameplay
instead this is an example of what not to do in a video game
without going into great detail i will say the the computer players cheat the minigames leave you with no control over your characters and ultimately the complete random unexplained nature of why and when things happen will make you feel like you are completely out of control of your characters fate
you may as well just sit back and watch what happens because nothing you can do will really effect anything
this game is one of the worst i have seen to come from the folks at sega who recently have been putting out some fantastic games jet grind radio and skies of arcadia would make me buy my system all over again
im thinking that maybe sonic shuffle was made by some subteam of developers working in some broom closet in the basement of the sega building
they should be fired or sent back to game design schooli have mario party  and  and they came out befoe thissonic shuffle is a mario party wannabethe mini games stink on iceand its pointlessall you do is pick a card and it walks by itselfif you wanna good sonic game get sonic adventure this has bad graphics and takes a long time to playwhen i first read about sonic shuffle it got mixed reviews but since i was desperate for a new experience in gaming for the dreamcast the best system that never made it i bought the game
i must say that it has sweet cel shading graphics and thats it
this game is really uninspired and tedious
my biggest gripe among many is that the multiplayer games are boring uninspired and just plain suck
i was origionally drawn to it by the boasts of many mulitplayer games but boy was i fooled
there are probably three if so much of these games that are fun trust me the mini ames are bad
one game puts three players in a frying pan and the fourth player gets to turn it and toss it as if they are making pancakes weak sega weakdo not buy this mess
it is not fun
tails is the most annoying character ever created i hate the way he always has to call sonic for everything
someone at sega should get a career change and go into licking envelopes at thhe post office a job that requires little thought because he obviously did not have enough to put into sonic shuffle to make it origional or funi am a fan of sonic the hedgehog
i have been there for better and for worse like when they added the superannoying amy rose as a character
i have always liked sonic as a video game characternonetheless this game is awful
first of all the premise of this game is stolen from the game mario party
cloned games can be alright considering that the developers dont rely too heavily on the origial game for inspiration and design
sadly the makers of sonic shuffle do exactly thatthey rely completely on the design of mario party to patent their game after
they make no attempt to hide the fact that they are copying off of mario paryand when game developers create a clone it should be equal or better than the original or else theyll have to deal with the fact that not only did they not have the creativity to make their own game but they could not even use the success of the game that was their predecessor to create a successful game in their own right
sonic shuffle is a textbook example of thisthe game boards are pointless and poorly conceived
the story behind the game is uninspiring and does not catch the imagination
the minigames are stupid and not entertaining in the leasti would avoid this game at all costs unless you want to give someone free money for a useless piece of software
or maybe you could use the cd as a designer coaster or somethingi got perfect dark for the n the day it came out and was actually surprised that it was better than i had expected
when i saw the same title for gameboy i figured it would be a portable version of the great n gameboy was i wrong
this is easily the worst game i own
the controls dont work the sound isnt good and the game play is horrible
almost entirely the opposite of what the n game was
in fact really the only thing in common between the two is the title and main characterin short if you liked the n version dont bother with this game
if you hated the n version i suppose you might like thisthere is nothing perfect about this game so that right there is false advertising
anyway how fun can a game be that allows you to get shot from an enemy who is shooting you while rushing in from off screen
sound fun
well no its not
gameboy color games are pretty weak across the boardid stick to the advance
perfect dark is just mindlesswhen the transfer pak was initially introduced for the nintendo  there were very few games that used it
pokeacutemon stadium and mario gold see reviews were the first ones and mario tennis was coming
at the time i had recently bought perfect dark for the n and id heard that the gbc version would use the transfer pak
based on that i bought the gbc game
oopsmy first mistake was expecting an ntype experience from this game and thats simply not possible
perfect dark was so good for the n that it couldnt be translated well for the game boy
however it could still be a good game in its own right
well its notthe controls to say the least are poor
its difficult to aim difficult to tell where youre aiming hard to tell whats happening hard to see where items are to pick up
its just difficult to play
i couldnt even force myself to go through the first levelthe sound is nothing spectacular and while the cut scenes are interesting the graphics themselves are poor
the cartridge also comes with a builtin rumble feature but that really doesnt add anything to the game other than weighti cant recommend this game in any way even for its ability to unlock features in the n game which i couldnt find in the gbc manual and will accept on faith
its simply not worth it
if you need to get into things in the n version find some cheat codes online and save yourself some moneyi bougfht this game with great expectations but i didnt like it in the least bit its got an awsoem story lien and greta gameplay i just dont liek drts to you d rts fans this is nothing liek a d rts i found it very boring and extremely annoying how the veiw system workshaving just played homeworld and not really enjoying it i tried this one the second game in the series i bought all  at the same time
shouldnt have done that
and so far i cant even get the game to play
i installed and uninstalled twice
i have downloaded updated drivers for nvidia geforce fx  meg video card
i have changed all of the settings over and over again
and still cant play
i see the beginning story in the aftermath that follows the end of homeworld of them rebuilding
but as soon as i see the ship fly in on the first cutscene i get kicked back to windowsmy recommedation is if you have xp dont get this game
so far its more trouble than its worth
so now i guess i will try homeworld i bought this game because i used to play it when i was young and i loved it
i was so upset that it did not work when i received itman roller coaster tycoon is awesome but this is like a piece of junk
who would want to but thisone of the biggest mistakes of my life was purchasing this travesty of computer programming
it runs terribly and i have a new  system
the time frame is not paced and the options are not as smooth as the package  promotes
bad production indeed
and the biggest factor that it fails to  anywhere close to funi am not much of a game expert but i do know what i like to play
i decided i wanted the game because the concept of running my own airport would be fun
i even read a few of the reviews on amazon
my husband seen the game at local store including in a pack with other games
he only paid some money for the pack and i see why
first the box said airport tycoon but the cd saids air mogul
i guess it is the same game
when i first seen the graphics it was awful
i still thought there would be hope
the game play is not easy to understand and the game tutorial was worthless in fact it was mess up itself
i just didnt like it at all
i was very disappointed
so if you are just a person who like to play games just for the fun of it and not one of those hard gamers dont waste your money on this game
it wasnt even worth a few dollars
now one of the other games in the pack i am currently playing is railroad tycoon  and it was definitely worth the few dollarsplease promise me you will never play this
it is not worth your time
if you paid money for it try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin
hard
then throw your copy of this game in the dumpsterseriously though this game is absolutely terrible
the graphics are bad even for the psx the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless
there was no reason for there being  something characters most of them were exactly the same statwise and all of them were poorly designed
the most annoying thing in the world bar nothing is having to reequip all your characters spells whenever you switch characters
you have like  spell slots
god
i dont think i even need to say it but those crumbums at square couldnt pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too
they should really stick with straight to video final fantasy  anime movies from now on lest they risk making something like this againthis game looks good and the story is great but the game does not deliver the goods
the problem i have most with the game is serge the main character never talks that is just plain lazyness you just get the feeling that serge is just  lifeless and is not intristing at all
since the game has so many characters in it it seems that most of the other characters as lifeless as serge and have no pointe in ever bieng introduced to the ploti feel thair is a limit to the number of characters in a game that will still make the game intristing
and i am sorry game informer but this game does not restore my faith in the modern rpgyou have to read thair great magazine to know what i am talking about square could do better i have seen it donethe game played but it was unable to save a file without corrupting it every time so that was bsi dont know why sierra really bother to repack halflife in yet another version
what else are they going to do
a halflife pack with counterstrike day of defeat and action all in one
this is a waste
a waste of time and money for sierra and the consumers
im only talking about the product counterstrike is actually not a bad mod since about  of the halflife gaming community plays it there is no room for other mods
this is bad for the people that are tired of counterstrike and are looking for something newbuying halflife by itself is cheaper you can download counterstrike for free anywaycounterstrike is a spectacular mod for a spectacular game
halflife though somewhat outdated now is still one of the best fps games ever made
the gameplay is superb and the mods that have spawned from the game are great in their own right
counterstrike is one of those great mods
counterstike is so great that sierra decided to sell a retail version of the game
this is why i am giving this only one star in spite of the spectacularness of the game
go to pretty much any website where games can be downloaded and you can get this game provided you have halflife for free
yes for free
the file however is fairly large but even so it is probably worse to buy a game you can get for free than it is to leave a slow internet connection on all night so you can get this game
basically this game is great and though it is worth the price it is still available for free so that price isnt worth itwhoa were do i startthis game was by far the worst turok game everthe graphics are horribleexcept for the talking caracters from previous turoks come back and look compleatly different
i mean not even remotly closethe sound is okaythe music is all the same thoughlets seegameplaythe ai is horible
the enemy stands there and shoots at youunlike its previous game where the dinosoids would hide behind crates and throw grenades or self distruct ectthe guns are like worse versions of ts guns
the only gun i like is the hardest gun to getthe story line is bland
nothing really happens
it has nothing to do with all the othe turok games
all of a sudden things just happenover all it seems the game had a lack of intrest when they made it
notice iguanawho made the other two turok games didnt make this one
tells you something just by thati really wanted to try ridge racer so one day i picked it up at my local gamestop and i was excited to play it what i experienced was one of the most boring unoriginal frustrating racing experiences i have ever had
the game is so boring there is nothing unique about this game
let me compare this to my favorite racing game fzero gx yah sure fzero gx was hard but hot damn it is amazing a wide variety of vehicals to play with unique tracks incredible speed and hand sweating action ridge racer  on the other hand is boring a boring selection of cars a boring selection of tracks all in all its just really lazy
and dont get me started on the racing itself this is one of those games if you fall back in last place there is not chance to get back to first the ai is terrible they always get ahead of you and you cant get ahead of them
this makes an already boring game frustrating
in fzero gx even though the game has insane level design you still at least had a chance to catch up because you know the game is fast
ridge racer  is slow and boring and frustrating its not even worth a damn pennyfzero gxi got this on the cheap thinking that it would be a decent racing game
i was wrong
i didnt know what to expect but cars that handle extremely unrealistically graphics that are just average in my eyes compared to nfs  hot pursuit and gt  and a general unexpected hardness in gameplay made me sorry i got this game
the cars are fake which isnt too much of an issue but you have to make the fake cars good
if youre looking for a fun racing game with realistic cars go for need for speed  hot pursuit and if you want a good driving sim go for gran turismo  rent this if you must but dont spend a lot of money for itthis was a let down indeedall graphics nothing more
the controls are downright horrible you cant use your whip multidirectional like you could with castlevania bloodlines and super castlevaniaand he walks slow in this gameeven the special double requires you to mash the buttons
also whats going on with all the jumping i feel like im on the th level on super mario brosnot a castlevania gamethe difficultly was unpleasant and the level design was unforgivablein addition what who ruined the castlevania music with this techno garbageunless you like gay technowhich is all techno by the wayyou will be looking for a mute button
this is a rare and unheard castlevania for a reasonit flatout stinksget castlevania bloodlines or super castlevania or even sotn if you have a playstation but avoid dracula xyou have been warnedkirbys dream course is one of the most frustrating games i have ever played
there arent too many kirby games i dont like but this is one of them
this game is very overrated its not one of kirbys best games
trying to play this game makes me want to throw my controller across the roomgraphics the graphics have decent quality something the rest of the game lacksgameplay replay value i have not played this game since i got it on wiis virtual console so that is why presentation and sound scores are missingoverall this game is stupiddont evem think about buying this itemid give this game  stars if that was possible
the graphics were pretty good yes
but if youve played one level in this game dont get frustrated about not getting far theyre all the same
i played this for  minutes thought wow this is cool played it for  more and realized how much it really stunk
waste of  dont let anybody pay you to buy it or rent it for that matterthis game is soooooo boring i fell asleep playing it
the only thing good about it is its replay feature which lets you sit and watch a firework show but other than that this game has no objective
i never thought fireworks could be this boringi thought its ok until the bugs start to happen very often that it just became so annoying
the game freezes alot
this doesnt happen with any of my other  games so i know my console works fine
no wonder i was able to buy this game brand new for only its garbagewhile i do like the ps  line up of games the system itself i have lost all confidence inmy first two ps s the old bigger version died from the disc read error problemi thought maybe in the new design this problem was addressed since the laser lens is more easily accesible and youd think that would make it easy to clean it and stuffwell the new slim i bought a year ago just stopped reading discs to and i tried to clean the laser lens and it has no effect whatsoeveri have bought  playstation s in the last  yearsif i buy another one it will be my th in  years and will bring up my total spent on new ps s to about  dollarsmore then it costs to buy the upcoming ps  on a much lesser systemconveniently they die on me after the warranty is gonei have  games that are all dust collectors now cause i refuse to buy another ps  againthey have no durability whatsoever and the life of the systems i have owned seems to be just over a year on eachthats not acceptablei take good care of my systems and it doesnt matterwith time the ps s just stop reading discs for whatever reasonthen they want you to buy another one or ship it somewhere to be fixed and charge you for it of courseif it was an isolated thing with one faulty system i would have no problem with itbut when all three systems i buy die from the same exact problem thats not acceptabletheres an obvious flaw in the building of this system and sony simply refuses to address it and fix the problem where it starts in manufacturingbecause people keep flocking to the store to but them sony wont bother to fix it cause as long as they see profits that translates to them as being no problem with the systemmy advice is to avoid sony console systems until they one day show they can create one with some durabilityespecially with the new ps if that one ends up having the same flaw as this system its going to cost alot more to keep replacingfor the time being sony systems are a bad investmentthey just dont have long lasting durabilitymy original nintendo lasted longer then all  of my ps s combined which is pretty sad considering that the first nintendo had a bad reputation for durabilityi got this game after purchasing a ps thinking that even if this game wasnt all that great i could use the two microphones which came with a usb adaptor for karaoke revolution games
i was wrong
because the microphones are not actual usb mics and have to plug into a usb adaptor karaoke revolution games do not detect these singstar micssecondly singstar does not give you the option to remove the lead vocals from the songs
this defeats the whole purpose of karaoke
even on karaoke mode the lead vocals are still therelastly the game has a very small selection of songs and there are a handful of tracks that are medleys which are basically a medley from choruses of the same songs that are already on this gameconclusion
this is not a karaoke game as it does not give you the option to strip the lead vocals and the microphones included with the game are not compatible with any other games for the ps or ps
if i was given the option i would give this game zero starsi really truly do not understand how settlers has managed to get to a fourth release
i would have thought this game would have died out after the first
everything about the game is annoying and confusing
you need to produce all sorts of resources from different spots and its not clear when you need to produce something youre not
this can lead to a lot of headscratching while you try to figure out why exactly your miners arent mining
you really dont have that much control of the individual units the way you do in almost every good strategy game
the combat is dull and not particularly tactical and the graphics are pretty dated
most of all this game just isnt fun
it feels more like a tutorial in a free market economy than a game
pick up civ  or age of empires  if you want an historical strategy gameits a shame
looks like this could be a good game but after installing the whole game it just would not run on my computer
after reading the reviews im leary about installing patches  so i just uninstalled
bioware should never have released a game that works only on certain computersthe game crashed my hard drive and forced me to buy a new oneall of that happened after i unsuccessfully tried to install and run the game
i have a computer and engineering background so this senario is not typical for me
i know what im doing and if it takes too long or if it crashes most likely its not my faultthe whole installation process was lagged it would take several seconds for every move youd make to respond  in the middle of the installation i was already frustrated but decided to finish it all the way and then restart my system and see if it made any differencewell it didnti tried any display settings i could think ofi updated or checked for updates on all my driversi double checked anything i could possibly think of and at the end the game ran slower than a snail  and to add insult to the injury the next thing i knew the infamous bluescreen was there
last time i had a blue microsoft screen i was running windows nt not xp
need i say that i was never able to recover my computer or the data on my harddrive
i had to buy a new hard drive as the old one had been damaged beyond repair and ended up losing lots of datayouve been warned
buy and install at your own riskneverwinter nights is really not a computer game in the traditional sense
its more of an electronic version of the pen and paper roleplaying game dungeons and dragons
if you are an avid dd player who cant get your group together at your own house you now have the internet to do it
while this is fine for pen and paper dd groupies the rest of us are left out in the coldbasically neverwinter nights is set up in the hopes that a community will help it grow
the game comes with a sample campaign to play but it also comes with a complete editor that lets anyone design their own dd adventures
either with the official campaign included in box or some of the community made mods there are already  available online you can play neverwinter nights by yourself or online with a group of players
to further enhance the pen and paper dd experience there is even a dungeon master client in the game
if you dont know what a dungeon master is i can already tell you youre purchasing the wrong game
basically a dm watches over the mod and controls the adventure to hopefully provide a better game for the players
sort of like an invisible refereethis all sounds great when reading it on the back of the box but im not sure it really works
for one thing while the editor has a lot of capabilities every map has that same squarelook to it to fit in the dd grid system
nothing looks natural and after playing a few mods youve seen everything the game has to offer and it all starts to repeat itself
also for a game that relies on the community to invent new adventures the editor is more difficult than it should be
if you dont know programming basics youre going to have a difficult time with the editor as every simple action has to be scripted which is basically simple c programming
to accomodate this new system and catch up with its competitors neverwinter nights also has a new d system that reminds me of hack and slash games like diablo more than the companys previous classic release baldurs gate i and ii
in fact the official campaign included in the game is nothing compared to the baldurs gate games and i would recommend that you not buy this game if the official campaign is the only thing you will play
the included campaign is boring linear and not that creative its more of a sample for the editor rather than an epic adventureif you plan on only playing online be careful if you only have a k modem
youll never be able to host more than  players on your computer without lag
also youll have a difficult time joining the large servers with  players if your connection is slow
neverwinter nights comes with an ingame browser that divides online games by category
you can join the action channel the roleplaying channel etc
most of these games are called persistent worlds and are basically smaller versions of everquest
while they can be for awhile because of their small size and limited equipment quests etc they never provide much fun
the best way to play the game is to get together with a group of friends and meet on a weekly basis just like you would the pen and paper dd
  while you can find people to play with through online fan sites youll have a much better time with this game if you already know people that own it and are willing to play the same mod with you at scheduled timesafter trying this game for a month frankly i feel cheated
i bought the game because it promised gamers that even if they didnt want to play online or use the editor they could play the official campaign included in the game by themselves and have just as much fun as they did with the companys other epic releases baldurs gate i and ii
thats a misleading claim because the new mechanics of neverwinter nights and the boring campaign included are pitiful attempts to live up to the companys previous pc dd games
this game is really only for people that want to enjoy an electronic pen and paper version of dd the rest of us should move on to icewind dale ii or morrowind or hope that another company manages to design a great singleplayer rpg as fantastic as the baldurs gate seriesalright i thought
a true add game from the company that created the classic baldurs gate series and other great games that ran well on my computerunfortunately this game barely runs on my midhigh range system
the game literally stutters along with constant  second pausesi find that many of the other people in the bioware tech support problem were having the same issue without a response from biowareafter much research i discovered there is only one solution to this problem and this consists of using a thirdparty graphics program costs about  bucks to register
this program will not allow you to see any of the ingame movies and the performance is still slow sluggish and just unplayableto play this game it comes down to either buying new hardware waiting months for a patch that might not be released or just returning it
from what ive read on here and elsewhere i see that this game isnt even worth playing even if it ran flawlessly on my system to save space i wont repeat what others have saidmy advice get warcraft iii
if you want a real authentic add experience play in real life for now as this game doesnt provide it even if it runs smoothly on your systemi dont see how anyone could possibly like this game
i couldnt get into it after several tries
the game play is the worst thing about it the perspective is awful movement sucks one fight can last a very long time even its foundation is bad and even that is being generous
i see that many people like it but the old infinity engine games are so much better in so many different ways
i dont even like them but they hands down beat this game
its a big step in a very bad direction for the series
it might have a lot of depth for all i know but its so terrible that i couldnt find out
playing it was like being repeatedly stabbed with pins it drags on and on
its incredible how narrow boring slow drab and awful it is
the best things about it even make it worse
after playing baldurs gate    icewind dale    dragonshard and demon stone this is by very very far the worst of the bunch
i wish there was some redeeming quality to mention here
usually i try to throw in some good point no matter how bad something is but i really cant come up with anything at all
ive played video games my whole life and i would rather play pong than this waste of spaceit has that bulders gate blahh feel to it
very slow moving
i have an extremely highend system and it moves very slowly just as bulders gate does
what is the fascination with that style of game
sure it uses add rules but it does it so gruelingly slowly
anyway i played arcanum for a day and the novelty of the ability to fire a gun in an rpg wore off due to the terrible interface
top that off with the  quality of the sierra name its become apparent they rush developers into releasing buggy lowquality software with cool packaging  cheers to their marketing company
and youre looking at one crummy game
dont waste your time or money on this onestuttering graphics severe slowing during actions cheesy graphics youd expect from about  or  years agopricenot only that multiplayer is practically nonexistant the patches are extremely unreliable game freezes after the patchestake my advicestay away from this and all other sierra products
keep in mind this is the same company that came out with the little gem rage of magesi like pokemon but do not buy this game
the peoffesor runs the whole thing pikachu never listens there is a time limit 
be smart dont buy itso to most of the gr readers im warning you to stay away
its the video game equivalent of going to the library and reading a golden book instead of tolstoy
but if you have a really young sibling or even a child of your own who definitely likes pikachu and can bear all his long term annoyances there might be a possible christmas present therethe reason i dont like majoras mask is because it has a ridiculous story line
first of all you have to do all this junk to get certain things
plus you have to stop the moon from smashing into the earth that is the stupidest thing i have ever heardthis game is not loyal to all the previous zelda games nor does it have any returning characters such as  princess zelda
ocarina of time is without a doubt better than majoras maskit is sad to say the least that what made this game horrible was the fact that there was time added
how does it ever make sense that you have temples lodead with many things to get not to mention going into ten different rooms just to get to an enemy yet you only have  hours game time to complete the task
not to mention side quests and loads of things to do
the sotry line was cool and the graphics were great but this comes nothing close to ocarina of time which i enjoyed sooo much
in fact i think ocarina of time was waaaaaay better then this
if you are going to make a game make the ememies hard and the task difficult but dont add time
picture if you were half way through a temple and were almost done then time runs out
that would make you want to pull your hair
thankfully from the looks of future games i have seen they did not make that fatal mistake again
i recomend to buy orcarina of time betteri hereby pronounce the zelda series dead
ocarina of time had bestowed upon me a premonition that perhaps zeldas death as a series would soon come to pass in the near future and majoras mask confirmed my sinking feeling in such an exact and nauseating manor as only a truly pathetic game canfirst of all zelda doesnt belong in d
it robs the player of the ability to be aware of everything in the room an ability that is vital to the zelda motif
ive said this about ocarina of time and i say it now about majoras masknot only that but youll spend less than half the time with any actual gameplay dungeons and the like
about half of this game consists of wandering around clock town solving peoples problems for them like some kind of deranged therapist
while ill admit that the roots of this element are plainly visible in the most brilliant installment in the zelda series a link to the past naturally
 it has now been carried way too farthe third and final majorly boneheaded move in majoras mask is the revival of an ancient gaming abstraction that should have been left dead and buried the time limit
nothing good can come of such a thing
any game with a time limit is not a leisurely activity as a video game should be but a frantic scramble
being frantic is not fun peoplethats the last of my major gripes but the problems dont end there
for example both ocarina of time and majoras mask are quite depraved did you know that
what is this stupid spider obsession
guess what nintendo its disgusting
i hated the deku tree and now i hate that godawful thing in the swamp
being obsessed with spider webs is just plain creepy
i dont even want to know what kinds of activities they were performing as they envisioned fantasies of those spiders in their headsif you want to see cute cartoon animals acting just like beavis  buttheadthen look no further than this disaster of a gameonce a lovable squirrel that fought acornspoor conker has been turned into a furry beavisor furry buttheadand generally staggers through the gameaccomplishing absolutely nothingand thats just how you feel when you try to play this piece of garbageyoull constantly feel that youre not getting anywhere and that youre not accomplishing a single thingin the gameall you do is get drunkswearstagger aroundpuke and have a hangoverall through the entire gameyoull start to feel like youre in the animal version of beavis  buttheadremember how much beavis  butthead love to sweardo drugs and get drunk
and youll start to wonder where the fun and enjoyment isunlike conkers pocket talesthere are no goals to accomplishthere is no plotand there is absolutely nothing to do except swearget drunkpuke and have a hangoverdespite how much people try to get you to believe that conkers bad fur day is the greatest game aroundyoull learn the truth about this gamethat its just a big promotion for alcoholdo yourselvwes a favor and get conkers pocket tales insteadif you want a real mrated gamethen get grand theft autothis is a horrible game
it is really really gory and nasty
the multiplayer mode is hard and rare really made a big mistake
if i could choose to buy either yoshis story or bfd i would choose ys and im 
oh conker what have they done to youconkers bad fur day may look like some cute banjo kazooie game but guess what
it is far more complex than banjo kazooie
this little twerp pees on his enemies swears gets drunk posses as an army guy and does other stupid things
this is not a game for children to be playing
he even has sex with girls in some movies
parents dont even consider buying this for your five year old
infact not even when theyre seventeenpaper mario is very boring at the end of the game there is nothing else to do you cant get more exp pointsthis game has horrible graphics i dont give a damn if its paper
there is really nothing to do at the end of the gamethis is the worst game i played
at first i thought this game would be excellent because i loved super mario for the snes
when i put the game in i wasted so much time on a long and boring intro that you have to watch
nd mario talks to evreybody in the game which adds to more boredom
may i also include there is no sound
rd everytime mario has a battle with a stupid bad guy it goes into a scene similar to pokemon
you do your attack than mario gets attacked himself
what is that
if i made the game i would just make it so mario and him fought normallyth the graphics are just terribleth the music really got on my nervesso ignore the majority of people that say it is the best
in my opinion the game is sad and just disgraces the ndont let the cool box art fool you
this game is just the opposite of what the box art suggests
it suggests fun great visuals and a stellar epic storyline
in game reality the fun comes in very small almost untraceable doses the visuals offer a palette of dark colors that blend the setting with characters and items and the storyline is neither epic nor stellar
if that doesnt chase you from the game then the rest of this review most definitely willthe good the levelup system is actually rather good the dialogue will make you laughwhether its meant to or notthe bad somebody let this game out into the market long sequences of boring combat many people might not even find their way out of the first castlethe ugly the character and monster designsstorylineunfortunately the scriptwriters dont provide the characters with any intelligent dialogue
in fact its laughable
the game doesnt take itself very seriously which makes things even worse
take for example what the main character alaron says when the party stops to rest
they sit before a campfire and the camera zooms on alarons face
he says ah
pass the marshmallows
not only is this not very funny but it grows annoying when you have to watch this scene every time your party rests
the best line of dialogue though belongs to the knight abrecan
when the king sends alaron on a quest and offers as a reward to make alaron who is at the time a squire a knight abrecan objects
he continuously insults his king by saying you are too generous
and each time he repeats those words more and more of them become capitalized expressing abrecans abhorrent anger for the king allowing this young squire a chance to become a knight
compared to that line of dialogue nothing else is worth rememberinggameplaymany of you may not find your way out of the labyrinthine castle you start out in but for those who do youll do some questing and searching through the notsolabyrinthinebutstilldifficulttonavigate outside areas
most importantly youll be battling bad guys
thats what you bought the game for right
to battle bad guys
for this the game developers bumped their heads together and thought what is so fun about video games
they made a list narrowed it down to whats so fun about rpgs and then for the fun of it made a list of what would not be fun in an rpg
but somebody accidentally slipped this last list to the developers and threw out the other one
thus the combat that lasts  to  minutes and consists of lots swinging and missing
i swear the chance to hit in this game is about as low as the chance to miss in other games
there are so many factors that go against your chance to hit that there just is no hitting
and when you reach a high enough level to actually start hitting the enemies you move on to the next area where the enemies are stronger and thus harder to hit
argghh
back to square oneon the bright side the experience system is rather good
you can put points into different skills for each character giving you a lot of freedom for customization
too bad the rest of the game couldnt have been so fun and originallongevityas i said many of you will probably never leave the castle where poor alaron will breathe his last but for those fortunate or unfortunate enough to make it out and go on your quest theres a lengthy quest here
much of it consists of long battles between incompetent fighters and very little of it consists of an engaging story
in the end it would be much more merciful to allow alaron to live out the rest of his days lost in the castlelets just get this straight when i bought royal rumble i was looking for the next smackdownone problem it nothing like smackdown first of all there are only  modes a regular one on one match or a royal rumble where there can be  people in the ring at one time
yes i know the royal rumble match sounds cool but it is as boring as a one  on one matchin other words this game gets one star for being fun for  minuteswell its safe to say that all the wwf games for the dreamcast
just keep on walking and get something elsefor those of you who actually like royal rumble for the dreamcast i must say that you are deprived
if you want the best wrestling game on the dreamcast go track down fire pro d wrestling an import gamethis game has over  wrestlers and the most indepth create a player mode found in any wrestling game
heck you can even edit the origional given wrestler costumes wanna see bret hart in a blue jeans then just edit one of his costumes
wanna see the rock in a shiny gold shirt and long black dress pants then just edit one of his costume choices
you can edit costumes for everyone if you like from andre the giant to hulk hogan to dallas page to goldberg to vader to shawn michaels to chyna to ric flair to yj to hawk and animal and any of the japaneese wrestlerseverything you want in a wrestling game is here
it also supports  players and never suffers from any slowdownthe cast of characters fire pro d range from stars from the wwf wcw ufc yes ultimate fighter championships and numerous wrestling organisations in japan
this game rocks
there are numerous game modes like royal rumble battle royal survivor series  man tag  man tag  man tag single match cage match barb wire match submission matches and more
this has the most moves per character in any wrestling game
i dare any smackdown fan to compare the two they will loose badly
overall the game is what a wrestling game on the dreamcast should be and not the disappointing mess called royal rumble
import this game its a must havethis has to be the worst wwf wrestling game i have ever played
their are no create a wrestler options no season modes limited choices in wrestlerscontrol get screwed up at times
the game certainly does not take advantage of the dream cast hardware
ive played this game for about  minutes and simply became disgusted
do yourself a favor and get something elsei am serious
this game is the worst wrestling game ever made next to wcw nitro for playstation but it ranks up there with it
this game has two modes no endings  characters no entrances lame move sets and looks like a really nice textured smackdown
i suggest u rent it for a night and when ure ready to throw it out the window return it
thq failed at making a game and im appauled at the way this games average review is  stars
this game is bad
and this is coming from a gamer of  yearsamerican idol could be the worst game of the year just by the looks of it look at how bad it is
the grapics are horrible
they are some of the worst graphics ever seen on playstation  i saw some screen shots
there are many dreamcast games that look better than this
i bet its boring too
i heard it took only one hour to beat
one hour
one hour
 for one hour
are you people insane
spending  for one hour of gameplay probably with no replay value either
the show may be horrible but i have a feeling this may be worsethis is just a flat out horrible game
when i first heard american idol would be making its debut as a video game i immediately knew it would be a horrible idea and it was
bad bad badthe fact that the game puts too much thought and effort into selecting a hairstyle and dressing up your teenage idol character just makes the game stink even more
as for the actual singing part well pressing buttons on the controller just the right way will help you stay in tune with the musical notes you hear
this isnt any fun though
avoidif you have a four year old that has for some reason an affinity for prefab pop music then this might be the game for you
for the rest of us this is a waste of money and time
wow you get to choose the costumes and the hairstyles
that is hardly what i call gameplay
as for the gameplay itself  if you know the difference between a triangle circle etc
then you are  percent of the way there
again your preschool tots might find this a little daunting but they will be the only ones
one reviewer compared this to the old game simon but that game emphasized good memory skills above everything else and is in fact still more challenging than this prefab nonsense
save your money and your time  avoid this boring unchallenging garbagethe grinch is back in full force and it looks like konami has tried to capture his essence in this poorly made game
konami has made some dynamite games castlevania symphony of the night and metal gear solid to name a few so it comes as a shock that theyve let this thing slip out the door
its sad that many unsuspecting and wellintentioned parents will pick this one up thinking that their child will enjoy it
this game is horrible pure and simple
every level consists of the same challenges so boredom sets in fast
the graphics go from awful to horrendous and back to awful if youre lucky
the popup is here and its in charge
for instance in the first level i played the grinch was on a ledge that completely disappeared when i moved him slightly
and on many occasions the insides of buildings would stick out through the roofs and walls making for a very unattractive gaming experience
i hope ive made it clear that the grinch is a gift no man woman or child should receivei played this game last xmas and within about  minutes i wanted to put it back in the box and throw it up the chimney
maybe i was just missing something or maybe this game is absolutely horrible
someone else on here said they couldnt figure out the st world im with youi dont get this gamethis game is soooo fun but sooooo many bugs
you think thats nothing
trust me what a pain in the bum
glitches stalls ugh
i have two copies for playstation and both have the same problems
yet if you buy it knowing and expecting bugs or if its ever rereleased without them this could be your favorite game ever
puzzle action without being lameso grinchythis game is tedious and boring
you use the same dumb tricks to beat different characters in lame looking arenasavoid ready  rumble  i love sport games but this just suckedwhy do i have to give it a starcmon amazon put a minus feature in place for game like thisim sorry to say i have to give a bad rating because the game just would not play as if it were blank the company would do well to check the games before they sell them if i didnt test or check things before i work on my clients i would lose clients
also i threw away the bag thinking there was no need for it so i couldnt return it and my kid was really upset
please test you games before selling sheeshas an adult i find this game extremely boring
basically you are a little dragon and hop around to recover dragon eggs stolen by some evil beings
your primary weapons are your body and the fire coming out of your mouth
the graphics is very simple ok maybe because i have a ps i keep forgetting this game was designed for psx and the controls like most sony games are more complicated than necessary
the gameplay is repetitive and very tedious
and the characters when they talk to you talk in text not voice
very lameif you want to play this game rent it dont waste your money buying it
its pretty easy to finish all the levels in a day or twowhat have they done to you d
this game had so much potential
good graphics great story and a huge fan base
but they made the game slow excessively difficult and bland
i tried i actually tried to like this game but it was so hard to feign interest in it for more than an hour
i loved the movies but this is a travestygo buy the legacy of kain series insteadpersonally i feel ripped off for having wasted money on this product
like call to power  the game has some interesting features particularly the variety of stealth units
however the game suffers from a number of major problems
not only does it appear that the designers never playtested this game its clear that they never went back and played the first call to power either many glaring problems from the original are still here
the worst problems  way too many bugs  the game crashes often
also theres a problem with save game files being corrupted that gets progressively worse as the game progresses
 i finally gave up after a game that i had spent  hours on would not reload even though i had eight seperate save game files from the last eight turns
every single one of them was corruptedthere are also numerous less catastrophic but more consistent flaws in the programming
for example stealth units are supposed to be clandestined
when you are attacked by one you dont know who sent it
the computer players however always do and immediately declare war in response to any stealth attack by you
badly written documentation  quite frankly this is the worst rulebook i have ever seen
its long winded and repetitive yet still lacks many key pieces of information
as a result you have to use trial and error to figure out how much of the game works
one example  the rules mention that you must have military units on hand to control your slaves but never spells out how many
the right ratio turns out to be  but you wouldnt know that unless your read the rules to call to power  whole parts of the game design just dont work  while the stealth units are interesting some of them are so badly designed that they just dont work
the cleric for example is the chief weapon of the theocracy which uses it to go out and convert enemy cities to your faith
this is an expensive and risky operation
however it is so ridiculously easy to undo this conversion station a military unit in the city endure one turn of mildly elevated unhapiness among the citizens that no player computer or human ever allows a city to remain converted for more than one turn
so why bother having the cleric unit in the game in the first place
there are similar extreme problems with other parts of the game many of them left over from call to power   do these people ever playtest their own products
clunky interface  the interface is badly designed
information that could easily be put on one screen gets spread out over two or three
for example information on trade routes that you currently have and those that are still available are placed on different screens
so to compare them and figure out if you have the optimal set of routes requires endlessly flipping back and forth between two screensoverall i just dont see how the designers could have played this game and still released it in the pathetic state that they did
this is the second game that ive bought from activision which was released in an unplayable condition
personally im swearing off their products in the futurethose interested in a good civilization type game should probably try civilization  or better still alpha centaurithis game is too hard to conquer because when you try to solve the puzzles with your quick wits the opponent will keep attacking you over and over
it makes me both angry and sick because you have no choice but to keep on dying
if you want to play puzzle games i recommend arkanoid buster bros and jack brothers
this game is not worth playingi dont know about the rest of you but im just never impressed with the street fighter series when it becomes a d game
the graphics look terrible
it looks like a  year old drew up stick figures and smeered poo on them and said quotlook mommy its blancaquotreally please you cant tell me that youre impressed with the same predictable and boring fights with this game
honestly street fighter was a game that should have never gone d because it just doesnt work for the game because even so you dont even have that because all you do is go back and forth
you cant get stuck in a corner but you also cant side step like tekkenif ps really wanted to impress people releasing street fighter alpha  would have been the smarter move
i have to say im really hoping that another one of these is not in the makingwheres the d motions
wheres the excitement
wheres my refundi bought it i played it and then i stuck it in a time capsul and buried in my backyard
hopefully tekken  will have some i dont knowuhm entertaining qualities you deserve from a ps gamestay away from this game it is terrible
i liked nfl blitz a lot and thought that this may be a bit simmular
there are a lot of differences but the main one is that nfl blitz is good
with terrible sound play control and too little characters this game bites the big one
do not even rent itgoodyou get a free case for the cdbadno jump buttonlinear game play you use a button to access doors and stairs what is this 
clunky controls
its like driving an rc car where you have to mentally reverse your thinking when the car is coming toward you versus going away
this is totally lame and makes the game practically unplayabledid i mention no jump buttoni paid  and would have had more fun had i kept the money and a made a paper airplane with it or b set it on fire and watched the delightful glowbuy devil may cry  and have a blast
avoid this onethe game arrived in a timely manner
ripped open the package put it in and loaded it up
looked great at first glance dont recall the intro specifically
the game play started and the directional buttons are used to control the mighty warlord
the joystick has been used with nearly every game ive played in the last ten years or more
in fact prior to home arcades all of the games used joysticks
this feature flaw was enough for me to turn off the game and not even bother
if you can get over that and play and enjoy it i say have at it
i know its been doneheads upthis is one of the best games ive played but ive never finished a session or three slopes in a row for that matter without the game crashing
i own ten other ps titles this is the only one that has issues so i know it isnt the consoleif you can run it without porblems its the greatest game out theresorry for the bad news folksfirst let me explain that i have never played this game
now with that said let me say that this game is probably terrible
the only person who will play this game is brian b because he eats and sleeps soccer
he is the soccer enthusiast
he refuses to buy or rent any other ps games showing severe disregard for his friends at work professional advice
he also is a huge rem and live fan
god forbidessentially konami needed some loot for christmastime their solution releasing this and gradiusthe graphics in this are a must see
they are creepy
the players look like showroom dummies animated to exact their revenge on the olympicsthe gameplay is the opposite of confusing
i dont really understand how quotpress buttons fastquot can be confusing especially since they pummel how to play into your head before each eventi rented it and took it back after  hours and got a different game because i had gotten gold in each event the nd time tryingmaybe konami had a deal with sony to invent a game that would only break your controllerstrying as hard as it can this game lurches lunges and sprints to a finish with a gold medal in crappynessthis quotolympicsquot simulation offers people the chance to compete in some true tests of player patienceat its core this game is nothing more than hyper olympics
why they chose to dump this game on the ps is beyond me
the game play is puzzling at best
logic has no place in this game and it makes that  clear early oni made the grave error of inviting some friends over to play
we would relive our days in the arcade playing hyper olympics
needless to say all we did was boggle at how such a game could have been madei can not go into how the controls worked because i am still not sure
the on screen explanations are sad and are nothing more than clues tossed to the players
its pretty clear that part of the challenge of this game is how to actually play itexasperation sets in very early
in record time in fact as this game has the worse music my poor ears have ever come across
i am sure we would all agree that the sprit of the olympics is best summed up in some very bad heavy rock music
right
if you own a sega and would like to point at a ps and say quotthe ps stinksquot this is the game to have running on it when you pointwhat a great concept they had
and what a shoddy pile of junk the resultant game turned out to be
evil dead hail to the king held my attention for precisely  minutes before the novelty wore off and i was left with nothing except a great sadness knowing i had spent my hardearned cash on one of the worst games ever to grace the playstationthe game gets an f on all fronts
its main drawing card was that it got bruce campbell involved to do voice work and help with concept but the fact is there isnt nearly enough variety in the wisecracks comic situations and ashs activities
theres nothing here that hasnt been done infinitely better in the evil dead movies
the computerized graphical representations of the evil dead characters are just pathetic check out that pale graphic imitation of the title sequence of army of darkness
and though bruce campbell is still one of the most delightfully hammy comic presences out there after about an hour of hearing him repeat the same halfdozen oneliners every half minute youre bound to get boredthis would be okay if the game had been well designed in terms of action aesthetics and feel
noooo
as with so many other games with a strong licensefranchise behind it evil dead hail to the king abuses this license using it to attempt to cover up atrocious design
first the control scheme
its bad enough that this game features the single worst use of camera angles ive ever seen move over fighting force  but why oh why would they force a firstpersonview control scheme onto a thirdpersonperspective game
imagine having to play double dragon using the controls for medal of honor and you get the ludicrous nature of evil deads controls
and oh yes the camera angles  what makes the designers think its a good idea to fix the camera on top of a tree looking down on ash when youre trying to fight the undead
and even while fighting if you move past the edge of the screen the action stops so that the game can load a new closer angle which completely kills the flow of the action
then again there isnt much in the action anyway  swing your chainsaw and hope for a hit twist and turn and mash those buttons
and there are so many enemies all of whom react in pretty much the same way that it becomes excessive monotony before long
the fact that the enemies respawn simply adds to the boredom
the only plus
some of the environments look tolerably like the movie
if only you werent forced to look from those weird eyesores they call camera angles
this is the worst case of game programmers trying to be filmmakers ive seen yetall this adds up to an experience akin to waiting in a doctors office for your turn with no magazines and the heat turned up to the max
i dont care when i kill an enemy i dont care when i find a page out of the necronomicon and i dont care when i get slaughtered
the apathy this game gives me is even worse than an ultratough game that hangs me out to dry
stick with the movies one minute of evil dead  contains more action fun and engagement than an hour spent with this sewer rat of a gamethe only good things i can say about this game is the graphics are good and bruce campbells voice acting is good but the gameplay sucks and the game is not fun at all when your chainsaw runs out of fuel in the game and the chainsaw is your most useful weapon in the whole entire game because your shotgun handgun and rifle are all pretty much useless the left handed weapons in evil dead a fistful of boomstick like your  shotguns and your gatling guns you have and your laucher you have in that game are so much better and so much more useful than the  left handed weapons you have in evil dead hail to the king this game sucks assi love the films i think the game set up is great familular and fun
i think the graphics are okay by ps standards butthe control is awful
the came is set up like a keyboard game for pc up back and
spin
yes left and right spin the ash
you have to spin him then press up for forward spin press up spin press upwalking left
spin press up
walking right
spin press up
want to fight
too bad your behind a tree a wall a rock and cant see your self to are you ready
spin then press updid they play it before they released it
i cant believe they didlove the movies hate the gamebuy fistful of boomstick
still too hard a game but it plays correctly and that matters alotnow if they would just make a real game they might learn theres a real market out therei really enjoyed every evil dead movie growing up
they scared me at times when my parents would watch em but as i grew older not so much
i own all the movies so when i saw that i had missed this for dreamcast i picked it up for  dollars or so
wow did anyone even test this
did i get a bootlegged fake copy i know i didnt
this is horrible
i tried to like this game really i did
nothing flowshorrible camera  dreaded graphics x unforgivable controls  any fun what so ever  evil dead hail to the kingim serious guys this is bad
im talking like crack bad
your filled with excitement you got it for only ten bucks or so but when you get it started  minutes later you just feel horriblehow can anybody like this terd yeah it has neat graphics and sound and bruces voice but the controls are the worst in videogame history no joke basically u walk around with jerky animation using a button to flail your chainsaw in every direction with no aiming at all even worse it gets stuck in the creatures and runs out of gasoline cause of technical glitches the whole game u are running  frames per second in grainy semispooky backgrounds flailing your chainsaw at poorly drawn creatures this games a joke i own  game systems nearly  games and beat ever  of them but i wont even play this disgrace  time even for  bucks its not worth itunless you are a real snowboarder which i am not and into watching espn winter xgames  you will prob
think this game really sucksfor the money buy ssx tricky and thank me laterthis is simply a joke christmas fodder
if you enjoy playing this over other ps games you must not like utilizing the full capability of your expensive systemtruth of the matter is konami needed to make up the costs of the developers kit so it releases a few lame games which will be rented and bought just out of sheer lack of launch titlesthe only way this game could have been valid would be if there was a gradius  in it as well that is actually good and utilizing that emotion enginethe only emotion evoked by renting this game was pure sorrow
i guess this is what i get for utilizing an emulator to play these games a few years agolet me start off by saying that back in the day of the super nintendo i did own gradius  and had an absolute blast with it
the games graphics music and gameplay were standout gorgeous i loved it
granted i have never played gradius  but figured it would be just as good if not better than the g that i remember from back in the day
the versions on this ps console are an embarrassment to the pss capability
granted even though this game was released somewhat early in the pss era i simply cant believe that a system that can play games like resident evil  and god of war i and ii could put out something this hackednow before i say anything let me just say that the g on this disc is not the super nintendo version
so if you are like me and wanted to play that game again you can forget it
dont pay any attention to all these ridiculous positice star reviews on this site
i have no idea what kind of drugs these other gamers are on or  they probably work for konami directlythis is supposed to be a straight arcade port but i cant imagine the arcade version looking and playing this terribly and i was right
i went as far as to check youtube videos of both the snes and arcade versions and they both look significantly better than this game
so judging from that this game isnt even a straight arcade port of g so what version is this exactly
i have no idea
seems like some extremely poor rushed port of the arcade version that plays more like an emulated game with extremely pixaleted graphics that look as if they belong on the original nes
things are just too uneven the objects are too big and the ships and enemies have probably like  or  colors at most
overall it looks terrible
i was shocked because after the really cheap looking presentation i was afraid that my worst fear was true that this was not the snes version
for that game it seems that konami made it a point to overhaul the gameplay and graphics when bringing the original arcade version home to make it more home friendly and they did an absolutely excellent job of doing so
g for the snes game looked and played about x better than the original arcade version
im not sure why konami being the same company that brought the snes version knowing full well it was superior to the arcade decided instead bring the more substandard arcade version to the ps instead of their snes classic
not to also mention that the ps has about  or  times the graphical horsepower that the snes had
its like are you kidding me
again it was a rush job and an absolute embarrassment to them
shame on konami for not having the common sense to at the very least just port the snes version over
if you ask me this shouldve been an overhauled and updated version of the snes version
who even cares about the arcade version of g
i wish i can say some redeeming things about the game but if the game isnt even arcade perfect whats the point
this is just an humiliating rush job that was just put out to meet demand
even the voice acting prompts in the game that state what power up you use sound severely weak
konami decided to forgo the cheesy sounding killdestroy them all
and you need more practice bits out of the snes versions and on here they just sound annoying and stupid and completely unfitting to the games atmospherenow considering gradius  there isnt much difference
the g version on this disc does look and play a bit better than the g version
but from my memory g wasnt brought home on any console so we really only have the arcade version to go by
whether this is an actual arcade port of the game im not really sure because i didnt bother researching g on youtube or anywhere else to make a comparison
granted even so the game does move a bit faster and gameplay is a bit smoother and there isnt that disgusting pixelated look to the game but overall g is just a small step better than g
i feel no real desire to return to either game and would much rather just buy a used copy of g for the snes instead
to add insult to injury the games dont even have a continue feature with them
nope you basically have to beat these games in a single sitting with your measly  lives and  if you change it on the options menu and considering how badly these games play dont even bother putting it on anything harder than very easy mode
you wont get anywheresave your money and if youre a gradius fan i would suggest either getting an nes to play the original an snes for g and for your ps go out and spend the extra for gradius  which is a completely new version of gradius that actually decides to use the pss graphical power
but avoid this rush job at all coststhis was one game that i remotely enjoyed in the arcade but unfortunately what made the game worth its while was the gun
the gun was the whole attraction of the game which was otherwise just a dull shootemupbut my question is why
why repackage a game that was clearly marked for the arcades with the extra guns and whatnot
yes playstation has had some success in repackaging some of the arcade games for play at home and yes thay have made great games with shooter attributes without the gun but if they were to repackage a shooter game where people have gotten used to using a gun in the arcade for playstation they should and could have gave us some sort of a gun for just a few dollars extra and at least made it worth its whilethis game   when i buy a game i want to be able to play it over and over
but with this game if you play it once you know all there is about it
the snipers are always in the same spot doing the same thing for the same amount of time
if you like arcade games like this rent dont buy this game its a waste of moneysilent scope cannot be played using a control pad
the scope moves so slowly and it is rather frustrating to look for enemies while being shot sixty million times because it takes twelve years to move the gun scope around to find targets
a good ps zapper if included would make this game  or even  stars
the graphics are crisp and clear the sound is good but none of that matters when your game is over in ten seconds because you cant look around fast enoughbought it because it sounded really interesting
never got it to run on my computer
continuoslly locked up my system
actually threw away the disc
didnt feel it was worth wrecking my computer fori just picked up mafia  more than  years after its release  mostly because of the positive ratings more on this later
if you can get past the fact that the graphics are dated although remarkable considering the limitations they worked with and learn about the game in terms of gameplay alone read onfirst the basics mafia tells the story of thomas angelo as he joins the ranks of the salieri famiglia and gains power within their ranks
the story  which seems to be one of the selling points of the game  is delivered through twenty multistaged missions and inengine cutscenes
the many interactive challenges in each mission are delivered through two distinct gameplay modes driving and thirdperson explorationcombatthe thirdperson mode is the most versatile
from menial work to secret dealings to baseball bat beatings to allout tommygun massacres this is where the most action will come from
these segments can be pretty challenging the ai doesnt waste its chances
if you can get shot you will get shot you in the other hand will leave lots of bullets in door thresholds as the game misrepresents your line of sight
its probably too preoccupied with cooking threats  be it a couple of shotguntoting goons out of nowhere or a wellplaced shooter  to bother with those pesky details such as saving your progress
youll find yourself going back to square one quite time a few times as the game just decides that its not handing you any more ammo or health refills and tough luck here comes yet another triggerhappy batch freshly teleported from screwjooevery failure and there will plenty of them will set you back from twenty minutes to an hour of gameplay and it wont spare you any of the mindnumbing chores that saturate the experience
you will have to go drive all the way there again talk to guy a and guy b again search for and fetch c for them most of the time without knowing precisely what youre looking for or where to begin and even load boxes into trucks and wipe out puke from a backed out toilet and its just as fun as it soundsnot all of the game is made of tight spots and grunt work though
you will be doing plenty of driving too some missions involve vintage car chases which at  mph somehow fail to be the adrenaline pumpers youd expect and the miniature city of lost haven is big and labyrinthine enough that most of your time will be spent traveling between points a and b going any significant distance in these roads which apparently were designed by mc
escher means a lot going around blocks and finding the entrance points of bridges and tunnels
you can try to cut corners but policemen and cop cars will show up when least expected to punish you for running that red light or speeding
lastly theres also a little circuit racing here your main task will be not to engineer those sharp turns in a way that will keep you car from spinning like a top which is harder than it sounds as the car seems to like itthat about sums it up
oh i forget mafia has been compared to the gta titles but in truth the resemblance is very superficial
it should be likened to the sims  sure you can roam about and steal another car and victimize random citizens but it doesnt reward wanton violence the way gta did
no powerups no better guns or cars no cool stuff to be stolen fuggedaboutitveredict avoid like the plague
unless youre a masochistwhat should have been a threehour game was padded into a much larger but radically duller and more frustrating experience
what little genuine fun remained was irrecoverably marred by obtuse artificial difficulty stiff controls the savepoint system and braindead choreswhether the team ran out of ideas five seconds after development began or they just hate gamers i dont know
i theorize that the positive reviews given to this game either a come from a time where much less was expected from games and b nobody dares tell the emperor that hes naked
look elsewhere for a genuine vintage thrill ive heard max payne also comes pretty cheap these daysa note to game developers everywhere
its possible to create a challenging game that does not involve intensely annoying obstacles
rule   all games should have a quick save option at any point in the game
no one enjoys going over the same mission over and over to get it right
mafia only saves at the end of a mission or important taskor not nearly enough
this alone makes me want to pitch the whole mess
rule   excessive amounts of driving around and map reading with old jalopy cars with extremely poor handling and dealing with other stupid drivers on the road is no fun attall
way too much driving required
i drive enough to and from work x a week and deal with inconsiderate idiots on the road daily
i dont need it in a game i want to be a diversion from the grind of daily lifeif there were workable cheats available for this game it might be bearable
i would like to finish it but only with access to cheats that actually work
i play games for enjoyment not torture
ive searched the internet several times for cheats and none of them work as described
a real disappointing game that didnt have to bethis game wont install on my new amd  cpu it freezes during disc   purchase with extreme cautionive got a brand new nvidia   mb graphics card and just got back into computer gaming so i was eager to try this game because its a genre i love
plus my pc played cod and battlefield  so there shouldnt have been technical problems to play it
boy was i wrong to think thatthis game is a technical disaster
i ran it on a p with  mb ram and it still crashed on me three times something that never happened even once with other games at allafter it crashed for the third time before i even got to start the first mission i gave upthe developers really dropped the ball on this game
from its looks and screen shots ive seen it looks like a great game
but if its too unstable to play nobodys going to notice itthis game is an absolute disaster from a technical standpoint and the developers should be ashamed of themselvesfirst there are similar games with better grahpics like myst
second upon playing the game i felt a bit betrayed
nothing on the packaging indicates that this game has a specifically christian outlook but it becomes apparent upon play
had i know i wouldnt have bought it in the first place
now that i have i suppose ill have to sell it in an attemp to recoup something
the designers et al should have had the integrity to be honest about the slant of the game before unsuspecting people buy it and discover it for themselves
ive nothing against proselytization but at least be up front about it so that i dont waste my time or moneyi bought this brand new and the yellow cable had black smudge marks all over it
the pin connector that plugs into the ps was damaged and loose
i had with it red white yellow and an s video cable instead of red white and s video
i tried everything possible to get it to work and nothing no picture showed up or sound when turned to the right channel mode and the cables matching where it should go
the black cable also has a small cut in the black cable but it didnt go all the way through
i will be returning this once i get paid and buying something else
i heard ps s video cables work with the ps and it is a sony product so i will try thatthe svideo connector is faulty
it only works as a composite cable
i wish i had tried it sooner as i would have returned iti feel i should post how much i hated this piece of junk here since the other reviews seem to give the impression that its a fantastic game and everybody will love it
i couldnt stand it and took it back a couple of days later
all the positive reviews below positively puzzle me since engaged in a conversation about this game in the local eb everybody else declared they had hated it too
so whos writing those reviewsthe thing is too slow
it takes about  years to build a school
and the economics of the game dont make sense either  you charge nothing for rent and pay everybody beaucoup bucks and still everybody moves off your island and the birth rate decreasesalso this game is not as funny as the programmers obviously believe
i agree with the reviewer below who said that the manual is much funnier than the actual gamelastly the graphics of the game are overcomplex meaning that the game will be extremely fussy on most setups
this wouldnt be such a problem but tropico either has no tech support line or they dont answer what they say is the support line or theyve done a fantastic job with hiding the contact information of the real tech support line
in other words after a couple of days of trying i couldnt get any helpthis game is ridiculous i couldnt even finsish it
in fact i barely started it
its obviously just a ripoff of all the blair witch hype from a few years ago a movie i love
disappointingas a fan of the movie i had high hopes for this game but they didnt pan out
not quite a true port  rustin parr is more of a crossover between the bwp franchise and nocturnein the game you play elspeth doc holliday a sort of gunwielding investigator for a supersecret government organization of the s  one introduced in nocturne
with its own simulator room the agency trains agents like holliday to take on missions involving the supernatural what we now call paranormal phenomenon
inevitably hollidays superiors have become drawn to the case of rustin parr a recluse who killed a group of children near his hometown of burkittsville formerly blair maryland in a psychotic rage in   parr vaguely attributed his crimes to prodding by the legendary elly kedward aka the blair witch
parrs story was told in the movie and its apparently his creepy house in which the final cryptic scenes of the film play out
the premise of the game sort of clashes with the originals movies selling point  which was to keep us wondering about whether these supernatural elements were genuine no atter how obvious it was they werei gotta confess that i couldnt get past the startup level
the game ran smoothly as far as hardware is concerned on my old pentium  at this stage hardware specs are your least worry but gameplay itself was a major hassle
using the nocturne game engine you maneuver holliday in rd person
only unlike other shooters  rd or st person game perspective isnt fixed to the character but to a room  set pieces through which your character enters  exits
this allows for nice looking scenes since your pc doesnt have rerender the backgrounds to compensate for movement but extremely static ones
it also makes it harder to confront threats and position yourself for such esoteric acts as opening doors or picking up objects
this made for extremely frustrating gameplay from the very first level
i got fed up just trying to navigate the simulator room and decided to make the game vanish from my hd
recently i thought id give the game a second chance yet all ive found is the cd sleeveeveryone likes saving money and this controller is cheaper by far but its not worth it
aside from the occasionally working buttons and tricky directionalpad the worst crime comes from the rumble feature
if youre playing a game that uses the rumble feature a lot youre going to discover that inferior plastic shaking in your hands not only feels wrong but it sounds wrong too
i had people from way across the room comment on the loud noises coming from the vibrations of this plastic wonder
do yourself a favor and just buy the real thing instead of this onewhen u buy this controller you only buy it to save  bucks
you wont save  bucks when you have to spend  bucks to fix ur ps
also it voids ur warrenty
to me it didnt ruin my ps completely it just burned out the controller port
so i use the second controller port with a multi tap which doesnt always work i finalyl decided to send the ps for fixing
and it was much cheaper than  bucks cause it was only a controller portso pretty much instead of saving  bucks which u can make in an hour working for burger king i spend lots more fixing the pswow let me count the ways this controller stinkslets start with the fact that this waste of  will void your ps warranty
yep i found out the hard way
any any
thirdparty accessory you buy that is not licensed by sony will instantly void your ps warranty
one month after purchasing my ps which was also the time period for the return policy at the store i bought the ps from i made the mistake of picking up one of these horrid controllers it lasted two weeks before finally dying  that is when i could play games
games started locking up left and right after i started using it
according to sony tech support the second i plugged in this uncomfortable hunk of poo my ps warranty went flying out the window
so i sent the ps back to sony for repair along with this controller for testing at the price of  and a month without the machine its hard to watch your new dvds when your brand new dvd player is already being repaired
the ps came back repaired along with a new warranty and a letter from sony stating this controller was the cause of the problem as determined by diagnostic testing
shweeeeeeeeeet
i understand that this will not happen to every ps combined with this controller but you will lose your warranty none the less
i have run across this issue on several ps message boards and the sony tech support person i initially spoke with said many other ps owners have had this problem thanks to the dual impact gamepad
please learn from my mistake and spend the extra cabbage on a good controller
or not its your well it was cheap
the cables are super thin
think cheap headphone cable
the sound cables worked fine but the video output has continual static snow that drives over the screen in waves
other than that it worksi tried this stick out to compliment my old namco arcade stick
they shoudve spent less time with the metal and put more of the money into developing responsive buttons and a stick that registers motion correctly
none of the extra features matter if the basic design is flawed so deeply
a controllers first and really only purpose is to enable you to move your character around smoothly onscreen
the shadowblade fails at this
ive used ascii sticks hori sticks mas sticks and the shadowblade isnt even close though it shares a similar price rangeshop around
there are way better sticks out there
especially if youre a fighting game fan youre just torturing yourself if you buy this messon a whim and a touch of desperation i picked this up at a local shop being the only stick i could find in town
i really regret doing so because its just awful
quotmushquot describes it well mushy buttons mushy stick just mushy
this is due to the fact that everything on the stick is capable of operating in analog mode why
this is an arcade stick for crying out loud
because of this response time is greatly reduced in fighters and youve got to really throw the stick through its entire range before it will registerif youve ever used a nice stick like the ascii ft even the agetech dc stick or any of happs sticks in an arcade for any length of time avoid this thing like the plague
youll regret it as much as i dothis product is horrable for arcades i got this for metal slug sucks it evan sucks on fighters i was like omg dont get this its waste of money and timemy intention with this review is to provide a rather different oppinion from most reviews here which qualify this game with an average  stars
i purchased this game for my son for two reasons  the price drop and the excellente reviews
i had no previous knowledge of rayman so i came unbiased to play it
i own  titles from spyro the dragon games that have always satisfied my son jak and daxter ps and crash bandicoot wrath of cortex xbox and my son plays all of them very regularly
i personally like these games very much so i expected rayman  to be a great platformer game
well the thing is that my son played rayman  for about an hour and a half and never picked it up again i myself had to play it in order to understand what was wrong but then i understood himfirst the graphics i have read in every review even the newer ones that the graphics are excellent and so on
well to my opinion the graphics can not even match spyro  on the psone they are graphics that are ok for an early launch on the ps but can not be compared to the possibilities that we are getting today and i refer in this case to jak and daxter where the developers naughty dog have done a beautiful job on this subject
second the voice acting what can i say i personally found the constant whispering instead of real voices very annoying i even thought there was some kind of malfunction in the cd because of this until i realized that those whispers were the voices
third the story even though it is a typical platform story there is no fun in it i personally found it very boring and i couldnt play it for more than half hour before i could fall asleepi truly wish that i could find something good about this game but the truth is that i had to sell it one day after i got it neither my son nor i liked this game
if you truly want to play a good platformer then go for jak and daxter there is no comparison great graphics hilarious voice acting even in spanish good story and lots of fun or wait for the ps version of spyro the dragon or even play the psone versions of spyro i can assure you that you will have more fun with those than you will with rayman   i was deceived by the price drop and the good reviews and made a terrible mistake wasted money so dont fall for the same this game can only and hardly diserve the one star i gave itthis game really isnt fun
im not really sure what is supposed to be fun about it
you cant skip through the cut scenes and the characters that play your concience are just annoying
even with the trick to make immense amounts of food and wood with miracles you spend all your time trying to make the ant like people do something
i spent about thirty or forty hours trying to enjoy this game and then i gave up
i had spent a rediculous amount of time trying to get through only a few parts of the game
your creature really isnt very interesting
sure it learns and everything but even teaching it is just a matter of repeating the same thing over and over and over and over again
not something i really enjoy in a game but hey thats just me
a few quotlevelsquot into the game your creature is taken from you and you have to be a god without him for a while
right when i was getting a close to getting him back i was set back another several hours by an attack i could have stopped had the symbol interface not been so slow
im not sure who would enjoy this game for any amount of time
if you like being in control id suggest a sim game
another thing i found odd was that this game came on a single cd
for its price and the amount of hype that i had heard i would have expected a game which consisted of a little more than poorly rendered worlds in which tasks are set up that are much more like chores than questsin closing if you like taking out the garbage and doing other menial tasks there is a slim chance you could enjoy this gamethe reviewers who went nuts over this game at the popular magazines and web sites probably felt the same way i did after completing the first of the games quotworldsquotafter the quottutorialquot world where you are walked through the games premise story and how to get things done i was having a lot of fun and was very excited about the gamethen it all went down the tubesthe supposed creature ai is nonexistent
it has nothing to do with artifical intelligence it is merely an ifthen database that plays percentages
it is frustrating and not complex
the ai wont link consequences to actions so you punish or reward actions regardless of their consequencesthe game is very unhelpful
since you have to spend a lot of time away from your creature doing quests monitoring villagers or scouting around it would be nice if the games messages meany anything
however when the message quotyour creature will now do that sort of thing more oftenquot comes up it make syou want to scream
what did the creature do
was it good or bad
is it too late to rewardpunish and teach the creature and of course it is
who the heck knows
the game doesnt tell youwhen you do get around to rewarding and punishing your creature you really have no idea if you quotgot to him in timequot or if he is ridiculously associating your reward with another actioncreature combat is ridiculously lame
its a glorified mouse clicking battle that doesnt really mean anythingfinally lets say youve played a while feel like youve gotten the hang of it and want to start over too bad theres no such thing as starting over
first off you have to go through the tutorial no skipping no fast forwarding so there goes a good hour of your time
it doesnt really matter if you save or load your game your quotcreatures personalityquot is persistent
basically they were far too lazy to work in a real saveload so instead they just hardwire your quotcreaturequot in even if you quotget a new creaturequotyes the community has developed fan made workarounds and patches
but this underscores the point
the fan community has to rush in to save a game that is too restricting and too deceiving
there is nothing going on under the hood of this quotgamequot
you dont really train anything since a truly trained creature would not have to be retaught every hour or so but simply rewarded properly
and its a fact that many trained psychologists will disagree that punishments are as predictable as the game pretends to be
but dont worry your quotcreaturequot will clean out its database of quottrainingquot while you are away doing other things to add to your frustrationand after a while youll get sick of the controls to rewardpunish
youll be clamoring for a hotkeywhat is the one single innovation in this game
well there is one
its the quotscribblingquot method used to cast spells by drawing with the mouse
some people memorize hotkeys others dont
this is easy and intuitive with a helpful legend in the lower right hand corner so you remember that moving the cursor in a swirl brings up the spell you want etcone innovation for a truly pathetic game
this isnt worth your time although for the first hour you will be amazed and in awe
then your frustration will turn to anger and an oath to never buy another game from peter molyneaux its no joke his next venture is named project ego how fittingok i was expecting alot at first cause i went to a friends house and watched him play it for awhile it looked like lots of fun
so i installed it on my computer which is more than adequate for any other game but apperently not amazing enough for this game everything went slow and even when i adjusted the picture quotqualityquot nothing changed the quality was the same and so was the slow speed
so i dealt with it and started playing
the tutorial was sooooo long and boring i wanted to die but i knew soon id have a creature and it would be neat
so i get through the tutorial and have to find my creature which takes about  hours cause the controls for this game are the most horrible and difficult controls ever
i mean all they had to do was have the mouse control where youre looking and then have the keyboard arrows zoom in and out thats all but no it had to be impossible instead
i cant even tell you how many times i got stuck just trying to move a few feet
then after i got my creature i started trying to be nice to villagers but theyre all lazy and dumb they cant do anything on their own i killed them just for being so stupid and demanding
then i had problems with my creature cause the bugs in the game wouldnt allow me to pick up a horse to feed it after the horse had moved out of the animals range
it was just so frustrating and bad that i immediatly uninstalled the game and returned
its not worth anyones time and what seems like it would be fun is really just tedious and boringthis game is really boring and it has high systems requirements and video cards problems do not buy this gamethis game admirably breaks from a lot of the god games inspired by sim city and civilization
unfortunately the game designers tried to do far too much with the way the player interfaces with the game universe gave inadequate in game tutorials and made the manual almost entirely useless
after many hours of gameplay i couldnt figure out how to build a sustained civilization without giving it constant attention
i would like to say more but i just wanted to register my frustration with this game and hopefully dissuade others from buying iti have a p  and this game runs slow and clumsy
the interface is overwhelmingly confusing and there just doesnt seem to be that much point to the game
sure killing your subjects is fun and the pet feature is nice
however the interfacecontrols are simply to complex
i dont know about you but i am going back to civ ii and sc
skip black and whitedont waste your timethis is forty dollars worth of tweak and not as much fun as a typical simsomewhere between  and  years in the making black amp white disappoints and irritates on so many different levels that its hard to know where to start
the nonintuitive control system takes hours of getting used to and even then is clumsy and unresponsive
the graphics are not on a par with such recent titles as giants or sacrifice the landscape morphs and warps as you move around it and the villagers well the less said about them and their unfeasibly large feet the better
the subplots are supposed to be humourous but are merely twee as are the good and bad advisors
much has been made in the gaming press of the creature ai and it may well be the best ever in a computer game but the game itself which should surely be the most important part is sadly lacking
this may well be selling swiftly but will be returned to retail outlets just as fast by all but the most persevering of gamerswell this games sucksit is not even a finished product
big gaming companies should be punished for not delivering a finished product
its a different story if a game is not good but its totally unacceptable if people have to pay for imcomplete productdont buy this game if you have a dfx voodoo banshee video card the only good graphics are on the creaturesthe support is also terrible i called a few days ago and the support person said go to the site and download the patch after waiting the agonising  minute download i tryed to run the patch and then it saidquotcant patch this you do not have the right version installedquot how many versions are there
two words dont buy it
lion head studios is geting no more buisness from methis is one of the most overrated piles of tripe ive ever playedthe graphics are pretty but youll need a pretty hefty card and processor to get the most out of them
my voodoo mhz struggled almost constantlythe gamneplay although hyped up something massive is dull at best
it just boils down to the people want wood so put some trees in the store
the people want food so put some food in the store
the other god wants you to get more land put food and wood in another villages store
etcsound is good but it doesnt reallt matter considering the rest of the game is so dullthe creatures although made to seem like real children are boring and essentially boils down to ape picks up man god slaps ape ape goes quotoohquot ape picks up another man
etc i suppose eventually the ape will learn not to pick up the man but youll have flogged this game by thenmy rating zipmaybe  if you coiuld use the cd as a coaster maybethis game is very original with good graphics
the person who thought this up was very creative
  however once you get in the game you will encounter a plethera of annoying bugs
some of these are invisible creatures that wont move creature wont eat or learn creature wont interact with objects missing sheep for sheep quest etc
so you go download patch  and install it
then when you try to run black and white it will start to run but the game never makes it far enough to start
it just freezes
so you use the easy program to report the problem  and that program locks up your system
congratulations you have just wasted  your hard earned money on a  buggy gamei read osiris review about needing the mb patch that is incorrect
that is a patch for the nonenglish game if people still want to here and see english language
being from canada i guess he would need that
sorry osiris but game companies expect that if you live in canada and buy the game there you will probably speak the local language not the games natural english
i admit that that is a huge patch especially if you own a modem but at least it was made available to you
i have yet to play the game which is why i didnt rate it high
however i ordered it a few days ago and should get to play it around january
i will write another review about it then
i am fairly sure i will give it a high rating thenthis game is truly awful
the game has an interesting concept but the realization it horrible
youre a god but the only way for you to do anything is with your free floating hand  which is close to impossible to control
between that the poor graphics and the problems it caused with my system i gave up after a couple days
i wouldnt bother unless youre into frustrationthe graphics are good but the gameplay totally sucksi was not impressed with this game
i found that when you hit the key board to move it was too quick
i would press it once or twice and it would just spin around
overall i did not like this game and suggest that you look for something elsethis game is booooooorrrring
my goodness is this game boring
if youre not asleep now you will be once youve played this thing
i actually think that the talking quotbilly bassquot you know the one in the commercials that sings is a whole lot more entertaining than thisthis game is boring and its just collecting stuff in your car
i was expecting more from rockstar than this crappy gamethis game disapointed me quite a lot
it has bad graphics but the worst part is the control nothign like any other racing game except maybe pole position for atari
bad physics int he sense of hitting others and aceloration and everything
with the bad control i find it quite hard to get anywhere int he game as well as the sight of the game screen just mkes me want to shut it off
sorry i dont mean to be so rude to the game but i really am disapointed and would not recommend it if you like racing games at allwith difficult controlslousy graphics and repetitive musicthis game is a mockery of the great james bonddont waste your money on this worthless shooterif you want real james bondbuy the movies insteadeveryone loves this game yet everyone seems to hate it for all the same reasons and its a shame really
crimson skies was like a soon to be star standing in the wings waiting for its big break but when it hit the stage and stood in the lime light it choked and fell flat on its face in the worst possible way
what a disappointment it was to load crimson skies and have my jaw instantly hit the keyboard for all its quirky and wonderful audiovisual treats the voices the music the design the brilliant colors and the trees my god the trees
 only to have my guts turn while i listened to the hard drive in  my compaq pii  mhz system grind and groan and crackle for what seemed endless minutes as it struggled with a simple drop down menu
and lets not even get into the nearly three minutes it took to just exit the game
oh i have the onboard tools to run it ati rage fury pro mb board and  sdram but it seems it doesnt matter what your running a    or even  mhz system youll simply end up spending much more time waiting to exit menu screens or load levels then youll ever spend playing the game
and even after an exhausting hour on the phone with our patient friends at microsoft tech support tinkering and tweaking my system i gained very little satisfaction although the frustration grew with the fact that this absolutely brilliant concept wrapped up in probably one of the best designed packages ever to hit store shelves was so horribly flawed that it squeezes the very life out of what could of have been one of the best games of the year if not ever
if  i were to rate this game on sheer fun excitement and originality theres no question it earns a solid five stars but the endless waiting for those brief brilliant moments when i actually got to scream through amazingly detailed  billowing clouds and over crimson skies breathtaking landscapes made me just walk away shaking my head muttering to myselfwith great disappointment so close and yet so very far
maybe someday theyll find the silver bullet patch that will redeem this worthy title if not it runs the very real risk of going down in software history as the heavens gate of  pc gaming
heres to hopping that doesnt happeni have had two logotech sticks the first logitechs wingman d
it lasted a year and a half but toward the end lost center and never recovered
my second this one lasted for  months
then the twist started to go leaving me guessing where neutral on my rudder was every time
i have read of others who have had similar centering issues it is a good product out of the box but the quality of components inside the base are not what i expecti ended up replacing it with a saitek evo cyborg force it may cost a little more but it is much more adjustable and the feel is more substantial to mei wont be buying logitech again from my experience
some others may have had better luck but from the centering issue well thats pretty basic in any flight simfirst off let me start off by saying check reviews for this game on game spot you will see a rating of  out of  by  votes there is  votes on amazon and somehow it is rated  out of  this is a game that is basically only playable if your a child who wants to play a shooter game that isnt quite as violent challenging or story driven
not the worse game in existence but this definitely a middle of the pack title  or  stars is generous in my opinionencouraged by the rave reviews i bought this game but ended up tossing it into the garbage after  hours of play
aside from the horrible  graphics there is dead boring game play on a buggy interfaceyou spend hours building cities that lack character and armies symbolized by one awful figure
dragging your people around the map is a real challenge because you can only move them a tiny bit each turn while getting them onto ships is even more frustrating due to the awkward tile design that governs movements on the map
historical value is  as ancient egyptians build cities named melbourne and helsinki and the american empire begins with abe lincoln in  bcdo yourself a favor and grab a copy of age of kings or even better combat missionif you like wwii themesand you wont be disappointed
they do cost more but you get what you paid fordespite almost universal praise in the games press this is a terrible terrible game
im horrified that it seems to have gathered so many good reviews
its essentially a dated semiprofessional quake  mod with the addition of a novel damagemodelling system that lets you shoot peoples arms off
made even worse by a useless attempt to give the game some authenticity  the box cd installation and loading screen are covered with warnings that the game is a realistic depiction of modern warfare all of which exist purely as a tease because the game itself is essentially a gi
joe cartoon with blood
the violence is strictly cartoonish  shoot somebody in the leg and he hops around yowling  and the novelty wears off after a minute or so
everything else about the game fails comically so from the interactive music which because of the games lack of any slow bits stays in combat mode almost all the time negating the point to the stealth element make too much noise and bad guys appear in the level usually in totally illogical places to the interface which looks as if it had been drawn by a backwards child
the gameplay itself is pure quake   you run through a linear track along which bad guys are placed at regular intervals
sometimes you have to press a button to open a door
if something moves you shoot it
most usually nothing moves  the bad guys are in the words of gamespot strawberryjamfilled turrets
anyway if you want a decent modern shootemup with stealth elements get project igi
if you want violence trip somebody up and then jump on them and have a fightit has been awhile since i played this i have the ps version and i i bet you could get a used copy for about  cents
this is probably the most violent game i have ever played
there is a violence lock in the game that can let you control whether dismembered limbs or blood are allowed
if you turn everything on you have one big goreapalooza
this game goes beyond mature
dont let the kids get there hands on thiswhen my printer prints there are blank lines in the middle of the picture
doesnt work
cant fix it eitheri thought madden  will have a lot of difference with madden  just like what fifa did but the game was not even better a single bit
the linesmen in the game still arent d modeled but still are d modeled
the graphics may be a bit better but has made the game very slow
then i thought about the new players in miami dolphins
at madden  dan marino was concederd still playing in real life but was not
and i saw that in madden  dan marino is still concedered as a player at the dolphins
the whole setup was bad
madden also put in european football teams which i think is gossip
if those teams they put were real id bet that the players arent real players at alli am not what one might call an overly hyped video game player
i dont go out and buy the next installment of ff after viii it really got bad imo i enjoyed hack and its storyline though but i felt that the series could have been brought together into one large game like with ffvii
then there is the pe video game i loved the first one had some trouble but over all it was a great game
i knew there was a part  so i found a copy and started playing it
boywas i disappointedfirst the game play is terrible the movement is haphazard the angles are horrific and its down right troublesome unlike the first one
i loathed the movement there was none of the smoothness of the first onesecond i hated the leveling what leveling there is
you dont go up in your hit points you barely go up in mps and parasite powers and even worse when you go to a next scene from one point to the next in the story you go back down to your  hit pointsthird which is related to the angles the combat is atrocious
there is nothing quick and exciting in fact its down right stressful because since you rarely have a chance to get items for health unless you spend quotmoneyquot between the scenes at home base you end up dying again and again until low and behold you get through with maybe  hit point left and then wham you are hit by another attack and you have to do the whole stupid thing over again
even worse the camera angles are so bad you rarely if ever see the enemies and just shoot blindlyfourth connected to three the weapons are horrible to use
you end up getting killed repeatedly because you have to jerkingly reload so many times that when you are facing multiple opponents unlike the smoothness of the original first story and youre going to get killed unless you spend hours dealing with one combat situationfifth items with the original first game you got lots and lots of items
with this game you are in luck if after three or four attacks bringing you down to  hit point you finally strike it and get a recovery pill that brings you back up to original hit points but then again those hit points are taken down again by the end of the next combat roundwhile the story line might be interesting it fails in comparison to the first one and by all means the poorness of this game in the controlling just makes you so fed up that you dont care how this story ends
its a bad bad game that could have been a great sequel if only the company had followed the original games beauty
dont buy this game unless you have lots of headache medicinei cant believe it but i actually hate this gamethe first pe had problems  ayas painfully slow movement some bad camera angles etc
 but was overall a good game
this  this is a travestyfirst the movement system is miserable
characterrelative movement is an abomination painful and results in many many deaths
second ayas parasite powers are pathetic  how did she go from taking on eve and the ultimate being to this
eve would have turned this aya into mincemeat
third why is aya suddenly young and dressing in bizarre fashion
i dunno about you but id wear body armor or at least long pants when confronted with creatures like thatin terms of plot and characterization  there isnt any that i had the patience to see
ayas sole reaction on seeing a human or apparent human mutate boils down to so what
this from a woman who freaked at seeing the rat mutate who has not seen anything else mutate since finishing off the ultimate being  who seemed to think nothing else was going to mutatestupid puzzles uninteresting secondary characters wheres ben
maeda
daniel
wayne
pass on this one
play the original againman this is a poor game i bought it played it for an hour and thought this cant be it but it is theres no voice acting so the atmosphere is cack and the battle system is really bad
a game like this relies on gut feeling and instincts not to be told how much hp was taken off the player should not be told
the cut scenes are good and the camera at the beginning i sold it after that was reasonably good
this game just feels like a subpar resident evil
even the graphics are not upto resie standards the developers didnt use pre renders like capcom so the areas look ok at best
the enemies are reasonably well animated and look solid enough but dont provide the visual oomph that resies deadites do
you shouild be able to see the flesh hanging off them but nope
whats with the rpg elements too
again it detracts from the atmosphere when you recieve bp or whatever from kills and use it to upgrade it just doesnt work and feels tacked on
if they were goimg to do something like this then they could have made it at least a bit more indepth like other rpgs
there are many faults to this game and all add up to a below standard rpgaction type thing
not good at all
if youre wanting survival horro best check out resident evil usually when a descent game comes out youd expect the follow up to be better
this is not one of those games
for what ever reason somebody decided to completely remove the wrestling ring
you start out in a back lot  just brawl
heres the strange thing
to win you pin your opponent on the floor
if its a brawl youd think you just have knock out your opponent
you can move from one area to the next but there is no ring
if i wanted a fighting game i could have bought something elsei also didnt like the selection screen
its divided where you cant see all of the wrestlers in the game
the only good aspect of this game is that the commentary from tony schiavone  bobby the brain heenan is good
thats not enough to make it a great game thoughwcw
it stands for world championship wrestling but maybe it should stand for either we cant wrestle worlds crummiest wrestling wheel chair wrestling or we cant win
either way backstage assault reflects on all of these factorsin electronic arts second wcw attempt this game makes mayhem look like a frickin masterpiece
lets just do a quick rundown the graphics horrible
the gameplay youve seen better
believe me
the sound why wont the announcers shut up
im not gonna even bother rating this on my usual scales
i give it a  this is pure garbage
avoid iti love wrestling sure i love video games sure
but wcw backstage asssault is not wrestling and its hardly a video game
when ea came out with its first wcw game wcw mayhem i picked it up on opening day
and a day passed and my copy was back on the store shelf
i was looking forward to backstage assault hoping ea would correct their mistake
nope
again my copy is back on the store shelf
first off i am a wrestling fan and i love harcore matches
but no ring in the game at all
wrestling is not just fighting backstage it requires a ring to wrestle in
the graphics run as smooth as silk ill give them that
but the sound
bad
the create a wrestler was the same as mayhem with very few tweaks
save your money and buy smackdown  know your role
at least thats gooda horrible game that features all the top stars of the defunct company and no ring whatsoeverouch
this game is justouch
maybe the developers behind this didnt test the game
at all
that might explain the atrocious gameplay we see here today
the music is the only plus and thats only because george williams composed it
yoda must be rolling in his gravewhen i started playing this game the first thing that hit me was the terrific battle scenes that were displayed in the well done opening credits and the very similar feel that the game had to romance of the three kingdoms
unfortunately after game play began all my hopes for the game deteriorated into a freeforall of unrealistic combat between armies that i had little to no control over
i had hopped to be able to have some amount of control over the game but instead i found myself watching volley after volley of animated musket fire and screaming at the computer to let me do something
somehow i managed to beat my way through most of the game despite having no concept of the controlsthis game is not worth any amount of money if you wish to play it find a friend and play his copy renting is simply too much moneyi thought this was going to be like ghengis khan for the original nintendo but on a grander scale it turned out to be more like chess on a grander scale
the graphics are alright the game play is lame and the movies are pretty much the same
its not as advertisedas a long time fan of the nba live series i can honestly say that i purchased the ps almost only to play this game
nba live  was so good with the challenges and the unlocking hall of fame players that i expected this game to blow my mind
unfortunately it only blew a hole in my walletfirst off the gameplay is sluggish and staid
player movement seems barely a step faster than slow motion video
power forwards like elton brand are treated as nd class players not able to score and rebound
the post up moves are a big yawn given the games focus on guardssecondly they eliminated the fantasy draft option whereby all the players are stripped from their team and reordered based on your and the computers picks
this option was made even better in nba live  as when you unlocked the classic players you could thrown them into the draft too
we had wilt and karl malone as our back court for example
in this game none of that is possiblefinally the graphics are subpar
not only are the faces unrecognizable but if you notice all the ears of every player have this white glint in the middle of the ear making the ear look misshapen like the slave race that served the shape shifter dominion rulers in star trek deep space   in addition no one has tattoos
i care little for them myself but given that almost every nba player has one what is the point in not doing it hereto be honest i was so disappointed in this game i considered returning my ps
if you have any desire to get an ea sports game get madden nfl  that is an example of what the ps can do and an example of how ea could have done their nba franchiseone of the most anticiptated sports games for the playstation  turns out to be one of the st bombs for the system
ive been an ea sports nba live fan for over  years now
playing it on all the major systems like playstation pcs genesis super nin etc so im a devoted nba live fan
this game is a complete disgrace to the series
you can tell that they rushed the product to compete with other games that came out the same time like espn nba  night and nba hoopzokay lets go over the pros of the game
yes its got michael jordan in it and yes its got classic legendary teams on it
overall though i dont think that balances out the cons of the game
the biggest disappointment being the response time from when you hit the buttons to the time it actually does the movement
you can press the button to shoot the ball and release it before it even does it on the screen
its that bad
the movements are pretty choppy also its not fluent
you can be driving to the hole and it would be real sluggish
also the percentage ratio of making a basket is extremely low
you can be wide open for a  foot jump shoot and completely miss  shots
you pretty much have to dunk it to score
another big con are the players
yes the body shape fits the actual players but none of the faces look anything like the players at all
i rather take a buffed out reggie miller with a face that matches like in nba k for the dreamcast rather then the actual shape of a skinny reggie miller with the face of a complete stranger
whatsome more cons
well they took out the franchise mode from previous games as well as the  point contest
why i dont know
next year they should bring back the slam dunk contest on the game remember jordan vs
bird
just like they brought back fighting in hockey gamesso overall the game wasnt worth the 
i thought it would match up with the same quality as nba k for the dreamcast like madden  for psx and nflk for dreamcast but it doesnt even come close
im getting tired of companies rushing to put out games
dont they realize that when people are devoted nba live or madden fans or any game would rather wait for a great quality gamei am a big nba live fan and i tell you this is not worth your time
i have playd live since it was on supernintendo and this game is a waste
the graphics are crisp but the moves are slow the play control is in no comparison the other versions of live on the ps
please do not encourage the purchasing of this game
ea sports did a horrible job after madden  they give us this weak titlethis game is absolute garbage
i opened the box and i couldve sworn my dog went in the house
it is definitely not up to par with other nba live games
graphically it looks like they shouldve released it on ps or sega genesis
the players look nothing like the real thing unlike madden for ps
the only highlight of the game is michael jordan and i feel sorry that he had to be in this game
if you want an exceptional basketball game pick up nbak
if you dont have a dreamcast just buy nba live  or lakers vs celtics or even double dribble and you can get the same appeal as this piece of junk
dont buy it dont rent it and if your friend has one beat him up and tell him that you never want to borrow it
i have one for sale if anybody wants it
never been playedi have a dreamcast and a playstation  and except for maybe  or  titles i think the dreamcast is winning in the gaming department
i bought nba live and was very upset with everthing but the graphics
now a days we expect great graphics what we want is game play and in this area nba live  hits the bottom of the fish pond
nbak is far far superior in every aspect
i believe next year the makers of p games will finally use the potential of the system but for today they are not
so  with that said if you want to play basketball go get nbak and leave nba live  on the store shelvesalthough i rather like the game and really enjoy the graphics and music of it i now wish i hadnt purchased it at all
the game is rather buggy
it has a tendency to crash when you attempt to skip dialogue and sometimes key items simply do not work
one of the online faqs i read explained in detail that sometimes an item simply wont work as it is supposed to and in such a case you basically have to start all over
restarting your psxps wont fix the problem
i had that happen  hours into the game with the library keys
what a waste of time
good game lousy quality controloutlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west
the story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan
built on a outdated engine with wonky physics dated graphics and a d design
very dull gameplay with no atmosphere and a box of rocks ai
gameplay is nothing but shoot the baddies find key open door shoot more baddies find another key ect ect
outlaws is very dissapointingthey never made a mac version of collectorsi played the demo of this game and quickly realised that i would not be paying for the full versioni think its a reflection of the game that used versions are currently selling at very low money and it is a real shame when this game could have been a winneryou are a secret agent type assassin given several tasks that involve thinking and sneaking around instead of the usual guns blazing approach and the graphics levels enemies weapons and scenarios are actually very very good
there is one big problem however you cant save your progress as you go
even if you play this game on the easiest levelyou will find it very frustrating
there is a fine line between a game that isnt easy to beat and one thats annoying as anything and this one jumps that line with size  boots
you will find yourself playing for a long time reaching so far in a level and then getting killed off only to go back and start from scratch
i hope the programmers have learned from their mistakes as i see a sequel is now available
if you really like this kind of game try quotsoldier of fortunequot instead its much more rewardingthe basic idea behind the game sounds fun
youre an sas officer sent off on a number of missions to save the world
its a standard fps shooter made a bit more exiting by the d landscape engine which allows the action to take place across large outdoor environmentsthe emphasis is on quotrealworldquot fighting  where taking a couple of shots will kill you and so you spend most of the time creeping around hoping not to be discoveredthere are plenty of gadgets to play with too
the satelite camera allows you to view the action around you from above and zoom in on activity in outdoor areas
when you use the camera the map is shown fullscreen and the action caries on around you in quotrealtimequot
if youre not careful you can get killed while looking at the mapthis quotrealworldquot emphasis can be great try games like swat but the game designers need to finely balance quotrealityquot with quotfunquot
unfortunately this is where project igi shoots itself in the foot as it werei couldnt even get past the first level on quotnormalquot difficulty
im not that bad at games ive completed halflife star trek elite force etc
 but try as i might i couldnt get through the first mission
id get  minutes into the level and get shot by a sniper  theres no save game feature so you have to go back to the start of the level
a boring  minutes spent working through the part of the level id already completed shoot the sniper and then got shot by someone else
guess what 
another  minutes going back over the exact same level againafter id played through the same part of the same level  times i just got bored and went to play something more fun insteadas far as the rest of the game goes other than the outdoor maps there is very little special about the graphics  theyre pretty much quake engine standard sub halflife
all that running around climbing ladders etc
is pretty passe these days how old is tomb raider 
 and there is really nothing new that this game doesi originally bought the game because pcgamer uk gave it a good review
as it stands without a save game feature i wouldnt recommend it to anyone
if eidos get around to patching the game theres no sign of it yet and adding the ability to save your progress within a mission i might start playing it again
as it stands ill stick with swat elite edition quotthe element is behind youquot or counterstrikepro  the satelite camera is quite cool
 outdoor environments make a change from usual fpscon  you cant save your game
 too easy on quoteasyquot
 impossible on any difficulty setting above quoteasyquot partly because there is no save game option
 no multiplayer
 dodgy voice actingyou heard right this game has no savegame
it saves only at the end of each of the  levels
the levels are huge and  shot can kill you or raising the alarm or  other things
they say its for realism truth is that eidos wanted this game out by xmas
unless you like being very frustrated and repeating a level from the start time after time after time buy something else
if you played sof on hard setting all the way through without saving go ahead and get igi otherwise youll have to play this game wits trainer
its a hack that gives you unlimited health but that takes alot of fun out
design is monotonous with only  buildings that just repeat level after level
so overall close but no cigar
this could have been a cool game wa savegame and more levels but its not
try noonelivesforever or something else at least until eidos offers a savegame patch
this game is  sofgreat gameand  cool new ideas like camerasalarmsreal weapons but without varied design amp all ruined by an unforgiveable mistake
save your moneythis is a game only for members of the tomb raider fanatics club
if you remove all the hyperbole and wishful thinking
this game is just another rehash of the older cheaper tomb raider titlessure you have new weapons and some new moves but it all adds up to the same thing a big yawn
the games clipping problems and crazy camera angles made things even worse
people who gave this game a good review must have been in a very magnanimus mood or they must really enjoy ogling lara crofts enormous quotgunsquotits time for eidos to stop milking this cash cow and deliver something different to the gaming publicthis game isnt as good as most of the st person shooters on the ps
for a release on the ps this is a pathetic excuse
youd be better off buying syphon filter  or  or medal of honor for the ps or waiting for new versions of those games to come out on the psis this ps graphics or just taken from the original ps
the graphics are for the most part dated and very weak looking and the game is only semifun if you play the multiplayer death matches
personaly i prefer unreal tournament for ps
if you want to buy this game at least rent it first or if not its your funeralno mercy has got to be the worst wwf game i have ever played
for one thing no mercy does not have special entrances like wrestlemania  does
in no mercy  the titantron does not play when you make your entrance
also in no mercy every tag team comes out seperately and you have to buy everything from the smackdown mall and wheres the fun in that
also the box says up to  backstage areas and there are only six
in conclusion smackdown  is the better buywell the game is good lots of playersbut here are some cons lots of them they walk like girls the weapons dont do anything they dont bleed
after all the beatings if you fall of the top rope or the hell in the cell
they will get  right back up
with out any damagethe season is soooo boaring my cousins fell a sleep when i was playing itevery time when micel cole interviews some one after the interview he will srug like he has no idea of what the hell is going onand i could go onbut lets stopcause i am tierd of telling the truth to the world and saving people from this crap ur wellcomerockstar the developers of this awful game sure have been pumping out the ps games
smugglers run was fun and all but this is just too bad
it fails in every way that a game can
the visuals are subpar psone games look x better than this it controls like a cow and the actual gameplay is repetitive and a chore to play
not worth your timei enjoy playing these old titles sometimes you find a gem you skipped over and sometimes you find a turd
this game is a turdremember the earlier days of gaming when the box cover was usually more exciting than the game itself
well its pretty much the same thing herehands down the most incredibly difficult game you will probably ever have the opportune chance of playing
nearly impossible to beat thanks to the games mechanics
youll at times feel like your trying to take down a tank with a sling shot with the powerless weapon selection they provide youthe controls arent that great but they arent that bad
this is the first time i had to use a cheat code to survive in a game since duke nukem and i mean the original side scroller version
this game is inhumanely difficult
youll have  guys attacking you at once
while one is shooting with  marksman ship just draining your life away the others will be kicking and punching you and knocking you down
so your getting both beat and shot to death
sounds like it would be rare but it isnt
this happens  of the time when you have one armed and one unarmed opponent mix
each armed gooned you come across is almost like a mini boss
your guns will barely phase them while theyre guns hit every mark and will kill you even if you jump and run around or try to see coververy poor game mechanics and pretty inconsistent game play
the music is mundane and the artwork switches from fantastic to what is this supposed to be
might not matter but in an anime game whats the reason for having several different artist with multiple renderings of the same character that look different in each one
sounds like im being harsh but i just expected the in game art to look as good as the front cover and the opening scene
instead it goes from madhouse to crayola crayonthe previews looked so cool
get this you need a tutorial to walk
yes walking is a pain
whenever you go sideways you actually strafe sideways it is really inconvienient
the controls are terrible
you will see what i mean when you get to the first part of the training
you have to run around a room in an extremely short time
i had to do it like  times
basically to beat it i walked straight strafed left then went backwards and narrowly got it
then the combos they are so difficult to pull off
i honestly feel that the creators were trying to make it as hard as possible to lash out against the society or somethingthe backgrounds are terrible
i rented this game for one day and was fed up with it after  minutes of the first level
you honestly are going to see alot of boxes in some of the most uninspired and retarted rooms ever
one room was a square
o thats right they are all squares with  or  boxes of course
cant forget those boxesthe guns are the worst actually
when you shoot  bullets with a gun mabye  your girl looks at the roof
she cannot hold a gun straight
the target practice is basically  targets going directly upward
i mean seriously this chick is an operative and the recoil on her gun actually has her looking towards the roof in  shots or less
o but wait lets say she walks while she shoots now magically her gun has no recoil and she is fine
so whenever you want to shoot anything and actually hit it with  shots or more you have to move around
want to know something else
the guns are stupidthe combos are hard to pull off and worthless
i could care less about snapping that guy i only have  arms
jeez its like memorizing the dictionary then repeating it word for word with the same exact tone and depth that you memorized it withthe game is terrible
spend no money on it
rockstar must of been payed to stop making this game because i never see it anywhere and that is a good thingthis is the worst ps game i have ever played
boring repetitive backgrounds uninteresting weapons and characters awkward control scheme all on one disk
i bought this game used a while ago for  and i still feel ripped offdid i mention the graphics
this game was released close to the time of the ps launch and it shows
there are also some serious clipping issuessimply put oni isnt worth your timei love the first power stone
its the best dreamcast game in my opinion
and im also a big fan of the anime based on it
i never got to play power stone  until i got power stone collection for the psp and i was really looking forward to it but it didnt meet my expectations at all
true it did have some good ideas but they were all so poorly executed
and dont tell me oh
but this one has a  player mode
who cares
that doesnt make it good
plus this  player mode is nothing but a huge disjointed mess
and then theres the new characters
these new characters are so boring and stupid
i dont even know where to start
another thing is the announcer
he is so annoying
he says irritating things like this doesnt look good
you better be careful
no really
you think so moron
why dont you be a little bit more useful
but in conclusion to sum it all up in a nutshellthe first game was a revolutionary and original concept for the fighting game genre and it was alot of fun to play
the sequel was nothing but a cashin attempt that relied on style over substance and quantity over quality and its worth about  used
glad i dont have to buy this abomination twice since i despise it so much
theres several other things id rather spend  on
and not just video games either
the original game is worth playing without question but this sequel is nothing but a waste of time
it belongs in the same group of sequels as ones like megaman x marvel vs capcom  contra force double dragon iiithe sacred stones final fight streetwise duke nukem forever and any other sequel like those i just listed
oh and by the way none of the characters in power stone  have any endings either
they just escape from the castle and you get a credit sequence
booooriiiiiiiiiingif you like resident evil or first person shooters this is not the game for you
this one fails horribly on both fronts
there is no look around feature essential to any fps so you can be standing right in front of something and not be able to see it because you cant look down
not to mention the fact that the plot is weak and has nothing to do with the continuity of the other games
steer clear of this one at all costswhat a dissapointment
for the resident evil series this game really sucks big time
the story is lame the controls are different from past resident evil games
first person shooters should have never happened with a resident evil game
these titles were meant like the first  re games this game sucks like re dead aim
if you want a great re game get the firt  plus code veronica x and re  now these are re games
not this lame re survivorok let me tell you this
rent dont even dare buy
the only thing that kicks on this game is first person view mode
but this game is not even fun
you work for umbrella in some crazy city a little after resident evil  and you fall from a helicopter and get amnesia not knowing you are the most feared person in the world
you screw around killing zombies but you never ever ever get to have any fun at all
whats with capcom now
why are they so lazy now when it comes that they make even greater games than konami does
now one game i reccomend is resident evil code veronica its very funresident evil survivor the black sheep of the resident evil family
compared to the rest of the resident evils yes this game is bad
however it is not unplayable
the lack of any and all save points means that youre going to have to go thru the entire game in one sittingand that can be quite a challenge
however considering how easy the game is its not because of difficulty
this game just is bad
now if you have a bunch of friends over who love resident evil like you do and you just want to be able to say you beat them all this game does have some redeeming value
its great for a laugh with a group of friends at just how bad it is
this game is more of a collectors item for those who want to have the entire resident evil series and who want to beat them all rather than for those who want a fun and enjoyable game to play
stay away unless youre resident evil thru and thru
nnycw for capcityall i have to say is that this game is horrible
i found little in it i liked and i loved all the others in the re seriesi found the gameplay to be almost quotprerequotthis rates up there with my sega gt review for worst game ever
worst graphics i have ever seen for a playstation game and the system is in its th year now
all i want to ask capcom is why release this trash to the public
im the biggest resident evil saga fan ever
i bought this game with high hopes and was let down by the biggest video game company in the business
i played it for about an hour couldnt take it anymore and threw the game out of the window
capcom why i ask whyi love the resident evil series
but this game ow my its the worst game i have ever ever played
i was thinking to burn the cd but the fire could be really disappointed burning one bad cd
i know you wont find this helpful but on my opinion dont loose moneythis game is quite possibly the stupidest game i have ever played
from the first and only time i played it it got on my nerves
the voice acting is terrible and really annoying
in the very beginning on the boat you walk into a room and the girl whines ohh noooo my jeans are ruined
that did it for me i just snapped the game off right there
the graphics are bad for the ps and the way the characters move is all jerky and repetative
they wave their arms when they talk and then kinda forget to stop waving them after they finally shut up
the combat system not very good you just stand in one place and idly blast enemies with badlyanimated spells
if you see this one on the shelf dont even give it a second glance just move on and get something else
anything can be better than thisif you buy this game you are buying a drink coaster  it is horrible  the comabat system is horrible  the characters are horrible  the graphics are glitchy and the controls leave much to be desired  this is a launch game  which means it is one of the oldest games out  do not buy  buy dark alliance insteadorphen was another prime example of a rushed game that wanted to be a launch title
it contains a little bit of bad voice acting at the beginning then from there they gave up and no one moves their mouth
as for gameplay its very limited pretty boring and overall lacking
 i dont even know why they call it orphen
you just live out someone elses adventure as you join their party
the story is one of the worst ever made
 my point is the story is bad and everything else about this game is bad its the  game that ever  
use the disk as it was obviously intended to be used as
a frizbeethis is by far the worst role playing game ive ever played
the battle systum stinks
you have  buttons wich you equip weapons to every button executes that weapon but you cant move and the voice programing gets anoying
and the voice acting is very poorly acted
there is not one message you read in this game
it is all the charecters voices so those of you who have no volume are scrwedand the story line ha
the worst
it seems like a  year old worte it who knew cool words like damn and hell it is very sad
it is so corney you will die laughing
actually thats the best thing about it
and the game play hours stink
and so does the ending
the graphics are good but thats it
it is above all boring
oh
there are some cartoon clips that arnt so badand you have absolutely no options on where to go or secret places
you just go straight through the story line on what youre supposed to dodo your self a big favor
dont buy this game here is my overall raitings starsgame play hoursbattle systumreplay valuestorylinegraphicsmusicsound effectsvoice programingmappingneeed i say moreall this game has going for it is the graphics and the name
too bad it has absolutly nothing to do with the movie
this game is garbageget ace combat dont be hooked by the fact that you can play as megaman or the other capcon fighters
the weapons of all the players are basicly the same
you shoot a bullent with your right hand and you shoot a special large blast with your left hand
thats all you can do
megaman does not have a large inventory of weapons like he does in his other gamesthe arenas are very small and there are only about  stages
and there is absolutely no skill involved
based on how you select the difficulty level the game will be either too easy or impossible to beatthe only reason why people are giving this game a good rating is because they or their friends are trying to sell overpriced used copiesokay heres the gist of things
eq finally got to a point where it was almost bug freethen out comes rok
they still run patch after patch trying to fix little problems and graphics glitchesand then they come out with yet another expansion
dont we get the picture yet
its not about quality of gameplay peopleits about the bottom line
i could go into a  page dissertation on why i despise verant and their company and why the majority of people who are looking for a good gameplaying experience will walk away shaking their heads sadlyat the potential wasted but i digress
fix the car before doing a brand new paint job
otherwise you have something that looks real greatbut goes nowherei expected this game to really rule
i thought to myself quottens of thousands of players rpging together
it will be chaos
people will be banding into nations and battling each other for dominion
imagine my disappointment when i found that pking is not only disallowedor restricted in most servers most players i talked to professed disgust at player killers
worse guards are now near invulnerable
what
cant a guy have a little fun and slip a inch dagger between a guards plates and into his back
its only an ai
i pray for the day that someone with a sense of fun dreary drugdgery which is what this game is starting to feel like after four months takes over this company and point this world into the right directionwith all the great reviews i thought i would give it a try
yeah its dated but i expected that
some dated games are funi just didnt think this was one of them
i played it for about  hours on normal which was enough time to learn the controls and understand the game play
the map is difficult to readunderstand
the psychic abilities are okay but switching to them takes a little timeenough time for the zombies or monkeys to kill you
i found the interface a bit clunky
i just couldnt get excited about this game or the storynarration
i thought it was tedious not funi was able to get this working on windows xp home sp but it took a little effortif you need help go to youtube and search for this video hhgcxftubche does a good job of explaining how to do ithere it is in a nutshellinstall the gamefind download and install systemshockpatchexein the installation folder rename sshockexe to sshockoldfind and download systemshockxpfixzipcopy the exe from the above zip file to the installation folderin the installation folderopen shockcfg with notepadat the end of that file on a separate line add this safetexturemanagersave and exit the filewindows xp bootini changes be careful

you are approached by the devil with a task witness the stories of seven individuals and decide whether their souls will go to heaven or hell
it seemed like a fascinating premise and i was eager to see how it would be handled in a computer gameill admit its my own fault for not making sure the game would run properly under windows xp
it doesnt
it will run but it isnt at all pleasant
the animated sequences get stuck frequently and the audio is choppy
its a good thing subtitles are available for the dialogue although most of it is nonsensical metaphysical gibberish anyway
as of this writing there is no patch to make the game xpcompatiblebut operating issues are only part of the problem
the puzzles if they can be called that are so obtuse youd have to be some kind of savant to be able to complete them unaided
there is absolutely no logic to them at all
at a later point in the game youre rewarded with a demonic assistant but the clues it offers are invariably for activities youve already completed
apparently the clues are based on your physical location not how far youve actually progressed in the game
except for a couple manual tasks you need it to perform it is uselessthe graphics are fairly nice but interacting with things is also problematic
hot spots are frustratingly obscure and you can move over them a half dozen times before they register
occasionally they are misplaced entirely
there is one room you cant exit until you make a quarter turn away from the door and click on a blank wall
and i am currently at a standstill in my game because a drawer i need to open will not open
i have gone over every inch of that room to no avail
what good is a game that you cannot finish even with a walkthroughseven games of the soul or faust as it is referred to in the game itself is a huge disappointment
it could have been interesting but it getting through any portion of the game was torturewhere to begin with this boring game
as a hardcore final fantasy fan i find it hard to start on how disappointing this game isfirst of all the characters
theyre lame
the main character is this stupid monkey boy whos part of a theater troupe
thats not very badass
after making the super cool ex soldier cloud and seed in training squall what was squaresoft thinking
did they not look back at the past final fantasies and get that the protagonist is supposed to be a badass
losers hanging with this failure of a protagonist include a little kid with no face who came up with that design
 an annoying guy in armor who always jumps up and down a girl with purple hair lol is this an supposed to be an anime
 and another girl thats named after a weapon she doesnt even use awesome
none of these characters are as awesome as barret or as hot as tifa and they all look like they came out of a cartoon another failure on squaresofts partnext the story
its stupid
the only thing i can recall from my boredom is that it involves stealing a princess during a play performance wtf
and preventing an airship from blowing up or something like that
the main villain is some fat blue lady
what the hell is that about
while playing this i just sat there wishing sephiroth would jump into the scene and stab her
i stopped playing after the first disc where in the end some white haired chick looks down at the dead characters and flies off on a dragon was that supposed to be a female sephiroth or what
who cares the world was boring
it was all castles and medieval crap like that
hello
final fantasies are supposed to take place in futuristic worlds with technology and gunslastly the battle system
what a pile of crap
only the stupid kid can cast black magic the girl is the only one who can heal and the other guys are the only ones who can use real weapons
what kinda system is that
its like theyre each supposed to have a designated role
youre supposed to have em learn spells though materia
oh wait only real final fantasies are allowed to have materia my bad
also why do you control four party members
first of all that makes this game even more confusing and stupid and second of all real final fantasies have only three party membersin conclusion this game fails to please any final fantasy fan due to to squaresofts failure to take a look at the franchises  roots
if square had looked back and reflected on what made final fantasy such a great series to begin with they would have known this game would be a disappointment to any longtime final fantasy fan such as myselfeverybody is always saying how ff  is great because it gets back to the roots of final fantasy
but this game is nothing like ff  at all
it doesnt come anywhere close to ff   its got wacky graphics and a boring kiddy storyline and the combat system in  is just way too simplistic
ff  is just another stinker from square which is what all us superfans have come to expect
if they dont get it right next time i will swear off square games forever
that includes ff  so that would effectively be like commiting suicide because without ff  im sure i would enter a permanent vegetative state
get it right square or i will never be able to forgive youbeautiful game
its just that this game gives you the worst directions ever for you to follow and then expect you to find it while throwing a random battle at you every  seconds that you walk
annoying as hella lot of ff fans are immediately going to say my review is poor simply because im disagreeing with them
please know that this is not the case ive spent many years of my life playing analyzing and reviewing the installments of the final fantasy series and with ff i am most dissatisfiedits very difficult to find where to begin in expressing exactly why this is the worst installment of the final fantasy series ever
for starters im going to warn the consumer that if youve played other ff games in general the good ones  doesnt count
 and compare them to ff then you are most assuredly not going to like this gamethe first thing wrong with this game is the mere theme of it
ff has a character and plot theme that is so frustratingly childish and kiddyfriendly that one could mistake this for a gamecube game
in all honesty thats an understatement
the music only contributed to this flaw the music track could go into a disney movie most assuredly without notice
last time that i checked disney does not belong in ff despite what uematsu composer for ff thinks
i should also point out at the beginning of my review that i guaruntee that this is the shortest game in the series
the first cd to this game will still be spinning in the cd case from the leftover momentum of its rotation in the ps when you complete final fantasy  it is too shortim not ignorant enough to be driven away just by theme
the battle system and process of character growth is easily the most uncreative and funlacking system in the series
you learn your abilities from weaponry and items which means that before you can upgrade to the next level of weaponry you must finish the painfully slow process of acquiring all the abilities on that particular item
challenging i do admit but not the least bit funff promised its oldschool fans that it would once again display the oldthemed characters like black and white mages thieves etc
dont be fooled this is hardly true
what you get in this package is two pc mages of both classes a brief encounter with a red mage and some old names
oh yeah and the main character is a thief but his abilities have nothing to do with being an oldschool ff thief
thats about it for this gamemark my words the chocobo sidequest is not fun
it consists of your running around in a single location for several hours gathering treasure and collecting points
you can buy special stuff with the points but youre going to have to spend an awful long time in there to get anything useful
another illusion set by squaresoft to make you believe its fun
i think somost importantly the plot was the killing stroke for a game that had no potential in the first place
the plot twist to this game is a leftfielded ridiculous and random event with no foreshadowing whatsoever
worst of all it didnt even bother me storywise mostly because there was no reason for me to like any of these characters
i mean i was more emotional about my black mages in ff tactics and they didnt even say anythingif youre looking for oldschool on that note i strongly suggest fft
not as good a plot as ff but definitely much more solid gameplay
if youre looking for an ff game that is not bad do not buy ff by all means
it is not worth your time
in fact i think ff is an apology for this horrendous waste of cds
the playable demo on jampack is superbjust about everything they could do wrongthey did wrong
the interface is absolutely awful
the characters move in this pokey slow manner that make you want to scream
getting at spells goes through a multi level menu
the combat is almost exactly like the old turn based pool of radiance from five or six years ago
i take a shot then you take a shot then he does etc
utterly lame
the adventure is completely linear
it gives you no choices and leads you by the nose
often you dont even have a choice of right or left since the dungeons tend to lead you in a line as well
when you level up the machine decides how to allocate your feats and skill points for you
please please please save your money
buying this would only encourage them to put out more garbageim thinking alright pool of radiance is finally out
so i pay my  and drive home to install it
i chose drive d not c but its still on my c dirve
oh well lets playim still waiting to play
you cant escape combat
thats a big minus considering the monsters in the first dungeon are way more powerful than your whole partywhy cant i choose what skills and feats for the characters i generate which are still the only characters in my party
the customising of characters is nil
i so much prefer baldurs gate  and  even though i only get to create just one character
but those games are way more fun than this gamewhats with the movements
my newborn baby moves faster than these guys can walk
excuse me sir do you carry any magic items
no
you dont really carry anything
ill just take my gold and leavebasically a big quotthis game really stinks dont waste your money buy hooked on phonics cause its probably way more fun than this rpg is that what this ispor has to be the most disappointing crpg release ever
i played the original gold box games when they were released and this does not live up to the legacy
there are numerous crash bugs a tendency for the save files to become corrupted and unusuable wave goodbye to hours of play a horrible user interface and the most unbelievably awful gameplay system ive ever had to slog through
i imagine that ssi before starting development on por had two folders available one for the best features of the gold box games one for the worstthe devs picked up the wrong folder before startingthe combat is terrible
it amounts to waiting slowly even with gamespeed set to max for monsters to make their way towards your party and then just as slowly attacking them
and ssi brought in the part turn method which was definitely not one of the endearing features of the gold box games
it makes for redundant effort and a great deal of wasted time
on the other hand i am getting a good deal of reading done while waitingpeople have complained that comparing por to the baldurs gateicewind daleplanescapetorment run is unfair
i agree
its horrendously unfair to take a betacode quotgamequot which shows little to no knowledge of to say nothing of love for the dampd license and compare it to the magnificent efforts of black isle studios products
its like setting a flea against godzillapor is the favoured acronym for this disastrous undertaking
advance the last letter forward one letter in the alphabet and youll have a better idea of what this game truly isim really sorry if any of the developers of romd are reading this but this game is a dog
do not buy it
go buy one of the baldurs gate games instead or wait for neverwinter nights
i was so disappointed by this game because it could have been so much better
as the first dampd rd edition game out there it had the opportunity to define the standard by which others would be judged
instead it failed to qualify as even remotely fun especially in comparison to the baldurs gate gamesplenty of other reviews talk about the numerous inexcusable bugs like the installuninstall problems or the painful game play why exactly cant i send party members more than one screen away from the leader
 so i wont get into it here
what i would like to know isa how could the people who slaved on this game night and day for god knows how long not realize that the game was fatally unfunb how could these bugs have slipped past qaso much potential
so disappointinglet this be a lesson to all game companies take your time and develop the game fully
rushing it out the door to take advantage of the hype results in a bug ridden game that ends up in the budget bin faster than the speed of light
do not buy this unless you are prepared to be frustrated and send it backi pop in the disc and select install
the game refuses to let me do a full installation because it says i dont have  gig of space free on dwhen i clearly have  gigs free
so i have to do minimal install
i then finish installing it and go to play the game only to learn that it didnt install on d drive
apparently i need to download a patch just to install the game to d
wow the creators sure messed up on something so fundamental
they must not have even tested the game because apparently you cant install the game in any specified folder unless you download patch then i go to play the game only to see my characters walking at  miles an hour
i start it up with a paladin barbarian and rogue tearing the place up while my mage sits down and rests
i then realize that my characters dont have their long swords equipped
this is odd because i just equipped those long swords
i look at my inventory only to learn that there is no long sword animation
i have the sword equipped but i cant see it because i guess the creators left that out or the minimal installationwhich i was forced to use must not have it
this pisses me off greatly
i then look around for quicksave
where is quicksave
i have no clue
you cant customize your controls or something
i then give up on the game to play icewind dale
the games have the exact same stories and pool of radiance has so many problems that i dont ever plan to play it again
besides if you do find a sword that does  damage in the first dungeon you know theres a problemthis game is the biggest disappointment ive ever seen and being an avid fan of the gold box series it doubly hurtsbeware at your own risk if you buy this one
and dont even try if you are running xp
according to ubi soft these are business operating systems and we should not expect to run their games on a business operating systembut i was asking them about xp home
last i checked that wasnt considered by microoft to be a business operating systemits this arrogance and negligence by ubi soft that will convince me never to buy another game from them againanybody want an opened unused version of porhave i place such high expectations for a rpg only to receive a game thats barely playable i got it the first day out but there are now known technical issues with the release of this game
after  hours of playing my saved games were utterly corrupted and the game crashed consistantly back to the desktop
i have to manually delete some files just to be able to play
other technical issues have been raised in various forums that i will not address since i will assume that a workable patch will be available by the time this review is posted instead i will mention the gameplay itselfgraphically the game looks nice but it only has one resolution of x so you see a limited view of your partys immediate area
the pathing ai during combat is horrendous often taking a longer route than necessary this sometimes leads to your character running by an enemy giving them an attack of opportunity against you this can also negate your ability to attack  depending on how far you need to move to an enemy you may or may not be able to attack taking a longer route even though it initially shows an attack icon means a wasted move
its also hard to position your character to score flanking attacks
the combat manual is almost too cumbersome though hotkeying commands helpi like the pointbuy system of generating your characters ability score which is sanctioned by adampd rules and a very fair way of managing your needs
but your character starting equiptment sometimes doesnt make sense
your characters generally have a range weapon a bow or sling but no ammuno arrows are really hard to find and was not sold by the first trader you meet i havent come across another tradershopkeeper so far yet most of the orcs you meet will launch arrows at your partythis game follows e rules but predetermines each characters feats skills and abilities without input from the player
the characters does not appear balanced the ranger for instance does not have the ability to use dual weapons no one can making the class much weaker than other fighter classes the favoredenemy is preselected at least on level onegetting to level  is fairly straight forward but getting from level  is tedious  it feels like most of the enemies encountered rarely provide much experience points
sometimes the enemies seemed harder to fight because your characters are so weak  at level  your will face shadows and wraiths and only one or two of your party will have magical weapons at that point once you are in combat mode there is no way to retreatsince you have to keep your party together you also cant send one character to do advance scouting this oversight will be a huge disappoint especially if you play the multiplayer modeoverall this feels like an unfinished game thats more of a dungeon crawler with lower resolution and much less loot than a true rpg  the plot line so far is fairly trite
i am just severely disappointed that this game is linked to the excellent gold box series  maybe its unfair to make the comparison but if you carry the name pool of radiance youve got to deliverpool of radiance shows every sign of being rushed to market despite obvious problems in the user interface and serious bugs
its only redeeming feature is a turnbased combat system that is deeply flawed and the ability to save at any time which is very importantlets start with the boring and repetitive dungeons which look like they were expressly designed to antagonize the players
long detours are required to travel between nearby locations
the automap is almost useless as it consistently shows openings where none exist frequently characters fail to take anything close to the obvious direct route to their targets and consequently arrive there too late to take any further action
often a character would walk through a cloud of death rather than take a shorter clear route
however the bad guys were just as stupid so i guess it evens upthe targeting algorithm is equally bad
all the characters are animated wings flapping etc and even when the cursor is stationary they will move in and out of the target zone of an arrow or spell depending on which frame of the animation is being shown
not only does this cause a problem when trying to target the character but it causes problems when trying to target nearby characters too
the angle of view also prevents you from targeting characters when there is a larger character in front from the viewers point of view not the characters point of viewthe noncombat part of the targeting algorithm is also flawed
quite frequently it was impossible to persuade the group to move to the desired location because of the angle of view which cannot be changed
there are also artificial restrictions on how far characters can look and travel both in and out of combatyou can arrange your party to travel in a particular formation
this feature doesnt work
i had my fighters up front thieves and clerics next and my magicuser at the back
so why is it my magic user always seemed to walk into a room first
i couldnt get my fighters into combat until the bad guys had killed the magicuser because the silly sod was blocking the door
i wish there was a way for my fighters to kill the magicuser firsti lost several turns in each fight because the computer has a habit of ending your turns prematurelyits also unstable
during about  hours of play the system crashed or hung about a dozen times
it also pauses for up to five seconds at a time with annoying regularity
i would expect this from a fps game but not an isometric view
diablo never hung onceall in all this loses to diablo in every way except the turn based combat in theory anyway and the ability to save at any time which i really liketwo thumbs downwhen i first heard they were continuing the pool of radiance series i was very excited as there were some of the best dampd adaptations ever brought to the pc
they were intriguing adventures that finally implemented what seemed like the complete rulesonce i finally got it installed forced to install to c regardless of directory chosen i was sorely disappointedthis game is a sad hack and slash adventure in slow motion
the other reviewer hit it on the head with diablo done slowly
you crawl through the dungeon fighting groups of orcs after groups or orcs or skeletons or zombies or whatever resting after every fight and talking to almost no npcs
additionally in order to compensate for dampds purposely slow leveling they had you magic items like theyre throwing out pocket change
i have low level characters with some stats  supposedly godlike because of the equipment they are wearingthe game seems pointless and less than thrilling
at least it wont flare up your carpal tunnel as much as clicker games like diablo but its the same type of game
the random adherance to the adampd rules is frustrating and this game does not deserve to be called dampd  fortunately they put  seperate intro videos into the load procedure so ill constantly be reminded of who released this garbage and avoid their games in the future
i may continue playing after the patch comes out and the sound actually works
until then im afraid to uninstall after reading the horror stories of people losing their os during an uninstallavoid this gameas i continue to play pool of radiance my opinion of it has grown steadily worse
this is the third review im writing on it and for the first time im wishing there was a  stars rating
as has been thoroughly pointed out this thing is the ultimate bore
you will find raking leaves in your backyard more fun than playing it i guarantee thatwhats more since i bought the game ive started playing pen and paper dampd and i can assure you that this game does not follow the rd edition rules to any reasonable accuracy
the designers cut more than corners on this production to the point that its more like a demo version of dampdill just list off a few things im sure ill think of more laterweapons are restricted by class
they arent supposed to be anyone should be able to use anything but sometimes at a penaltythe wizard druid and bard classes are not included probably the most glaring omissionyou are supposed to be able to choose skills and a good three fourths of them arent even implementedspellcraft is actually supposed to be useful because you can cast counterspells
you cant do that in pool of radiancea wizard is supposed to be able to cast on the defensive to avoid an attack of opportunity
no such thing hereenemies are only supposed to be able to make one attack of opportunity per round
in the game its unlimitedyou arent supposed to be able to critical hit or sneak attack an undead creaturethis should be obvious pool of radiance is missing about  of the standard spell library
included among the noshows are such incredibly useful spells as mirror image stoneskin any summoning spell any shapeshifting spell and even most of the cantrips and orisonsclerics arent supposed to cast spells like a sorcerer save for either cure or cause wounds spellsclerics dont get domain spellsspellcasting is limited to sorcerer spells fixed per level no empowering extending quickening etc
no casting lower level spells from higher level slotsthe game is completely missing any and all combat modes save a normal attack and spellcasting no tripping grappling disarming etcyou are supposed to be able to pick feats and there are supposed to be many many morepower attack is supposed to let you pick a number from your base and add it to damage
it only lets you pick max or plus half herechanging armor is supposed to take a long time
its a free action in the gamedrawing a weapon is supposed to be a move equivalent actioninvisibility is supposed to force an enemy to guess where you are
the enemies dont guess they knowfor some reason probably a bug sorcerers dont suffer movement penalties for encumbranceyou cant have a familiaryoure supposed to be able to maintain a shocking grasp spell indefinitely after casting itcloudkill is supposed to do more than make enemies grunt another bug
they took the easy way out theres no resistance other than spell resistancespell components arent implemented i dont mind this much but some people doobviously there are no skill checks other than finding and disarming trapsand after all this i have also decided the graphics arent even that good
i had thought them the only strong point of the game earlier and now that ive been further into it i can assure you they are not
theres simply nothing new as you go on everything is the same tile of wall same table same barrel et
al
give me a break ubi
i know you can do better than thatpros cute graphics bargain bin at compusacons confusing layout
no instruction manualinfuriatingdifficult to understand timeconsuming interface impossible to deal with limited control yadda yadda yaddathe bottom line avoid it
the jewel case will make a great coaster for the soda im sipping while playing a real game
if your goal is to drive someone insane literally then this is the perfect gift
otherwise dont waste your moneysummarythe prosthe idea of it all
they potentially had something so good in this gamethe scenarios
easy medium or hard as well as most income or most popular or first one to make a million dollars
i liked the option of not really having any goal and just playing so that i wouldnt blink and be obliteratedyou can check on how different target groups are responding to your restaurant your food etc
click on the target group and a little polaroid photo sort of thing pops up and theyre either smiling or making a prevomiting facethe make your own pizza part
oh man this was fun
you sort through all your ingredients and apply liberally
you have the traditional meats and cheeses and veggies
you also have all sorts of seafood and insect life
ew right
well you open franchises in different countries and hey tastes vary
what else is fun when youre making your pizza is they have a chopper
you can click your ingredient over the chopper and itll dice it smaller and smaller and its graphically correct and adorable
cheese starts as a block chopper chopper and then its a thinner slice chopper chopper and then its small chunks and then shreds and then sprinkles
how cute
tomatoes go from whole to halves to quarters to slices to paste
funthe consim ashamed to say that i couldnt figure out how to play this game for the life of me
being impatient i just jumped on in and thought i was going to kick some butt
after about  minutes i was still staring at the screen clicking on various thingsaaaaalright ill take the tutorial
it turned the light bulb on in my head in terms of staffing decoration and purchasing supplies
frustrating thoughi clicked on everything on the screen before id click on what it wanted me to
the graphics are loud and confusing
what does a big face mean
staff
syndicate
exitoddly enough when i started my next game i couldnt find any of the buttons that were there in the tutoriali couldnt find the staffing my information history and couldnt even figure out how to open my darn restaurantinfuriating
i checked out my restaurantit had some people and staff in itbut when i clicked around it sent me to some other restaurant
i sure the heck didnt open that one or decorate it whered it come from
arghyou have the option of having things done automatically for you in various areas select them when you begin your scenario if youd like but doesnt that defeat the whole purpose of building your own pizza empireyou can find one for a good  dollars at any local store
completely avoid this  dollar ripoffbecause of what i consider to be a significant flaw this is a somewhat superficial review of armored core
armored core  has great graphics and even nicely designed missions although it often requires you to repeat completly unnecessary dialogs and setup sequences even for repeat attempts that only serve to waste time
aside from that though it has what to me is a major and disqualifying flaw
the ps has really great analog controls
armored core  doesnt use them
they say they use analog control but they only use the  analog sticks as single push buttons
how can you build a cutting edge mech fighter and not bother to incorporate one of the most significant features of the ps
this would be bad enough on its own but the manual controls are extremely slow and ponderous
if something is shooting at you from behind you can pretty well count on the fact that by the time you can get these hulking beasts turned around you are going to be toast or at least severely damaged
they also accelerate and decelerate with equal lack of alacrity
i might add that the ai mechs that are attacking you actually appear to have higher performance than you can acheive in your own mech
it is a terrible shame that an otherwise really great game is so severely flawed by such inadequate control
the design it yourself mech feature is really excellent and if it werent for the truly hobbling nature of the controls this really would be a  star game
you will find my copy for sale online real soon now do not buy this game
dont rent this game either
in fact dont even borrow it from a friend thinking hey im not paying any money and i have a few hours to kill so what could i lose
this is easily one of the worst rpgs i have ever had the misfortune to play
ever
the plot is contrived at best due in part to an absolutely atrocious translation which cant settle on how to spell the names of important placespeople
the psuedonewage music seems to be interesting for the first five minutes but the utter lack of variety in the soundtrack had me wanting to claw at my eardrums so i wouldnt have to suffer through it any morethe battle system is very broken you could be standing right in front of a monster and still not hit it no matter how much you swing at the fool thing
the upgrade system you use for your equipment is also fundamentally broken
you need to repair your weapons and armor every few monsters you kill more often if you use the special abilities certain items grant you
and this is very expensive
i was so frustrated because it seemed like by the time id killed enough monsters to recoup the cost of the last repairs it was time to repair againthe only redeeming feature of this game is the graphics
even though theyre a little crude by todays standards theyre still nice to look at in some cases
also the character model will change depending on your equipment so your character could be running around with a pumpkin on her head or a metal pot on his headoverall its not worth it though
i never once thought that id get a headache just thinking about playing a game but thats really how bad i found this game to bei dont expect a game to blow me away with story actors or any other things that goes into a movie
because its a game
its just for fun
with that in mind i try not to rate games too harshly and also because there is usually some reddemming quality that i come away with that is good
but not this one
the game just starts
no intro nothing to show what is going on or why
just straught into a blood omen clone that  there isnt any story in the whole game
just move from place to place and kill things
there is no real reason for it
there really isnt anything good in this game
it is years dated and uses nothing of the ps power
metro d just put this sorry excuse for a game together and then hoped we the gaming community would waste our money on it
there may not be alot of rpg games on the ps but they are coming
save your cash for the good onesim not going to give you many of my opinions on this game because theres no point
theres no shortage of opinion as far as how this game is
if you want to see how absolutely outstanding this game is simply look at all the reviews below singing praises about this wondrous game
lets just say if you like repetition ie
dark cloud times  youll love this gamei thought this game said it had something to do with vampires
i been fascinated with vampire lore for a long time and love some of the games that follow the old stories
i guess i was looking for more of a blood omen legacy of kain or soul reaver slant but guess what no dice
this game wasnt by any means hard or challenging
total waste of what i paid for it in my opinion
the sound tracks were well done but the storyline left a lot to be desired
i am a pretty avid gamer and have a good knowledge of a game that deserves to be played or not and this one is almost no worth renting
there are far better things to do with your time no matter how pitiful your life is trust me
skip it move on and get over it before it consumes you completelyyou are always told this as a child
well its normally ment that a good book will have a bad cover
well a bad game can have a good cover
this is one of the first games i got when i got my playstation a few months ago
this and gtwell i played it alittle bit and burned myself out on it pretty quick
how many times can i go to a dungeon for the same item
gets pretty boring fastthis was a big stink bombi would rather play the original pong or space invadersa great big stinko goes out from me to metro d
wont be buying anything from these guysat first when i decided to play this game i thought that it would be like diablo but was i ever ever wrong
there was no storyline at all the birds eye view was horrible i kept straining my eyes to see the characters everything was so dark except for that strange light that seems to illuminating from anna which i dont understand where it came from and the music was awful
there would be loud pounding music one minute and all of the sudden its silent for a long timestrange the action was barely there just run up to the monster and hack
it wasnt even fun after the first mins
the graphics isnt even worthy of psone maybe supernintendo
dark angel is neither an rpg game or is it an adventure game i dont know what it isexcept that it is boring
i wish i could give it zero starsno story character graphics controls suck
all i can say is that im glad i found this at eb games for only 
if i read all the negative reviews on here first before i bought it i still would not have spent 
thats pretty bad when a game isnt worth that and this is one
i played it for about  minutes and ill never play it again
dont waste your time on this onethis game is very horrible
i rarely give out one stars but this game so greatly deserves itgraphics
pretty bad but not so horrible that you cant bear to look at it
back grounds are actually done quite nicelysound there are some great scary growls and moans but there is no voice acting and the main character doesnt even talkreplay
if you had the guts to play this game twice it would be just as boring as the first time dcharacters what characters
theres the main character and we know nothing about herstory
its hardly fair  making a rating of the story because there simply is nonecontrol
ok ok  ill admit there is a good side to this horrible game its extremely easy controlscinemas
huh
what cinemas
theres no story so why would there be movies
why would there be anything good about this gameoverall fun 
this game is a crime against god
i recommend this game only if you enjoy games that are badwarning this program like many other recent games form microsoft and others will only run on an account that has administrator privileges on windows xp or  that means that in most common home settings school settings or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game
if you have configured your home pc for example so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them limited accounts a recommended best practice you should certainly be following your kids will not be able to play this game
similarly if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to userlevel access then only the administrators will be able to play the gamenote that although i agree with the general consensus that mech warrior  is a fun game my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box it is not and thus i cannot give this product more than a single star because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentationas far as i am concerned this game is disappointingly boring and  just the same playstation game all over again where is the gameplay
if i may suggest dont buy this game buy ready  rumble round  its better and more realistici was never a fan of the playstation  controller
i dont like the fact that the analog stick replaced the directional pad
using an analog stick is annoying because you dont feel comfortable with it
ask any older gamer they will tell you that you felt more in control of your movements with a directional pad
with an analog stick you slide all over the place
in addition to that disaster the ps controller also suffers from too many buttons
we shouldnt have to have a degree in rocket science to figure out how to successfully figure out and complete a game
the playstation one had the best controller ever
it was comfortable you were always in complete control and it just looked betterthis controller is undoubtedly the biggest pos ever made
since the ps came out around  years ago i have probably gone through over  controllers through normal play and not from getting thrown into a wallwell not until theyre already nonfunctionalwhats worse
its the best one out there
ive had no better luck with any aftermarket controllersi wish i could punch the engineer who designed this craptastic pile of poop right in the eyei cant get through the simplest of battles because the buttons on this controller are so iffy
makes game playing a real pain in the butti hate this controller
it is so small and uncomfortable to hold
the analog buttons are placed in the worst spots
it is way too small to support the anolog buttons  fat black blobs dpad triangle rectangle square and xso i got this controller and i thought it would work since it was like buying one from a store but i was dissapointed because this didnt work and i wont buy anything else from this selleri unwittingly bought a ps not knowing that id get a god awfull small game controller
i used it for a month and now i cant hardly move my hands or my fingers
dont buy playstation  theyve ruined my future
im writing this review right now by using a voice typing program that microsoft published especially for people whove ended up in my poor situation
ps
buy an xbox instead their controllers are much biggerat close to price sonys official memory card is way overpriced
it probably costs them  or  to make it but we end up paying dearly
unfortunately you should not buy thirdparty memory products none of them offers complete compatibility with the ps
sonys memory is slow but at least reliablefirst there is nothing about this to really write home about
it is a memory cart
you have to have it else your ps is worthless as a game machine
most games wont even play unless you have one so you have to have onemy main gripe is the memory size
mb
cmon
wrc and gta both take up almost  of the capacity of this cart for their save games
and it is going to get worsewhere are the mb cartssave yourself some money and dont buy this single pack
there is a twin pack of cards for only a few dollars morethis game in one word 
get the madden  and dont even bother with this game
i got it and played it once and had to take it out
terrible graphics and shotty game play
bottom line dont even buy itif youre gonna get this game get on playstation if you have the original system
the controls on gameboy are next to impossiblethis game is horrible
it is so incredibly horrible that it makes et on teh atarii  look goodfor a psx game the graphics are bad
the over the top view is fine but it looks like it could easily be on the nes conviently trannsfered to gameboy color by the wayi hate the music in it
the same style makes for a non stop bore fest
i took it back within three hours after renting itthe controls are what kill it though
you will smashj the controller in three seconds after playing itavoid with all cost
trust me as a hardcore gamer for  years you will trust my advice and avoid go for grand theft auto  if any of the seriesi dont really consider this a game
yes it is very different
but what is good in diffrence is bad in gameplay
the princess cannot climb chains at all
cant she feel a chain
come on
the combat is stupid
look at me
im hitting black shadows with a stick
wow
the puzzles are interesting but i hate that call that ico has when calling for yorda
squawk
also please translate yorda
maybe im not a fan of puzzle games
oh welli got this game a few years agomany years after it came out
so many good reviews but when i played it i wanted to hurt the people that made it and not allow the creators to do make anything elsebut they redeemed themselves withshadow of the colossusa
pointless adventure worthless story hideous game play
sotc is where this company shines
forget this game get sotcthey might be coming out with a icosotc ps upscaled hd gamei recommend getting that only for sotcvmu games are the worst thing ever
i dont know why i thought this would be a good idea to buy because its garbage
it features grade school quality acting
maybe you could consider it to be one of those so bad its good kinda things
in that case  thumbs upi have read many reviews on the game gear and i am disgusted with the reviewers who didnt do any research all of them
they insist that it is soooo much better than the game boy advance
the game gear is too big to even fit in your pocket
it is really bulky
sure the back lit screen is nice but that adds to the size and weight of the system
it also takes  aa batteries and drains them extremely fast
the game boy advance runs on  aa batteries and last  hours
the reviews state that the gba is the same as the game boy color and the game gear is a better system
well here are some eye openers for yougtgtgtthe game gear can display  different colors  at any time
the game boy advance can display  colors  at any time
that is more than a  color differencegtgtgtthe game boy advance is  times as powerful as a game boy color and  times more powerful than a super nintendogtgtgtthe gba can display  moving objects at once
lets lee a game gear do thathopefully you have read this review and make the right choicefirst of all i must say that when i was a kid i had always wanted a sega game gear
they kicked the gameboys butt
color screen and an eight bit processor that was every bit as good as the internal processors for the sega master system actually almost identical in fact you can actually get an adapter to play master system games on a game gear and the adapter dosent even take extra power at all nor have any processors inside of it it just directly adapts a master system cartridge to fit a game gear thats it and to be fully honest when you play some games that were made for the nes and the game gear both most of the games look better on game gear just to be totally honest
ive had both systems more on that later
one flaw in the system is the battery life
not good
it takes  aa batteries and this sucker will drain them in  hours in my experienceone day i was at a yard sale and low and behold i found a game gear
for 
no crap
the sound didnt work but it did work out of the headphones
everything else was perfect
i played on this game gear for quite a while until the headphones stopped working as well
i looked it up online and discovered this is an extremely common issue with game gears
it turns out that when the game gear came out in  there were a bunch of bad capacitors on the market at that time
most of the game gears got these bad capacitors not all of them but most of them
i must say that i do have a very extensive background in electronics i majored  in computer hardware design and repair in college
so i immediately replaced all of the capacitors on the soundboard of the game gear
the speakers started working immediately and the headphones started working great as well
in fact when i got done with the system it was very loud out of the speaker
i bought probably  games for the game gear and loved  of them then i started notticing that the screen was getting almost impossible to see
you had to hold the thing at a very odd angle in order to see anything and the contrast had to be all the way up
i looked this problem up as well and guess what
when you replace the capacitors for the screen you really must replace all of the capacitors in the entire game gear in order to get it to work properly
i did this
for the longest time i would even take my game gear to pawn shops just to show it off time after time i was told this is the best screen i have ever seen on a game gear and ive never seen one of these work so well 
i would ask how much they would give me for it and i heard anywhere from  dollars
i loved the game gear for another year if that or  months when the screen went out again
it was perfect after i replaced the capacitors even better than the nintendo ds screens in terms of clarity and brightness in my opinion now the thing wasnt working
so i opened the thing up one more time to see that the screen was leaking fluid
guess what this is common as well
just replace the screen for  dollars for a good one
i gave up on itso basically i do love the system but do research on it
not all of them have these problems but most do
if you have or buy a game gear that has the sound going out of it all of these other things will happen as well its just a matter of time
it may last a few years or maybe just one year like mine did but as i said earlier do your researchgreat games include sonic the hedgehogsonic the hedgehog sonic tripple troublesonic chaosstreets of ragestreets of rage outrun not europagt racerformula mortal kombat nba jamarch rivalspaperboysonic driftsonic drift jeopardywheel of fortunefred couples golfjoe montana footballmany many more
terrible games in my opinionmonster truck warsoutrun europamortal kombatbasically every other racing gamebasically every other golf gamethat stupid tails gamethe terminator game  cant think of the exact name lol nor care tocrash test dummiesall loony toons gamesaladdinprobably more that i havent playedthis game is has many things wrong with it
first of all the controls are some of the worst that i have ever seen
there is no smooth movement in oni
it is very choppy making it hard to control your character
second the camera angles are horrific there are parts were the camera decides to zoom and unzoom especially when fighting and it makes it very hard to see who you are fighting
the graphics are halfway decent but nothing worth looking at
the best thing about this game is that i kept the receiptive never played the original gangsters but ive heard enough horror stories to know what was wrong with it but despite all the flaws people complained of everyone still seemed to enjoy the original
so when i saw the sequel on the store shelf i thought to myself that it would probably have all those flaws improved upon while still keeping its great strategy elements
so i bought the game hoping to be able to live out my favorite scenes from the godfather
at first the game was amusing but after those quick  minutes the game was quickly repackaged and returnedfirst off the strategy elements of the game are completely gone
everyone used to complain about the micromanagement in the first so i guess the solution was to completely erase all management
youre basically told what business to buy and it just generates moneythe graphics are a bit cartoonish but fitting
although the graphics arent realistic or polygonal they match the theme of the game and give it the appropriate feel
unfortunately thats all this game has
good looks good packaging no substancethe gameplay is terrible
youll pull your hair out as you order your goons to drive two blocks away and watch him circle around the whole neighborhood before finally going to his destination and hopefully hes not there to do a driveby
the driveby shootings in this game are just ridiculous
youll quickly despise watching your thugs drive past shoot make a uturn drive back shoot more make another uturn shoot you get the point
that doesnt seem like a very effective driveby to me
also the people standing on the side walk never ever take cover they just stand there shooting at the car until they are finally gunned down
what kind of dumb gangsters are these anyway
the ai definately needs improving
also dont get your car ruined
if you do then you have the option of stealing your enemies car but only his car
what sense does this make
my thugs have no problem with gunning down police officers but they refuse to steal an innocent persons car
i had to run  blocks past rows and rows of perfectly good parked cars to my enemies hideout to steal his vehicle
but basically what i am saying is that the ai in the game is pretty stupidanother thing that ruins the gameplay is the tedious and repetative missions
the game is basically open this shop do a hit on this guy buy that building place guards here do a hit on that guy over and over and over again
and although carrying out a quothitquot should normally be enjoyable as you can tell from my paragraph above i found killing people to be quite the choreso if all of the micromanagement is now nonexistant and all of the action is absolutely horrendous and silly what does this game have to offer
simply put boredom
the game is just too easy too simple and too shallow
perhaps for the third game they should eliminate the tedious missions and make it more openended
just allow you to hire thugs and build your empire
also they need to work on that ai a little
why do these guys get lost in a neighborhood thats  blocks wide
and who ever heard of circling back around better yet making a uturn while doing a driveby
youre supposed to shoot and then high tail it outta there
basically it could have been a good game had they taken the time out to actually add some gameplay to ityes the graphics are very good but the game is akin to an interactive painting
and so what about the graphics
whoopee most games have good graphics nowadays too but good games have some meat to them
realmyst does not its a very bland game for people who dont like real gaming experiencesafter fifty minutes of looking at the pretty pictures i was bored to tears and began the uninstall procedure
phooeyi had never played myst before and i wanted to give it a try because of its popularity
my biggest gripe is that the game offers no options
every game i know of allows a player to customize the controls
i always use the inverted mouse lookpull back look up push forward look down
i use this in quake unreal thief ii  hitman codename  forsaken system shock  halflife etc
etc
real myst does not give me a choice and i am not going to change my personal style for one game
the mouse is too sensitive and there is no option to adjust it as in other games
the quotwalkquot mode is way too fast
so just try playing a game where you seem to be running all the time the mouse operates backwards and is too sensitive in its left to right movement
well i can just stand there and admire all the scenery i guessmy system is a dell xps br  mhz coppermine piii with a geforce  mb ddr ram d card mb rdram soundblaster live audio
actually the music in the game is very nice and the graphics greatdriver  is a poor game for the playstationthe wheelman is back in driver  for playstation and who truly cares about it
why this game was produced for the playstation is beyond me
this is a game that is meant for the pc and not the limited processor of a playstation
i saw the difference in the orginal driver for playstation and driver for the pc and the gameplay experience was completely different
ill wait for the creators to code driver  to the pc so we can actually enjoy the game
the graphics are horrible horrible and horrible
anyone who says the graphics are excellent must have some bad eyes or have never seen any other game system besides a playstation much less a computer
during the gameplay it is very apparent that the coders of the game did not fully optimize the game for playstation as you can see in many parts of the game where the framerate drops
the framerate drops
what the heck is this on a playstation
i have not seen any processor or memory upgrades for a playstation so why would a game i am playing be too much for the playstation to play without any errors or holdups much less framerate drops
this is totally ridiculous
i have a very good feeling that the creators of driver  made a pc version first then coded it back to playstation format which would explain the buggy and slow gameplay in some areas
i do have to admit the game is very fun to play and would be even more enjoyable if the game would actually be better than the orginal
the mission are very good and you can pass them easily if your gameplay does not slow down but if it does you will be pushing the restart button after you fail the mission
the cutscenes are ok and i just love the beginning scene where the man with the sawed off double barrelled shot gun fires off about  shots without reloading very clever indeed
rent do buy this game unless the only thing you have in your house is a playstation
and if i see a driver  for playstation i might just drive myself into a wall in frustationthis is a review of this productdriver  playstation video game
amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product for which this review may not apply
after reading this review please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for
this is a review that i originally wrote on i lovegrand theft auto for the playstation  and i wanted a game that would be similar to it
i know that no game except for possibly gta could even come close to gta but i still wanted more
from what i read about this game it seemed like a poor mans gta
i haddriver on thepc but could never actually play the game itself because i could not pass that stupid driving test at the beginning of undercover mode
when i read that driver  did not have a driving test that gave me even more reason to want itgameplaywhen i popped the game into my ps i immediately went into free ride mode so that i could get a feel for the controls and check out the scenery a bit
i didnt even move one inch when the cops were after me
yes thats right i was standing still and the cops were on my butt if the cops are going to be on me like white on rice id at least like to know why
i gave the cops no resistance allowing them the chance to come up to the car and pull me out like real cops would and those in gta but they thought it would be best to just keep ramming me
since this game lacks the police bribes and the pay and spray of gta the only way i could get the cops off my tail and reduce my felony meter the equivalent of gtas wanted stars meter was to hitail it out of there in the hopes that i could lose them
even though the game promises that you can wipe your felony meter clean by getting out of your vehicle and carjacking another one since you cant get out of the car and switch vehicles while being wantedchased theres no practical use of this feature
i decided to try the main undercover mode hoping that it would be better
the first mission was simple enough
get from point a to point b the first time i tried it i failed it because i didnt get to the place on time i was going the wrong way from the start
once i figured out that all i had to do was make two lefts then go right every chance i could i got to the destination with time to spare
mission  passed
perhaps this game would get better  until mission  that ismission  involves you having to follow another car
the problem is unless youre at most two car lengths behind him the game will say that you lost him and thus failed the mission  even though his car is clearly visible on the screen
after attempting this mission three or four more times only to get as far as around the corner i had enough punishment and immediately decided to bring the game back to the store with my moms receipt to get a different game
any game would be better even barney the dinosaurnot even cheats codes could help make this game playable
i used two game shark codes to unlock the ingame invincibility and immunity no felony cheats
however neither of these would help with mission  the infinite time game shark code would not work otherwise i might have had a chance of barely playing the game  the key words there are might and barely
graphicsthis game has the worst graphics ever seen in a video game of any age
pong and pacman look hightech compared to thisthere is more popup in driver  than in a marathon of popup video on vh
you look ahead and see an open piece of land
you plan to cut across that land in order to make the turn at a high speed without having to slow down or just to take a shortcut
just as you get within a cars length of that land a building pops up out of nowhere
bam
you crashed and damaged your car
repeat indefinitely and youve got the graphics of driver replayabilityin order to have replayability a game must first have playabilityto buy or to rentneitheri wouldnt even give the cd to my dog as a chew toyif it were possible i would have given this game a  rating
then again it kinda deserves the  because it has one redeeming quality it makes a great coasterthis is a wicked bad game
its its also wicked hard
basically all you do is run a round like a mad man and kill things
sounds fun
guess what
its not
i mean you have to repair your weapon
what the heck is that all about
and theres boxes that you open and they turn into enemys
yuckzelda killer
only if that means copying zelda in every way imaginable can make it superior
a league of its own
not exactly file this one with legend of dragoon as a predictably unoriginal mediocre rpg
if youre looking for that game that will pick up this slump of good software for the ps youll have to wait even longernow let me clarify this i have not played zelda  nor do i own a n
i did not hear about how this was going to be a copycat of zelda until i finished reading someone elses review a few minutes ago
that said i still felt like i was playing a rather effortlessly made copy of it
for sheer curiosity i tried zelda at a friends house
even the grunts link makes inbattle seems to be stolen from this gamewhat is the gameplay like
for zeldavirgins such as myself it was pretty good at first
it was easy to jump into and hard to put down for the first  hours or so
good until after quite some time in the game nothing really happens in the storyline a sony rpg trademark and after hours upon hours of repetitive gameplay yet another sony rpg trademark it failed to keep me within its graspsthe graphics while good are nothing spectacular
they quickly get tiresome when youre in the same dungeon for  hours or more
every level of the dungeons look the same so if you have a high tolerance of environments as repetetive as the gameplay youll have no trouble thereand heres another staple the immense amount of typing errors the third sign of a sony rpg
while there isnt much text it was enough to make me want to send money to sony to buy a spell checker for the sake of pitygeorama is almost innovative
it would be if simcity hadnt done this general idea first and if it gave you more freedom
the villagers are very picky as to where their house should be placed
so picky that youll wonder why sony even bothered to let you build these villages at allin general buy this if you liked legend of dragoon or if youve never even heard of the zelda seriesi cannot believe how high a rating this game is getting
this supposed zelda killer is nothing more than a dungeon crawl along the lines of evolution on dreamcast
zelda tramples this bore into the dirt
its got many similarities to evolution randomized dungeon levels repeat visits back to town to restock on supplies so you can go back to the dungeon bland enemies that feeling of inane repetition
as for combat wheres the strategy
wherere the backflips the dodges the ability to take out an enemy in more than two fashions the feeling that youre actually in the middle of a fight instead pressing one button a lot
basically you either combo them to death or you use your charge up super move
dungeons are bland
basically its a bunch of rooms connected by tunnels
there are no puzzles or unique obstacles that have to be dealt with
theres no sense of discovery no aha
moments that are the great moments of zelda style games
every dungeon just feels like a dungeon
youre not discovering whole new worlds filled with nooks crannies and secrets waiting to be found youre dungeon crawling looking for loot and the key to the next level so you can do it all over again
gameplay is repetitive
venture to the dungeon find the mystic balls and key go back to town build which does have a minor appeal to it and get supplies did i mention your character has to have a drink of water every three minutes
or that his weapon starts to wear down and break after killing five or six enemies
 venture to the dungeon and find mystic balls on the next level which looks exactly the same as the first
ugh ugh ughi cant even really say this is a fake zelda because they tried to copy and came up with a repetitous counterfeit
over  hours of the same thing over and over again
i maxed out my sword and didnt even get a reward
i wouldnt wish this life stealer on my worst enemy thats why i through it in the garbage
negative  and yes i beat it
ocarina of time a positive  starsthis was a bad game
graphics were subpar
gameplay was easy
after one weekend of playing i almost completed everything
for an rpg give me a challange pleasethis game is absolutely horrendous
you go back and forth to the same ugly looking dungeon looking for georama pieces
on top of that he gets thirsty every  seconds and is sword breaks which makes it weaker
very very annoying
what is up with the building of the town
i want to play an rpg not sit there and build a town
if i wanted to manage a town i would go play sim city or something like that
i bought this game a  while ago and played for a total of about  hours before saying quotscrew thisquot and shelving it forever
i recently bought a game called ico which is also made by sony now that is a masterpiece sonys redemption
this is a horrible title go buy ico instead youll be happiertrust megran turismo  aspec tries to hide its craptacular and atrocious gameplay with the looks of a gorgeous racer
but then its like when you look at a movie star on an hdtv and you see its appalling horrors that lie within it
to start off the controls suck greatly
for example when turning a corner you will notice how you cant seem to keep your vehicle on the road and it constantly slips and swerves like youre driving in snow
another problem the absence of a sense of speed
when i was driving i never felt the sense of speed that should be in racers
instead it felt like i was maybe only going about mph or less
problem  the lack of interesting tracks to race on
when going through the various tracks i never felt compelled to look at the environments around me solely for the fact that they were so boring
problem  crappy career mode
never in my years of playing various racers did i ever go through a career mode that was so dull and made me feel so unwanting to complete it one day
problem  crappy multiplayer
wow what a horribly dull and unexciting way to challenge a friend to a race
heres how it went we raced around the boring tracks swerved like we were driving in snow and we were totally bored
so then he took the game out of his  ps and put in kingdom hearts that is how bad the multiplayer is
the only positive thing the amazing graphics that was iti just want to say that this is a racing game if u havent already figured that out
if u like ur games to have a little more substance then u wont like this
i will admit that the builtin rumble feature on the controller really adds to the realism
it is very realistic like when you get hit or go across a bumpy dirt road you feel every hit and feel every bump but thats basically the only thing it has going for itthis is a disgrace to racing and all car games in general to bad such a powerful system does not have games like metropolis street racing on the dreamcast
dont buy this game it is horriblethis game is great if you have  or so hrs to spend getting your drivers lic
there are a total of  test you must pass to get all  drivers lic
infact i wouldnt be suprised if it takes someone  hrs to pass them all
shouldnt these test be optional
they could award cash or the best cars after finishing each lic test
but they make you go through this garbage of taking these useless test
im on the last test of my b lic
i spend nearly  hrs total
i doubt i will pass it
sorry but that is not fun
i love a challenge but the developers made the test way to difficulti hated the fact that you had to pass the damn license test before you could even race
takes away the fun from doing whats really fun in the gameracing
theres a point where realism can stretch a bit too fari know it would be realistic to have the liscense tests in there as you would have to take them in real life
however they are annoying and stupid and better off not being there in a game something meant to entertain you not bore and frustrate you to deathalso there are the simulation of the handling and controlsmy bro says its for people who know how to drive well
well for the rest of us could they not have implemented arcade style handling and controls
it would have been such an easy thing to implement and i know its not realistic but it would draw more people to play the game that wouldnt otherwisefinally there is the fact that you cant crash wreck or damage your car in any way shape or form
this is supposed to be the most realistic driving simulation yet i can hit a wall at  mph and just bounce off it and all that happens is that i slow down maybe spin out or get turned around
supposedly this is because the car companies that liscensed their cars for use in the game didnt want to see their precious pretty cars get smashed up in a freaking game
so it was either take damage out or the game wouldve never been released in its current form
the only thing that could have given this an extra star is the occasional fun you have racing against your friends but sadly it isnt enoughi bought this game because the reviews i read were glowing and it looked like it had good graphicswhen i got home and loaded it it took forever to install i discovered that the game was  just walking around and talking to various characters
some of the characters are homosexual and the language was terrible
i dont want to listen to profanity or some gay woman telling me about her sexual life
i just wanted to play an adventure game
i didnt want to hear all the gay talk
after about a half an hour i had had enough of this gamethis game was totally boring with reguards to gameplaythe content was vialthe profanity was plentiful and totally uncalled fori give this game my lowest ratingthis is the dumbest mega man title yet
i was floored when i saw the game and first played it but when i saw that there were no bosses and no charge shot i felt betrayed
i did finish the game as i did not want to lose the money just a big let downthey get in the way of the screen and they show very little lighti recommend getting a micro sp a gameboy lightdoesnt work for gba games a dsonly gba games or just playing in lightsave yourself the trouble of having to return it
the worm light puts out very little light and you have to try to position it so the light doesnt just reflect off the screen
the price is right but these lights wear out very quickly
you would be much better off buying a light magnifier for your systemthis light stinks
you barely get anything out of it and it wastes your batteriesthis is a lousy product period
i purchased one of these cheaper memory cards and it worked for a month
i had the pleasure of the memory card breaking when i was over halfway through oni on the ps you will have to have played oni to know how upset i was because oni is a really frustrating game
needless to say i went out to purchase a memory card made by sony after i spent  minutes on the phone with sony technical support
oh by the way sony said to me that the rd party dvd remotes are not endorsed by sony and they could potentially cause problems with the ps console so i ditched the rd party remote i had toosave yourself the time and money and just pay the few extra dollars for a memory card that is endorsed and manufactured by sony
that way you wont have to spend hour after hour of sleepless nights just to get back to where you were in the game you were playing because you had one of these cheap memory cards and it crapped out on you right at the middle of the gamei bought this memory card and was sorely dissappointed
the salesperson told me that the sony brand ones which were out of stock were better and i dismissed it as a prosony sales pitch
i shoulda listened
this card quotlostquot three weeks worth of saved games and data
the company offered to replace it for free gtif they find it to be defectivelt
since it appears that the card only reformatted itself i cant see them replacing it because quottechnicallyquot it works
too bad they cant recover all the hours of lost gameplayim sticking with sony cards from now on ive been burned by third party cards one time too manythe online adaptor works great with any online game that came out before   dsl is not compatible with this adaptor on all games created after   do not fall for these other reviews
i have dsl and i was able to play madden  online but madden  is not compatible i called ea sports and a recording tells you dsl is not compatible with any ea games sold after   i tried calling my isp as well as sony but found absolutely no tech support on this subject
how can you have  million users who have dsl and possibly make games that are not compatible with dsl i ask you
sony found a way
oh and dont think youll be able to play socom ii online with dsl either i repeat all newer games  will not work with dsl
dont get me wrong i love the ps but man did they drop the ball with the online adaptorthis should basically be for a collector only because the network is gone
i cant do anything with this product online at all
sony is kind of bogus for shutting down the servers for the ps network because it would be fun to still be able to go on line and play with other gamers
some one else should get something going again so this item is useablethis product for the ps that enables you to play online is an absolute rip
i have pleanty of reasons but let me give you the jist of it
now see first of the price of the adapter alone is pleanty enough to put someone down
hell i love online gaming but  some bucks taken out of my pocket to do it is a little too much
the adapter is fine within itself
the problem i have with it is just the online capabilities
now first off installing and connecting the adapter to your ps takes way to much time
another thing is the booklet which they give you and expect you to read it is like a chapter book not a manuel
in order to start playing you must put the disc in which is given within the package and sit through a long tidius process
it is not as simple as to plug it in and play instead they had to create a long difficult processanother problem with this product is the capabilities with the games
first of the games are very limitedfrom that i mean the choice in which one has to play from
eventually i know more games will come outbut eventually ps will come out wont it
nevertheless for the games that are compatiable with this adapter the connectivity servers suck ass
playing from several of my friends house and my own the lagging and time it takes to enter a game is extensive and overstrenuius
there are pleanty more things wrong with this including hidden fees with cables not included in package the games and routers which i needed
i spent in total around  in high hopes of playing online
instead i had the enjoyment of staring into the menu screen of the ps
if your smart youll spend your money on something else you want instead of this pos
by any means necessary stay away from this productthis game is the absolute worst pirate game ever
it completely lacks the fun factor of sid meiers pirates or the polish of any many of the top quality games
this is headed for the bargin bin soonit has typical bethesda softworks graphics bugs and other game crashing bugs
ship control is horrid
game play is nonexistent
the interface is a cludge
the sound is good and the graphics are quotokquot
brilliant in spots and simply ugly in others
there are quite a few graphics bugs
even with patch  released 
no matter how well you pound an enemy ship they will never strike
you must board almost impossible
and then defeat the enemy captain in a duel
this duel is limited to a couple of crude keyboard strokes
and in the first  i tried i lost all 
oh what fun
so i had the joy of reloading the start postion a dozen times and experimenting with several different  there is absolutely no game balance
there is no way to scale down the difficulty level
in about  of the opening games i was attacked by  spanish ships you always start with the spanish as your enemy
no matter how much of their sails you shoot out with chain shot they remain always faster and more maneuverable then you
your ship has  cannons facing rearward for when you flee
i used those liberally for hours real time and was in the end caught and killed
repeatedly
this is a simply stupid way to begin the game
if you simply must own all sailing or pirate games get it
i tried to give it to a buddy i went to college with and after trying it he gave back
even free it was over pricedi bought this game based on the enthusiastic reviews below and now i have to wonder what these people were thinking
quotsea dogsquot is indeed  games in one
however none of them is particularly complelling
they consist of  a roleplaying game which consists of walking around and asking people things
however you generally ask each person one thing and they give you one response so theres not much room for thinking
a naval simulator which is mildly interesting for the first couple of fights
however since every fight is basically the same this quickly becomes boring endlessly sailing in circles and lining up broadsides against your opponents
a video game style fencing sequence that is simply annoying
its ridiculously primitive compared to the martial arts style games on the market and one has to wonder why its even in hereover all there was nothing particularly compelling about the game play
the graphics are pretty but how long can you stare at the waves and the storm clouds when the game itself is dry as toast
also the game is seriously buggy even with the new  patch installed and running
the game is completely incompatible with a number of video cards
so if you do buy the game theres a modest chance that it simply wont run on your machinei just wanted a fun game didnt have to be high tech yet i was very let down with the gamei first of all went to the options section to select beginner as was advised by a supposed experienced player on amazon well there was no option to select beginner or any other skill levelall the hype and info sites  these persons must have worked for bethesda the game maker because the game does not perform as advertisedthe cheat codes do not work unless you need a patch and the start ship a pink just gets sunk by  spanish galleons or pirates from the start so you do not have a chance to build up money to upgrade your ship or frankly to continue playing at allyour just dead in the waterthere are no treasure galleons to capture and only one pirate map at the end of a questseveral efforts at making the game work for any length of time failed for the same game flaw of being attacked overpowering attacks by spaniards or pirates all in all its very lame  maybe the game would be better labeled an example of the worst game a company can make 
it wins first place for the worst pirate  trader game since computer games were developedthanks bethesda i could only give one star to reflect my opinion but i would have given it a neg
 star if possibleso life goes on look for another piratetrader game in the futurefirst of all why the hell is this thing  dollars plus tax
i have playstation and i dont generally like it
i thought microsoft was trying to steal your money but now this piece of garbage comes along and it is a joke
why is amazon selling this for  dollars
i got mine with my playstation and now they are selling it just to keep space
this is a total jokenow that i have cooled down this can be space saving
if it was free well it would be a good buy
playstation is not that big and if you dont have enough space your poor and can only put everything in one room or you have those tvs which have a million plugs
that is why it gets at least two stars because nothing is that bad wellsome games and equipment have gone over the edgeso instead of wasting  dollars go out and save up for some games
the blue color is not impressive and it doesnt cool down and it doesnt scratch your discs
actually it only does one thing wastes your moneycarma ii was great
i loved it
a great way to take out my aggressiveness at the end of a hard day
and nobody gets hurt
carma  sucked
im not even going to be kind on this one
i was very disappointed with the entire game and trashed it within a half hour after installing ita friend of mine has this game
i found it really annoying and frustrating
its to difficult to play
i couldnt even get past the first level
i recommend borrowing it from someone who owns it or rent it somehow instead of buying iti was unable to get past the frustrating parappa style first level so i cant recommend this game
after  minutes of not getting anywhere i gave up and threw it away
and i was able to beat parappa so i know im not totally inept at this sort of game
theres no difficulty option nor is there a way to skip levels
dont waste your timei havent purchased this yet but this review can still be extremely helpfuli was playing my ps on my  tv and i said to myselfwow
that quality   i went on to amazon because i had heard about these new cables that improved quality
i found one this one and it looked great
i hurried back to my sony receiver it connects up my dvd player tv and surround sound system and looked at the back
no svideo
i got a flash light and searched it over again hoping i missed it
no signs
i moved my tv over so i could look at the back
what
there i see them  svideo imputs
that makes me mad
how could monster assume that everybody is going to be playing this on their tv
dont they realize that some people use home theater receivers
nooo
theres no way im giving up my great surround sound for this
if you want to buy this i would check your receiver first
if you dont have component cables which i dont
they also are only on the tv or svideo on your receiver i would suggest getting a  regular av cable from monster
that one still improves quality quite a bita friend gave me this pad before considering throwing it in the trash
after two days of having it ilt threw it in the trash
the dpad has got to be the worst thing about it its a dpad that wants to be an analog stick
so its never fast enough on oldskool games because of all its give
it has the right ammount of buttons start select l  r but that dpad is soooo hoakie
id rather have an old turbo touch s flat touch panel from my nintendo days
atleast those actually worked
if you want console quality but on your pc dont bother with flimsy copycat pc gamepads because they all suck
get a liksang adapter and you can use ps pads on your pc
download joykey and youll have awesome keyboard and mouse mapping software just like any saitek or logitech padalthough it has  workable buttons which come in handy for some games it has some major flaws
on some games if you press up on the gamepad you go down and when you press down youll go up
the directional pad is totally useless games where you need to move the dpad rapidly forget about it
the buttons in the back eventually get stuck
you cant use any other gravis controller while this one is in use
and on top of all that not even the uninstaller works right
when you goto uninstall the controller it screws up your computers registry files
it was a nightmare just to get my computer working again
ill never buy another gravis gamepad againthis is a great game but these amazon sellers are charging over price for this game
the extra levels you can get on xbox live marketplace if you have the regular edition
dont pay unreasonable pricesso buy the regular version
then download the extra levels on xbox live
have fun and dont let these sellers take advantage of you
they shouldnt be overcharging in this economy and i give them one star for tryingthe game really does look good
and it seems like it would be a great game
but it is at this point almost completely unplayableif you buy this game before they fix it which could be months from now heres what to expect lag very often that can last longer than a minute crashing to the desktop at least once an hour computer lockups at least once every few hours occasional inability to log in at all items which do not work missions which do not work character death due to lag and countless other minor and major bugsi was actually very patient with these problems until the publisher lied to its customers
first they told everyone the quotfree monthquot your purchase price includes one month of online play would not begin until the game was playable
then six days later with almost no changes to the game they declared it playable and began the billing cycleto make matters worse i cant even cancel my account
ill probably have to dispute the charge with my bank
but at least ive already returned the gamemaybe ill try again in a few months but i dont really have a whole lot of faith or trust in funcom right nowi will never ever buy a product from funcom ever againthis is the worst developed game i have ever played
it devlievered on nothing it promised
it had horrible crashes for at least  months and now they reintroduced even more problemsworst of all they have no customer service
something goes wrong with your game
tough
wait for a patch
no quick fixes and completely moderated forums so you cant even voice your complaints anymorei canceled my account and i urge you to never ever buy this game
that also includes any funcom game including their upcoming mmorpgwhat is interesting about anarchy online is how much potential this game had
great graphics a solid story line and promises that players would be able to alter the course of the games storyline all added up to an incredible dream for many gamers
the problem is the game failed to deliver in most areas besides graphics leaving us with just another quotinteresting for a weekquot piece of software that will be popular only until the quotnext big mmorpgquot comes around
if you like running out in a big field clicking on a monster killing it clicking on another monster killing it clicking on another monster etc etc etc then this game is for you
if youre looking for an engrossing rpg look somewhere elseone more important note this game does contain quoteaster eggquot nudity  that is in certain extremely rare situations you are able to see the genitals of some of the quotavatarsquot in the gamei honestly wanted to give anarchy online a chance
the massively multiplayer genre needs some new blood and there were some interesting things in this game when it first went live good graphics promising character classes and a scifi setting though really not very hard scifi more like fantasy with some futuristic toucheshowever the developer funcom has demonstrated truly astonishing incompetence and bad faith since the launch of the game
all games of this kind have rocky launches but dont be fooled the problems of anarchy online go far deeper than a rocky launch
each patch has actually introduced serious new balance problems and several including the most recent patch have reintroduced old bugs and added some new ones
these are not just gardenvariety bugs but gamestopping ones mind younow funcom has taken the extraordinary step of shutting down the support bulletin boards at its own site which is always a sign of imminent disaster in the gaming world
its the equivalent of a toxically bad film that a movie studio tries to keep away from critics hoping that they can just get one weekend of good box office before the word gets outaos european launch is imminent
if our good friends in europe have any sense theyll give this game a wide berth whatever its price
the sooner funcom closes the lights on the few remaining players in this flaming wreck of a game the better
perhaps they can sell the remnants of their tattered code to a real developer and someday well see the game reach its potential
its a certainty that funcom itself cant pull it offreview  anarchy onlinei am currently a member of the beta community for anarchy online
for weeks now many of the community members have spent hours upon hours trying to solve countless unaddressed problems that funcom are ignoring
to sum it up
anarchy online is an advanced and very graphical rpg if you can get it to work
i personally believe that no self respecting programmer out there that would launch a game in a state like this
if you want to buy it wait a few monthsi was in the betawelli never actually played in the beta because i could never get the game to work
then i was dumb enough to buy the gamelol
after about a week of hair pulling countless crashes to desktop a few re installs i actually got into the game and playedfor about  minutes at a time or until i zoned and crashed to desktop
but these problems are covered in other reviews lets get to the real problems
boring  once you get past all the bugs if you can you find out what the game is really all about
wellnot much
one of the main selling points for this game is that camping would be eliminated by the quotrandom missions generatorsquot
the key word here is random
everything about this game is random and generic and thats its biggest downfall
there is no sense of purpose no sense of direction and no sense of accomplishmentthe missions all start to look the same after about the th one and youll be on hundreds of them if you ever want any cash
this also ties in to the lack of boss mobs and lack of dungeonsyou fight mostly outdoors or in the quotmissionsquot
which are randomly generated quotdungeonsquot
the implementation of which is absolutely horrible
mobs are spawned with no ryhme or reason some dungeons have zero mobs in them some have  that will all rush you at zone it
serious coding and engine problems  not even going to go into all of these as they alone would take up the  word limit on reviews needless to say its overwhelming
crashing crashing and more crashing  self explainatory
character creation  suppose to eliminate cookie cutter characters but it doesnt
sure you can train anything you want but because of the skill system and the way the points you get to spend must be distributed to make your character viable you end up with really only one path you can take per given proffesion
monster ai  the single worst programming of ai i have ever seen in any video gameand thats saying a lot
exploits cheats hacks  by the time i left which was under one month into release there were already players that were level 
being that this is a pvp game thats not good
exploits were rampant and numerous
exploiters went scott free
balance of proffesions  non existant
the game is so unbalanced its not even funny
there are  viable classes to play if you want to live pvp forget it if you play any of the othersjust a note about me
im an avid gamer and have  characters over  in eq and  over  in ac
so i obviously have the patience for online gaminglolthis game fails in every single aspect of gameplay
its boring repetitive buggy unbalanced and just plain no fun
avoid at all costs you have been warnedbroke after about of month of use and wont but another because of thatjust becaise of the poor build qualitythis is a review of this productsuper bustamove playstation  video game
amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product for which this review may not apply
after reading this review please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for
this is a review that i originally wrote on i cant believe all the good reviews this game is getting
i just have to chime in with my opinion on this game
simply put they broke bustamove
they removed almost all of the game play modes they removed the edit mode they made the controls unresponsive they take a second to respond they added annoying and distracting backgrounds the bubbles have been graphicallyenhanced so they they too are now annoying to look at they took away all the cool characters and added a bunch of pokemon rejects and they added a ton of long loading screensmost of that is pretty much selfexplanatory so i dont need to elaborate on it
however i will give you a list of what few game play modes there are in the game  player training  normal  classic cpu battle normal  expert  player battle normal  expert  chain reactionyup thats iti rented this game to see if i had made a mistake buying bustamove  for the playstation 
well i can tell you this my purchase of bustamove  was definitely well worth it
i havesuper bustamove on my rental list
although i suspect that it wont be much better than this one ill still be optimistic and give it a tryif you want a good bustamove game to play on your playstation  get yourselfbustamove orbustamove both for the playstation 
both are essentially the same though  adds pulleys to the puzzles
sure the graphics look like they came off of a snes but is that really such a bad thing
the load times are short to nonexistent at times the characters look cool in that oddjapanese way and most of all the controls are extremely responsive and there are a ton of game play modesdont buy a ps just becuse its style how can you know its the best if you are one way minded what about dreamcast gamecub xbox  is dreamcast dead hard to say when sonic aventrue  come out sega cant make enough  of it its so goodive tried many times to play this gameand didnt get to even play it the first few times as it would just say that its saving and would stay that way for an hour or morethen i kept tryingand finally made it past certain pointsbut then the game screwed up againsoi gave up on iti am hoping that the seller wasnt being a snake and knew this game has a memory card glitch and still sold iti wrote a review for this game a few days ago and i guess amazon wouldnt let me post for some reasoni was just trying to warn people of this game problem and possibly the seller i had ordered fromi didnt get very far in the gameonly a couple of missions before i have upmake sure the one youre receiving workswatch out for some sellers on herei would return itbut id rather not waste more moneyits too bad i was really looking forward to playing this and this game had a different twist to the series which i likedoh welli bought this game because people said its better than ssx
not true at all
this game is nothing compared to ssx
you should rent this before you buy it
i am glad this game is so popular because i was able to sell it very easy and fasti bought this game because the sales charts revealed it was a topseller but now that ive played it i can only assume that everyone else was as duped as i was
this game is terrible
the graphics i will admit are amazing but the game play is just downright uninnovated
you cant take shortcuts even tho the box says quotcareen off the dirt pathquot and the machinery isnt different enoughthey did spend a lot of money on the music and instruction booklet as the first includes tracks from alice in chains and soundgarden and the later which is a fullcolor  page manual
but if you want a good offroad racing game buy rumble racingat first i was impressed with this sorry excuse for a game but after playing it for a week i win every time when i play against the computer
but really what is the worst is that the ai of the game stink
it just is worthless
so in aattempt to make it more challenging it cheats
you ever charge  heavy calvary with  of your heavy calvary only to be beaten because the  heavy calvary you attacked just happened to have their daimyo
come on how stupid is that
there are a million bugs the game uses to get an advantage which is a real shame because the frustration it builds just does not make the game worth it
it is also a joy to get your troops stuck on the side of a mountain and it is just impossible to manuerver them anymore
never has a game had such potential just to stinki just could not get into this game
i really liked riven but myst iii does not in any way compel me to keep on trying to solve the puzzles in order to get farther
i solved the first major puzzle which involved lining up reflecting lights in order of color to open a door on an island
it took me a while but i finally figured it out and opened the dooronly to find another puzzle preventing me from opening the next door
i mean come on
i guess im just not a big fan of puzzle games anymore or something
the story does not make me want to solve them at any rate
its slow and sluggish at least at first i never got past the first part because i was just too bored
so the eagerlyawaited myst iii exile is sitting on my desk collecting dust
i feel absolutely no urge to go play it although i will give it one star for the pretty graphicsbuy this game only if you really really like thinking and solving almostimpossible puzzles
everyone i know who has this game was forced to buy the guide to go with itthe flower zone is too dull in fact this whole game is dull dull dull
there is no story and the puzzels are just plain stupid
spend hours arranging reflectors
i dont think soand let me tell you about the flower zone
first of all the graphics rely on jumping to the next point so there is little pathway to follow given that there is no d progress to take you to the next point of play
the screen jumps to your next location in even a more lazy way than riddle of the shinx did
plus once you have landed at the next point in the jump the stupid game has you turned off the point you landed at so that you are looking cockeyed
i really hate how that happensprogrammers please place us facing the way we landed
i am not anal enough to want to figure out how i can go down a path and end up facing a direction i did not turn to facei hated schizm but i think i hate this more
it is really a bad game
i have played many adventure games but this is really lousyi bought myst iii over one week ago
until now i have not been able to play this game at all
here is whyafter installation the game needs cdrom disk  in order to start the game
however after i loaded the appropriate disk the program did not recognize that it was in fact in the drive and kept requesting iti finally went to the myst website for assistance
there i found that ubisoft quotis aware of the problem and for now recommends to the user to change the drive letter of the cdrom drive to something lower than hquot
added is a small short note with a warning that quotchanging the drive letter could cause other programs to not work correctlyquot
it continues with quotwe are working on a better fix for the problemquot
so of course i am not going to change my drive letters around  who knows what that will do to my systemwhile i am happy that ubisoft apparently is aware of the problem it bugs me immensely that they would throw such a game out on the market which obviously isnt up to todays systems
my cdrom drive is drive letter n and i can honestly say that no game i have played in the past has ever had trouble recognizing iti have now shelled out money for a game that sits on the shelf until ubisoft comes up with that promised fix  inquiries about how long this will take were not answered to this day
i can only imagine how many more troubles are waiting for me once ill get around the disk  problemas to the game itself i wish i could say something about it
i really dohiwhen i first loaded this game i couldnt get past the title screen
i emailed support and had no luck getting it to work
based on my negative review here on amazon greg uhler one of the games producers emailed me personally to try to helpas it turns out i emailed all my information and he gave me a solution right away
now the game runs greati cannot thank greg enough for his personal helpin case you would like to know what i didi manually set my monitor resolution to x and bit color
thats all it took
btw i have a voodoo mb so if you have had any troubles try thisrich rossiold as many of you know this game had some serious support problems
i was never able to get it to work even though my computer exceeds all the system requirements
i talked to support and recieved an answer and a follow up answerthen nothing
now i am stuck with a game that will not run on a computer that it is advertized to work on
 you have been warnedthese games expect too much from you
what i mean by that is that everything has to be perfect in the city that you are building in order for the people who live there to be happyyou have to build their houses in a desirable location otherwise the houses will be of poor quality and the people will move out
you have to make sure that the people have food water jobs are healthy have a source of entertainment and have access to religious services
providing these things for the people will cost money
if you run out of money you have to find a way to make more money
one way to make more money is to establish a trade route to another area to trade your goods
this can be hard to do because you will have to find an area that will accept your goods and will trade them for other goods that are useful to you but that you cant produce yourself
you have to make sure that your city has a strong army of soldiers in case of an invasion
even if you are confident that the people are happy it seems like they will always have something to complain about
it seems like businesses always complain that they have too few employees
it seems like no matter how many firehouses and architects posts you build buildings will constantly be bursting into flame or falling to pieces
your entire city that you have worked so hard on will be in ruins in just a matter of seconds even if you have the best fire and damage protection
and you have to make sure that the gods are happy
you need to be constantly throwing festivals in their honor otherwise theyll do things like send down plagues of locusts or what have you to wreck havoc in your city
what im trying to say is that these games are a little too hard
also the games have lots of typos which can be annoyingthese games belong in a th grade history classroom to teach kids how hard it was to rule one of these empires
i would not recommend these games to anyone especially people who are easily frustrated
if you like citybuilding games i would recommend majesty the fantasy kingdom sim
now thats a fun gamethere is no sound
graphics is very very bad
this game is too old to be playedi love quotstar warsquot and related games
i recently bought quotrebel assaultquot for the pc and frankly it is an assault on my good taste as a gamer
i would rather play the original quotspace invadersquot
this game is horrible and should have been removed from sale years ago
the graphics are poor and lack any finesse the controls for the ships are slow and useless the colors are gaudy and combined with the lack of definition caused by the poor smugdy graphics really hurt your eyes
quotrebel assault iiquot has to be better than this
i wish i has that insteadok so i bought this from gamestop used for like  bucksand im not gonna complain and say that i wasted my money or anything like that but this game isnt that greatsure i played it for awhile but it just got to boreing for meim not gonna explain what you do or what its all about but i will tell you that the gameplay pretty much sucks especialy if your the type that likes free roam gamesthere are these mini games or whatever you wonna call them i gues to train your character or something i dont really know i didnt play it long enoughwell anyway the bottom line you should really really try before you buythis thing is about as ergonomic as a prison bench
the ability to change it from a right handed controller to a left handed one seems like a good idea but it came with too high a price
four of the control buttons are located directly in front of the stick hard to reach anyway but theyre only about a mile away from the throttle control useless for those i gotta hit this button now or i will die moments every gamer faces
because once you move your fingers from the throttle waaaaayyy down to the ff buttons its all over
they did this logically to save the expense of having to place opposite mirroring buttons beneath both the right and left throttle portsspeaking of throttlethe wheel based throttle control has about  degrees of travel between zero and maximum way too much for comfort
it forces the user to stretch out the arm too far which over hours of gameplay can really become uncomfortablethe stick itself no doubt youve noticed from the pictures theres this strange looking protrusion from the back of the stick
what could this be
one ponders upon first glance
well i shall not keep you in suspensethis little plastic protrusion is an incredibly intelligent and novel idea gone sadly awry
the upright u shaped piece is designed to nicely support your hand the big muscle beneath you thumb sits atop it while the flat portion of this device supports the edge of your hand
its a great idea executed poorly
because of its placement your hand always ends up coming away from the most comfortable resting position in favor of better stick control
it would work very well if the human body did not have shoulders that is
this resting point can be moved up and down according to you preference but its just another feature i found completely uselessit stayed where it was when i took it out of the box all this thick quagmire of discomfort results in one thing sore wrists and elbowsthe trigger is pretty nice performs well and is unfortunately the most functional thing about this controller
there are three buttons atop the sticks head theyre very easy to hit in fact too easy to hit
often the user will find themselves executing commands because theyve accidentally hit one or more of these buttons
like most controllers there is an eight way point of view or hat switch up top too
it works but it too is much too sensitive due to the length of its design which gives your finger too much leverage on it and makes it very easy to press sideways when you wanted to press upwardsthe customizable features of this controller make it unique its a fantastically intelligent idea
too bad saitek didnt do some research and development utilizing human hands
the head has three positions straight up angled left and angled right
i found it to be absolutely positively useless
it stayed straight for my gaming needs the angled positions just made it easier to accidentally hit the three buttons up top
not something this controller needs
there are also three up and down angle positions which is nice because you never know when you might want to put the top control buttons as far away as possible so you can place your hand in slightly different uncomfortable position to even out the aches in your wrist elbow and shoulder
i mean hey why not make your thumb uncomfortable too
just to be consistentoverall construction isnt terrible it wont fall apart if you drop it
but if youre buying this for your teenager or tend to destroy controllers yourself look for something a little more substantial
even the base is lightweight plasticnow that ive said everything bad about this controller how about some of the good the handling of the stick is very good
there is a nice spring at the base of the stick making excellent consistent resistancewhich translates to good ingame control
the spring also is responsible for returning the stick to center and it does a dang fine job of it
twist control too is very responsive and it returns to center very well which means your gaming screen only rolls or twists when you want it too
the only other good thing i can think of about this controller isumwellit looks cool doesnt itto summarize things this controller incorporates some very novel intelligent ideas but executes them about as well as an albatross makes a landingthis game is not worth your money
seriously
consider buying another ps game or even  dvds
you are almost sure to get a better moviegaming experience somewhere else
let me tell you about the game
it takes  hours to work your way through the first time but actual gameplay is only  hours
the sad thing is you wont want it to be longer
the repetitive nature of the game is just awful
seriously this game is not nearly as entertaining as double dragon on the super nintendo
you basically take your wooden stiff character into fights against even less natural opponents and kick butt
this would be fine but it just goes on and on and without any real special skill or matters of interest
the graphics are great and the story is only half bad which for a game is fine but seriously the gameplay is horrid
ill give it a star for the graphics but that is it
save your money
you would be much better off purchasing doa hardcore or tekken or even zone of enders
do not buythe bouncer has been one of the most anticipated games for the ps and it being a square title youd figure that its well worth the waitbut dear sweet lord its not
its actually the worst excuse for a game that ive played in years and square should be ashamed of even putting this thing up for salebasically the bouncer is a fighting game with hardly any actual combatjust loads and loads of cinemas
its mostly a noninteractive interactive movie with a terrible story something about a girl getting kidnapped by some megacorporation with evil schemes uninteresting and underdeveloped characters and an awful game engine
this thing seems to have been created as an showoff vehicle for squares art department and it seems to be little more than selfindulgent demo
if you skip the skads of cinematics you can breeze through this game in under an hour 
and once youve beaten it youre supposed to go back and play with other characters to unlock more hidden features but once is waaaaaaay more than enough
combat consists of hitting a few buttons over and over with little strategy involving moves because once you gain one decent attack youll pretty much stick with that one time after time
the combat sequences arent even that long and youll be watching two or three cinemas longer than the actual battle once youve beaten a level which is completely absurd
if youre looking to play one of the worst quotgamesquot released this year then rent but do not buy the bouncerthe only good think i have to say about this game is that is does look really good
the graphics are great but thats the only great think about this game
i am totally disappointed with what they did to this game vs what they could have doneif you are expecting to see a double dragon kind of  players with out a split screen type of fighting then think again
next to that you get the cheesy characters with the same ole cheesy names and cheesy story line
if you like story based fightingaction games that are very poorly thought out then you will like this one
other wise rent it play it  or  times and then promptly return it and count yourself lucky you didnt waste your money on this stink bomb of a gamebootup of squaresofts the bouncer shows that even a few short months after the playstation  has become available developers are making games that look great meaning that even more great looking games are yet to come
unfortunately the bouncer looks amazing but thats mainly what you do in this game  lookthe graphics both foreground and background are completely amazing
the character designs are firstrate with details adding to the realism like the wisps of hair that bounce around on sions head to the spiked horns sprouting from volts head
the emotions revealed through facial expression are great but i really felt that i was watching a movie rather than a ps gameintros ranged from a few seconds to several minutes
they were great to watch but as the game progressed they became longer while the parts where having a controller inhand became shorterwhen the controller was inhand fighting enemies the fighting isnt much ahead of final fight or even as far back as the double dragon series
while you did have the incentive of beating them to see some more breathtaking scenes the more you play the less you want to watch or even playadditionally the camera angles often were pretty bad with you running toward the camera making it impossible to see where the enemies were up ahead
there were also times in the subway scene where youre running aimlessly to keep ahead of the closing doors and out of the times i did it never got caught once
there was little challenge here
i think they were included so they could add more time to what was actually interactive on this titleeven though the fights are few and far between it still gets old pretty quickhad i bought this one id be sorely disappointed because a dvd action movie has a cheaper price tag
squaresoft incorporated dolby digital  sound during the cinematic scenes and it sounds wonderful but again the matrix is cheaper and more entertainingthe game isnt even that challenging
ive beat the game with one character within a couple hours of booting it up and am working through with another but the storyline really doesnt change enough there are parts but its just not enough for this one to be worth much more than a couple hours of play
the local used game store had several copies of it and now i see why
theres little replay value in this onethe bouncer really makes a good showoff piece for the ps but squaresoft forgot about putting some game in there
if the cut scenes had ended up having more actual game play in between itd be a musthave for the ps collection but as it is its a mayberentthis game looks fantastic
its visually stunning and works the pss capabilities to a great extent
the sound and cinematics are nice toobut thats about where the fun stops
this is a brawling game where you get to pick one of three fighters in singleplayer mode
the controls are limited and clumsy but the buttons are pressure sensative which is kind of cool
theres not much in the way of skill heremash mash mash you knowi was excited about this game but got instantly bored when i played it for the first time
thank goodness theres a return policy at babbagesdont buy this one
its short and boringand pretty slow
not good for a fighterbrawlerwow where to begin
i popped this game into my ps after several months of sammy sosa high heat baseball   i had forgotten how crappy the triple play series had declined to but was almost immediately reminded in full as all the bad memories came back
i had to force myself to finish a season last year with tp   i finished st with  wins only because i quit trying after the allstar break to try and make it a little more competitive
i had  homeruns and  rbis with a player i created
i could mention the errors in tp  all day but wont because i am reviewing triple play for the ps
the graphics are a given as is true with every ps game so theres no need to goo goo ga ga over good graphics
the gameplay is virtually unchanged from the ps series
i cant believe with todays technology they couldnt produce a better product
i havent played the game very much because of terrible boredom so some of my facts may be inaccurate but i doubt it
the baserunning still feels like youre playing tball in kindergarten
if you hit a line drive to the wall in rightcenter most of the time your runner only gets a single because hes too slow to make it to second
not to mention that the runner on first can be thrown out at third on a ball hit to the wall that should be a standup double for the hitter and should score the guy on first with no chance of a play at the plate
instead you end up with a guy on first and third and your next batter will likely ground into a double play to end the inning which explains why you can have  runs on  hits when the game is over and batting averages over  for the season
the ai artificial intelligence is absulutely horrible
ex
the computer has a runner on second base
the hitter hits a slow roller through the left side that escapes the ss
it takes the outfielder  seconds to get to the ball which has completely stopped rolling in the outfield and the runner rounds third and goes back to third every time
every time
the runner never scores from nd on a single
the computer never steals bases
the only time you ever get a triple is when the ball is misplayed and rolls to the wall
then you almost get thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple when it should be a standup
at this point i was looking for a single sign that this game was improved from last years ps version
if there is an improvement its that you have to place the cursor on the ball when you bat
that may help control batting averages a bit
you can still get  or  hits in an inning and not score a run because of the horrible baserunning and double plays
i almost forgot
i was looking for a way to give me complete control over my baserunners and couldnt find one
so every time i hit a ball to the wall and want to run for a double the ai retreats my baserunner for me and i get one of the longest singles in baseball history
there may be a way to change that but i havent found it
nor will i because im probably not going to play it again
the game still seems very choppy
the player movements are still subpar
ex
you have  outs in the inning and you ground to the first baseman
he snags the ground ball and quickly runs to first base taps the bag and jerks back into st base position without breaking stride
he should be going to the dugout the inning is over
i havent played to game enough to know if it still freezes with  outs in the th inning
it probably does
ok the commentary
when are they going to quit saying those same stupid things that theyve been saying for years
the little stories that buck martinez tells over and over again during the same game
the sound of the game blows too
i use to play baseball and never did i hit the ball so hard that it sounded like a blast of dynamite
is this what ea sports has to resort to to make thier product more interresting
you also cant change settings in the beginning to turn the stupid soundtrack music off
it plays the same verse over and over and over again
youre ready to heave the game into the wall before you ever begin
its worse than the quotmagic carpet ridequot of last years
at least madden  allows you to turn that crap off
there are almost no options in this game
you cannot customize your gameplay
no franchise mode not that id use it anyway or customized level of play
i could easily win  of  games with an allstar setting
i think ea sports has sunk its ship with this one
the only ea sports titles even worth playing are madden and nhl and both of those have their problems
dont waste your money even renting this one
id love to have my  back
so far im not impressed with ps sports titles but their day is coming
dos high heat baseball  for ps is by far the best baseball simulation i have ever played in terms of realism and gameplay
awesome
i have heard great things about akklaims allstar baseball series for the n
i am eagerly anticipating the arrival of both but if hh  follows its predecessor closely with a few minor changes i will never need another baseball game
as for ea sports sorry but you need to get on it or get passed by your competition
you no longer reign and your reputation is headed southnow ive played the later iterations of phantasy star and i loved them
so i bought this to go with my shiny new dreamcast thinking id like this one as well
and im sure i would haveif it worked at alllet me be the one to tell you fellow shopper because no one told me to play this you need a dreamcast modem which is quite frankly impossible to find anymore a constant wired connection to a sega server and a special serial code both of which do not exist anymore unless you want to go the hacking route and use cracked codes and private servers one of which im fairly sure is still illegal and the other of which is timeconsuming and requires lots of programming knowledge
in short you can boot it up and you can look at it but there is nothing short of hacking that will allow you to play this
do not buy this is a collector piece only because it has ceased to be functionali have no idea why this game is so highly recommended by so manythe graphics are datedand i cant imagine why directx  is needed for this gamei tried very hard to enjoy it but i cant see whats there thats new or differenti hate the interfaceand have found no way to see your stack or even your own characterin a first person view you should be able to see your other party membersdecide who you like check out their skills and move them around in positionbut not possible in this worldi havent played the previous wizadry gamesand maybe if i had and come along with the story as computer technology progressedi might find it more interestingbut i dont really think soif you are looking for fast paced actiongreat graphicsand an engrossing story dont look hereall in all wizardy s only wizardry seems to have been in the pr stari guess if you spent the eighties playing wizardry this game really does it for you
for the rest of us it just doesnt cut it
the graphics are straight out of  and the control options are sad
youre forced to pivot your pov around with keyboard keys like a tank turret which completely kills any feeling of suspense
the character development within your party looked promising but thats not enough to cary the dated game play
i cant believe companies make games like this and put them on shelves next to modern titles and expect to make moneythere are a number of people like myself experiencing a slowdown bug that makes the games all but unplayable
every few seconds the game will pause for a  second or so
you might want to wait until a patch is released that fixes this annoying problem
check the publishers message boards for more info regarding this known annoyance
when i get this game working im sure my rating will be  stars once im able to run this game as what ive seen and heard have been greatthe first thing that comes to mind when a reviewer claims a game is terrible is probably oh yeah mister smarty pants you better be able to back up why you think mega man x is such a bad game
i will try my best
first of all the gameplay
being a mega man fan since  i grew up with the original dr wily and the x series
i love both
people constantly pick which one they think is better but in the end i always found shooting robots incredibly fun and i still find it rewarding and addicting to play through a mega man game over and over searching for the very best way to blast through a stage and eliminate the enemies along with finding the best way to defeat the boss at the end of the stage
mega man is mainly supposed to be a sidescroller shooter
that is the most important thing sorry big words make it easier to get my point acrosswhat does mega man x do
it mostly abandons the need to really use your xblaster for anything important except for the stage bosses
it makes me absolutely sick to my stomach sorry the big words need to return that capcom chose to make at least half of the stages almost completely empty
i dont know the name of the stage but the forest level has almost nothing to shoot
you basically spend the entire time in this level just dashjumping your way through until you arrive to the end boss
oh okay there are a couple things to shoot
lazilydesigned and completely unmemorable bad guys are featured inside this forest stage did i mention the backgrounds are blandlooking
when you arrive to these enemies i think one of them is some kind of robotic plant but i may be wrong you actually have to wait a few seconds for them to shoot something uncreative and boring at you which incidentally does very little damage
why am i waiting for a slowpoke enemy to shoot something at me
and in a mega man game where speed and avoiding attacks is supposed to be the key to completing the game
boring
anyone who tries defending the stage enemies in this game is going to have an extremely tough timei wish that forest stage was the only problem with mega man x but sadly its just the beginning
i cant stand this game
i cant stand the fact that capcom removed every single thing i love about the mega man series
its like the company has something personal against mewhat to talk about next okay everybody hates the fact that the stage bosses are named after guns n roses band members
this doesnt really bother me even though i passionately hate guns n roses and think they are nothing but a sorry aerosmith imitator rock band with a whiny overrated lead singer
i hate the fact that every stage boss can be defeated with just your xbuster
remember how important it was in past games to find the right weapon to successfully destroy the end boss
not now
each stage boss has ugly and lazy animations and they move across the screen so slowly that its very easy to just continue shooting at them with the xbuster while avoiding their lazy slow attacks
believe it or not all eight stage bosses can be defeated this way
so much for strategy
what a worthless gamewhenever capcom tries to make a mega man game tell a good story the gameplay suffers as a result
this game is the biggest offender
the worst part is that they removed the cutscenes you were introduced to in mega man x
now you have to scroll through boring text as the characters have their boring conversations building no suspense whatsoever during critical moments
lengthy and frequent textscrolling is what x is all aboutoh and lets not forget that capcom just threw in a bunch of new friends to help guide mega man through the game
i highly doubt anyone cares about these characters because capcom just put them in the game and expected us to care about them without any kind of interesting history or connections to other mega man games
doesnt work that way
even if they were returning characters from the wily series it wouldnt have bothered me
the fact is these new characters are a bunch of nobodys and even when you beat the game they will remain nobodysspeaking of characters guiding you through the game your female friend alia insults your intelligence numerous times throughout the game
while you dash and shoot your way through each of the eight unmemorable stages that is when you actually arrive to something worth shooting she will constantly appear on screen to bug you and tell you exactly what it is you have to do
this means more inconvenient textscrolling
sometimes she interferes with your progress so often that you just wish there was a way to shoot and kill her
its incredibly annoying
after finding out how disappointing x turned out to be the last thing you want to do is put up with someone like alia basically calling you a moronalia insults your intelligence by telling you to do very simple things that anyone with any past experience with a mega man game would be able to understand without needing any pointless instructions
she actually has the nerve to say things like jump over that wall
i think we already knew that
why
because weve had to do the same thing many times in the previous four x games and many times in the wily games
were not dumb
the challenge in each stage ranges from very easy to incredibly difficult which is quite surprising to me because the challenge in past x games was a lot more consistent
the already mentioned forest stage is worthlessly boring but more specifically a cakewalk
however the flipside to that are really frustrating stages that require excellent fastmoving timing in order to complete
so throughout the game you will go from incredibly simple stages where you dont even have to shoot at anything to incredibly difficult stages where you are sure to die many times until you get it perfectly right
i like fun mega man games
not this inconsistent messthe game becomes almost excruciatingly difficult when you arrive to the very first stage in sigmas castle
the stage is ripped off completely from the quick man stage in mega man   remember jumping down and avoiding those laser beams
same thing
in this game trying to complete this task is much harderat least three stage themes are pretty good
thats it
thats the only thing mega man x has going for it
oh and speaking of music the theme in one stage is just an updated version of the water stage theme from mega man x
i especially hate this stage because its one of those stages where the screen pushes you to the right and you have no control over it
you are forced to go with the flow while avoiding shots from a giant underwater robot
so much for fastpace shootingdashing action
i hate this underwater stage more than the previously mentioned forest stage
at least with the forest stage i can go duh and daydream my way through the empty thing
stare at the ceiling while you play through the forest stage
i bet you can make it to the end bosslook i love capcom and think theyre a wonderful company that does a fantastic job with action games but they really screwed up with mega man x
please avoid
i cant be angry at a company that gave us so many good games but when a game is rushed to the market and i believe no creativity or effort whatsoever was involved during the process of creating the game it has to be mentioned
thats what i did just now
told you why mega man x is so freakin awful
a lazy and unremarkable experience
the game has no lifeevery company has their bad games and this is clearly the bad game from capcom
just pick up mega man x to find out what a really good action game should be like
i can only imagine what x must be likei just received my dracula  game from  today
thats the good news
when you open the box the only thing inside is the jewel case which contains the two cds and the worlds shortest quotmanualquotthere appears to be no way to change the resolution settings color settings sound or anything else
or remap the keyboard
keyboard
there is nothing in the quotmanualquot which shows keyboard assignments
how do you move forward
who knows
backwards
run walk or jump
who knows
want to use mouse invert
sorry about thathaving played pc games for a couple of years now i am conditioned to the fact that youre gonna get  sometimes and this is one of those times
think of it this way  i get to have turkey in april because dracula  the last sanctuary is a turkey and its not even thanksgiving yetwelcome to the worlds most boring game
when i ran this game for the first time i was very impressed with an introductory movie that was very long detailed and creepy
i couldnt wait to start playing to see more of that
however once i started playing i was dissappointed with this game and its oversimplicitythere are only certain places that you can move to
want to go check out that dark corner over there
forget it you cant
you can turn around  degrees but only move in one direction go figure
you collect different items and solve different puzzles and thats all this game really is
its a pretty puzzle game
there are no special effects and no movement by the monsters
they just stand there and grunt at younot to mention this game is so pathetically easy that my four year old son could play it with no problems at alldont buy this gamefirst i want to say that i am a huge baseball fan and that wsb k was completely underrated and k is equally overrated
k had hands down the best graphics ive ever seen in a sports game
the pitching and batting of all players was right on the money a perfect  full motion breaking pitches looked so sharp you could even see the seams
while the fielding was automatic the plays looked realistic and had full motion and extreme detail
the editor was fabulous too although i wouldnt mind changing the height and weight too
its wrong to call k a failure an example of failure would be all  baseball games on ps because if only the fielding were changed to manual that would have been the greatest game of all time
meanwhile in k i lost hope
to start the graphics arent even close to k pitching and batting motion is strange even cartoon like
also pitches dont break at all a fastball looks just like a screwball
batting stances arent correct especially bonds and balls outside the strike zone are still strikes
to continue yes you have manual fielding but a normal  double play is almost impossible because it seems as though everyone is as fast as maurice green
plus the fielders dive way too far but at least they can jump
to add to that the editor is weak too
you cant even change the faces pitching stance or batting stance so its all a clone team
then to top that off as the gm whos suppose to have control cant even trade half the people you want to because of no trade contracts
thats poor
hitting is far too difficult and in  player mode you cant even hide your pitch
the only pluses i can give are exceptional commentary online play and home run derby
this game needs much improvementi did not enjoy the controls on this game
the only entertaining part with the somewhat nudity that came with the game
you know what they say sex sells
well if that was their only selling point then i wont hold my breath for the next one
i would rather get a girlie mag for excitement
definatly not for kids
i must say though this is the first game i put down in one day
i gave batman and robin a  day chance before i put that one downthis is a comic book
with too much plot
endless pages of text dialog you must scroll through before getting to even a very short action sequence
even the action is dull and has too much dialog
after a while i quit reading and just kept pushing the buttons to get through the text and get to some action
if youre looking for action  look elsewhereif you buy a game for graphics then this is a game to buy
however if you buy a game for game play then this is not the game for you
dont be fooled by other peoples reviews well over half the game is movie and i for one did not buy the playstation  to watch movies
the entire game you just run from one movie to the next never really doing anything except maybe picking up a key
the problem solving is very simple as well so simple in fact that it took me an afternoon to complete the game my total time was like a little over  hours
save your money and dont buy this cheese fest of a gamei remember playing this game when i was very young at my brothers friends house and i was addicted to it
i have fond memories of it and wanted to play it again but good lord how how did i play this when i was little
its very annoying
you cant save your progress if memory serves right i havent played it in a while though still have it and it automatically saves as you progress through the game
well for me i dont know what happened i was at one part of the game progressed and then the timer kept running out before i could even walk anywhere and the character dies
so this means i have to start the whole entire game over again because each time i load my saved progress the a few seconds and boom im dead
grrbut other than that the plot is just plain amazing
if youve watched and are a fan of the anime full metal alchemist youll probably love this
the main character is basically trying to defy his fate of death trying to find out who it is who keeps trying to kill him
during your quest youll find some ties to the scientific religion of alchemy and meet a lovely woman who somehow becomes involved in this scheme
every choice you make in the game determines the ending if memory serves right there are  alternate endingsi wouldnt quote me on that
you must travel to different times some quite distant
and defy your fate
i do adore the game and the plot but argh its so frustratingsnore fest
maybe this would have been fun in  but here in  this game is a bore
youre limited to  weapons and this has a very s arcade feel to it only even more lame
this game is a wast of time and effort
pass on this onethis is the worst shooter game i have ever played
weapons are pathetic movement is akward and aiming is purely painful
when i see the name koie on any other game i will certainly know not to by it
seeing the  star average rating on this site makes me think that most of these reviews are bogus
 has anyone ever seen a game with a poor rating on this site
i have not
this game diffenitly deserves a zero
it disgusts me that there are games of this crappy nature allowed on the market
give me a breakso get this i play this game on normal the second to last level
meaning one more and it was the final boss
i went through hellthe game has you go through really tough things and really boring environments
the hard part of the game is really the backtracking
i never needed a strategy guide but jeez man what is this
once i got underground i had to backtrack like  timesso the second to final level had me going under lasers again
after i narrowly got by the lasers i had to go on a catwalk to a small room
there was no cover across the catwalk and it was easy to die
i ran across for my life to the room which was to the right of the catwalk
right when i step in the room a missle comes at me and i lose all of my health and my place
i had to restart from before the lasersthe games mechanics are fine the bots are boring though
the longer you play the more times the nuclear bomb thingy goes off
it went off once during my whole time and that was right before getting to the undergroundthe game itself is boring
i hated bactracking and i hated how the enemies always had the upperhand
it was relatively easy somewhat but powerups and life refills were hard to find so alot of the time i was at low health knee deep in baddiesagain the backtracking is horrible
but also the lasers
my gosh you have to avoid these lasers on a roof and at the second to last level
the lasers are hard to get by
you have to do split second reactionsyou can only save once a level is complete so get ready to make commitments
you cant reload from continues so you better finish that levelagain i hate this game for making the second to last level so hard
honestly keep the level of difficulty at medium
how hard is it to make the game easier
koei decided to make all that time i spent worthless o and there was no way to beat the guy with the rocket launcher unless i had thousands of health or a cheat on
i will never cheat so that is thatany team can become the champs of all the teams
you can be the darn expos and be about  games above  the sliders break too much and the curveballs are just between a change up and a fastball
the first one you throw is always awesome
acclaim needs to make the game a little harder
the batting stances are outta wack
the brewers my favorite team is underratedof course
with good players you hit  homeruns a year
on the back of the box they say franchise debut but there is no franchise once you end it youll never play it again  just the first part of soulreaver its quothalf a gamequot we as the consumer should sue them for making   not   percent of a game well it seems that you cant trust konami
they come out with great games like metal gear solid but also produce junk like this
the demo disc well its worth it but you can buy the game now
the gameplay is horrible
its just a giant robot collding into other robots in order for them to explode
wow
and that awful awful awful soundtrack
bad techno with a singer whos genitals were ripped open by fishing knives
the voice acting stunk espicially leobad game
dont waste your timea great way to waste  or how about 
this game has little to no graphics gameplay is nothing anyone should want it lags all the time even in story hows that supposed to work dont ask me and the only good thing about it is that you can outfit your charactercons  almost everythingpros  the outfitterthis is an absolutely horrible game
the first thing you notice though fairly trivial is that the graphics are bad
theres no changing the resolution or the color depth so it runs at what appears to be x or something with a very low color depth
everythings grainy with banding due to lack of colorthe next biggest problem is that the navigation is terrible
you move forward by clicking when you randomly pass the cursor over the right spot and the cursor turn to the right shape
but to turn you either have to use the cursor keys which do an instantaneous turn instead of a pan so its hard to hold an image in your head of where you are or you click and push the mouse in the direction you want to turn instead of clicking and dragging the window in that direction and the pan is so fast you cant see the scenery go by
theres no cursor change in those cases
then if you can look up or down the only indication you have is a change to an icon down below the scene in your inventory
plus the cursor shape indicating a possible path is very easy to confuse as to where its really pointing
in some cases clicking forward will turn you  degrees before proceeding to take you somewhere nowhere near where it looked like it would take you
in other cases you think its pointing somewhere youve been but its not so you miss a path
you end up watching the cursor and thinking about the mechanics of movement instead of looking at the scenery and tying to figure out whats going on
also irritating is that once you click to go forward it will stop at multiple nonsignificant spots even on straight nondivertable paths
so you spend time sweeping the cursor over everything in every direction wondering whats so important that the game stopped you herebut the biggest problem is the puzzles themselves
the charitable description would be that theyre impossibly hard
a more accurate description is that theres neither rhyme nor reason to them
in some cases theres no indication that a device is a puzzle and not just a static display
if you dont have a necessary inventory item you cant do anything and theres no indication that you could ever do anything in it
if you have some random inventory item that it expects it just changes the cursor in the right place if you happen to cross the spot and you drop it on
in others the puzzle is so vague that youre not even sure what youre supposed to be doing with it or why
then you have to work your way through multiple noneasilywritten notation systems or phonetics
in my case i uninstalled the game when it became obvious that it wanted me to reproduce some long string of barely heard nonphoneticallywriteable backgroundnoisefilled alien speech on a set of devices strewn in four or six places about a very large roomimpossible
not fun in the least
do not under any circumstances buy this gamei love strategy gamesi still play civ master of orion ctpand remember others fondlythis isnt one of themthis one is just a lame gameits slow
game play is close to nonexistentconquest is not fun but tediousmarching a group of your soldiers from one of your towns to another and a significant percentage of them will diesame with sailing your ships
if you had  ships and sailed them from england to germany how many would you reasonably expect to make this short voyage
how many if you controlled all the coastal regions in northern europe
if you think all your ships should typically manage to sail for an entire day without sinking your vision does not agree with this gameas i said its a very lame gamesave your money for civ or arcanumeu is heartbreakingly close to being one of the best computer games ever produced
economics religion warfare diplomacy and exploration have never been so successfully integrated
as several people have pointed out however the manual and tutorial are woefully inadequate for such a complex game
youll find yourself learning this game largely by blind trial and error
but i could live with that given this games many other terrific features
the thing that destroyed my interest in eu is the fact that this game cheats outrageously in combat
it is not uncommon to lose battles even when you outnumber the ais forces by  or more
you can spend gamedecades building up your armies and planning campaigns only to watch your entire empires armed forces get brutalized by inferior numbers of inferior troops
as long as you never fight another major power youre fine but should you become involved in a war with another power expect to do a lot of saveandrestoreing to counteract the senseless combat resolution
in my opinion the game is not playable in its current statethis one of the worst games i have purchased for my computer
i have well over 
 the tutorial is worthless
it tells you to perform a certain function but it doesnt tell you how to do it or why to do it
 the manual although chock full of information is terrible
i guess it would be ok if you are using it as resource material for a masters thesis in history
all in all i have to say ive wasted my  but hey itll make a nice coaster for my beer glassive played and liked and usually loved every sid meier gamethis one is not on the same page as civ etcpoor graphicspoor balanceabsolutely horrid game playthis is one annoying stinkerthis is one of the rare games that makes me wish that i could return softwarethis game is exactly like tetris
so dont get this gameim good at puzzle games and i like them
but this is too hard
getting  sword will be hard for beginners or any gamers
you must have to have the stragety guide memorized in your brain to beat this
you should not ever get a zelda gameunless youre up for the challenge
dont get thisthis game is the worst of the three
messy aweful games and same characters
dont buythis is by far the worst game i have ever played on any system
i dont see how anyone could think this game is fun
the graphics are not good the map would be better off not even there and the glitches in the game should not even be an issuebut they are besides the fact that the game freezes up running into objects is annoying enough to make you want to snap your controller in half
please dont anyone buy this game and hope that they dont try to waste anyones time with a sequelone of the first things you do when you begin serious development of a generalmarket software product consider the system configurations that it could work with and make it compatible with as many of those as possible without sacrificing tons of featuresthat isnt how microsoft did things though when creating the train simulator softwarethis product just wont run on my relatively new pc  which was designed for high performance gaming
even after repeated attempts to work with microsoft support no luckand after hearing and reading several other users difficulties im convinced that microsoft made some basic mistakes on the development of this productdespite their claims to have designed this for a wider audience than the hardcore gamer microsoft has released a product that does require more configuration twiddling than should be performed when installing a pc gameand purchase of a new video or sound card shouldnt be a requirement for getting a product like this to work eitherit is a shame too
because this simulator seems to have so much to offeri was really hoping to have hours of fun with thisbut ill have to wait for a more robust product from someone elsedont get me wrong i love trains but i think that this game is just terrible
the graphics are merely ok nothing amazing
microsoft in my opinion tried to make this game way to realistic where it goes beyond fun and becomes a job
also ts  gets so boring and dull after about  minutes that you will most likely wish to return it
overal the game in my opinion is a disaster but if you are a hard core sim fan maybe you will enjoy mtsas a huge fan of microsoft software i regret to say this is the lowest quality ever sold by them
microsoft even skimped on the software packaging
just a cheap cd envelope and brochure type key card
the software has a somewhat unfinished feel to it
the scenery and models are extremely simple and plain
i attempted  installations with this software and my computer has not been the same since
i strongly urge anyone to wait for a few versions to come before paying for train simulator
if this were any item other than software it would go right back to the store to be returned
for microsoft shame on you
i am now a skeptical microsoft buyer
long live qualityi picked this game up because it was cheap and happened to be one of the few adventure games i didnt already own
it was a waste money
this most awful computer game ive ever played
the storyline is boring and confusing and the graphics and voice acting are terrible
its an excruciatingly slow game to get through not because its hard but because it takes forever to get from point a to point b and then you have to listen to some awful dialogue for a while
the puzzle i had the most problem with in the game was the one where you had to light torches in a dark tunnel
you cant go on to the next stretch of tunnel until you light the torch in that area and its impossible to see anything
i was reduced to searching the screen with my cursor until i could find a spot where the game would allow me to use my matches
it wasnt hard to figure out what i had to do but actually doing it was another matter
save youself the frusteration and boredom and buy some other game
whatever else you might get itll probably be better than this game
if its worse you have my sympathythis game was enjoyable for the first two hours and then its fun factor quickly went down hill
it is far too complicated to figure out the right combination of car color license plate etc that is needed to race the different groups
for japanese street racing geeks that is probably their idea of great fun but its not mine
i regret buying this gameyou people rating this game  or  starts wouldnt know a good game if somebody slapped you in the face with it
this game is a disgrace they should have kept it on the almostextinct dreamcastthere is absolutly no point to this game
i wasted three bucks from renting down at my local video store when i was bored one after noon
this game is the same thing over and over and over again
and theres no point to playing because you cant open anything its already all open
so save your money and go buy a good game for the same price like final fantasy xthis game is the pits
its the worst mario game ever
even worse than mario pros nice graphicscons makes you madder than the mad hatterterrible gameplaytoo hardsuper mario advance  is better than thisat least it has the classic super mario world which is really awesome but this like balh
get the nd version
youll like it more than thisthe original gba is an eyekiller because its screen is so dark
even though the lcd is activematrix you cant see much even under the best lighting conditions
get the new sp edition instead it has builtin frontlighti bought this a few years ago because i sold mygame boy advance sp classic nes limited editionsince i bought anintendo ds lite onyx blackand later came across some of my old gb color and black and white games i thought i lost in a move
this is crap compared to agame boy advance sp classic nes limited editionsystem or any gba sp
the screen is so dark on this original gba system i have to shine several lights on it to see the screen and sometimes the glare of the lights makes it even more difficult to see the screen
just stick with a ds or an gbasp system to play gba gamesthere is absolutely no point buying a gba
its the same thing as a game boy only the thing is shaped different
bit
do yourself a favor and dont buy thisthis is the third official version of fzero
there are hacks claiming to be fzero  but there are only three games in the series fzero snes fzero x n  fzero maximum velocity gba
fzero is a relatively simple concept it is all about a space race
each vehicle is equipped with a jet propulsion system and magnetic stabilizers
you race down the tracks at speeds exceeding mph
racers from all over the galaxy come to compete
once you are on the track anything goes
other racers can even push you off the track and to your deathi was rather pleased with the feel of the game
the whirr of the engines was well done for this limited audio power on the gba
collision sfx did lack in the sense that they sounded more like someone sneezing
the cityscape presented on the  earlier tracks was well preserved from the snes version
the vehicles have a new take on appearance
these are nicely rendered in d when you select your machine however in game racing uses a very dulled down version of the cg models featured in the vehicle select screen
the track does spin nicely and appears to have slight usage of a d enginei was disappointed with the actual control of the game
racing is very difficult to control
it seems the slightest tap will send you ricocheting from wall to wall
this became increasingly annoying when i was trying to place
the recharge ports are also too small to really regain any energy
by the time you are finished being bounced around on the track you have already passed your chance to recharge
there is definitely a high learning curve in this out of control worldi did not like the game
i enjoyed the first two fzero games fzero x more than the original
fzero maximum velocity just seems to take more time to learn than i am really willing to put forward
i do not recommend this to newbies of the series
if you have played previous installments you may find value here but as for myself once tossed around twice shyi dont want to waste too much time on this crappy game  its just not good at all and its pretty funny how everyone keeps saying its good just because other people and game review sites say it is
maybe its because this game was made years ago before better games came along
whatever
nothing sets this game apart as fun or special be it graphics or gameplay or storyill be frank
i purchased this game because it was cheap and i miss the old doom shootem ups so i was feeling a bit nostalgic
but i must say that red faction is not a very good game
the graphics look like something from super nintendo the controls will definitely get you wacked if the monkey enemies disquised as humans dont kill you first and the character voices
my god i though i was hearing people talk through a pillow being stuffed in their faces
purely awfulthis game is a steaming pile of  that stepping in may cost you  luckily it only cost me the simpsons and wrestling are two of the most popular shows on tv today and two of the few shows that i make sure to catch every episode ofevery week
now some marketing genius knows that the psx is in dire need of a simpsons title but they know none of the simpsons games made under the acclaim license were really any good except for the immortal simpsons arcade gamethey figure hey simpsons and pro wrestling the kids will love it
the problem is any kid in their right mind will not love this
as far as pro wrestling goes this is not it at all
steaming burps massive weapons coming out of nowhere jumping  feet across a ringthe graphics are downright ugly
the characters look all wavy and messed up
they tried to make a d simpsons and wound up with a very dish cartoony game that wouldnt stand on  bit standardsthe gameplay is not there not there at all button mashing on top of button mashing will not get anything to work in this game if you rent this without a manual youll be doubly confusedthe sound is not as bad but not good at all small voice sampling and really really unfunny clips its the actual tv show voices but they sound like theyve been clipped from episodes and put together for the gamethere is no replay value because it stinks its pitifuli rented this game and i want my  back on top of money for all the distress and punitive damages that this game has put upon memay god have mercy on the souls of the people at activision who made this stinker this is the company that made tony hawk spiderman and vigilante 
the thing that really irks me is that some of the best games ever have been cartoony takes on sports
like punchout and ready  rumble for boxing fans and mario kart for racing fans so on and so forthhowever if you want a wrestling title for your playstation i recommend smackdown  thq did a great job with everything except the graphics on it and the arenas look good it smacks of fun and replay valueif you want a good simpsons title email the folks at activision and tell them to make the simpsons racing game for gcn and ps not stink characters
more like  and its not even wrestling its smacking each other around with pinning
dont buy it itll only kill your love of the simpsons
it only got a star because the dialouges are funnythis game is nothing more then a mindless filler
a secondrate smackdown vs raw ripoff
the story is stupid as heck
the garphics look like they were made by a drunk  year old
its very gimmacky and cartoony to say the least
i give this game a  out of i couldnt even get through the first level
the graphics arent d but thats okay because the colors are awesome
i dont like the levels and the powers you can get
it seems very boring for me to go around and punch cages and weirdbad guys
the levels are really bad and its too hard
not a good gba gameill be quick and to the pointthis game is not final fantasy
did i mention its also bad
the story music and gameplay is as flat as the cartrige its made on
saga frotier has been wildly praised as the worst squaresoft game ever produced and its no wonder why
the only reason it came here as final fantasy is because they figured thats the only way it would sell
my advice skip this gamethe final fantasy legend games are a perfect example of the gameboys limits which makes the game unplayable for me save your money and buy final fantasy   or this is a quest through the jungles of south america you are an explorer equipped with a short whip a sling slingshot and a boomerang against a jungle of animated snakes spiders deadly plants quick sand annoying monkeys and so on
the controls first of all are annoying having b as the jump button and a as the attack l as the boomerang and r as the sling
then next the background graphics are so needlessly detailed that you can hardly tell what is part of the level and what is part of the background
the animations are cartoonish and annoying because its impossible to lets say do a small jump the player will always takes huge leaps
the levels are very large and detailed each has a different theme but there are traps where you can actually fall from the end of a level back to the beginning and have to do it all over again making the game very tedious and frustrating
if you want a fun game along this genre take a look at the gameboy advance game lady sia
its also very unfortunate that i have given this game one star because i have never given anything one starthe game looks good on paper but its very difficult to play
the missions are pretty much all the same and the controls are very difficult and you cant really see your enemy even on the backlit screen of the gba sp
avoidthis game was one of the sorriest game boy advance games i have purchased
its not the sorriest and that belongs to metal botsvery simple building of a tetris castle
biggest challenge is determining what shape is falling after your castle gets higher and the piece is hidden behind the score
graphics are very simple music also simple
after an hour of playing youve seen it all
nearly all atari  games have more complexity and game play
the l and r buttons are reversed you push the r button to scroll to the leftfortress is definitely an odd spin on the old tetris formula
you start by dropping blocks to create a fortress
instead of eliminating lines as done in the classic tetris assembling a  by  grouping of  blocks will create a solid stone
after completing a predetermined amount of your quotfortressquot  you will be given a catapult piece
this piece will be used to attack your opponents fortressat first the game appeared to be a tetris clone
i started stacking blocks between two flag poles
this seemed rather easy to me until the flag poles started to move then it got a little frustrating
after blocks started fusing together i started to get the general idea
the enemy began firing at my fused blocks within the first minute of play
i realized at this point i probably should have read the manual before playingthe second time playing fortress  the point behind the game still eluded me
granted i was now stacking blocks like a pro  but this time the bombardment still continued as scheduled
no matter what i do the game will not allow you to build a castle and completely defend it
i equate this game to building a sandcastle on the beach
lets say you build it in the tide
every time a wave comes along it destroys a part of what you made so therefore you can never complete your castle
you keep doing this until frustration sets in and you quit all togetheri do not recommend this game to anyone
fortress is a poor attempt to modify the tetris formula
this game fails to entertain on any level
unless you need a paper weight skip this titlea little while back i bought this game at a store for  because i thought it looked fun and it seemed at the time to look alot like worms armageddon which i really enjoy
when i got home i hated to say that i wasted that money
this game is not appealing to me although it may be fun to some who are tetris fans since this somewhat resembles that  but thats what i found odd because i liked tetris  but this made me yawn after  minutes of gameplay
there only few levels and you just have to make a large building and blast down your opponents building
you cannot even shoot when you want to
all that you do is stack and then lay back and watch the slow combat take place
well i hope i am not the only one who doesnt care for this game
i dont know what was on the creators mind when they were making this but i dont think they succeeded in making a great game
onestarrating is a little harsh butthis just isnt a game for methis game does not do any justice to castlevania because the games dark ambience is totally destroyed by gbas poor screen
dont even think about playing the game under anything other than ideal lighting conditions
you just wont be able to see much on the screen
i was foolish enough to buy the game to play on my subway commute but boy was it a true nightmarethe gameplay itself is classic
you scroll to explore the environments so its very easy to play
konami should have lightened up the display and made the game gbafriendly
then i would have given it a threestar or higherdragon ball z budokai is horrible
the graphics are ok but the gameplay is slow
im not a big dragon ball z fan but i do like good fighting games and this is not one of them
i would not recommend buying this game if you are dbz fan then you might want to rent iti dont own this game
but  ive seen it played on a ps i own an xbox
overall i was unimpressed
the graphics look old and the towns crackling with pixelation
kind of like the games i was used to on our old computersnothing compared to the smooth defined glow of the graphics burnout  has on xbox
you start with total crap for a car and are supposed to build up as you break into the underground
really you go crawling around in your tank  it says youre going  but it looks like youre going  honest i could imagine one of the pedestrians grabbing a skateboard and keeping up with the carsin burnout  you literally rocket through the levels flying at crazy speeds weaving in and out of traffic
gets you excited
i watched someone drive their car in midnight around for a while and about fell asleepplus no car damage or not much
the old school shove others out of the way my cars invincible gagmaybe its just me
maybe burnout  spoiled me or i just have alternate tastes
but i dont get why so many gamers stand behind subpar games
silent hill  was supposed to be good  crap
halo  perhaps the biggest game ever was hyped to the max  bor ring
maybe im just got particular tastes in games that i just have to realize for ive been disappointed recentlywant good games i suggest burnout  wolfenstein for a shooter its okay and mortal kombat deception bloody good fun
but i dont recommend this
ughsorry dont buy this game
the idea of a cell shaded racre is cool all the hype the pictures and the new challenger to gran tourismo are completely false
you have zero control of your car around corners braking sends your car into some crazy wobble across the track until you slow down enough to go straight with added sfx of something reminisent of opening the door to your home on a very windy day and not closing it right
i was stupid  i bought it full price when it came out and hated it the second i got going
music sucks tracks suck sound sucks  cars look cool but overall  it sucksdont waste  let alone  on this heap of steaming stuffthis game sucks
if you want a truly disturbing game play the  fatal frames on psoka cutscene here and there oka cutscene every freakin time you move that goes on for  minutes is not fun
my save game is clocked at  hours and im sure i only played about  or  of those hours
and when i was playing all i was doing was running around
how in gods name did you all give this game a 
you want a good game thats similart to this get shadow hearts preferably  its a thousand times better
after playing that youll wonder how the hell you ever gave this  stars therefore convincing me to buy this awful gamei had more fun playing the xenocard game than i did with the rest of it
and even that i got bored withi have been waiting for this title to come out for a long time but sadly im disgusted with how this game plays and looks
if im not mistaken this company is creating edited
if thats the case its not a good showing for what to expect
the graphics on shell shock look a few years old the movement of the character is slow and rough
and the overall feel for the game is boring
compare this game to edited theres no comparisons
this is a definite tradein and title to forgetladies and gentlemen be warned
this game is a popular series that has until this point been very enjoyable
but treyarch has seriously lost their touch
spiderman  starts out as a wonderful game the ability to visit street level and foil everyday crimes around the city is awesome
but the level bosses fights that you must complete to move on are terribly designed
one level mysterios burning theatre is impossibly difficult simply because of the terrible web slinging controls the game has employed
another level statue of liberty is so bad that youll want to return the game
this game deserves no honors whatsoever since the designers spent too much time trying to do cool things rather than making it playable
go back to the older spiderman games and youll enjoy yourself a lot moresonic d blast is quite different from the d sonic games on genesis
instead of running through zones to get to eggman sonic has to rescue birds called flickies from eggmans robots to proceed
im fine with rescuing birds even if it is a bit strange although the idea was also in sonic adventure
what i do not like about the game is how weak it is
the graphics are not in d at all they are simply set at an  overhead view similar to zelda and super mario rpg
they are good for the genesis but if you want to see better consider getting the saturn version
the soundtrack is weak repeats a lot and normally does not fit the zones very well
again if you want an amazing musical score you should get the saturn port
after the terrible music was muted i found the controls were very slippery
i tried it with the standard dpad and found it was almost impossible to change direction
using a joystick is not much better
the controls aside from not having a proper configuration have bad traction
along with the dreadful music and controls is the boss fights
eggman has been and always will be a wimp but he hardly is trying in d blast
normally it is the terrain that supplies the hazards while eggman flys around shooting something at youhonestly i am a huge sonic fan but i can not stand this game
if anything you should buy the saturn version or just play a real d game like sonic adventurei dont like this game
the st one is better
this one sucks
i expect more from the blue sky teamconsidering how much ive hated and continue to hate regular mortal kombat  since it was first released almost  years ago it was only natural that i would also have a strong dislike for ultimate mortal kombat  but if youve never seen any of my other reviews for other mortal kombat games heres why i really hate this game ultimate mortal kombat  was the beginning of the end for the series because this is the game that started the trend of having way too many unnecessary mortal kombat games on the market making everyone who used to enjoy the series sick to death of it the actual fighting in this game is exactly the same as in mortal kombat  which means i hate it
its like the company knew how much i hated the direction they took the mortal kombat series starting with the third installment so they decided to create more or less the same game but with old familiar fighters returning
they did this on purpose to annoy me
if the actual fighting stinks it doesnt matter who returns
its like midway knew they made a mistake with the original mortal kombat  by introducing people to a list of allnew fighters but they somehow didnt realize that adding combos and a run button was the main reason mortal kombat  was such an awful game in the first place
so running around delivering combos is still here
bad move i hate when something is supposed to be the complete package but instead when you play the game you find out that a bunch of things are missing
thats exactly what we have with this game
its sort of like opening up a christmas present to find nothing but styrofoam chips inside
okay the game isnt as bad as waking up christmas morning and being insulted with an empty box but stillit would be best to never even think about touching this gameyou should have seen the look of disappointment on my face when i first played mortal kombat  i actually received the game a day before its official release
my dads exgirlfriend found a copy of it somewhere and bought it for me
while that was a nice unexpected thing for her to do i really dont like the gamei hate mortal kombat  not only because many of the classic fighters of the past arent included but for another major reason the actual fighting sucks
i absolutely despise the fact that combos have been added to the mortal kombat series
nothing more irritating than doing really well in a fight only for the computer to suddenly get this amazing burst of energy and charge at me with devastating combo after devastating combo
that right there ruins the game completelyspeaking of combos actually being able to pull one off is almost impossible thanks to the way the game company designed the combo system
they made it so you have to press a bunch of buttons exactly the right way at exactly the right time or else the combo wont work
yeah ill really have time to properly do that in the middle of a fightthe fatalities are horriblelooking
they look really cheap
the fatalities in mortal kombat  are graphic and bloody but the ones in this game are terrible because they are so darn cheesylooking
they arent as violent as youd expect them to be in a mortal kombat game
in fact the amount of blood in the game went down considerably
a little wave of blood splashes from your opponents body when you punch or kick them and i hate it so much
its almost like a normal fighting game
if it didnt say mortal kombat on the box you wouldnt even know you were playing a mortal kombat gamei hate the fact that they modernized the levels so you can fight your opponent on the city streets with buildings and other normallooking things in the background
i have news for you every fighting game features a city level
i thought the people behind mortal kombat were more creative than to copy what everyone else is doing
i guess notbut the one thing that makes the game worthless in my opinion is the fact that there seems to be a bug in the game that makes the computer really cheapshot you after you win just one fight in the tournament
for instance lets say you start a tournament with liu kang and you have the game on easy mode
you defeat your very first opponent in two straight rounds and move on to the next fight
no problem right
suddenly for no reason at all the next opponent will rip you to shreds with combos and other things giving you no time at all to respond
you lose both rounds and have to do the fight again
remember this is on easy modelets say you try it again with liu kang or anyone you want
for some reason now the fight is easy
now the computer isnt throwing combo after combo at you and now you can complete the fight without much of a problem
you beat your opponent in two simple rounds and move on to the next fighter
guess what
the insane cheapshotting has returned and in a matter of seconds you die in two rounds
youre shocked and confused that the game has turned into insane mode
time to hit the continue button
you pick liu kang as your playable character again nah lets make it kabal this time
guess what
the fight is back to easy
your opponent is dead in two roundsyou cant understand why the tournament fighting bounces back and forth between easy and insanely difficult
after all you put the game on easy it should be easy
the next opponent you have to face yup you guessed it nearly impossible to defeat him until you die and try it again
do you see the pattern here
after you beat an opponent easily in two rounds the next fight will be just the opposite with you having to face an extremely challenging fighter and most likely you will not be able to beat him
but the next time you face him he will be easy
do you see why the tournament is so frustrating
you win you die you win you die and the tournament will keep going like this until eventually you run out of continues and therefore die
no way can you put a positive spin on thisthats the dumbest and cheapest thing ive ever seen in a fighting game and thats the main reason i hate mortal kombat  more than any other game
at the very least when you enter a tournament on easy mode it should start off easy and gradually build to a challenge by the time the final opponent rolls around
not any of this easy this fight impossible the next fight crapavoid mortal kombat  forevermk  and mk  were pure gold
mk adds some cool characters but it totally sucks
the ai makes this game nearly unbearable they are super nazi cheese kings that know your every move before you even do it and magically avoid your moves and counter everything in a quick and cheese bs fest manner that the player con not come close to doing
the unfair level in this game makes it only fun playing two players
the bosses are unfair cheese lords too
this just sucks other than the new cyber ninjas nothing to care for herethe saturn was a briefly popular bit video game system created by sega in the s
it was designed to compete with the sony playstation and nintendo   unfortunately for sega the saturn ranks a distant third in terms of enjoyment valuelooking back id say the sega saturn really isnt that bad a system
i used to play it with my friend and id say i had a little fun
its just that sony was pumping out an unbelievable amount of excellent games during the exact time sega was trying to market the saturn and as you know sony came out of nowhere and grabbed the attention of millions and millions of video game fans
this made it very hard for sega to keep up with the surprising success of the playstation
sony wasnt fooling around back then they were on a mission to dominate the video game market and boy did they ever succeed
it permanently changed the video game scene destroying the console wars between nintendo and sega
sony coming out of nowhere and almost immediately ruling the market pretty much spelled the end of nintendo and sega being the only two video game companies competing with each other
now a third company entered the mix
to put it another way sony temporarily brought nintendo to its knees and in the process knocked out sega forever
sega was never able to recover from the damage sony had done
everyone thought nintendo would be the company to destroy sega
nope
nintendo came close a few times though
with segas wellknown history of bad marketing techniques this might have been for the best
i bet sega would have continued to struggle if they had made the decision to keep themselves in the consolereleasing market after the dreamcast was finished
i bet sega would be looking pretty ugly right now in terms of sales
good thing they pulled awaybecause the sega saturn didnt have a long life the few people out there who actually own one have to notice its main weak point not very many games to choose from
the good saturn games you can choose from are either really rare and expensive or import games never released in america
thats the biggest problem with the saturn
just not enoughto give sega credit the saturn does have some quality games such as virtua fighter  guardian heroes radiant silvergun shining force iii sonic jam nights and dracula x  but and heres the important thing i want you to remember it would be impossible to ignore the many crappy games released for the saturn
worthless games such as corpse killer bug too incredible hulk the pantheon saga hioctane gvector and the house of the dead dont exactly show off the saturns amazing capabilities
also keep in mind that the sega saturn was an extremely awful system when it came to sports games
just about every basketball and hockey game released for the system isnt worth a darn
to me thats surprising when you consider the sega genesis was known at one point as the best video game system for sports games
youd think sega would have continued the trend of releasing quality sports games for the saturn but they didnt
another disappointmenteveryone likes to point out that the playstation is the video game system with the highest amount of crappy games
thats only because sega gave up halfway through the competition with the playstation
argue with me if you must but the saturn was basically dead by the end of   the playstation was just getting warmed up by that point
if the saturn had continued to compete with the playstation until say the year  the saturn probably wouldve ended up with just as many horrible games
sega gave up in  when it finally dawned on them that sony was putting them out of businessmostly jealous sega fanboys like to point out the high amount of terrible playstation games while playstation fans correctly understand that you have to sort through a lot of junk to get to the good games and believe me the playstation had a lot of good games
in fact the best playstation games are better than the best saturn games in my opinion
give me silent hill and resident evil  over nights and shining force iii any day
its a shame sega fans will never stop defending the saturn with the same old argument
time to give it a restin case you havent noticed already it bothers me that sega fans dont seem to mind all the junk that was released for the saturn and instead point out all the crappy games available for the playstation
thats like saying the mosquitos in miami arent nearly as bad as the ones in tampa bay
doesnt make much sense does it
so why am i defending the playstations crappy games
because i find it a little bit inaccurate and rude to be honest that sega fans completely ignore the crappy games available for the saturn and instead focus on the crappy games for the playstation   i just want to point out that yes the saturn does have its share of horrible games as well despite what sega fans would like you to believei think sega fans are confused when they say overall saturn games feature less loading times than the playstation
for a supposedly powerful video game system you sure had to wait a long time to play a game on the saturn
for example you have to sit there for an eternity to play games like wwf wrestlemania the arcade game and mortal kombat trilogy
compare those loading times to the same games on the playstation and the wait isnt nearly as inconvenientwhat makes the lengthy loading times on the sega saturn even more frustrating is how right after the now loading screen goes away the screen turns black for a few seconds making you wait even longer
theres no seconds of blackness on the playstation
the very second the loading screen goes away on any playstation game the actual game comes in
sega fans like to pretend those few additional seconds of loading arent happening
trust me sega fans i do notice them
i do realize that im waiting  extra unnecessary seconds to play the darn game
the saturn is much worse when it comes to loading times
its so slow
none of this matters anyway because by the end of  loading times were almost completely gone anyway
if only the saturn had survived long enough to see thatbesides the loading problem most of the time the playstation had the superior version when the same game was released for both systems
this was because the graphics were always clean and sparkly on the playstation
on the saturn after they finished creating a game it was like they rubbed the graphic engine in the dirt
either that or the person who put the colors in all the saturn games could only see in black and white
all the bland colorless backgrounds on most saturn games make me feel like im digging a hole to china
poor severelydated graphics
for a good example compare the two versions of castlevania symphony of the night
once again the playstation version smears it
the saturn version features ugly grainy and uglycolored graphics
if a game appears on both the saturn and playstation compare the graphics and i guarantee the playstation version will look betteri can think of only one thing the saturn did better than sony the cd player built into the system is actually more interesting on the saturn
on the playstation its just a boring predictable layout of hitting play pause forward etc
on the saturn you have a lot more options and the neatlooking background showing a countless amount of shooting stars is pretty impressive to watch while you sit back and listen to the music from the cd you put on
none of this means the actual quality of the cd player on the saturn is better just that the outer space background and addition of more options makes it look better
they both play cds very wellits a shame the saturn couldnt hang with the big boys
it couldnt hang around long enough to see sequels to many popular games such as resident evil mega man and tomb raider
all those sequels went to the playstation and turned out to be very successful
if a game like resident evil  had appeared on the saturn who knows how successful it would have been
sony seriously put a hurtin on segafunny how the playstations graycolored ordinarylooking system design is actually more attractive than the saturns silkyblack cool color
whats that expression
never judge a book by its cover
right
i think back to that sega commercial ten years ago showing a playstation falling from a building and a guys voice saying fly play thing fly
hahahahahahahahahahahaevery time i order this product the company sends me nba street the first one
ive ordered this game four times
ive given up on this game
send it to hellfeeling like like making a mistake
buy this gamethen
made its bad graphicsimpossible passwords and lack of fun will convince you what a mistake you made
enjoy fighting crappy unpopular bosses like the sewer king the hand ninja klan thingecho easiest boss and the first boss harder than kingpinelektra who has suddenly without any explanation has sprung back to life
fighting bosses just depends on luck no strategy
enjoy your waste of moneybefore i played the demo of this gamei thought it would be awesomelike a better version of rune from the psbut alasi was sorely disapointedi was looking forward to the fast paced action that made the movie gladiator exciting to watch but this game is turn basedturn basedwhat were they thinkingi know there arent that many turn based games around so its a change of pace from the normbut why on such a cool looking gamei was sorely disapointedwow i honestly expected more from lucasarts but this game is by far the worst game ive ever played in my entire lifeand im not being overly dramatic
not only are the graphics disturbingly horrible the voice acting is dull and repetitive
the story is interesting but its randomlike really really random
add to this is the games mind numbingly boring combat scheme that makes dragon age feel like call of duty and the ridiculously jacked up moneystore system
and perhaps the worst element of allthe music the music only has one track that is played over and over and over and over and over
when my sister and i played this the music got so annoying that we turned the music volume to zero
this game could have been so much better
no wonder lucasarts decided to not make anymore medievalthemed gamesthis game should be in the platinum hits sections
no make that the old copper penny section
paying anything over  bucks for this game would be a mistake
only hardened rpgers will like this game you know the typethe guys who sit over by themselves and even the computer nerds wont talk to them
after  sudeki fable  jade empire comes out gladius will be relegated to the bargin bin right next to pong
anywhothis game is about as much fun as visiting a friends dying grandmother in an old folks home unless of course you enjoy that sort of thingthis is a good game but having to enter a sixteen character password is unforgiveable
the game costed it should have a battery backup
i was assuming it wouldthis game ranks up there with possibly being the worst game i ever played
i got the demo way back when it came out and i loved it
i played it just about every night for a few weeks and had mastered it
i bought the game when the price went down and i installed it
the game bugged out on me in training and i couldnt drive the truck like i was supposed to
i gave up on it and a week later my computer basically tanked
i assumed that was part of the problem with the game as i was having trouble with other games that used to play fine
i happened to have lost the game for some time and i finally found it in a box in my parents house two years ago
i took it and finally played it a while back and i was completely at odds with the demo i remembered so well and resurrected to play before starting the game again
the game played nothing like the demo and i swear that i was losing every mission even if the goals got completed
i never understood how to use the tactical map for a long time and when i finally figured it out it still didnt help
the friendly ai has as much sense as a cardboard box the enemies are apparently sharpshooters with tanks and it seems that while you only take  bullet wounds to die the enemy takes at least  the graphics were awful and it isnt due to me being spoiled by newer games since i still play msdos games on occasion
i couldnt believe how terrible this game was
it has been put into a box so i can forget about iti am wondering if i played the same operationflashpoint as the rest of the reviewers because this was the latest in a long line of terrible military st person shooter games
the graphics are mediocre while the playability is absolutely horrible
i took this game back and exchanged it less than an hour after buying it
it ranks among the worst military shooters i have ever played along with the delta force games the clancy gamesthe rainbow six series that is and others
dont waste time or money on this  game
its disappointing that no one seems to be able to come up with a good st person military adventure shooter game
the only two decent ones ive seen recently were medal of honor and return to wolfenstein
again dont waste money on this awful gamei was quite excited about operation flashpoint after playing the demo
it seemed the most realistic portrayl of warfare yet on the pc however after a failed installation i went to various websites attempting to find a soloution
i read through  pages of people expressing problems with the patches installation textures and various other features of the game
i am sure that for those of you who can install it it will be nice however check out theto see what the people who have problems are saying
i would not recommend a purchase of this game until you can be certain the bugs are fixedthis is the worst
i want my money back
klunky lost unplayable
i would give it a minus star if i couldi wonder who was the genius who came up with the idea of glorifying and incorporating hiphop style violence into a video game whose target audience is made up of teenagers
this game also shows that it is fun to beat up on women
theres already enough gang violence in our nations inner cities we dont need little suburbanites to follow in the example of violent criminalsthis game was a sinch to beatits boring and it doesnt deserve to be rated
thats all i have to saytwisted metal black is an extremely violent game beyond that of most firstpersonshooter video games and war games
as one example driving after intentionally hitting someone then the game has the person stuck in your front bumper as you drive around
yickwhen you first start playing tmb you will be saying to yourselve wow until you play it for  or  hours straight and then realize that it wasnt want you expected
one reason why the twisted metal series was so great was new innovation to the car combat genre
unfortunately no new innovation has added to this game in fact you could stay it going downhill
the game lack so much stuff that make all the other series look like winner
what the game lack isnt in it graphic department but it most important aspect of any game the gameplay
it fast infact it super fast how can a  wheeler go as fast as a motorcycle and realize how lame and such a poor excuse the developer of this game made it
the car physic is probably the worst i have ever seen
it never feel like your actually driving on the ground every car has the same physic driving
instead of driving like any other game it drive more like on ice and hovercraft style
it lame and also it very hard to hit your opponent
also every game is a handicap game not only do the al dont shoot each other but that all the al are all trying to destory you
it doesnt take long before a barrage of missle is aiming for your cars
this take so much away from the game that for beginner will be totally outwhelmed
it also pretty hard on the easy setting because every game is a handicap games
now talk about going downhill there is no replay extra and no clear objective to any of the mission but rather on objective and that is to destroy how many cars the game want you to destroy
put in bad graphic and poor gameplay with an unexcusable  cars only and you get a poor quality of a twisted metal game that the only thing going for it was the hypeive tried the cable out with my cousins and we have not found any games that have let us play two player yet
i left the cable with my cousins knowing they had more than one gameboy advance suggesting that perhaps the games have got to be exactly the same in each system
i am still unaware of any two player games they may have gotten to workoooh
horrible horrible game
i saw reviews here way before the game was released
come on have you played it before you gave it  stars
just the prospect of the gamefeel free to spend your money and see how it stacks up to ctp
of course call to power  was not perfect but this is abysmal
you will notice that the playability is extremely hard and vague compared to activisions ctp
wars are strange with no stacking and each soldier fights another one
how realistic is that
trading is so vague with no idea of whats going on unlike ctp where trade routes are clearly shown
diplomacy is also toothless and you do not get to compose a message nicely like you can in ctp
and there are many more instances that show sid meier is losing his touch or he doesnt have enough resources to hire enough programmers and do a good jobmark my words you would be better off saving your money for ctpcivilization iii has all of the aspects that made civ ii and the original huge timeguzzling monsters
every turn involves the micromanagement of every possible aspect of running a society
you have to decide what to research what each city should build if all of your citizens are happy enough not to revolt what terrain squares to upgrade and endless other options
the time system in this game is ridiculous
you have generally from  bc to  ad or less to achieve a victory
while over  years may seem like a very long time when the game clicks off    andor  years a game turn that time runs out quickly
even at the lowest difficulty level your adversaries are given huge advantages over your civilization
they can seemingly create super units with little or no build time supporting dozens more units than your civilization even if theyre the same size
the enemys units are harder to destroy always seeming to win even fights
their units can move across terrain features that would take your same units multiple moves in a single move and they can even run away twice when your units can run away only once
the diplomatic ai supposedly more advanced than the previous versions still demands ridiculous deals and the game never allows you to make similar demands or respond in the same way to those demands
game balancing is almost nonexistent in so much as a battleship of the world war ii type can be easily destroyed by iron clads and frigates of the american civil war era
submarines that are supposed to be invisible to enemy units with the exception of a very select few according to ingame help info will always be attacked by ships supposedly incapable of seeing them
your units are always forced to fight to the death if they are the most powerful but not healthiest unit in a given stack while their units are allowed to change their defense to always defend with the healthiest unit in a stack
i could go on for hours about the excessive abusive intolerable demoralizing shameful cheating that the computer opponent is allowed to commit in the name of better ai
on the technical side of the game the interface is unintuitive and generally ugly
menus are in strange places and your advisor screens are nearly impossible to get useful information from
the graphics are a warmed over version of the civilization ii game and the sound and music are embarrassingly poor quality
response time is a major issue with late game enemy turns taking  seconds to  minute per enemy
start up time for the game itself is good and i have not experienced any crashes with this game patched version f
also the game manual is large but uninformative and the index and table of contents are almost useless in aiding you in your search for some obscure game quirkoverall this game is not worth your substantial amount of time and money
if you must purchase it try to save as much money getting it as possible and find all the trainers and cheat codes you can get because this game does not play fairfor people like me who loved the previous sid meier civilization games civ is a bitter disappointment
there are two seemingly paradoxical reasons for this not enough has changed and too much has changedon the one hand there have been very few improvements to interface and gameplay
all the things you liked about civ will be too familiar to seem fun and all the things you disliked about civ are still there and just as frustrating as they ever were
the ai is still berserkly aggressive and will attack you constantly even when it has no hope of winning and even when theres nothing to be gained from fighting
there is a way to group units to simplify movement but it is only available as a random result of combat leaders or as a capability of a rather highlevel tech military academies that does not become available until relatively late in the game
thus moving armies around remains a tedious and timeconsuming process of giving goto orders to each unit individually
master of magic allowed you to group units for movement back in  why does civ still withhold this obvious laborsaving measure  years later
most of the time this game looks feels and plays just like civ didon the other hand building almost all military units now requires the player to acquire access to certain strategic resources
this is an interesting idea in theory but the concept was implemented so severely that it cripples the game
for example if the random map generator did not happen to place an iron mine near your starting position you will not be able to build swordsmen gunmen frigates canon or even build railroads across your empire
you may have researched techs well into the modern era and still have to fend your enemies off with longbows and spears because the resource rules wont allow you to build more sophisticated units
on their website the games designers say they intended for players to be able to trade with other civilizations to acquire these neccesary supplies
anybody whos tried to negotiate diplomatically with the previous civ games ai rivals knows how laughable this is youre expected to rely upon goodfaith trading with those same guys who delcare war on you every few turns
and without a source of strategic resources you can not build any of the worthwhile military units and your aggressive ai rivals will eat you alive
its just that simple
complicating matters is the fact that the number of strategic resource tiles is proportional to the number of players in the game
the larger the map you play on the harder it will be to find just those few terrain squares that have the essential resources
since i prefer to play on large maps i found myself unable to acquire iron in most of the games i played and i never not even once found a source of saltpeter on my starting continent which in civ means no muskets and no canon
civ shipped with an editor that is supposed to allow you to alter the rules to your liking but im afraid that when i tried this the game crashed
the result is that it no longer matters how happy your people are which techs youve researched and which wonders youve built
despite its name this game is no longer about building a prosperous and happy civilization
winning or losing civ depends solely on the blind luck of being granted a source of strategic resources by the map generator
if you want to fight over a few scattered resource tiles essential to mere survival then buy civ
but if you want to manage and grow a prosperous empire save yourself  and break out your old copy of civcivilization ii is my all time favorite computer game
when i lost that game when a computer virus damaged my hard drive i recieved the third edition of this series
and what a utter crock of ht
i am so dissapointed i am almost crying in disbeliefthere are so many thing that completely ruin the qualities of this so called game
first you cant bribe rival units
second there is no cheat mode to toggle
third there is no complete it button to spend money to build improvements units or wonders
god is there no end to this sorry storyi felt so excited when i got this game for my birthday but when i installed it all it did was crash almost a few minutes after starting and it wrecked my hard drive
needless to say is that this is nothing but a computer wrecking hunk of garbagei personally am going to the computer store and am buying a replacement copie of the second civilization
this one on the other hand will be sitting on the shelf and collecting dust or heading to the garbage canmaybe if my computer is fixed and upgraded this game will be playable and given a higher rating but from where things stand right now this is one of the biggest dissapointments everfor those who are rushing out to buy this stick with your older versions because all this one will do is eat up hard drive space and ruin your hard drivethe eclipsing star of the computer gaming world sid meyer resurfaces to serve up a game that is every bit as exciting as watching lint accumulate
basically a rewarnmed version of his earlier title quotalpha centauriquot a game now in rerelease which will put you back  bucks but without all the cool movies that ac offered civilization  has all the action of glacial movement the excitement of a sixhour monotonal history lecture and all the visual appeal of a mids dos gameafter buying this game i popped it into the drive booted it up and five minutes later was wishing that i had bought something more exciting like a program that would monitor the growth of my fingernails
ive played a lot of games and over a gameplaying hobby that has stretched over the past two decades i cannot remember a title that was so underwhelming so dissapointing and so downright boringi loved civ  and  and i also loved colonization
what made those games truly great was the endless depth and the ease of play
civ iii is a radical departure from the latter
it is just too difficult to figure out
the interface is clumsy at best and the game play in my opinion has really slowed downall in all i am really dissapointed in civ iii
sid meir had to fail eventuallynow i know what you are going to saywhy did you buy this game unsure if it was compatible or not
well i had done a little research and thought that just maybe this game would play on my pcokay my pc is an asus netbook but i had upgraded the ram and felt that i had the system requirements metboy was i wrong
i was only able to install and get to the start screenafter that nothingokay i figuredill just download win s xp mode
again start screen and then nothingi know this is a phenomenal game from all i have read i just wish i could play iti might even go so far as to buy the osx version and put it on my macbook pro but not for nowfrom now on i am making sure games are compatible before pusrchasethere are few games that have made me this angry i cannot believe how unfair this game is
the resources are bull man i never get salt paper and even if the computer has extra it refuses to trade with me doesnt matter though id bring a ton of cavalries into japan and ill just get chopped to bits by their samuri which seem to never end
it seems like no matter how superior your units are the comp can just tear them up with its endless supply of grunt units it aint right  i loved civ  back in the day and mastered it
but this game is unforgiving the diplomacy is a complete headache if you want something you have to pay an arm and a leg and you have to give away all your secrets
i dont know i liked  better maybe  is good but my computer sucks ugh
dont waste your timeas youll probably know civilization continues and heres the newest version of the game known as civ
now dont get too excited about this game as more often you never know how it will end up as
i know i know its enjoyable but just like civ and  were i dont really think civ will make any difference
gameplay and graphics changed a little bit from civilization  to  but overall everything is the same
whoever made this game is a person who likes to cheat people into buying this game and wasting their money on some garbage
id suggest buyers think more often about the sims and simcity  and if they have these games they should be thankful to themselves
thank youthis game took  seconds to get on my nerves
i would expect better response and graphics from an old nes system
compared to the beautiful gameboy advance translation of donkey kong country for example or mortal kombat  deadly alliance and  nightfire looks like its a game from four computer generations agothe graphics wouldnt be a problem if gameplay were a compensation
unfortunately the enemies in this game look like white blobs with vague black eyeholes the sounds and voices sound like they were recorded with a portable tape recorder and controlsthis game should have been called   need a stairmaster because your  moves like he has lead weights attached to him
it takes about a whole second after pressing forward before your agent starts to move forward and strafing is nearly pointless because of it
the control scheme requires that you stand dead still in order to shift your aim and that is also slow and ponderous
my thumb hurt after a couple of minutes of dealing with this control scheme and after hacking through to level  i just gave up
i happen to value my eyesight and looking at the blobs on the screen wasnt doing my eyes any goodi was stunned that electronic arts responsible for some excellent shooters the medal of honor series for example produced this atrocity
a game of the lowest qualitythe gameboy advance wormlight is one of the few occasions where nintendo didnt get it right
the only problem that affects the gameboy advance is its lack of a backlit screen
in normal light this usually isnt a problem but for naturally dark games like quotcastlevaniaquot and playing in poorly lit conditions it can be an issue
alas the wormlight does nothing to fix the problem
in many ways it makes it worse
instead of providing a broad soft light to enhance the screen this light produces a narrow harsh glare
the glare created practically washes out any ability to see what is happening on the screen
check out some other lights or just go completely without one rather than wasting money on this onealthough this game seems quite promising it is just a mess of bugs frustrating loadtimes and huge patches
first off the graphics are quite mediocre
the building walls are paper thin and there is really nothing to the buildings other than four walls
the characters are blocky and all of the action looks quite silly most of the timehopefully you enjoy long load times
waiting for the game to boot up and let you into the server literally takes  minutes
even the offline mode takes a good  minutes to load
and this is with a system that surpasses the recommended system configurations i am running a pmhz mb sdram mb video xcdrom and cable modem
also the game says it only requires a k modem to play but even with a cable modem i experience terrible lag in big battles
also youll hate your k connection when it comes to downloading patches last patch i downloaded was about  mb
the gameplay itself isnt too much fun either
it is pointless to try and go footsoldier seeing as how everybody uses tanks
trying to be infantry will get you either run over or killed in one good tank blast
since youre able to just select what to use in battle is it any wonder that this game has become a war of tanks
in the whole time ive played i only come across infantry when its the persons very first time playing
after that they quickly learn to just use the tanks
knowing who to kill will be frustrating as well
everyones name in the game is blue and although you cannot damage an ally you will spend a considerable amount of time shooting at the wrong targetsall in all the game is terrible
fighting the battles is aggrevating but not as aggrevating as finding a battle to fight there are no npcs so you have to find other players to fight
on many servers youll notice the allies are quite outnumbered by the axis
every battle i have played has been won by the germans
the game is just chaos no structure no commanding officers unless doing missions and not really even then
its basically jumpin shoot die jump back in shoot some more die again
theres no real goal or purpose
no medals to be awarded and no real benefits to acheiving a high rankfirst of all i must inform you that in order to play this game online you must download a mb patch file
that is just far too large of a download for those of us stuck with a dial up connection
if you have a high speed connection  megs isnt that big of a deal thoughok  on to the game then
i am running a p  which is well within the system requirements
i also have a mb video card
the offline practice mode takes no less than  minutes to load up
unacceptable
in trying to map the controls i found that the game would not allow me to program my joystick
unacceptable
as a ground troop my gun would not fire
in flight the sound would cut out intermittantly and no i wasnt blacking or redding out
the graphics are horrible and low tech in comparison to other recent games
the interface is slow and clunky
i could go on but you get the point i hopewait until this game has time to mature into a proper peice of software  this release is nothing more than an incomplete beta version
which is a shame because most beta software is free while this cost me  bucksi would like to be able to write a review for mech commander  but i am unable to play this game on any computer in my house
it seems that microsoft has chosen to add a copyprotect program quotsafediscquot to render the cdrom incompatible with every single drive i have
a readme file included with mech commander warns the user of this problem when it is too lateunfortunately microsoft neither includes a warning on the box nor posts a list of incompatible drives on the web as of this writing
those who have not yet purchased mech commander  should be aware that among many other drives the cdrom fails with the following sony cdu sony cdue acer cda memorex cdrw plextor cdrom pxts scsi sanyo crdp and the yamaha e sx and cdrsvk
the full list is probably much longer
microsoft does indicate that the sony cdue should work if it is configured as a master drive but all of the others listed are right outi am personally going to contact mircosoft about getting a replacement disc
i suspect a patch will not arrive since this is a hardware issue and microsoft obviously will not do anything to override a system they just spent money to install and distribute
it may behoove the reader to write microsoft for a full list of incompatible drivesdont let anyone fool you
this game is a pure  dimensional dungeon crawl of epic boredomyour first impression upon starting the game is that it really is fun and the graphics are good and the gameplay is nicely paced
it was based on those same sentiments that my friends got me to buy it after they had been playing it for  dayssadly i did buy it
by the time i had it installed most of them were complaining that it was getting repetitive and that there wasnt much to it
just gather up your npcs and keep going boyreally this is a game where if you buy enough healingmana potions you can survive anything since your npcs will drink for themselves and if you get one of the healers with the group heal spell you can kill for hours without taking a breather if the mobs would hold out that longneedless to say i was finished with the game after a week and looking for some poor sap to unload it on because there is no replay value
you cant make different decisions so its a one shot dealstay awayi would like to write more but the game just put me to sleepgo buy some grass seed plant it watch it grow much more fun then this gamethis is is a game from a long line of diablo clones
the basics of the game are just a ripoff from the diablo system
the only significant difference is the addition of quite good graphicsunfortunatly this is one of the most uninteresting games ive ever played
i pretty much exclusivly play rpgs and i was just totally bored about  minutes into this game
the plot is pretty much just meeting some schmuck on the road and he tells you something to do so you go do it and kill things along the way
i mean come onthat was pretty fun at first but after diablo diablo  and the numerous clones they spawned that sort of thing has kind of gotten oldyou can only play as a human character and theres very few modifications you can do to your characters looks and all of those modifications are abhorantly cheesy lookingthe advancement system is pretty simple and i think thats why its boring
if you want you character to be good in melee weapons then you smash things with a sword
want an archer
shoot things with a bow then
want character who can smash and shoot
then smash things with a sword half of the time and shoot with a bow the other halfbut the thing that really made me hate this game was the camera angles
they jammed so many stupid trees and caves and mountains into the screen that you cant see anything
you have to spend about a minute moving your camera around before you can see anything giving yourself an epileptic seizure in the process
i found it easist just to play the game completly in the megamap mode
in that mode all the silly graphics dont get into your way and you can actually see where youre going
but of course in the map mode you reduce the game to commanding a dot around and telling it to kill thingsthe game did suprise me on how smoothly it ran
usually microsoft games give me alot of trouble with choppy graphics and game crashes
but this one never crashed and was plesently smooth and fast
figures that the only game they make the runs smooth is the one im not interesting in playingall in all if youre up for a diablo clone id recommend throne of darkness forget about this waste of  gigabyte
on the up side it may make a good game for childrenread this review it is very helpfulmy friend got this game and he was saying stuff quotyou gotta get it its so coolquot  i was so exited to get eq trilogy
finally i saved up enough money to pay for it for a few months
by the way thats a badthing you have to pay  a monthly fee to play
finally i started to play it and that weeks i played it every day
day  awesome day  awesome day  awesome day   and  awesome day  sucked
after a few days of playing it not only it gets old but you learn your way around the game and figure out that its really dissapointing
the graphics are pretty good
but thats about the only good part
its impossible to gain levels it takes so long
after  days of gameplay  hours each of nothing but fighting training fighting training i was level   i didnt take one break not a lunch break nothing
thats how hard it is
i didnt die once either
it is hard to find your way around
the th day before i got rid of it it took me an hour to find the magic shop where you buy new spells to use
it is hard to use some spells like hide
it never works
not many people are friendly
i only joined a group  time and that was with a friend my friend who i knew in real life
even in the daytime it seems kind of like it is still dark
it just barely lightens up
it is still about the same
you need a torch which doesnt help much
you can turn up your gamma and it will be easy to see but it will be like that the whole time even at night so it takes away the fun
it takes forever to get enough money to buy stuff unless you do a trade skill which is hard
it is nothing like the commercials they say you go on challenging quests fight dragons and other monsters go on an adventure of a lifetime
your kidding right
for crying out loud you have to stay in the same town until you are like level  which takes about a year if youll leave in half a minute some monster will kill you
i can go on and on but i am getting tiredsodo not buy this game it is horrible
waist of money
waist of timethis game doesnt make much sense in terms of the star wars universe
it was clearly made to be as similar to age of kings as possible
yeah its pretty cool to select some tie fighters and tell them to attack or to move around an atat but im sorry wookies naboo and gungans are all lame
it suffers from all the same problems as age of kings really really slow action where everything takes forever sound is really bad
it sounds sample from someones vhs copy of star wars missions are boring too many units so many resources that you spend all your time making drones to chop down treesadditionally the graphics are subpar
the color palletes for things are not right and theres a lot of dithering
it looks really bad each quotracequot is essentially exactly the same as the others
all have basically the same units and tech with minor differences to make it appear that they quotbalancedquot the gamedo not buy thisthis games sucksthe controls r radically hard lol radically  you need  memorize like  different buttons  run jump crouch this n that im on a laptop so it probably made it suck on ly more lol honestly id rather master the kotor like times b going threw this thinglucasarts stole my moneythis is one of the worst games ive bought in  years
although the graphics may be fancy thats about it
the game play is terrible the levels are dry and the animations are choppy even on my p ram
its like the only thing they focused on was pretty still pictures to lure unsuspecting gamers with screan shots
this game is just not funin addition to these problems there are hundreds of bugs in this version
i believe that they released this game way to early and i would not buy this product
save your money and please stop supporting everything they stamp a star wars logo onstarwars stamped across the box cannot justify such a terrible gamequotjedi outcastquot is the third installment in the outstanding quotdark forcesquot series
sadly it is also the first misfire
quotdark forcesquot and quotdark forces  jedi knightquot were superb games both in terms of graphics gameplay and story arc
admittedly the graphics are good for quotjedi outcastquot but it fails miserably with gameplay
the keyboard plays a singularly important role in any pcbased video game
with that being fact its imperative that actions that keyboards performs be smooth and fluid
it was with the two previous installments in this series but the control is nothing short of totally aggravating
the movement is herkyjerky almost like it regressed to earlier technology
aiming the weapons at the targets is nearly impossible because the targets move too fast to acquire with the current setup
also trying to pan the players view up and down and from left to right is very shaky
the gameplay is so awful that i have been forced to stop playing the game because i do not have the patience to deal with it
i suspect the game itself may actually get quite good
unfortunately i cannot give a rating based on how good i think the game could be if only the gameplay were better
the fact that the game is too aggravating to continue to play dooms quotjedi outcastquot to the lowest score possible
perhaps the versions ported for actual gaming systems perform much better
if they do i will review this game much more favorably for that platformhow could they of ruined atari
well they did
controls messed up and cant play for  so i dont like itinteract have recently replaced the gameshark v with a new gameshark v
the codes for the v are incompatible with the v codes and vice versa
interact are no longer publishing v codes for current games
you can buy an upgrade to gameshark v but you have to send back your v cd meaning youre without the codes for your older games
so it looks like interact wants to try and push people to go out and buy a whole new gameshark v so they get more cashmeanwhile  has codes for gameshark v which was actually the action replay unit under a different name
so rather than being forced to pay interact for a v upgrade go there insteadif you can find another cheat device
eighty percent of the people i have talked to people or so have said theirs lasted a max of four months and then had a fatal glitch
mine lasted a little over three
the gameshark deleted  of my codes and garbled the other 
to top it off i cant even reload them because of a quothardware not detectedquot error
this is common and cant be avoided
its a piece of junk
im looking into the pelican code breaker mentioned by one of the other reviewers
it has to be better than this
save your money or buy something elselet me just say this oncerip off
games can be hard at some points and its sometimes hard to get the most coolest weapons items etc
well ok
but thats why there are strategy guides
gameshark gave me alot of codes to get my hp and mp higher also weapons items and i finally killed evrae on final fantasy  but listen to this i had this game shark for about  to  months and yeah that does seem along time but
i put the gameshark disc into the ps
it started to loadthen said disc read errorafter that i took the disc cleaned it and the ps but still didnt work after thatsave you mula on something else that w o r k s for your lifetimeoh excuse me i left something else it erased my important battle skills and my peoples hp
and when i tried to beat this one boss it had more hp then its suppose to be
like the bosses hp was suppose to be  when it turned the hp into maybe atleast a millionfirst if you have the old playstation  not slim and without the network built indont buy
the disc is undersized compared to a regular disc
you will spend hours attempting to get the disc to read because it has to be placed just right in the reader
next the discs are blue on the bottom and are so delicate if you even think about a scratch you will have one
and finally the gameshark website takes  weeks to update codes for new gameswhen it works and you have the codes its great
but that is few and far between sessionsjust purchased this thing a few hours ago
i have yet to see it work
its going back to the storeso far i had  gamesharks both of which were defective
however i was lucky enough and my ps dint mess up but if you do use this terribleperipheral youll probably end up buying a new psas far as the product itself its ok but it will mess up soon enough
so if you want a cheating device id suggest code breaker its better and has a better and wider variety of cheats and if you cant find a cheat for that use one for the gameshark and it will worki am very dissapointed in interact i lost all faith in themif you already have a gameshark go get your receipt and hold on to it and when it breaks take your money back and go get the codebreakerif you still have quotpac man feverquot check out namcomuseum for the gba
it has ms pac man and many other games which put these to shame
as someone who works in video games i never heard so many complaints about a game as i did this one ie
 too difficult too boring etcnow im just about the biggest final fantasy fan around but ff is just nothing compared to ff
ff doesnt have anything in it that can match the horror of when aeris dies
and man that chrono trigger game
whats the deal with that
that isnt even final fantasy at all just like the ff movie
chrono trigger was incredibly boring and i was displeased with its lack of random encounters
and it should have had cool characters like cloud and aeris and barret and wedge and tifa
they were greatpso is a great game my friend brought it over and its incredibly customizable and fun to play if you want a game to brainwash you into playing more and more and more this is your game
however id advise against the version  very very strongly you have to give seganet your credit card number to play this and it costs like  bucks a month or something for a few extra levels
however pso is a very very good game and you can head out today and buy pso and a keyboard for  bucks and never pay a cent
its kind of a no brainer unless you live eat sleep bleed sweat etc psothats right to play this game online you have to pay
my friends and i being hardcore sega fans are very disappointed
you already have to pay  bucks for the game
in this version there is only new items and new levels no new characters
i would recommend purchasing the first one it is very good and you dont have to pay to play online
i also recommend sonic adventure  it is way fun the best sonic game everi bought this knowing that the servers would no longer be up
i figured i would just play the single player mode in the game
however you still need to link the game with your system and if you buy it used it will not come with the code needed and will be unplayablethis product was not usable or even helpful
it glitched many of my nintendo  games and caused my system to corrupt itself
it was nothing what the reviews i had read said it was
i am not pleased with this product nor will i repurchase itthey said it was in good condition thats what i was hoping for until i put the card into my controller to save my game for  world is not enough and it said controller pak may be damaged or broken well it was
i am not happy at all about this product and will never buy from this personcompany againpopped it into my n and tried to use it
was immediately taken to a screen telling me that the memory card was broken and would not work
gunna try getting another memory card like this brand new hopefully that one works as i need a memory card in order to play turok rage warsthe momory card i received was not the one pictured
i received a generic knock off product
my ps did not even recognize it as a memory card
beware
amazon are you reading this
i hope sowell the cord is alright but i didnt know that kind of cord went to a playstation component video cables for the ps are supposed to be hooked up to tvs that have y cbpb crpr connections
many newer tvs like the ones i have have y pb pr connections
they look the same
the manuals say that theyre for component video
but there is one crucial difference
the y cbpb crpr ps video output doesnt work in a y pb pr tv
they mention this in the fine print of the ps manual but as i found to my sorrow its easy to overlookbefore you buy this or any other component video cable to hook your ps up with your hdtv check the connections on the hdtv
if its y pb pr it probably wont workjust to be clear i did change the video output of the ps from rgb to y cbpb crpr before connecting the cable to the tv
did not work on two different hdtvs that have y pb pr connectionsthe cable itself doesnt deserve a  rating
im almost sure that if you have a hdtv with y cbpb crpr connections youll love this cable
i just wish i could test it myself update  if you cant use component cables svideo works pretty well
youre much better off with svideo than compositei got this for my ps and i tried to connect it to my tv and it didnt show anythingi got the new component av cable
the plug part that goes into the ps did not fit snugdidnt spend over  for itbut if i had to do it over again i would have went to radio shack to get the sony brand
if you ever have to send in your sony ps  make sure you use sony brand parts cables anything really
if you use this part your warranty is not worth the paper it is printed on
check out playstation faqs at their websitestopped working after about  monthshow do av cables stop working when you plug them in and dont touch them
i can understand them wearing out if their being plugged in and unplugged constantlybut to just stop working
cheap  cent store qualityi guess you get what you pay fori bought these cables thinking they would improve the picture quality of the ps while playing on my hdtv
purple and green colored lines go through the picture and the colors are way off when playing video games and watching dvds on the ps when using this cable
i guess for the price one cannot expect much from this company
i have already ordered an official sony component cable to replace this garbage
if you want quality then go for either monster or an official sony component cable if you want to improve picture quality of your ps gaming and movie watching experience
this company should not even be able to shovel out crap like this to peopledoesnt work for y pb pr tvs like the other reviewer mentioned
my tv is new from  i dont know why they wouldnt make compatible cables for recent tvs
it shows the playstation logo on the screen and then the picture freezes
not recommendedi tried to save a few bucks but fell into the same trap arthur kimes did on his review this cable will not work on a ypbpr hdtv it kept bouncing back and forth from a messed up picture to this signal mode is not supported even after setting the ps menu to the correct component configuration instead of rgbstick to the official sony brand cablesdo not buy thisi tried it with my hd tv and change the settings but the television kept going black from time to timethought i could get away with buying component cables this cheap for my ps i guess i got what i paid for
didnt work at all nor video or sound when plugged into my tv and another tv
i made sure the options were set right on the pstvill attempt to find out what is wrong with it and fix it but it isnt worth the refund because of the shipping feenot really too much of a loss though all in allok since im an adult my view on this game is likely very biased
while the first ten minutes of gameplay was fun i soon beat most of the tracks with peach and it just became boring
i can imagine this could be a good game for kids driving and shooting and throwing bananas  and there are  tracks to choose from  of which are available right away
unfortunately there appear to be a few bugs with the software that can frustrate the player
in the end i regretted paying  for a game that i wont touch againdont get me wrong i love mario kart
however you sometimes meet a terrible game in a series
mario kart super circuit is obviously no fun imo compared to mario kart  i enjoyed mario kart advance when i was younger but now i think its just a gimmick to show off what the game boy advance could do in  this game is overrate just like all zelda games after the super nes announcementdont buy this game
it is horrible
the cartoons look like an ages  and up board game
it is ditsy dinky and silly
go buy a real strategy game
this stinksok so ive had this for well about  weeks and idk somethin happend and all my stuff i had saved became corrupted and even after i cleared itit just never stops corrupting datathis is one of those things where you feel good to save money but then you find out that it wasnt worth the box it came ini think it would be a good ideal to stay away from this and get the brand of the thing your gonna be puttin it ini dont know exactly why it is but usually memory devices for game console made by rdparty manufacturers are inferior in quality
they are cheaper of course
however i experienced a couple times of complete data loss from rdparty memories from the time of ps
the situations were all the same both rdparty and genuine memories were inserted to console all the time yet only rdparty one failednot all rdparty memories will fail of course
even memories from same company show difference
however since i havent experienced data failure from genuine memories yet i do recommend you to buy genuine memory rather than to test your lucki cant emphasize that enougheven a diehard survivor fan will not enjoy this game
i was severely disappointed
loving survivor i expected the game to involve more strategy and conversation
this game couldve been a best seller but wizard works blew itfirst of all the game is poorly put together
after about  hours of gameplay of those  hours in which i was bored the game broke
i have a new computer windows  and i was really mad that i spent money on this game and it broke within a few days
it wouldnt load the game up
now im going to give you my reasons for buying and not buying this game
poor graphics
the conversations with other teamates are bland and the other computerplayed characters respond with the same strange responses over and over
it is impossible to hold an understandible coversation with themthe voting system is hard to understandthe rewardimmunity challenges are always the same bland old thing
if you win a reward challenge the reward is the same
voting out another person and winning is fun for aboutan hourto conclude this game turned to be nothing to talk aboutcoming from a simulation game lover and one who has a fascination with survivor dont get this gamethe ai is like a log
it has horrible challenges
the multiplayer   tribal council is lame
you cant even make alliances
i dont get it who would want this interactive   even hardcore survivor fans wouldnt want this piece   lets hope markaysas is better
i mean magic lantern has like  developers
dont get iti am not one who writes a lot of bad reviews  i think i am fairly easy to please
i love playing computer games and i dont need fancy graphics to make me happy
i am also a huge survivor fan so of course someone bought me this game as a gift when it came outi played it for a few hours and it was a complete waste of time
i can deal with the crappy graphics but gameplay itself is just boring
you walk around camp and talk to people but the conversations make absolutely no sense
the person will tell you they hate someone in one sentence then the next sentence they will tell you youre crazy for wanting to vote that same person off
the computer ai also seems to automatically go for you during the votes no matter what
i played probably  different times and each time if i didnt win immunity i got voted off first or secondthe immunity challenges are somewhat fun but there is very little variety so i got bored of them quickly
the voting is kind of fun if you have immunity
otherwise be prepared for a quick quotgame overquoti can see how making a game of the show would be difficult  the entire show is about human relationships which are hard to adequately present in a computer game
anyways this game is a waste of money
its quite simply not funit never worked for me on the  computers i tried it on
windows  me xp and xp even when my computer lived up to all the specs on the box
a definite do not buymy wife is the survivor freak and i got this game thinking it would get her involved with me and gamming and the price was right at the time
well she played it for like  minutes and the game never came up in conversation again
what a bad idea
in hind sight the game publisher should have paid me to play the game and think i would have thrown it back at themai is hard to get right in any game but this game set a new standard in really stupid ai
while in camp mode your supposed to walk around conduct tasks talk to tribe members and influence their decisions while making alliances
it never mattered what you did in camp it made absolutly no difference in the rest of the gamethe challenges were just too stupid and repetative to list
you could make it to the end of this game in one sitting because winning immunity was that easythe graphics were terrible
the sound was terrible
overall just a terrible game
you will not surive this if you buy iti am a long time nintendo fan
even now when i have a playstation  and no gamecube i still like nintendo more
so this review is not just a bias complaint about nintendo vs playstationthis version of thps is terrible
oh yeah its tons of fun when you havent played the playstation version but when you have you realize just how pitifull this is
on ps its rated t because they dont blurt out words like quothellquot on songs
on nintedno its rated e so the whole family can enjoy censored versions of songs by powerman  papa roach amp rage aganist the machine
and another thing music wise they dont even play the whole song
they cut out one of the choruses and the verses this is an example and just let it go from there
and the track doesnt go to the next track when its done it just plays over and over and over to where you have to change it yourself every  listens
and its not just the music
theres too much to say so just play the ps version pleasethis game is an old fashion side scrolling fighting game where the character is walking towards the left of the screen and several monsters are chargeing at you from the right
you are not allowed to proceed until you have beat all the monsters that are attacking you
but thats it
that is the extent of the game
you can fight one on one with someone else who has the game
also the characters stand and move much the same as they did in fighting games from the smy copy ended in a used games store in less then  hours after i brought itconisering the vast potention of gba this game is a waste of money
there are sever fighters like tekken that are out and much betterwell i loved re and re and i assumed this one would be just as good
boy was i wrong
this is one of the worst games i have ever played
the graphics are improved but the plot is just absolute excrement and the characters bite
the weapons are awful too and the controls seem much more difficult to manipulate
dont waste your time or your moneybeing new to the genre i for  years now have been hearing that resident evil is the most goriest and scariest game on the market
so i rented this one for ps
this has to be the most overrated garbage ive ever played
the battles are so boring i could crawl on my hands and knees and go faster than these zombies
the dogs
theyre awful
to think that dogs are demons are stupid enough
this makes a fishing game look like final fantasy
and the voiceovers ugh
especially that boy
youd only slow me down
huaa
what a  nerd
dont play itthis game totally sucks majorly me and my dad were trying to play this game we got on the first level and then couldnt even get off the first level with reading the instruction manual too and cheats off of cheats codesguides com worst game ever the first level your stuck in cell in complete darkness and keep walking around and then get no where
dont waste your money on this there are plenty of other ps and ps games that you can waste your money on
oh and you can play ps games on the ps for those of you who dont know thatcapcom doesnt seem to realize that people play video games for entertainment not torture
the first boss battle is so hard i just took out the disk and threw it into the trash bin
this is not my idea of fun
dont waste your money on this crap
all you do is run around looking for things to help you move on
you get pathetic weapons with very limited ammo then you fight enemies that are very hard to kill you unload almost your entire clip just to kill one lousy zombie
re is alot better than this one  at least jill knows how to dodge
if you still wanna try this game dont pay more than  bucksthis is by far the stupidest game ever made
and its a shame because i love the resident evil series but this game is an embarassment you should rent before you buy it
or save precious time and not play it at alli never saw a horrorsurvival game before and the idea of a spooky game intrigued me
so i rented silent hill   i figured i would be scared out of my mind battling monsters that pop up out of nowhere hearing strange spooky sounds basically playing the game on the edge of my seat
how wrong i wasfirst off this is a sorry attempt at a game
people say this is a puzzle game
in its loosest definition  yes it is
the same way old games like kings quest were puzzle games
basically all you do is walk
thats it
you walk
really nothing else
you walk and hope you find something
then you walk some more and hope that the thing you found works on something else
thats it
theres no complex or intriguing puzzle its just search around until you grab somethingthat was cool in the s when game makers needed to make  hour games while only developing a few background scenes and characters
this is the s and there is no excuse for it nowso all you do is walk and fight or dodge an occasional monster
that wouldnt be so bad  if they didnt make walking the most mind numbing experience in the world
to move from one end of the street to the other takes forever
the controls are sticky and clumsy and the guy is really really slow
since theres fog or darkness you constantly have to check the map to see if heading in the next directionhow about the environment
not once was i scared or awed
the graphics are below par for a playstation  game
the fog is cool for a second but annoys you afterwards
the monsters are a joke
theyre little bodies that couldnt frighten a  year old girl loaded with caffeinealso the puzzles are just plain ridiculous
for example heres what you have to do when you enter the town
youre just in the town with no explicit instructions
so you wander then wander some more then you finally find a key
big whoop a key
then you wander some more to find where the key goes to
so after playing for an hour youve opened a gate
in grand theft auto  you would have already killed a few people and completed some fun missions
in ico you would have explored a large castle rescued a girl and escaped dreadful spirits
this game  you only opened a damn gate
once youre in the apartment building you wander around rooms and hallways that look the same
finally after another hour what do you get
a cool new weapon
a great story cutscene
no  you get a flashlight
what does the flash light do
reveal new secrets
find new terrifying monsters
no  you can now read the map of the apartment building
two and a half of hours of game play and ive done is enter an apartment building and looked at the map
bored alreadywhats worse is when you need to something to continue the story but they wont tell you what
this means you could be conceivably stuck at one point for hours because of you didnt do something subtle in a room that is far at the other side of the apartment building
remember moving to one side of the apartment building to the other is a major chore in itself
after being stuck for a few hours because i didnt go outside and look in the dumpster and pick up a coin i knew this game had no hope
i continued on until i reached another apartment building that looked exactly the same
i promptly shut off my ps and returned the game to the storefinally in order to save you actually have to actively search out the save game places
this was the final strawi kind of wanted to see the ending but then i figured what it was
heres a spoiler for you
the monsters that roam the town
theyre not trying to kill you
their the dead corpses of the players who were bored to death warning you to return this game immediatatelyyou want a good puzzle game
get ico instead
this game just plain smells
it stretches a small environment into a major chore in order to squeze some playabilty out of youthats not true i did enjoy the mangastyled bomberman movie scenes but the game euh
its the ancient style offers very little and no variety
i enjoyed the n bomberman for its multiplayer here they left that out and it left a big gap
trying to play is ridiculous the computer loses about  percent of the time and its no fun attempting to beat them
you never feel responsibility for the loss
the game can change soo quickly that it might as well be set to one minute to save us time
theres way too much going on in one screen like  different things and its like youre supposed to try to watch it all and you dont and you lose
also there isnt even an adventure mode here
its all bombing in a small space
you always start out in a cramped area far away from opponents
its so old and dull its begging for a drastic gameplay overhaul like the n version not saying that was great but it was a direction with genuine innovation
all of the elements exist for a fun game but it doesnt ever come together
i kept wondering when i would get to the fun partlufia game boy color game it stinks so bad the game is just about religion and what not
this game is so boring that it doesnt even deserve to be played
if you want a game goto digital press and pick up a copy of super mario land   golden coins
this game is the worst game ever in that matter if you want your  get an original game boy w all of the super mario land gamesman this is the worst game ive had the misfortune of buying i mean customer wholl buy it off me
anyway the graphics take us back to that old ps game akuji
while thats not all that horrible i thought id at least get soulreaver graphics on a ps game
also the brightness of the game is pretty low
going in the water is horrible you can barely make out your character
the load times are also longer than the single load time on nba live 
also the game seems to load at every minor junction
just getting past the training portion i had to wait for loading about  times
finally the controls are not bad but nothing to write about so i wont
overall i was highly dissapointed with the game
more than i want my money back i want those missed hours of my life backi cannot believe i spent the money for this game
this is a gamers worst fear to buy a game like this one
a friend told me of a viking game on a pc that was totally awesome and said it was a must buy
he must of meant some other viking game called rune viking warlord cause this game was awful not awesome
the loading time the crazy controls the lack of a descent story are all reasons to avoid this title like the black plague
i mean it  the only reason i gave it one star is cause that was the worst i could
the best thing about this title is the time it gives you while it is loading
for instance you could clean your room walk your dog mow the lawn paint the house wash your car and even sleep in the amount of time it takes between each level
this is really an awful title
sorry if you already bought itbut this was one of the worst
i have to agree with most people here
avoid rune at all costsvikingsgotta love emtearing mutton right off the bone sans utensilsdonning ever fashionable pelt and ram horn outfitsand never letting the smell of blood leave their nostril hairshave established vikings to some as the ambassadors for masculinity at its mightiestunfortunatelyrune vw makes tim robbins from erik the viking look like the hardest norseman to swing a battle axeexpect to laugh out loud when enemies sprint past ragnarso he has to run after themmake a uey then decide to attack himor how about the annoying falling bouldersoversized carp looking for lunchand turnstiles that remarkably cause instant deathweaponsalbeit plentifulaent thrilling to behold or obtainand cheesy haunted house style ambient backdropsas well as voiceovers that come off amateurishly pitched downnot ominously odinishmake one wonder if human heads just being facetiousall in allsince its hard to take rvws action or adventure elements seriouslyits snooze cityshamenever thought vikings could be boringi had the misfortune of playing this game as well and might i say i was greatly disappointed
dont judge games by their covers
being a pagan myself i had high hopes for my hero ragnar but that r camera rotating to see what you were doing sucked so much i didnt even bother finding out what other aspects of the game blewdont waste your money or time on this
im tempted to do an angry video game nerd and try to get through it but i cant see spending  on a used copy that isnt even worth the plastic it is printed onavoid at all costs
these guys were just not up to the challenge of making a ps gametell you what dont think that rune is a bad game it is horrible for the ps though because sony playstation  is too weak to handle the unreal technologybut the pc and mac versions are a lot betterok why should you not buy the ps kind
just because the frame rates are low graphic details look extremely blurryyou might even think you need glasses because you wont believe that the developers would actually put such graphics for the ps and the controls are terrifying
there is only one very minor pro there the game is quite long but since the two of the most important factors of a good game are so stinking bad it does not matteri recommend you to buy the pc version which i would rate  stars there is nothing about this game that i like
the camera is annoying the controls clumbsy and the music uniteresting
the graphics were ok but the scenes were too dark and depressing for me
the monsters were unimaginitive and the weapons pretty typical
i got through a few days and realized that not only did i not care but i was really unhappy with it
i kept playing thinking something would make it worth the reduced price i paid for it
i havent played it since
i wish i could give it zero starsi bought a half life and addon pack because of all the hype surrounding hl
you would think being game of the year would mean that its actually good
ha not the word i would usemaybe i am too much into realism in my games real weapons real people etc but i thought hl was 
i would not recommend half life and i cant understand why it was so populari realize im reviewing an old game here and im writing this review with  standards
please keep in mind i am only reviewing the ps version not pcif youre one of those fans considering to track this old game on ps and spend lots of money on it  dont bother wasting itthe ps version is just really frustrating
some games still look good on the ps even to this day
however this game just isnt worth tracking down and playing it again on the pslike most games that are poorly ported onto console this game is no exception
there are many slowdowns
that is my biggest complaint
its not that the graphics are so demanding but it just isnt optimized wellthis game is considered a classic and really took fps to a whole new level when it came out
however to fully appreciate that even in todays standard go with the pc
instead of paying  or more for the ps just for the rare factor unless you just want to put it on your shelf or something and collect dust its better to buy the halflife anthology where you get many expansions for less than  now
you dont even need a fast computer and everything will be smooth
plus youll get to use a keyboard and mouse  the way it is meant to be playedbut for better graphics i recommend getting the orange box which has halflife  and even the original halflife with updated graphicsso my star rating is for the ps versionupdate the orange box does not seem to include halflife source original halflife game with updated graphics however it seems you can purchasedownload later on steam for about  extra
since the orange box is around  now its not too bad considering most of us paid  for orange box when it was first released
however i think the best way to go is try to track down halflife  game of the year edition which includes counterstrike source as wellthis is goin to be fun
halflife is without a doubt the worst video game i have every played in my lifetime and thats saying something
i beat the first four levels in the game and then i honestly couldnt take it anymore
the story is not well planned the monsters are dumb and kill you easily the characters and graphics are bad really bad and finally the whole set up is just plain bad
the multiplayer is no better with rooms the size of a small box and the weapons are not good too
i mean the crowbar is the best thing to use
when a gun isnt good enough to kill people in a first person shooter you know youve got problems
please save yourself and dont buy this game
im so glad i borrowed it from my friend instead of buying it
heed my words fellow video gamers halflife is terriblethis game was too hard to learn
it took me  minutes just to figure out how to build a building and it took me  minutes after that to figure out what i did
dont listen to what anyone else tells you
dont buy
big wastethere is one reason why i give this game  star
because of one reasonthe game is creepy
why is it creepy
if you are a smart gamer like me you know most wario bosses are disturbing
the bosses in this game give me nightmaresare you kidding me
i bought this game and within less than a week i returned it
it was the worst game i have ever played
if you like wario get one of the old wario games like warioland  for the original gba or you can just hate wariosure at first you play it it seems good i loved it at first but then it just gets lamer and lamer i mean who ever heard of getting stung by a bee and turning all swollen and flying it is ridiculous
o and turning into a triangle block
i couldnt even lookat it in stores it was so horrible and not to mention the price depending on where you get it for that piece of junk
im serious im not just writing this cus all my other reviews are usually s but this game is horrible kirby is a pretty bad game but not worse than this
i fell asleep while playing it wen i woke up my batteries were barely left
they should probably give you some free bateries with itin this game you can shoot webs swing across the sky and fight evil through many levels
sound like fun
think again
this game was one of the worst ive ever played
each level is tightly scripted and offers little exploration and freedom
the bosses freakspecimens criminals and other evil dwellers that you come across are so similar its boreing
though they look different they fight the same
a punch herea shot there it gets dull fast
the levels are repetitive and it becomes a real chore to play through the game
the graphics arnt the best and the sound sucks
dont wast your money on this gamethey are  different colors pictured but you only get clear and blue and they fit what more can i say about them
you can store pennies in them or use them to hold your toenail clippings or you canput your games in themit really stinks that nintendo makes us but these they used to come with the older gamesi am a big fan of survival horror games and recently ive been going back and playing older titles i never got a chance to playto sum it up as simple as possible this game was trash
the controls were among the worst ive ever had to deal with
the weapons in this game are horrible
you basically get  rifle the whole game and just keep getting little add ons which are confusing to usethis game felt like a job really
never at any point in this game did i feel like i was having fun or even partially enjoying myselfall i know is this change in some ways changed my perspective on video games of the past
theres really no point in going back and beating old garbage video games
if a game was made more than a few years ago and you havent played theres probaly a good reason why
it sucks like this pathetic knockoff resident evil trashstoryline  graphics    i honestly feel the re graphics for ps are betterweapons  fun    id rather slice my eyes open with razorsjust horrible in every way possible 
ok i feel slightly better nowi gave it a one star because i was a mgs fanthe biggest ever beleive me  and i am very disappointed about this game
i mean i loved the first game i played it  hourse beat it a number of times and liked it so much
mgs you dont be snake
and the end you wait for the big ending you say now i know whats gunna happen then boom it ends and the whole game is pointless
if you never played mgs then you may like it but if you were hooked on the first give it a rest
i was dissapointed after waiting  years
all the screans of snake you see in the first  minutes of the game btwconstoo much and too often talking between charactorsvideo segments too longthird person view  especialy from the top is annoyingi prefer fist person veiwthe snake was great but raiden was some kind of transsexualin the portion of the game where he is stripped down and you have to actualy play the game with him running around nude with his hand covering his crotch
prosfinaly quit playing before the game ended and went to rent a fun gameits obvious from the opening sequence that a lot of effort went into this game
the graphics and music are top notch
unfortunately the game focuses entirely on the eye and ear candy instead of gameplay and story
it is in essence a horrible horrible moviethe metal gear franchise has never been known for believible plots but msg takes this to a whole new level
like always theres a huge governmental conspiracy this time engineered by people that supposedly died  years ago
riiiggghhhtwhats even more infuriating is the fact that msg is really only a sidestory
those of you looking forward to playing as solid snake again will be sorely disappointed
instead his efemminate counterpart raiden takes center stage
hes the typical anime adrogenous hero all pasty skin and long hair
his story is not compelling in the least and the setup to the climax is in a word stupid
anyone with half a brain will quickly see where he fits in the metal gear universeto make matters worse all of the plot twists in the game merely serve to create unneeded confusion and seem incredibly out of place in the middle of a conflict
otacons story just reeks of a soap opera clichethe enemies in the game all have their own repetoire of abilities and are all portrayed as twodimensional melodramatic fools
they look neat and flashy but never seem dangerous
instead they seem rather comical which eradicates any sense of true drama
i know im not afraid of some guy that rollerblades while placing bombs everywherethe voice acting is once again horrible
like in the previous game emotion is handled via melodrama
the voices range from growly to whiney with no middle ground
they neither endear me to the heroes nor do they make me fear the villainsfinally there is the gameplay
the gameplay like in the original is great
unfortunately the game hardly lets you play
the plot moves through a series of cutscenes
you find out where to go go there see a cutscene of the enemy kill the enemy then watch another cutscene
repeat until you finish the gamein a phrase this game is not a game
its a horrible interactive movie
dont waste your money or your timebasically this game sucks
the graphics suck the dialog is boring this title is overrated
i sold my copy to some idiot on ebay and i get a negative review because it sucks so bad
i rather play with a barbi than play this posthis is the worst game ever for a ps
why
lets see no st person view guns stink fighting stinks plot stinks conversations stink movies are too long graphics paritally stinkto sum it up in two words this game stinksif this game were for the original nintendo it might be decent but even then it would be hard pressed to find an excuse for why it plays so badlyi like d fighters
i still think street fighter  is one of the best games ever made
samurai showdown is another classic example of a great d fighter
it was this game that made me decide to pick last blade  up
if you also loved samurai showdown and are considering picking this game up dont
this game is just awfulfrom the lackluster graphics even for a d game to the four frames of animation per sprite character this game is just a poor example of what fighting games should be
if you want a d fighter stick to the capcom games and you should be fine
if you just want a great fighting game dreamcast has one of the best in soul calibur
if youre into samurai get bleemcast or a psone or ps and get bushido blade  but by all means ignore this piece of junkwhats the big deal with this game
its not fun at all
its way too fast
i mean sonic adventure  battle was fast but not like this
in this game you cant even see where youre going
and theres no explanation for anything
i was expecting a cool actionplatformer with a few story segments
instead i was dropped straight into the first level with no explanation and there was no breakup between levels boss battles and worlds
i was just so confused
it moved so fast that my eyes hurt and i didnt understand it
it was a big fat waste of moneyexpect to grind for countless hours if you want to clear bosses
each act contains six quests often overlapping and then a final act boss
the act quests are reasonably challenging without being too frustrating but act bosses will kill you in sometimes one usually two shots unless you grind for an obscenely long time to get a few levelsexample i played without grinding to the end of act  coming to the final boss with a level  druid with  hit points
the boss has on the easiest difficulty no less than  hit points and routinely does over  points of damage on a single strike
i have no desire to grind for days upon days to get to level  and so i have uninstalled the game to free hard drive space for something bettergreeting friend
stay a while and listenthe original diablo battle chest had diablo  diablo  and lord of destruction
this is the new version and does not include diablo buy the older battle chestthese games are excellent but diablo ii was released in  and the expansion was released in   diablo i is even older and that game was little more than a stripped down clone of rogue a free open source computer rpg with some prerendered graphics added and a cheezy storyso in essence the idea for the game is unoriginal and the latest content in this package was released  years ago which is fast approaching a decade
yet they want us to pay  for this
im sorry but that makes absolutely no sense at best this entire package could be valued at  though in all practicality it could be sold for less than that republished as a  singlediscblizzard is ripping you off
show them how you feel by not buying itborrow it from a friendthis game is the most addicting game known to man
world of warcraft has addicting reviews but this game really took ahold of my life
i think i started playing since i was like  and stopped finally when i was about   i spent  hours a day playing this stupid game at least and some nights i spent all night without sleep playing it
it is a very fun game and i always wanted to get the next good weapon from a diablo drop or something but i finally gave it up
a very fun game if you know what your limits areplayed it once then never played it again
i remember these games being so much better
lol i guess alot of years have passedi wrote a review a while ago about this game saying how it was going to be bad because this game is definetely eye candy if u could even call it that
i just played the multiplayer demo yesterday and it was highly dissapointing the game has so many bugs i cant describe them all but here are a few very laggy
cant have  guns at a time
maximum of  cant bind some of the controlls to the kkeys that u want example cant bind strafe left to left arrow key when you reload it will do the reloading animation twice or even more sometimes
after reloading it will shoot uncontrollablythe game is good for one reason
the creativity
no company would think about making a top view war strategy game and then make a sequel to it except it was a first person shooter in the eyes of a soldier in the game
so the only good thing about this game is the creativity
you can see why this game is bad now
prepare to be dissapointed if you buy this game
hope this helps peacefirst things first
you learn spells how
tracing the symbol with your mouse
big whup
it is just a cheap immitation of a leading series
half of the game all you have to do is click move click move click etc
the recreation of the story is soso which is responsible for the  
i will list the pros and cons later but first a graphics check
the socalled advanced graphics didnt run with my computer so harrys eyes were on top of his head beside the mouth
i not so sure it was my computer either because i have a nvidia geforce   bit video card
i would buy jedi outcast instead
one more thing snape isnt that mean
and furthermore harry can jump  feet
come on
and now the moment you have been waiting for the procon listprosgood quidditch recreationrelatively good storylineconsgraphics couldnt be worsejumping is unrealspells are too easily cast
the cruncher it is not exiting or long enoughloved the bookshate this game
admittedly i may not have given this game a chance
the graphics are poor and movement is archaic
whats up with using the arrow keys
what ever happened to games which allow you to use a joypad or mouse more effectively
in their haste to release a video game to accompany the movie craze ea has classified their loyal customers as well as the general public as idiots willing to spend money on any kind of quotharry potterquot junk
from what i can tell this game isnt even worthy of release as freeware
perhaps the game improves later
i wouldnt know because the flashing blue red green amp yellow lights all over the hogwarts castle walls gave me a headache
i wasted my money on this game and made the conscious decision not to waste any more of my time trying to play itthis is sadly one of the few games that i felt so bad about that i needed to write a review
my biggest complaint is that all shots by the enemy ai are predetermined whether they will hit you or not
this part of the game is beyond frustrating
whenever you try to duck behind cover it doesnt matter because once that bullet is launched its gonna hit you one way or the other
all evasive maneuvers are pointless
on top of this if you stumble upon an enemy and blow him away he falls back and stumbles as bullets hit him
magically he can still fire his gun is pointed straight at the ground but you can watch the bullet fly out and still hit you even if his back is to you
the enemy also always knows where you are unless there on patrol
patrollers you can sneak up on and kill however everyone else is always pointing there gun at you
its rather frustrating walking around a corner to find a fortress with everyones gun already pointed at you
the damage model is also horrendous
it always takes three shots to kill someone with a basic rifle and more with a pistol or submachine gun
the only headshot that actually kills someone is the sniper rifle
the enemies are also everywhere you have to search every single corner of every single house because there is always some random guy cowering in a corner just waiting for you to pass by
this is not unrealistic per say it just that there are hundreds of themthe rest of the game is decent
it has good music and a good attempt to recreate normandy some of the levels are pretty fun
but compared to call of duty which is more squad based with better weapons and realism this game is a weak shooterthe game is great if you can get it to work
the success rate for that is horrific
it does not seem to mater what your system is based on  amd intel via etc
your chances are about 
six other folks i work with have purchased this game
only  got it to work right out of the box
two others got it to work with a lot of sweat and tears and then to find it fail later in the game audio looping problems
the remainder gave up and returned the game
i wish i would have done the samesupport for this game is slow in comming
ea hast left it to you to debug their software and find work arounds for the numerous problems
i advise two things log on to the mohaa site and check out the user forums
it will give you a good idea of what you may face
dont purchase this game until ea comes out with a major patch to resolve the problemgood luckthis would be a five star review if only the program would run for more than  minutes
im running on a ghz p m ram ati rage  the demo runs fine but the full program doesnt like the video card because it keeps causing it to send an invalid signal and i have to reboot
i have the latest drivers
i dont have this problem with any other gamesif you have the same video card as me i dont recommend this gamemohaa is a game that is ideally suited for the person who gives no regard for even the slightest bit of realism and decent storyline
essentially this game is a slowed down quake with germans and allies instead of marines and monsters i knew this was not going to be a ghost recon operation flashpoint or world war ii online but its pathetic and made me remember why i gave up console games so long ago
not even a hint of realism heremohaa makes me think of the movie kellys heroes where the americans march right through german lines and single handedly kill hundreds of soldiers only this isnt even comparable to the movie because its so badok the games graphics are really nice
not on the scale of ghost recon but still nice
maybe if the soldiers werent so dumb and you at least had a little control over them it would be slightly better but you donti really cannot recommend this game to anyone except hardcore teenage quake players
i bet it will sell a ton because the gaming community has very low standards for success at the moment
ill stick with ghost recon flashpoint and wwiiol for now
hopefully you will check those out if you want good fun realistic games of my friends and myself have bought this gameit only works for  of them
this game constantly crashes for my friend that it works forwhat a waste of moneydo yourself a favor and pass on this game
its neither a good golf game or tycoon game
while you will initially have fun with this game the repetitiveness of it all will quickly bore you its just not a good gamethe demo for this game if one could call it that was on the sims hot date or some expansion for the sims
it seemed pretty fun and since they restricted you to  courses i really wanted to know what it was like to build a big golf resort
and so i got caught in the trap
i went out and bought sim golf  the worst waste of money in my life
i quickly became bored with the different buildings there are so few
 and although the course building tool was kind of interesting it was far from addictingthe actual golfing aspect of the game required no skill and the houses you build for celebrities are a plain waste of timeit is a plain waste of time money and of course megabytes
i cant wait till the sims superstar comes outdont make the same mistake i did and get a better game
this is just a plain disgracethe game looks very good for gamers that like to play on settings of very hard
unfortunately i am not that good
because there are not  difficulty levels from very easy to very hard and even on the quoteasyquot setting i cannot get through the missions i am unable to play the gamei bought this game expecting something similar in quality to novalogics delta force landwarrior game
what i got was a systemdevouring buggy crashfestthe game installed without incident and i played the first mission without too much consternation why does the mission suddenly stop when most of the bad guys are down
no mopping up allowed
i took off from the base cant i find my way back and land
but the next mission had too many tanks or planes i guessat first the game turned into commanche  the slide show then it crashedkaboom
i realized that when i came over a particular hill during this mission at a particular angle of attack the game would have a stroke and start locking up
if i ran into another chopper one appears in the distance the game would brainfreeze
i have been playing alot of graphically intense programs lately with no problems i have a geoforce card mb of ram and a p machine so what is the problem
who knows
the graphics in this game arent that hot the gameplay would be almost worth it if commnche  worked properly
i want my money backbuy the commanche vs hokum game instead it is much better a realistic flight model better controls and it doesnt gobble up your computer or stop the sim when it thinks youre finished playingthis game is extremely annoying for two reasons
first it gets extremely laggy sometimes for no apparent reason
also the ai is not fun to play against
the ai is extremely fast because it doesnt have to use the mouse
however the ai is also really stupid and it doesnt have a good strategy even on the hardest difficulty
so playing against the computer is not funif you want to get your computer to get broken or get a hard drive problem get this game
this game was really fun and all but after  months it crashed my computer
i had to pay  dollars to get it fixed
so if you dontt want to get your computer broken dont get the gameflight simulator  is a good game but when you fly the planes you do nothing
you just end up crashing because theres  nothing to do in the game
one plane wont even get off the ground
i dont know why they put that plane in the gamecity crisis   starscity crisis is a total waste of money
poor graphics and sound downright horrid control
you fly helicopters around recuing people from buildings and following criminals in highspeed pursuits
i will say that it is an original ideaflying a helicopter around and saving people never seemed any fun to me
it would have been better if it was a car game i thinkcity crisis is a helicopter simulation where you put out fires and rescue people from buildings
you can also use the helicopter to illuminate fleeing criminals with the night sun
unfortunately the game has horrible graphics and even worse game play and the missions are redundant
im just glad i rented it and didnt waste more money buying itthis game stinks
dont buy it
the graphics are par for a  bit system not ps
the play control is beyond terrible
there is no variation on the weather it is always sunny and clear and the missions are longwinded and stupid
the music is annoying as well
dont waste the money even to rent itlegends of wrestling is not worth it at all
the game is very slow the graphics are sub par but considering that this game is on the ps and xbox the graphics are mediocre at best
also the gaemplay and control is awfulwith fighting games like tekken  mk deadly alliance and wrestling games like smackdown sym this series really doesnt stand a chance because these games are faster have better controls and the gameplay and replay value is great
i wont deny l of w has a lot of great names in it like george quotthe animalquot steele hulk hogan quotsuperflyquot jimmy snuka and more but still the names in this game cant hold the game upif there was any indication that this was going to be a bad wrestong game the fact that its released by akklaim and as most of you remember that akklain also had the unfortunate mishaps of having their name attached to their last wrestling games wwf attitude and ecw hardcore revolution
honestly akklain lost the license to release games for a reason and there are  right there
skip this one and if youre looking for a good wrestling game check out the smackdown series because youll enjoy that much moreits amazing to me how acclaim can make a game like warzone on the n and ps and make it a decent wrestling game
the only thing some people complained about was the controls being that of a mortal kombat style game which they ignored and kept anyway when they release the games follow up of wwf attitude
that game looked so promising and the graphics looked awesome but once the previews where over the the released game was playable it was possibly the biggest let down of wrestling fan gamers lives
they then lost the rights to the wwe franchise and picked up ecw in which they pretty much did not update a thing they just made the ecw arena and wrestlers and added a barbwire match and that was it
its a no wonder acclaim are not legendary amongst wrestling games
so here they are some years after their wwf and ecw release and a promising new game excited fans called wrestling legends
its gonna feature hulk hogan and bret hart the road warriors and so many huge name legends but what do we get
its a revamped version of attitudeecw
just with some graphical enhancements and worse controlsi swear to you if you have played attitude you will see how simmilar this game is in graphics and maneuverability
everyone hated that your player wouldnt lock onto his target and start punching the air well here it is back again
this game may as well be called acclames attitdue revival because it seems they are using the same pathetic coding they where using all those years back
i really dont get how other companies manage to make controls basic and smooth but acclaim always seem to stuff it up in just about every way possible
moving around and connecting with hits have such bad targeting in this game and moves man why is there so little amount of moves you can have with a wrestler
seriously you have about  to choose from in each match and they decided to put an excitement meter in the game where the crowed react to seeing new moves you havent done yet and it drops when you repeat moves acclaim why didnt you just give people the choice to be able to actually do a lot of moves instead of use the same old cppy programming you used for attitude where you kept doing the same moves over and over again because others where useless or got blocked all the time and you expect people to be forgiving and not notice that all you did was reduced the move abilities and added a meter to say hey try doing a different move that the controller is too stiff on to be able to executeah acclame you havent done it againi dont particularly ever want to turn this game on ever again
so i cant tell you how many matches there are or what options you can do because after  matches fighting the same guys in career mode and winning the belt i still was going back and forth between texas and somewhere else doing ugly looking shows against the von eric family all the time which i learned my lesson with previous acclaim wrestling games to not bother finishing it as acclaim have no imagination when it comes to these sort of things and you just do the same thing over and over a million times until you are presented with something boring like unlocking  wrestler and having to do it over and over again with other wrestlers just to unlock them all no thanks acclame not doing that ever again to be rewarded with nothing in the end especially when its so boring after an hours play and you expect people to play it for days to weeks doing the same no variety matches
forget iti really hated this game for many reasons
here are some pros and conspros uhhhhhh i guess the graphics are okcons no freedom
there is a track you have to follow but you have to do missions and kill people along the way
doesnt really make sense no weapons
for a game with no freedom like this one you would think they would try to spice it up with some cool weapons or something
nope
all you have is a machine gun and a regular gun i dont get why your car turns into a motorcycle when your life is low controls are too complicated
while you are going really fast and trying to complete missions you have to add more confusion switching your weapons
you would think only having two weapons it would be easy to switch but nothis game really doesnt deserve to be a playstation greatest hit
sorry if i offended any spyhunter fansi love nfl blitz games except this one and here is why
bad ai on your team sometimes they just stand their when they have a good chance for a sack
changing players take to long so good sacks are rare
 is abetter versionit sux
never get it
u just hop around getting smashed by things
i played it once and hated it
im srry for the ppl who have itin a word aweful
despite all the hype before it was released this game is the pits
why
the controlls are jerky and annoying the camera gets stuck and lost you cannot save during a board the cutscenes are unintelligible it is pointlessly hardi must have spent  hours trying to jump on a railing to ring a bell the railing was right in front of me but since he hops it is purely random lastly the game gets constantly stuck for example if you jump from under an island and you spend most of your time swimmingyou get stuck inside the graphic of the island and there is no escape
and since you cannot save the game during a board just at the end if you get stuck on a puzzle or trying to jump on a railing or to keep from getting stuck in computer limbo it is purely maddening
instead try jak and daxter i am not a developer or in any way affiliated with any game companyetc the most fun ive had since i first played spyro the dragon
when oh when is there going to be a new game for ps  i cannot recommend jak and daxter enougheverything this game gets wrong it gets rightif you rented frogger you would stop playing after an hourim sure there is a worse game for ps but i cant think of what it could benot this
if you are looking for a game
do not get this
it has horrible controls and camera lots framerate slowdown extremely short and it has a bad plot
so if someone says they want or bought this game your reply should be not this
the one good thing is there are  charactersi fail to see how konami could release such a terrible game
dont even think about renting it because you will want your money back
its terrible with a capital t  it has the word bad written all over it
dont even bother to look at the cover stay far awayafter playing it for awhile i realize all you get to do is play with cows and chickens and a dog if your lucky
what a boar
the harvest land in this game is so small i  wonder where all the memory went to
your main goals are to bake goods farm the land then attempt to earn money that way so you can buy something to give as a gift to some townsfolk fool
this way the townspeople will give you clues to go on stupid little adventures to get to one of nine stupid little endings to the game
oh and if you miss their birthday dont expect any help
save up enough money and you can buy a kitchen for your crappy little shack whoopieim sure glad i could get  for this game when i sold it
thats the best part of the game getting rid of iti regret buying this game not because is bad game at allbut because in trying to free some some memory the system erased all my save game information on all my ps games and reformatted the memory card
the game seems to be a good game thoughthis game was alright but it wasnt nearly as good as any of the other harvest moon games
personally i hated it and iv been a harvest moon fan for quite some time
this game only gives you a sertain amount of time to complete
and then u start over again with the same stuff u had iv saved the homeland as many times as you could and it didnt seem to beget any more interestingback in the ps times i used to like playing this game but know  that i see it for what it is its very limited you dont have much to doand the day ends very very very quickly giving you no time to explorer the very small town your ini have a fishing net but i cant go fishing for along timethe graphic looked good and the music hooks you in but the expertise is just badi was curious about this game
my brother loved the pc version and loads of people have been raving about in the reviews so i bought it for the ps eagerly opened it and started playing
i have to admit i didnt even get past the first level
the movement is horrible i was expecting something as well done as red factions movement
the frame rate drops constantly
to put it another way it felt like i was playing a first person shooter that predates doom for any of you who dont know doom was one of the first first person shooter games everor it seems like a first person shooter done on the original playstation
it seems like this port was half done and was relying on the popularity of the pc game to sell it
so as not to be totally negative i did think it was a cool story and that you could make decisions in the game that affected how the game progresses but unfortunatly a game cannot be considered good just bc the story is good
if you are still considering buying this half finished game id suggest you rent it first or buy it for the pc there are even adapters so you can use your ps controller with a pc now
if this were the first ps game i ever played i would have gotten a gamecube of xboxso this game or more specifically its pc predecessor is a masterpiece in the history of the genre
at least thats what people say
ill never know
the controls on this version of deus ex were so complex and awkward that i found them frustrating and consequently the game was a miserable experience
im not much of a fps player but there is a huge difference between intuitive controls eg halo which are possible in any game regardless of the overall complexity of the in game actions and the completely awkward counterintuitive and ultimately frustrating control scheme that defines the gameplay in the ps version of deus ex
are the controls an unavoidable result of its conversion from pc to console
probably not  plenty of other games have been ported and have still been wonderfully playable
oh well its a shame im missing what sounds like a really interesting game but i have better things to do than spend hours training on and acclimating myself to a poorly designed control schemesoldier of fortune for the ps is a very bad firstperson shooter
you can play single player offline or multiplayer online or with bots
i played offline but i doubt that it makes much of a difference since sof has many technical problemsthis game is barely worth my time
soldier of fortune for the ps should have been beta tested so it would not turn out this bad
this is simply of one the worst games currently out for the ps
it is an insult to the pc version of soldier of fortune
the pc version had clean graphics fast framerate and great sound effects
the ps version has none of those things
my biggest gripe about this version is the very crappy frame rate it is pathetically bad
it has some of the worst graphics to date on the ps
youll see this strange folding effect on the screen as if someone is tugging at it because the graphics cannot keep up with the action on screennot only does it look horrible but the choppy frame rate will also affect your game play
if someone is shooting at you from the upper level and you want to aim your cross hairs up it takes a couple of seconds too long and then you are either dead or the enemy gets away
the aiming controls can barely catch up to the target in time and this is very frustratingjust imagine an internet game with tons of quotlagquot and then youll understand what i mean
the graphics and colors look muddy and drab even the snes games look better
animation is jerky and the characters look strange when they run around shooting
sof also had clipping problems in some areas i spotted enemies because their arms or legs where showing through walls
loading the game takes forever
you can go have a cup of coffee and it will still be on the loading screen
then when sof finally loads youll be treated to every bad thing that a ps game can have wrongthe one good thing about the graphics was that it was able to keep the blood and gore from the pc version you can still blow peoples heads arms and legs off
and i liked the fact that they included bots in multiplayer and you can play against them by yourself
are the bots any good you ask
well they have a tendancy to shoot you in the back very often and they seem to have better shooting accuracy than you but they dont have any real strategy
they basically run and shoot a lot mindlessly
but the action is never exciting because of all the quotlagquotthe frame rate is laughably bad like a bad joke
playing single player is even less fun and i got ticked off by one of the levels where you ride on a moving train
my character got stuck in the railing a couple of times and the enemy cpu got me with a lot of cheap shots
i found a few other places where my character got stuck to a door and the enemy came and blew me away
thats just bad programming
if they had done a better job of beta testing sof this would not happen
the controlling is not bad but it needed to be more responsive especially when aiming
the sound of effects are weak and unrealistic
the sound of gun fire from each weapon is very inaccurate and sound cheap
the shotgun sound is too loud for its own good
grenade explosions also sound weak as do machine gun fire
however the music is pretty good as are the screams from enemies when you blow them awayin conclusion sof is plagued by everything that could go wrong in a game of this type and you are better off buying something else
i feel sorry for the people that buy this game and then they cant get their money back
so i hope they listen to me when i say this soldier of fortune for the ps is total junk
i suggest many other first person shooter games that are much better and enjoyable than sof
games like quottimesplitters  and quot quotmedal of honorquot quotred faction  and quot quotjames bond nightfirequot
those games will leave soldier of fortune in the dust bin where it rightfully belongsi wont go into reviewing this game very long so ill make it short
this games graphics suck
i have scene better graphics then this and this is from the pc i mean cmon
the graphics are terrible compared to the pci hated how bad the frame rate was and everything about the graphics were really really badthe violence in this game are hardcore but the pc version is better mainly cause of the graphicsim so glad i returned this i just couldnt handle the bad controls and graphics
i mean i donno i just did not like the game compared to the pc version which is betterin shortget the pc version out latesgames like every form of entertainment are subjective so i would never tell anyone not to at least try something out
i came really close this time
lets start with the load timethis practically cripples the game and makes the whole experience annoying
the graphics though not a big deal since really this game is for those into the cb series did not impress me
movement of the characters has an annoyingly n like feel to it
this was my second attempt at getting into the cb series and i think it will be my last
those into the series which i am not may find something appealing about it although im not sure whatmy little brother is a crash fan
personally i hate crash games they are all the same
when the wrath of cortex came out my little brother bought it
i played it with my brother and boy was i bored
it is the same thing even the same graphics and it takes like  minutes to load
dont buy itwhen i was  i played this game and loved it
i tried it again at  and it did not age well
the storyline is so poor that it annoyed the voiceacting and dialogue is so inauthentic that it is painful and while dante is still cool after all this time he is literally the only character i likethis game isnt so much write for teenagers as it sounds like it was written by teenagerssummarythis game is horribly unbalanced against the player
and this makes playing it absolutely frustrating
with poor story progression there isnt much to make one want to put oneself through such a horrible experience
but it just might be worth your while if you like the visuals and gameplay style
ill admit i really enjoyed these aspects
if only they were accented by the rest of the gamereasons i like this game good graphics
enjoyed the resident evil meets shinobi stylereasons i hate this game camera  generally fixed camera
always centered on player
this is great except when youre in a corner which you usually are
then the camera is facing the corner and not outwards where youll obviously be facing to attack oncoming enemies
this camera may work for games like resident evil where you have plentiful healing items and where the enemies dont move freakishly fast but both of these are major issues in this game
ill elaborate in reason  difficulty  im not your average gamer  im always adept at any game i play
and ive spent probably as much time ive been progressing in this game retrying levels  hoursish
this is due in part because of the horrible retry system which takes you all the way back to the beginning of the stage if you lose
if you have a yellow orb you can retry from the last door but you lose all your equipment you used on your last try why even call it a retry then
if you failed with the equipment youll fail without it
other than this the enemies movements are just too erratic and fast
no matter how much i get these enemies strategies down their attacks are still insanely difficult to dodge
and the enemy strength doesnt help  a regular enemy can take off half of your health bar with a single attack
major problems for this you are only allowed one potion item
and health drops are very sparse and very weak
this makes bosses particularly difficult
upgrades  this game has a very nice upgrading system that allows the player to pick and choose what is desired
the problem is that most of the upgrades to weapons arent very useful yet theyre outrageously costly
it will take you days if you want to grind the cost to gain all of the upgradesitems you want
and enemies are sparse for grinding
controls  there is a button to switch melee weapons but no button to switch guns
even worse when you do switch melee weapons an animation will be performed making you vulnerable to attacks
so youre forced to do it the oldfashioned way by opening the start menu and taking half a minute reequipping your desired gear
this makes battles very slow where you need to switch weapons because of enemy elemental properties
not to mention it just becomes tiresome after the th time
story  started strong ended horrible
its like the whole inuyasha series smashed into  hours
imagine all the filler  well the story is interesting at the beginning though not much is explained
but after that it seems like they just pieced together backstories to all the stages
example theres a tiny story of about  lines of text long about some item you need to get
game done
but seriously these kind of stories are what youre treated to most in this game
very sparsely is the gameplay ever tied to the main characters story
music  repetative and generic
same battle music is repeated over and over throughout the entire game
this music is very basic and very stereotypical action rock music
platforming  this game is by far the worst platformer ive ever played
half of the time you cant see where youre jumping because of the camera as stated before
the other half when you can see is still riddled with problems
you cant always grip onto platforms or the character just fails to which is immediately annoying
but even worse it is so difficult to land exactly on top of some platforms
platforming is not intuitive in this game at all
some jumps are performed automatically when you jump from certain ledges that require a longer jump and some jumps you have complete control over
which jump is the one youll be doing
who knows
there is no way of telling
most jumps have some sort of automatic contol where you are in partial control and are partly guided
this is so necessary because of the lame platforming in this game but this is also very problematic
since you are only in partial control your character makes unordinary jumps
this is very tricky for two reasons  the partial automatic control sucks you will miss your jump often and  its hard to determine which jumps you can make because you dont know exactly how the jump will react
fanbase  i bought this game because of the heavy embrace by a very large audience
this leaves one to wonder why
it leaves me to worry about my human kin and their interest in this outright annoying gamethis game starts out ok then later becomes plain stupid
no plot at all you dont know why you need to do this why you have to go there where should you go next
sure the action is fun until you face the annoying catlike shadow creatures
i was literally wishing death to whoever designed these enemy while i was battling them
there are also secret missions which are nearly impossible to do
did they even test this game before they released it
dont buy this crap get onimusha  or  insteadi am a long time fan of capcoms mega man x series owning almost all of them excluding the rare x which i only rented and the new psx mega man x
mega man xx on the snes where just great and mega man x was mindblowing greathowever a strange thing started to happen and it happened when x came out
x was decent but the storyline became too farfetched and anyone with a brain could tear holes in it
this is even way more apparent in xnow we have x and im just gonna flat out and say it is probably well actually the worst in the series no doubt
it is easy to tell this game was doomed from the beginninghere are my basic arguments no english voice actors for cut scenes or battle cries
 this is just so unforgivable mega man is as much a us game icon as a japanese icon this a royal slap in the face compared to the awesome cut scenes in x
capcom obviously didnt want to spend the money  lazy pure laziness
the whole zeros missingreturn thing was so dumb
capcom built this scenario up so much in x and x and failed to deliver any kind of interesting and credible reason for his return
i could write a better storyline man
zeros new sword is just way too powerful it shreds anything in seconds like his crescent weapon in x
basically he has no need to use the weapons he acquired at all youre gonna kick butt with practically no effort at all meaning no actual challenge
ok i know some people are sick of sigma and yeah its unimaginative to put him in again after building up the whole dr wily thing in x but gate was ten times worse
gate and isoc were lame enemies
you never even get to fight isoc either
the way you have to defeat high max was so annoying and over complicated
the so called nightmare system is really a nightmare
when i read about it it sounded cool but really doesnt add any challenge as it does controllerthrowing frustration
zeros control scheme is now so screwed up it leads to many accidental deaths because the buttons have more than one command assigned to some of them
the english translation or attempted translation is horrid the worst ive seen since breath of fire ii
how do misspell the heros name zerrrrrrrrrrro
as zelllllllllo
x easily has the worst selection of mavericks this time called investigators come on
when you have a dung beetle as a boss you know you have run out of ideas and a beating a dead horse
some investigators are pathetically easy others are insanely hard
and i though xs guns and roses theme was bad
overall the stages lack anykind of imagination
some are way too short the weapon lab some are way too intense weapon lab magma area and some are just annoying to no end central museum and laser institute
they butchered the animation for zeros victory pose  no more thumbs up
when i first heard that x would be able to access zeros saber as a weapon i was a getty as a school girl until i played and found out he cant wield it even half as fast as zero could let alone combo with it making it almost completely worthlessin the end capcom did do a few things right
some of the tunes are cool especially the two they remixed from x and x although some are really terrible ex
central museum and some of the new armors are cool i loved the ninja armor
its a sad day for x fans i never though i have to bash a mega man game this harshly
but what do you expect when they slapped it together so quickly one of my biggest dissapointments ever
now i have never played the playstation version so i can not compare the two but this game was horribleyou start out in a small town its being attacked by some evil family
so some chick turns you all to stone so you will not die then she attacks this guy
all of a sudden your back in the huge building and some guy says go on a quest
so you leave for no reason and have no info as to who you are except you are part of the dragon clan
you go to the first town and you kill some dude in a castle
now the king tells you you are awesome
 and tells you to go to some town and find the quake control to stop the earthquakes
not only was this task stupid i do not even know why i did it because i got no reward
also couldnt the king have sent his men to clear out the castle
so you go to the town at night and sneak in past the guards
keep in mind you have not said one thing at all during the game
you kill a knight and turn off the quake control
now you go back to the king and he says you rock again
i am too lazy to give you anything so your a hero now leave
then you go to some town and you learn the king is ill so you play as nina to go to some other place and get a remedy from a wizard
how did they know the wizard had a remedy
then you get sent to help nina kill him
back at the castle the king gets up and nina says i am going with ryu because i need to stop evil in the world
so then you leave
notice you have done  quests and got nothing but ninanot only do you have no info about who you are you are given weird tasks that give you nothing in the end
i am still not sure anyone knows my name
this game is overrated
also there are too many random battles
you cannot walk  steps withouht having to fight some weak monster
now if you want an rpg on the game boy advance get golden sun
if you want an rpg that serves no purpose and seems like people made up as they created it get breath of firetheres a reason this game is so cheap  i found it for about its a terrible game
now i almost never say that about games most have something redeeming in it but i am a diehard tetris fangirl and i found it quite frankly embarressingjust were clear this versian is for the gbai picked it up because i was excited to see that someone had finally made a color tetris game
when i turned it on i noticed several things which disappointed me right off the batthere are several modes of play in this game and only one which is plainvanilla tetris
most of the modes are fun for a time but only the classic tetris is even worth playingthere are a few redeeming factors but overall being able to switch out your next piece and hold a favorite and finally being able to quick drop your piece instead of waiting as it drops does not make up for the forgiving difficulty and distracting colors and backgrouds of theis gameseveral things prompted me to rate it so lowone there is no scoresaving
heck there isnt any way to score the game at all
what fun is it when you cant even brag about your high scoretwo the infinate rotate feature made it so you can continue to rotate a piece endlessly until you figured out where you wanted to set itthree the shadow block makes it so that you can see where you your piece will drop
makes the game too easythose three items have effectively broken tetris for me
i promptly took the game back and requested a refund
avoid this versian of tetris at all costs
if you must have a tetris fix its possible to findthe original for the gameboy under 
even if it does stick out of your gba sp two inchesdont mess with the successful tetris formulauntil a new versian comes out that addresses these issues im sticking with my gb tetristhe worst tetris game ever next to the tetris worlds on all  major systems  lets face it finding nemo was bythqtetris worlds is bythqand i can go on and on  thq makes some of the worst games i have ever played stay away from themthe graphics suck the game doesnt even have a save feature to save your scores and its hard  play when stuff gets in your way when your tryin to drop peices its horribleits hard to believe that someone could make a version of tetris that i wouldnt want to play but here it ishere are the problems  the animated backgrounds
this is a killer
everything on screen is trying to distract you from playing the game
just a static image on the sides would have been great
the spin bug
you can rotate a piece once it hits the bottom as often as you hit the button
this means you can just keep spinning a piece around until you need to drop it
no challenge
no battery
a huge part of the game was trying to beat your old scores
also this means you cant save settings
far too permissive default settings
you get to see the next  pieces and see an outline where the piece should go
want to change the settings
you can but you cant save it so you have to do this every time you play the gameeverything about this game feels wrong
the floating cube head mascot the annoying backgrounds and the lame attempts to change the gameplay
i still use my copy of tetris dx instead
i just wish i could get a copy of tetris dx in a gameboy advance cartridge as it sticks out of my gameboy advance spstay away from this game
hopefully the next tetris will bring back the classic dx version which was the best version of tetris ever made for any platformi have seen a lot better basketball games from ea sports
i have played this game and cant find  good thing about it
the camera angles are just plain horrible whilethe gameplay is just as badevery shot you take is a rim ball
no swishes or shots off the backboard
i dont know about you but ill wait till nba k comes out in february
ea sports should be ashamed of themslvesive been a big fan of most of ea sports titles throughout the years and this one is a huge disappointment
i love their new nhl hockey and the ncaa football but his games quality is questionable at best
in last years version the had great graphics and good gameplay 
but only half the cars on the track a concern for some
i thought it to be entertaining
this year at the expense of gameplay and graphics they have a full pack of cars
but the end result is terrible
inacurate handling of the cars and chippy at best game rate where the grandstands click by as if is was a ps one game
i owned it for two days trying to find some worth in it but alas could find no redeeming qualities in it and i sold it to someone who has a ps but no tv 
the best way to enjoy it if you want to own itim sorry i cant slap on the kudos that the other syphon filter die hards did for this version
i thought syphon filter  was the best console game available when it came out period
really good first person action and controls that were superbly responsivesyphon filter  came on  cds and was truly massive with lots of well thought out sections and excellent challengessyphon filter  is exactly what i said it is
a series of ok to lame leftovers they didnt think were worth including in  and in case you didnt know the company that produced one and two sold out before three and it is completely obvious that the people who cludged together  were using the leftoversone and two broke a lot of new ground and the increased scale of two alone justifies it but  does nothing new and is kind of like one of those death wish  movies
they really should have stopped at two in this case
this even came in a  cd box with only one cd and a lame little meaningless pamphletthey obviously had more planned but decided just to exploit syphon filter fans instead taking money out of them before they learned the truthsorry guys your first two were great but this one is pure financial exploitationmgs on the ps is intriguing but really wordy and a little strained in the control department even if you dont like true first person as much as i dohowever halo on the xbox is the new best console shooter periodplayed through heroic level hard but great fun
legendary is continuous suicide also periodif you like shooters it is time to move oni purchased this game because id played the original jade cocoon and liked it
id already read reviews about jade cocoon  so i knew it wouldnt be like the original
still i never expected it to be so bad
i wasnt even able to finish the game
i even picked it up again after awhile of inactivity to try to force myself to finish it but i couldnt
i really did consider finishing it to see if it got any better but after reading numerous reviewsfaqswikipedia i realized that it wasnt going to get better
so rather than trudge through the rest of this abysmal game i decided that id better quit before i wasted any more of my life
i dont normally write reviews for games i havent finished but i really feel like i need to share my opinion on this one so i can inform others of what they might be getting into if they buy this game
its really not any one thing alone that makes this game unbearable its a combination of several things that bogs it down
well lets take a lookgraphics score  the graphics themselves are technically decent but not really too impressivemusic score  ouch
music is incredibly bland and generic
i almost didnt notice that there was music
the voice actors try their best to invigorate the terrible dialogue but many fail
furthermore some voices chosen for characters were incredibly irritatingespecially the voice of that guy who stores items for youcharacters score  remember how i mentioned the crummy dialogue earlier
well this really ruins the characters
dialogue is very repetitive a lot like the rest of this game
kahu repeats every statement made to him back in the form of a question
kahu you need to get the forest orbs
so i need to get the forest orbs
urg
this sort of exchange happens constantly
kahu seems to be amazingly stupid
while other characters are amusing in a small way like yamu it doesnt save this section from a poor score since most everyone is either gratuitously stupid or simply poorly developedstory score  talk about nonexistent
what little story that exists is incredibly trite
kahu wants to become a beast hunter but then he gets cursed for touching a fairy cocoon
now he must collect  forest orbs to lift the curse
there are several subplots along the way but none of them are particularly interesting
the story really suffers from the pace of it slow and the way its told
the bits of story are revealed by talking to people in the dungeons
sometimes there is a scene mostly monologues by the fairy nico but mostly it consists of simply exchanging a conversation
there wouldnt be anything wrong with this if it were paced better
but the game drags on and on forever with a lot of level grinding
this really slows the story to a snails pace and makes you forget why you are even playing this game
with all this youd think the gameplay made up for it right
well lets seebattle system score  this parts not so bad but it does have its irritating bits
selecting attacks is turnbased and battle involves having several monsters arranged on a wheel surrounding kahu
they can only carry one move for each element and then can only use the move of the element that they are placed on in the wheel
furthermore you cant choose which enemy the monster attacksits random
plus monsters can only use their moves that take up mp they only use normal attacks once their mp runs out
that makes for a frustrating experience
otherwise i wouldve been fine with the battle systemgameplay score  repetitive is the word of the day
there is only one town and its dull
dungeons are long and boring and each one looks just like the others only a different color
there was just no varietyand in a game thats basically a dungeoncrawler this is bad
to make matters worse the monster raising system is very unrewarding
when you merge a monster the appearance doesnt even change unlike the original jade cocoon
further monsters stop leveling up at level  forcing you to merge them which resets their levels to   this really ruins any sense of accomplishment you had because monsters revert to their weaklooking baby forms
it really sucks the fun out of the gameoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
sigh the first couple hours of this game are really fun before you get sick of it that is
i wasnt able to force myself to finish this game and i dont see why i should have to
a game is supposed to be for fun not something i should force myself to do
i just dont think i could recommend this game to anyoneexcept maybe the most diehard of dungeoncrawling fansaquanox is one of those games that makes you wonder if some game designers have any idea of what their competition is making
its like getting dressed without looking in the mirror
i look at terrific games like splinter cell ghost recon half life or even the sims and this game just cant hold a candle to them
probably because it takes place under water
with all the time spent in my ship and never really going into the docking stations visited i got downright claustrophobic
air
airprosthe graphics were nicethe game setting underwater is originalconshorrible voice actingthe feeling that you are watching a filmstrip when the rest of the world is watching dvdswithin the first few minutes of playing this game i was left saying what the hell 
mind you i can play a game with a stupid premise but not a game with a stupid premise and crappy gameplay all in one place
if your an experienced gamer this game will only leave you pissed off because of bad gameplay and poorly explained objectives which only left me with the urge to punch the penguins that i already wanted to punch after watching happy feet
so remember folks if you enjoy fun things avoid this game and if you dont want to lose your soul to the suckage of this piece of garbagei thought about buying this game
im glad that i didnt
my little brother let me borrow his copy of the game
i am glad that i played his copy before buying this piece of trashit is a shame to rip off little kids like thisthere is no action at all
all spongebob does is jump around
can we say a captail boaring
dont waste your time or your money on this piece of trashi love the spongebob game for game boy color
i cant wate to try the spongebob game for ps playstation  and the gba game boy advance
i bought my little brother spongebob for game boy color and he let me play it i just love it and i am not a fan of spongebobs
i dont watch the show
i will only watch it if my little brother is watching iti would have given this game zero stars but that is not an optionthis game is just like crazy taxi except done in the most horrific way possible out of  stars
this game had like no good gameplay except pick up people and drop em off and a very short story modewhich is also crapnothing really to do except listening to annoying bad music which isnt even good and really really bad gameplayhit and run is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better then this malarchy out  horrible gamelatesthis is the worse ps game ive ever played
the graphics are rd rate and are far below many psone gamesthe camera movement was so jerky that it hurt my eyes after about  minutes of play
my son and i stopped playing and never had an interest in playing againthere are much better games available like ffxthps was fun
the levels made sense the physics were completely unreal fun and the locations had some sort of skatepark or something interesting going on
the locations in thps are lacking
a few are fun but the majority are chaotic and seem to be designed purely with aggravation in mind
the airport is a great example
the physics have changed for the worse
you feel like your controlling a big sack of lead and you will fall constantly
the controls are not configurable and the setup for doing tricks is more a game of hitting things in the correct sequence than any sort of creative use of the terrain
on the technical side this is one of two ps games ive seen crash
shipping a game that crashes is totally unacceptable but this level of workmanship seems to be a major theme in thps
overall im pretty annoyed with my purchase and would recommend staying away from this title
dont even waste your money on a rental
hopefully some developer as talented as the ssx people will come out with a good skaterthis game stinks
the graphics arent that great and the control is terrible making it hard to play
activision should make a new game instead of concentrating on tony hawk this tony hawk that
tony hawk  and  are more enjoyableitem was so damaged that it could even be repairedscratches were pretty deep and there is a crack on the end of the disk extending about oneeighth inch inwardmakes good wall artsoi said well sometimes that happens when purchasing used stuff and decided to try againthe second one played fine until i reached the th missionabout half way throughguess whathopefully this one can be repairedlets see what makes this a bad game shall we
quotcommentaryquota commentary is when two guys are sitting at a table near the ring and talk about some stuff other than the current match
tazz and coles socalled quotcommentaryquot is laughable and repeats the same phases
tazz and cole are emotionless and sound like computers that need to find an acting coach
they sound like this there will be no interferring in thesingle match
what the hell are they chewing on
every character in this game looks like theyre chewing tobacco or something
autolock pleaseive played wwf no mercy for the n and it had a clever little system
everytime you get it your character would turn towards the character that hit you
wwf smackdown
doesnt have an autolock on
create a characterokay this is one of the stupidest systems for creating a wrestler
you dont get to pick any of the moves just looks and clothing
no easy setting
wwf smachdown
is hard and doesnt appear to have a quoteasyquot setting
the computer is relentless and doesnt leave you alone to recover from the last attack
lookssome characters dont look like the wrestlers in the real wwf
for example stone cold
nuff said
nobody talksthe only two who talk are the computerized voices of tazz and coleall in all this is the worst wrestling game ever madei must say i am very disappointed in this game
for the ps they should have carried out their promises to the fans
their storyline section is horrible
you have like  matches tops depending on what you pick as a storyline choicesprevious smackdown games have a season mode where you can continuously play as a character as you unlock levels
here you have to finish multiple storylines in order to unlock wrestlers and movie segments
lame if you ask me
the create a ppv is gone as well which is sad
i loved making those
you cant interfere during a wrestlers entrance
the only thing you have is improved graphicsthats nice but for the ps there should be more
if you want to get a wwf game buy smackdown  for playstation and enjoy if you want a somewhat good wrestling game consider ditching your junky ps and get a real game game console  xbox
and get yourself wwf raw where there is at least some resemblence between the game models and the real wrestlerswell this game aint nothin but a ps version of smackdown  and this game aint even better than that
theres a lot of newer wwe wrestlers to choose from but the game is very uninteresting has bad commentary during matches and the controls are still bad
this is the worst of the smackdown series and this was the wwes ps debut
the graphics are also pretty bad tooi sold it back in  days with everything unlocked
story mode is a joke no replay value at all
ill take my chances with legends of wrestlingdo not buy this
it sounds like a good price but even for double the memory at half the price it would be bad
this is basically an mb memory card because in order to get the mb out of it you have to compress and decompress every time you want to use it if you fill the card with memory
and thats not the worst part
every time you put in a different disc or hit reset or turn the power from off to on you have to insert the disc that comes with this card let it load pick your memory card then eject keeping the power on and insert your game
if you dont do one of these steps you have to start all over again because your game wont recognize that you have a memory card
if you dont mind waiting  minutes every time you want to play a game then this memory card works fine
but come on ps takes long enough to load a game already
you dont need this
a better purchase would be two mb card for more
if i had been on the job when i first used this i would have made that by the time i started my game anyway because it took me a couple of tries to wade through the obscure instructions
one positive if it seems you can never find the time to clip your toenails this purchase may be for youi recently bought a ps
when i bought the console i also purchased this mb memory card because it was cheap had a lot of memory and was the only one the store had at the time
when i got home i put in  agent under fire and the memory card
when i tried to play my game the memory card wouldnt work
i printed some instructions from interacts website and i discovered that you had to use the disc that came with the memory card every time you wanted to turned off the ps
i tried to get it to work and it didnt work this time either
i took it back the next day and got my money backthis memory card is crap
i then bought a sonymade mb memory card
pay  more and get the mb memory card
you can save without the hassle and you can fit over  games to one card
bottom line do not buy this productwarningdo not buy this memory card
this memory card is a complete waste of your money
i would recomend sonys mb memory cardso this reveiw is practicly just a warning
warningdo not buy this productyou must boot with the included software every time you want to play a game
that stinks
do not buy it because the lower price and additional memory are not worth the extra hasslei was in search of an inexpensive way to save my ps games to memory
as there were not many choices besides the interact memory card for the ps the advertising on the package looked very promising
not only did you get twice the memory you could also crunch the memory files down to a very small size thus allowing you even more space to save more filesi purchased the interact mb memory card and it did not function as advertisedthe unit comes with a custom memory card and a small cd the size of a gamecube disk
in order for the memory card to work you must first load the software into the ps
this takes you to the main menu
the choices on this menu allow you to select copying functions crunch functions making your files smaller by using a compressing program moving files from one card to another and deletingwhen i first started up the program everything seemed to work correctly while saving to the card
when trying to load this data back from the memory card i received an error message on the screen saying that the interact card was not recognized
i tried loading for  minutes and followed the directions exactly
i thought that i had a bad unit so i returned the item for a new interact mb card
the second unit was in new packaging so i thought ah they must have fixed whatever was wrong with itwrong
same results
the card device did not work
however after some detective work on the web interact posted that if anyone had problems with the card they would take your card and return a new functional one to you
of course this meant that you would have to pay for shipping to get a working model backif it really works at all
no thanksthe units are all defective
i returned mine and received my money back
after several weeks all the units were pulled from the shelves of the store i purchased it from undoubtably because of all the complaints and returns from customersthe mb interact memory card is nonfunctional and a waste of moneya one star rating is really too generous for this product as it is totally nonfunctional
if there was a way to grade it zero stars i would do sodo not buy this memory card because it is a stupid thrid party assery
it says it can hold mb of info because use can conpress the files
but the compressing is a pain
and to even use it on a game you have to put this special disk in
but when you put the disk in it shows you all of the files on the memory card
then the software is so stupid that you cant go to the game from it and have to restart
then agin you have to put the disk in to use the memory card
dont buy this memory card
stay with the first partydo not buy this memory card
i bought this card and have paid the price
i talked with a scea representative
he said this product will damage your ps after just one use or many times of use
it damaged my ps in late july
i bought my product in early april
i bought star wars super bombad racing and it worked on a friends ps
but i used it on mine and and odd noise popped up when i inserted the disc
it has done the same thing with  of my ps games
the representative said that the company has not licensed their product and it has not been tested on the ps
the representative said stick with the sony cards for they have been tested and approved on all ps games
besides you dont need mb of space
mb is fine
do not buy flash memory mb either this memory card holds twice as much space as the official sony card but isnt worth it
it is a pain to use this
you have to load up a disc to use the card
it is annoying to have to keep loading up a disc when you want to play
with the sony card you dont need to load anything
this card is also very unreliable because most of the time it will and i repeat will corrupt your game saves
if you were to buy this i would only keep it as backup never to use it
i would rather spend  dollars and gets  mbs of sony than the interact
wait until sony releases a bigger card
if you think about it  mbs is a lot when most of the games usually dont require more than  kb
you can definetely fit  games that arent sports madden nba k all star baseball  etc
sonys card is a must buythis game requires that you insert software and go through a series of motions to start a game
so basically it turns a simple thing like turning on the ps into an annoying little exercise that requires you to babysit the console for at least a minues
of course the box mentions nothing of this and successfully hides the cd that you need place in you console at the start of the powercycle
worst of all the package is designed in such a way that in order to even discover this youd have to tear apart the plastic box making it impossible to returngranted it works but its just damn annoying
would you buy a car if it required you to crank start the vehicle
would you at least want to know about
at least its readily available unlike other useful memory cards
of course the main selling point is that it contains mb of data
who cares
does anyone really use up all their mb memory cardneedless to say the second i saw a sony memory card i grabbed that and never used this piece of garbage againeven if you dont mind the extra annoyance of the loading time you should not buy this product
it will only encourage companies to deceive customersalmost every night i sit here and wonder why we have so many video games in the world
what makes this game even worse is the fact that it really wants to be a mario kart game
we already have mario kart so this game is pointlessthis game continues to get worse the more i play it
good luck trying to control your vehicle
i was never able to do that
i kept crashing and wouldnt be able to win any of the races
i really want you to avoid this game if you want to make your kid cry this is a good way confusing and counterintuitive interface
difficult steering of the car
cheating opponents enhance educational value
impossible to win races
your characters steals some car parts to make the game even more educationalironically enough the developer company is called attention to detail attention to what it is horrible it does not work i never got to play it dont buy  it always says reading disk and never worksthis game doesnt help in any way to supress the awful memories of casper spirit dimensionsps and the bible game ps xbox gba it just throws me deep into video game hell where the worst of my worst nightmares reside
this game is flawed in so many areas i cant think of anything good about this game
for one thing it is way too simplistic to the point of where it feels like the idiots guide on how to play a video game
youll mostly just spend your time upgrading you scare meter by collecting many many potions
when you finally scare you subject it doesnt feel rewarding even after you collect all those potions it just makes you angry that you wasted your time on this crappy game
so to keep it short the missions suck the controls suck the camera sucks the graphics suck the characters suck and the enemies suckthis game is a slap in the face of existing heroes fans
what were the programmers thinking
its an absolute debacle
first of all the combat is ridiculous
theres no hex grids no room for tactics and the concept of having heroes in battle unless they are very powerful is absurd since they are easily killed
laying seige to a castle is a complete joke since theres no way you can knock down walls the only way through is the gate and theres these ridiculous pillars behind the walls that give a huge advantage to the player who owns the castlewhats really missing in this game is immersion which existed in both heroes    and made them such excellent games
heroes  however feels empty for a number of reasons
buildings are ridiculously expensive
theres no more wait until the end of the week for new creatures  they replenish sporadically
you must choose between which armies youd like to have populate your castle eg choosing champions means you cant have angels and choosing monks means you cant have crusaders
theres no upgrades possible for units
you just get them and away you gothe hero system is stupid and biased
when youre weak you too easy to kill wheny youre strong youre too hard to kill
learning skills takes forever and even at level  youve only learned half of what youre able to
the game looks too flashy and the layout is way too complicated
so much for simple looking graphics  its hard to see exactly whats going on nowultimately heroes  is a total disaster with so many things wrong with it theres no way a heroes fan could possibly like it
as for people giving it  stars theyre probably just looking for helpful votes
listen to the rest of the people who have bagged this game and avoid it entirelymy brother beat this game for a friend it is horrible
the enemies are dumb the gameplay is easy and unchallenging
my brother got up to the halfway point of the game in like  and a half hour
the story does not deserve the title of bond
i thought this might be a good game
the shooting enemeis is like shooting poorly made slow robots with pittiful iqpros great graphicsa wide supply of gadgetscons pittiful enemy aicar missions are reppetetivevery shortvery easyhorrible storyboring gameplayisnt faithful to bonds stylecombat is basicly shooting slow and dumb enemiesbad gun designaverage multi playerokay after a game has been in development for this long  years you would expect it to be decent right
nope not in this caseill get the good out of the way first
its biggest strength is that the game is pretty
there are lots of cool explosions and some pretty spiffy bullet effects all while running at a very smooth framerate
the control isint too bad ethier for the playstation controller although not on par with goldeneyes aim
there is also alot of variety in the gameplay which is like a breath of fresh air every now and thennow for the bad
my biggest problem with the game is the enemy ai
its horrible
i mean really really awful
poop on a stick is smarter than these guys
for example one mission you go under cover and your not supposed to be spotted
so what do the guards do when they spot you
look at you stupidly for a couple of seconds fire a few shots stand in front of the alarm for  seconds then hit the alarm
its like they are just asking you to make one clean shot in the head its that bad
never expect a real fight when you face one on one with them
heck the only time it becomes a real challenge is when they are in numbersanother problem i beat the game in  hours
yes  freaking hours
as if the game wasnt easy enough its over in a weekend of playing it
i am very glad i only rented the title otherwise i would be seriously dissapointed with the gameand its not like the multiplayer saves the day ethier
it tries really hard to be like goldeneye only its a completely different engine so it would have been wise to devise a new style of deathmatch instead of trying to recreate rares masterpiece
the result is an easy less tactical and overall less fun multiplayer with weak levels too
the autoaim makes the entire thing pointless  just to make sure there will be billions of cheap plays by your friendsthe frequent loading times annoying repition of the theme its not that great and  story this wouldnt even work in a bond movie makes me wonder if ea can ever make a decent bond game
it saddens me everyone else is so pysched about this game too
there are such better ps games out there and to consider this one to be the best is a jokethis video game stank
rpgs are generally plotstorydriven
the plot on this story fizzled quickly
the relationships between characters were not really developed
given how linear the play was they could have taken some time to add something interesting
in the end i was playing just so i could be done hoping that there was some fantastic ending
turns out the final boss was easier than other bosses and the ending sequence was just boring
save your moneytheres really nothing special herethe music is irritating the graphics are on par with roly poly ollie only not as inspired or amusing the battle gameplay is not intuitive there are no voices for the characters only occasional narration and the humor is abysmal i sense they were going for a peewees playhouserocky  bullwinkle approach but it just doesnt come off
i dont mind having to go through some prep work before my first battle but  minutes is ridiculousparticularly if youre not given the opportunity to save before your first fight
yup killed in the rd battle never saw anything that would let the game be saved
this might something that was overlooked but well it shouldnt be possible to overlook saving your game should it
i understand that a part of the plot is that the main character ari is his default name blends into peoples shadows but the way he interacts with the other characters in the setup is ridiculous  things he says are frequently ignored by other characters and at one point your reply options are yes yes and yes
why give me the illusion of control over my character if youre not going to respect the choices i makeoverall very disappointing to me  it seemed like it had potential but honestly after dying over an hour into the game without ever being given a clear option to save i had no desire to go through the bad jokes againi ordered this gamepromp delivery
 daysthen i opend it amp put it inlow a behold it was a quotblue backquot aka cdrom
my ps never plays quotblue backsquotalong with hundreds if not thousands of other folkscheck the web
dvd format work greatany and all silver backs are fineproblem is you never know till its opendmost places wont take them backor will let you exachange it for another
likewhat good does that do
with all that saidi never played itthis game is stupid theres no point or story to the game all you do is go around shooting alians and watching them blow up
kids say the game rules when they havnt even played it
one question why is the game rated m and got best game of  if its so babyish
if you like this game your a big stupid idoit who likes chickens
this game sucks play sonic instedthis ame is terrible just terribleits just an average shooting game but only it has the worst controls it takes a joystick and a button to climb a ladderand the graphics are badits just plain badi dont think antone knows what the hell theyre talking about
halo is by far not the best shooter ever
it can be just as easily matched with duke nukem  for n
look i have a gamecube and if you want a real shooter send your piece of crap xbox to hell and get a gamecube
x box sux x cox
the only reason it even gets a  outa  is because its a gameif you have played good shooting games this is not for you
with limited weapons and vehicles as well as tiny multiplayer maps this game is ok but nothing makes in stand out
you would be just as happy with any other new shooting game
there really is no strategy what so ever it is straight forward shooting
i would reccomend buying one of the battlefield games or planetside for experienced gamerswhat is the big deal about halo
it is one of the worst and stupidest games i have ever played
i think people like it because all you do is kill aliens that are extreamly stupid
in one mission you can kill like  alien things and you die  times
the aliens even speak english
how would a thing billions of miles away from earth know how to speak english
i think that is just stupid
theres only like  weapons and  things you can ride in in the game
in the game the warthog and earth cars can never break or explode but the alien stuff can
another stupid thing is the missions are way too long
it takes abouut  hour to finish a mission
and once you die you come back to life
so anyone can beat the game
some aleins have invisible shields on them and you have to waste a lot of ammo on them
all you can carry is two guns and grenades
and since theres only like  weapons you allways pick up the same gun
theres only about  differnent kinds of aliens and they are all stupid
hunters are big alien things that are almost impossible to kill little stupid aliens that speak english and run away from you little aliens with shields big aliens that have invisible shields around them and they chase you floods that when you kill them little ball thing with no guns come out and jump and pop on you theres more but they are mainly the same as the ones i just wrote but they are different colors or are bigger or smaller
if you like combat games dont buy this because all you do is kill dumb aleins
it is not hard at all
dont buy it the game itself while somewhat neat looking was ridiculous
i felt like i was being attacked by hordes of muppets as thats what the enemies looked like
the weapons were all stupid and unrealistici used to like this game alot
now that i dont like it anymore i find it quite unusual how people worship it
there was alot of hype over this game when it came out and its probably the only reason why xbox sales were doing so well back then
ive pretty much gone back to playing pc games and my xbox has been collecting alot of dust lately
actually the reason why i hate this game now is because of my friends
they used to make fun of halo then somehow the demonic entity known as halo took over their minds their bodies and their souls
we played everyday
they took it way too seriously and i cant stand playing halo with them anymore
i began to notice some bad things about haloeverything about the game is way too childish
you play an invincible godlike character who just cant die thanks to his recharging shield and the powerups laying all over the place
the aliens are wimpy and cheesy
plus theres an alien race that rips off john carpentars the thing
most of the game levels look the same
there were some variety but not enoughweapon names are too obvious
quotes from people playing quotoh im really good with the sniper riflequot quotshotguns are good when you want to fight somebody up closequot quotyou use the pistol way too muchquotvehicles were invincible
at least the warthog and the tank was
how come most of the alien vehicles could be destroyedtheres alot of other things i could say about halo
i believe there was too much hype when the game was just like any other first person shooter
what really destroyed halo was when it was released for xbox instead of for pc like it was intended too so it could boost xbox sales
the game probably never even reached its full potential thanks to the xbox
the game doesnt even looked finishedthe plot has way too much hope in it
even though the human race is being annihilated by an alien race known as the covenant everything is hopeful because of the god you play as
at least with halflife there was almost no hope because there was aliens as well as soldiers trying to kill youhalo could have been a great game but xbox ruined it
pc version is not any better eitherthis isnt a gameits an evil entity from youknowwhereits come to take over the human raceand its succeedingit almost got me
i rented it then realized within minutes that i was playing a clump of manure not a superb and divine game experience
i truly believed that rpgs saved meif you find your psyche being taken over by this evil feverish disease known as halo quickly play ffvii or chrono cross
its the only cure
and now the evil entity has devised a way to clone itself
thats right halo  is upon us and the foolish public still hasnt wised up
run while you still can dear reader
you may think youre too clever to be tricked by evil but this is such a twisted machination that it even made game informer its mindless puppet
if you must have an fps buy metroid primenintendo is the only savior from the demonspawn that is halothis game could have been so good if only you could tell which direction youre going
all the walls look the same
all the rooms look the same
its all the same
boring with gunfire
without a compass or map how do you know if youve been there already
oh you dont
i realize this is a fun first person shooter but the sameness of every room put me off fps games foreverthis game just plainly sucks
whoever plays this game needs to find something else to do even if its to go down to the local park and pick up trash thats how bad this game is
this games realism is as low as anyone who plays it
the game itself lacks in every aspect of orginal concept
everything from the weapons to stages even the monsters are ruboffs from other shooters and cheap scifi flicks
this game has no realism again the concept is terrible and nothing is original
i am glad this game is only on xbox so the other systems wouldnt have to bare its embarassment
whoever plays this game should second guess their actions and remember what their looking at
a cheaply put together game with annoying scifi gadgets and the most annoying looking costumes ever
if i were you i would settle with doom  or even wolfenstien
dont bother buying this game if you do youll be disappointed and embarassed
make sure your friends dont see it this game is not fullfilling the graphics are terrible and all you have to do it put in a simple code and you beat itif you like racing games which i dont you will find this game frustrating and hardfor once in my lifetime i am telling you not to buy this xbox gamethis game is not realistic racing you can barely turn if you are going over  miles per hour around a curve which happens alot
and then you cant even crash you just bounce off the other car like its a rubber ball
please do not even rent this game unless you just love almost every racing game thats been madewhen i saw trailers for this game something looked really fishy and when i finally bought the game and played it myself i found the problem
this game seems to have some serrious bugs having to do with the steering
not only this but the game is down right impossible and you have to earn every conflabbed car
also when you earn quotkudosquot the game takes a while to process the information and finally when your are done sliding or whatever you start again and if you hit a wall after that a matter of seconds after you are done sliding you will lose all of your earned kudos from that and all of that hard work vanishes into dust
also back to the steering the game seems to slip and slide very easily even if you just tap the stick at  mph the biggest complaint though is that this game was supposed to take advantage of the system with great graphics this game is laggy slow and has terrible gameplay
dont make the mistake that i did with this game
this is a horrible game on the xbox and it makes me feel one more ounce of anger that the xbox couldnt shape up the games that came out on release
there have been many games so far on the xbox that have been eye candy
dont buy this game
you will regret it laterremember msr for dreamcast
obviously not if you cam to the buying screen
it was an awkward racing game boasting innovative ideas that failed
the graphics were nice but the game wasnt fun
i instintly was reminded of that game while reading about project g  then i read it is the same development teamwant a boring experience with clumsy play control
then pick this poor excuse for a killer app up
you will appreciate mario and sonic more but that still wont get you your money backthis game really stinks
who thought this game would rock
i hated it
i got my hopes up because it recieved so much hype
i talked to others that have played this game and they all said that they were turned of by itoverall i think this game is boring
i actually liked the demo better that the actual game itself
i thought the worst thing about it is that you need soooo many powerups to progress though the game very time consumingand one player mode is boring maybe if there were at least a two player mode than it would be a lot betterwords of advice
dont buy it even if it is on sale if you are really tempted rent it
and the only reason i rated it a one is because the graphics are pretty coolhalo is a much better game
i started with azurik and it ws fun
then  minutes later i tried halo then mx and  more games
azurik was way below my expectations
this game is the least fun i have ever had
compared to other games this is sooo dumb
the storyline is just like zelda you gotta save some dumb planet from people
the graphics are only good on the videos
and i dont even want to start about the controls
i reccomend renting this game and spending your good  on haloazurik reminds me a little of turok dinosaur hunter from years ago except the premise is far less interesting and the main character is blue
yep blue
one of those ridiculouslooking japanese anime characters with tattoos and whackedout hair
worse he appears to be made of a stiff plastic which makes him move with the realism of a barbie doll
seriously he marches up steep hills without a single knee flexthe textures are nice but the animation quality in azurik is very poor by todays standards
those of you who are saying this game really showcases the xbox should try a few more games
the music is a poor attempt at a movie score and the creatures you have to battle are as dumb as posts
the birds that fly around are animated so badly that i burst out laughing
but worst of all the controls in azurik are so lame that you have to spend half your time and energy just managing centering the camera so you can see whats going onthe bottom line
this is microsofts worst xbox game and if i were the product manager i would have pulled the plug
stick with the likes of halo munchs odyssee project gotham racing cel damage and any ea sports game for stateoftheart funazuriks an interesting game
the elemental combination system thats at the heart of the game is an interesting one and could have provided for some unique and creative puzzles situations and combat
however in many respects the game falls flat on its facecombat for one as frequent as it is is entirely uninteresting
aaab is the name of the game and while youve got to make sure youre using the right elemental combinations the lack of a reward for beating a monster they respawn you gain no experience and often end up using more quotelemental fuelquot than you regain is negligiblethe game is billed as an actionadventure
adventure games are generally about two things  seeing the sights and solving some puzzles
the sights are a mix of good and bad
while theres clearly a lot of geometry up on the screen its not really put to good effect
textures are detailed close up but muddy from the distance youd normally look at them from
poor levelofdetail control
the level design is also often pointless and very easy to get lost in due to the repetitive nature of the levelsazuriks cardinal and unforgivable sin however is that there is no logic to the game
the puzzles are simply to find the pieces of the elemental discs and their respective powers and use them where youre told to
there are a few puzzles that actually require some thought but even then theyre more illogical and trialanderror based than not
had there been any indication of where you might look to solve your current problem the game would have been worlds betteralas the lack of logic in the puzzles and level designs the poor floaty controls the repetitive and boring combat and the atrocious save system yes theres a save anywhere cheat
it can also permanently ruin your game forcing you to start all over again if you use it wrong make azurik a pass for all but the most hardcore adventure gamers
but the problem then is that the hardcore have seen games much better than thiswhich do you like
if you choose quotgoodquot go to the order sheet for maden  or nfl k both going to the xbox
this game focusses on graphics also found in the other options but the others have perfect gameplay mechanics judging by the similar games found on other systems
its you choice good or badi have had this game for a long time and it was so horrible i didnt even want to write a review on it but then i thought other people would get the game thinking it will be good like the first one  well i thought the first one was good
the game sounds great with  cars and over  add on parts but they realy dont do that much to the cars handleing
the grafics arnt the best but they are ok but one of the things that made me realy mad was they took ford out of the companys on the list for cars and they had some of the best cars for off road racing
it is impossible to win a race because the controlls are hard and the other cars seem to go at least  miles an hour faster than you even the exact same car
i have a cheat to get  dollars and you cant buy those specialized racing cars without doing so many races even if you have the money and i put all of the most exspensive parts and the best parts to help me increase my speed but i still lost and i am very good at racing like on the first one and on other racing games
so i would not recomend this to any one at allthis game was an utter disappointment
the music is absolutely terrible possibly the worst of any video game
and the graphics are retro looking
come on with the power that the xbox has i thought the graphics would be better
the game is extremely difficult and is dull and lacks excitement
the missions are all basically the same as eachother which is to eliminate the enemy planes
dont run out and buy
rent it if you feel like its something youd like but dont buy it unless youve rented and liked it
i returned after the first day of having it
my suggestion would be to buy a game worth the money like halo or max payne or anything but thisi really dont know what i can say about this game that is good
i waited so long for this to be released and them finally it comes out and there is no season mode  there is a lack of a good roster  characters like kkwik and haku are included but no rvd or bookert or ddp no alliance members at all except for those in the wwf prior to the invasion
the characters walk bowlegged like they just got released from a prison or something
come on this is microsoft cant you come up with something a little better even smackdown just bring it is ten times better than this and create a wrestler especialy stinks on this game  this game took long enoughto get out on the market  so why not pull it off the shelf and take a little more time and give us a game that is actually worth the wait and the money i feel ripped off and i just rented it for  bucks so i wonder how someone who buys it is going to feel
dont get me wrong i am a huge wrestling fan i have even been to a recent pay per view  no mercy and it was awsome so im not disliking this game cause its a wresling game i dislike it cause they spent way too long on it for it to turn out the way it did
hope this helps some of you out thereafter playing this game a while longer ive decided that giving it the two star rating i gave it earlier was too generous on my part
this game is bad on so many levels that i cant even address them allgreat graphics should not be the primary selling point of a  wrestling game
nor should grand entrances of the wrestlers
to all the reviewers out there who are so easily impressed by the entrances  go watch a video of raw or something
who cares what the entrance looks like when the game is this badive seen some reviewers upset that there are no talking announcers on this game
hey thats one of the few bright spots  i dont have to turn off some inane commentary that repeats itself over and over again
who cares about listening to announcers when the gameplay is this badthis is supposed to be a wrestling game not mortal kombat
the matches are ridiculously short and the characters move like robotsfor the love of god what would make thq drop the development team from aki and pick up an inferior group like anchor
theyre almost as bad as the people from yukes who make those even worse wrestling games for the psi own a lot of xbox games
this def
is the worst one
i guess some of the things in the game are considered cool by the younger crowd
however if you are an older player like myself im in my twenties you def
wont like this onei was not impressed by the graphics
as a software developer i have to say that the xbox can do much better
while you can recognize your characters they certainly arent lifelikebut worst of all is the gameplay
in a tagteam match my two opponents actually started to fight each other and one tried to actually pin the other
what a farce
when you hit people there are way to few moves btw and knock them to the ground their bodies mysteriously slide around on their backsi was hoping for a wrestling game that would rival games such as dead or alive  but this is a serious disappointmenta few words before i begin my reviewignore my others for this gamethese are the true factsfirst of all the wrestlersthe faces look like bugs bunnys expression after he has the gun in his face in the hands of elma faudsecond of all the lack of wrestlersnow im not going to sit here all day naming the missing wrestlers but i can name two of the basic ones missinghulk hoganbooker tthird of all you cant climb ladderswhatyou cant climb them but you can knock em out with themsame with the tablesfourth of all hers an examplei was the undertaker and kane against spike dudley and jeff hardyi performed two chokeslams in a row followed by a wild ride or whatever his finisher his and the wrestler sha zam popped right back up in a ourth of a secondmy advice if you  want this game rent it any lower dont even waste  bucksi am a huuuuuge wrestling fan and have played all the others and loved them but this was a dissssssssssssaaaaapppppooooooiiiiiiittttttmmmmmeeeeennnnntttwwf raw is a perfect example of great packaging to mask a horrible game
this has to be the biggest disappointment i have personally ever had as a video game playerowner
i had such monumental high hopes for it and it fell flat on every levellets take a look and see how thq dropped the ball  possibly the worst createawrestler ever
costumes colors faces masks are extremely limited or else so goofy youd never want to use them
games for the psx and n completely dominate the pitful options here
forget trying to make any ecw wcw or superhero characters
youre limited to three skin colors and only  color options for clothing no text additions on shirts either  limited match options
no cage match
no royal rumble
no survivor series
no blood
no lumberjack
come on
games like warzone and attitude for the psx even had these options
and correct me if im wrong werent some of these options supposedly offered when the game was being previewed  confusing game play
although the moves and fighting style are nice the camera angle shifts way too often to allow you to stay focused  music and save options
compare this game to the other xbox offerings like gotham city racing for the music or halo for save and game options and youll be crying in your soup
on a hard drive the size of the xbox this game actually limits you in saving caw and match options
limits the size of  wrestlers
phawi could go on and on about why i think this game is a titanic waste of time money and expectations but i wont
thq needs to take a good look at classic wrestling games like the psxs wwf attitude or ns wrestlemania  because with their newest offering they have taken wrestling games backa huge stepyeah its pretty safe to say that this is the worst wrestling game ever made
the only good thing was the graphics
royal rumble on the dreamcast was better than this display of cow  thats why i say the xbox stinks down with thq
you want real wrestling
i suggest you hang on tight for the backyard wrestling game cuz thats the only way youll get the extremethis game pretty much has the best definition of sucksthe entrance videos you can watch is cool in the history section or whatever you call it
but the game is pretty much badprosgood graphicsyou can watch there full music videos in the history biagraphy thingand thats pretty much itconsvery slow pacedgets boring after  minutesno season modeno street fightno hell in the cellfor crying out loud theres not even a friggin cage match here
even the original raw for psx had more crap than thisno divas i thinkgraphics can get fuzzyand moredont get this game trust me
go with smackdown shut your mouth and here comes the painthis game sucksto make it short this was a terrible game this was one of the reasons i got an xbox but this was just plain dissapointing and the matches are very outdated especially for the time this game came out
its justterriblethe visuals were pretty good but thats pretty much itthe rest it all falls downdont get this game if you want a good wrestling game get wwe smackdown here comes the pain for ps
other then that out of  starslatesive heard of the things about all  the grand theft auto games and theyre   its  to go around killing innocent people and police men
its  to go around destroying peoples property
this applies to everyone
ive never actually played this game but ive learned things about it
its  dont buy iti was very excited to try this game the reality is that this game is sick
what kind of a reflection on our society is it that we produce a game which glorifies beating old people with bats running over cops and shooting cops
i am not against violence per se because we have all grown up playing cowboys and indians or cops and robbers pretending to have guns and shooting each other
that has been going on since time immemorial ever since it was cave dweller vs bear
many games involve shooting or death but usually you are on some kind of quest to save the world
in this game you are glorified for senseless acts of cruelty
i do not find this amusing or even funny
after playing for a few hours i felt dirty as though i were committing evil
if you pretend to commit crimes that is not a good thinghere is a word that discribes this game bad i know that some people like bad as it helps to bring excitement to their otherwise mundane lives
but your life can be so much more if you use the time you play this game to improve you situation and get the respect you want by doing things for others
oh yeah here are a few other words for this game abominableamiss atrocious awful bad news beastly blah bottom out bummer careless cheap cheesy crappy cruddy crummy defective deficient diddly dissatisfactory downer dreadful erroneous fallacious faulty garbage awful gross grungy icky imperfect inadequate incorrect inferior junky lousy not good off poor raunchy rough sad scuzzy sleazeball sleazy slipshod stinking substandard synthetic the pits unacceptable unsatisfactoryi bought this game and played it since it got such rave reviews from this website and i sucessfully completed many missions
however the game was just not fun
stealing cars and having sex in the car is only fun for so long
the game gets awefully repetitive and boring and i dont recommend this game
very overhyped
if you want to play the best get gran turismo the game save feature isnt working although i have two memory cards installed
the riding around is making me car sickthis might be more fun for kids who dont yet have a license for the sense of cruising around that it does provide
but for this  year old it is pretty close to torture to play this game
i can appreciate the programming but the game play isnt for me
driving around doesnt cut itthis game is horrible with tons of unneccisary killinggraphics the guys are all blocky
not nearly what it was made out to besound
okay
i have to give it props on its more than great voice acting but that does not redeam this horrible gamestory go around and blow people up
this game focuss way more on killing than stealing carsreplay
its all the same
steal shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot steal shoot shoot etccharacters
brainless stupid evil peopleprosgreat voice actingconslots of evil mindless slaughterlittle storybland graphicsan insult to your intellegenceoverall fun buy this game if you get pleasure from watching people die cruel painful deaths
if not play a good action adventure game like devil may cry or onimushaalright thats enough people wait for tekken vf or even soul calibur no matter how long it takes
its worth the waitwhy
the first  were awsome
this one is just bad
i beat it at the store
gamecube is better
xbox is bad
it looks like dead or alive  is deadthis controller feels like you are holding a big rock
there is no comfort in it
the buttons are also hard to reach if you have small handsno scrub that if your hands arent the size of a regular pumpkinthe xbox controller is a horrible controller
there are many reasons why it is this bad
the  reason why this is bad is because it is so dang chunky
for those with little hands this controller is absolutely out of the question
you need a map to find all the buttonsobviously just kidding
the controller is the source of your gameplaying skills and being chunky well beng chunky aint good
another reason of the teribbelnessis that a word is the shape and placement of the buttons
i mean comeon oval
the buttons are also stuck on the tippy top of the controller whichagain means that this will be tough for the little handed ones
this is the pain lovers best friend because youre going to be experiencing just that
this pad is also well extrmely ugly
 for this messcome onsure the xbox has some good games but come on we dont need pain just to play a game
we have enough pain in real life
atleast microsoft of japan has a smaller controllerthis controller stinks big time
the buttons are small and poorly located after  minutes your hands get sweaty and sore this horrible controller would i think stop most people from getting xbox its very fat and hard to find the right buttons the dpad feels like hard lumpy potatoes and is hard for nonveterans to use
just all the buttons feel like theyre in the wrong spot
it could of worked if it wasnt so weirdits too big the button layout stinks and it looks really stupid
better luck next time microoftthat stupid contorller is soo big it wont fit anywhere
trust me like my review on the system you dont want it
stick with computers microsoftwhy  star
because you need it
otherwise you can not use dvds on your xbox
i do not understand how microsoft can release such a simple remote
this isnt a remote control its a toy that belongs with the likes of little tikes
remote controls represent manhood this item represents happy mealslook at sonys quotofficialquot remote control for the ps
look at the button options
why did microsoft feel that they should produce such a simple product
onscreen menus instead of button selectionsi feel cheated
i even called the xbox help desk and inquired about a good remote control and was treated with quotthat is the final product
there will be no other option
maybe a second generation company will produce one you are satisfied withquotok you can watch dvds on the xbox
but did we tell you that you had to buy another gadget to unlock that feature
no
you can slap in a cd and a nice little onscreen menu pops up that you can use the game controller to use
but you have to go buy something else if you want to watch a dvd  also it wont scan into a song
i have a cd with some very long songs
i want to get to the middle of the song and not hear the whole thing but i cant
also needs an off button very badlynot for xbox 
this product is not for the  and it would have cost me more to ship it back than it cost
i was very disappointing and i have no use for this
i probably will give it to gamestop or goodwill
waste of money
i specifically searched for xbox  receiver and this came up first
this is not for the xbox pros nonecons bad graphicsboring gameplaymoney system guarentees youll be broke unless you stick to th tightest budget possible
its just like roller coaster tycoonunecaseraly hardmore furnishing animals cages and keeping them happy than running a zooprice is overdown this plays like agame out off a bargain boxwith in  hour of playing it youll start to loose intrestbefore i start i would like to state that i am a diehard ea fan especially for their sports games
 in addition i think that the nhl series is the best sports series ever
the games for genesis were groundbreaking  the computer games perfected the realistic feel
that said this is the worst nhl hockey game i have ever played  ive played every single one so im a video game nut
the game is virtually ruined by the slow gamepace
the players skate very slowly especially when they have the puck
if you have a breakaway you can bet that someone will hack you down or just kind of skate around you before you get close to the goalie
so considering that the defense skates twice as fast as the offense you would think that you may get some nice checks  physical gameplay wrong
the checking is mild  unrealistic
it doesnt even account for momentum
this means that a standing check is just as devastating as a check where you have a running head start
even the original nhl back in  accounted for this
as a final gripe the players arent accurately rated something ea is usually good atbasically not much difference in this version or the ps
high skyhook shots from the post is the biggest downfall
slow play on the advanced level makes a baller play on stater just for excitement
nbak is much better becuase at least you get a few real game steals by jumpming live has none of that
for true vets live lost it when k hit the scene
dont get stuck with games like this zero fun
graphics are very marginal for powerful xboxs capabilities
run from this one and wait one more year on hoops gamesurei liked hydro thunder on n but this is to much
i must say waveracebluestorm is a better buy on a better buy systemquothorrible gamequot is not enough to express how boring this game isyou cant see the characters when they fight there is no visual flair to the spells and the enemy movements are weak and minimal
oh and there is no actual plot its nonlinear
too bad
i guess ill go back to watching for the dragonball z game for gbabah i found dragon warrior  seriously lacking in all aspects and wish i would have rented it before i bought it
i stuck with it for about five or six hours and when the game still failed to interest me i gave up
the fighting is just as boring as the storyline and the plot seems to fall out of no where into your lap with little explanation as to how the son of a fisherman would be best buds with the prince
furthermore theres just no excuse for those horrible graphics other then laziness
the cut scenes dont even have a small bit of sound like walking or a rock slate being slid open
im all for games that focus on storyline before graphics but this one dropped the ball in both areas
this game seems to be one either you love or you hate from the mix reviews ive seen so id encourage you to try out a friends copy first unless you know and love the seriesthis game is gorgeous and the perspective is unique and fantastic
unfortunately some controls do not translate as well from computer mouse or gamepad to ps as they couldi had such high hopes for this game but i am just not able to use both analog joysticks the l and r buttons and the button pad at the same time
call me uncoordinated despite the fact that i have been playing video games since before there were home video game systems
 but i dont want to give myself carpal tunnel syndrome from playing a gamei would also like to state that quotbullettimequot was a neat style of visual effect in the matrix
it is not something i want to see in shooting games in the future as it just adds a level of implausibility to an otherwise realistic gamethis game in my opinion is terrible
though i must admit it did have probably the most stable mmorpg launch of all time that still doesnt fix the actual problems with the game
first off leveling in the game is rather easy and im sure there already people that have achieved level   second pvp is supposed to be a big deal in the game but because the classes are so unbalanced it makes most pvp battles unfair
the game also lacks in visual quality of the graphics
yes the graphics are nice but they definitely do not compare to anarchy onlines graphics
this is just a wanna be everquest that failed in my opinion
if you want a good mmorpg i suggest anarchy online or everquesti waited for months for this game to come out and when i actually got it i almost threw up at the poor graphics and the awful voice acting
the story cant be that great but i would not know as i sold it after playing it for ten minutes
there are not  job classes you can make your own however
i really doubt anyone who hadnt played the pc version was expecting this
and afterplaying this you will realize that it is all hyperent it if you are really interestedthe biggest problem with this game it can create problems with your xbox
apparently it saves progress in such a way that it can start to crash frequently
ive read some online stories of people who have had to have their xbox repaired after using this so be carefulthe other downside is that it is just plain boring
you can walk and walk and walk with little actionin its defense it is the only game ive seen with such a big and openended world
there is simply a huge amount of terrain you can wander around with a huge amount of freedom to do whatever you want kill monsters steal stuff find food buy thingsman i was really wanting to play this game for a long time
i thought that all of the possibilities would be awesome
but then i played the game and realized i am way too stupid for it
yeah i didnt know what i was doin
i figure that too enoy this game youve gotta be some kinda hardest of hardcore rpg player that understands this stuff
an average person will get confused to death by this
a lot of people have a different view and know exactly what they are doing they are who this game is for
newbies step away far awayunfortunately thats not very long
a splendid game made all but unplayable by bugs and crashes
get the pc versionfirst off the game itself is great but not good enough to warrant purchasing the xbox version after hours of play the game will crash continually until the point you cant move through certain citys without it locking up and you havent to wait through extremely long load times to get back
do yourslef a favor and pick up the pc version insteadthis is not issue just experienced by me apparantly the xbox runs out of memory and when loading a new area the game locks up taking forever however if you dont beat everything and constantly make new characters you shouldnt run into problemsplay at your own riskif youve ever played the final fantacy series especially the latest one you will be very very disappointedthe game playes in a limited area and revolves around solving puzzles
so far so good but the load time between scenes is horribly long and annoying
im a gamer and i could sit hours and play a good game but this one puts me to sleep after an hour
every turn you make you enter a new scene remember there are limited number of scenes to start with and youll have to stare into a black now loading screen for up to  secondsi dont recommend it for anyone over i rented this game to play with my girlfriend
after watching the uninspiring cut scenes which could have been done on a super nes we were ready for the boating action
unfortunately the deathmatch and storyline games are both so bleak and repetitive this game would qualify as the first shareware xbox game except it costs as much as a quality game like halo
after a few games i returned it straight to blockbuster even though there were still three days left on the rental
im really glad i bought ssx tricky just after i rented blood wakethis is the absolute worst game i have ever playedpros
nice water graphicsconsbullets are tiny and orange so you cant tell if you shot or notall you do is shoot stuffit takes a million shots to kill another boatits just plain boringnote dont play this game
do yourself a favor and stay far far awayok
its called blood wake wheres the blood and a  yr old could beat this game easily i should know i watched one play this game sucksthps is so much fun and it has infinate replay value so this should too right
sadly no
only  tricks are customizeable but thats not the problem
no one has ever heard of any of the guys except maybe the quotslim jimquot mascot but characters names dont matter either
so what is the problem
speed
think about it in thps you start out fast you recover fast and you never really slow down
in this you go slow until you hit a hill take  minutes to get up and once you stopyou take your sweet time speeding up again
ever ride an actual singlespeed bike
hard to pedal right
espescially up hills
same here you pedal like crazy and go nowhere
but you get there fast
seriously preorder thps and steer clear of thisthe graphics are are worse than n
the game is boring beyond anything ive ever played
the controls dont make any sense
highly recommend buying something elsei dont have this game i only played it at a few stores
i beat a couple bosses and got bored of it right after that
i would expect this game to have come out on the nes and it still would have been a bad game
the plot is boring and repetative and there arent any twists to the story  suck up a ghost beat up a boss ghost suck up more beat up another boss ghostplus its a lot like blinx the time sweeper xbox and thats a way better gameas a long time fan of the super mario series i have seldom if ever been disappointed by any games in the entire series from donkey kong and i do mean the original arcade game that started it all all the way to super mario  given nintendos track record with this series and the absolute high quality of games for its new gamecube platform i had every reason to think that luigis mansion even if it was not up to the level of its predecessors would be a quality entry in the series
i have to say that i was sorely disappointedi have a certain level of tolerance for games even ones that are frustratingly slow and plodding but i ran out of patience with this game
i could barely even get into playing it
from the very beginning this game gets annoying
when luigi first enters the mansion he encounters this stupid little professor who is supposedly there to give luigi the background of what is happening in the mansion and teach him to use this vacuum cleaner to capture the ghosts that haunt the mansion
yet the idiotic professor rambles for about  minutes worth of dialogue and there is no way to bypass it
after each brief piece of dialogue you have to hit a button to make it continue too
so you just cant do something else while he rambles
but i digress
you would think that once you get past that annoyance you could just get right into the game
wrong
learning to use the vacuum cleaner is incredibly aggravating
the game doesnt give you any chance to develop a feel or flow for how to use it because every time you do anything with it that stupid professor starts yapping again
this alone caused me to put the game aside for about  months before trying it again
once i finally exerted enough patience to get past this madness i figured i would finally be able get into the game
once again i was wrong
i find that almost every door is locked and any method of getting through those doors is hidden somewhere on the board
i had the strategy guide and could very well have looked up how to open these locked doors but at this point i was just too frustrated to care anymore
i put the game down for the last timeat first i was looking forward for this game  but when i got it i was disapointed heres whyprossound  terrible music sound terrible voice acting e gadds voicegameplay  the levels are very hard and confusingcontrols  they are difficult to use when you are trying to suck up the ghost in that vaccumbut if youre a fan of challange then this is the game for you  but if you cant stand the frausration then you know what i meant by my reviewall my friends told me this game is a lot of fun so i put it on my christmas listwhen i played it i thought it stunkit doesnt make any sensenote to nintendonever ever give luigi his own game againluigis mansion is a definite nono
the controls on the game are weak it is completely boring and the storyline is too original
when luigi enters the mansion its nothing but cleaning a dusty old house
this game is very boring because there is nothing to do on itlets face the truth luigis mansion isnt a video game at all but a demo of the gcns capabilities
it sure does a great job of showing off everything the system can do but thats not what a game is supposed to accomplish
ooh big fancy pretty graphics im so freakin impressed
the gameplay is downright terribleand lets not forget that it commits the worst faux pas of the mario series an earthbound protagonist
how dare they publish a mario game in which you cant jump
its unthinkable i tell youthis game is stupid and childish if your like michael heim grow up nintendo is for babys and mommas boys get the ps or xbox those have better gamesps dont you notice how  of all the games for the gcn are rated e and only one good game is rated m get the picture boys grow up i rented this game because of other reviews but the graphics arent that great
the graphics are like super mario  the buttons are so darn confusing
once i tried to seperate my pikmin in colours and they all ran away
the game is to short its a game that most people would beat in one day
the story line is your rocket gets hit by an asteroid and you land on a weird planet
your oxygen supplie will only last you  pikmin days
you lost thirty parts of your ship that spread out all over the pikmin world
one pikmin day is like  minutes so that means you only get  minutes of gameplay
one other thing if you use all  days and youve only found  or less parts you die and have to start a new game
you dont even fight you dont controll the pikmin
you just stand there while they kill the bad guy  boring 
if you dont believe me still dont buy the game just rent it youll seenever have i seen a game more engulfed in quotmiyamotos cursequot a term i use to describe shigeru miyamotos recent trend of mediocrity in his design
in fact im beginning to wonder what happened his early work was so fantastic yet this is so notthe problem with pikmin the problem being miyamotos curse is too big a focus on innovation so big that no room is left for anything else
the team that designed pikmin completely forgot to make sure it was any fun to play
they didnt even care
all that mattered to them it seems was that their final product be innovative unique and full of fancy gimmicks never seen before
and while such things are indeed fine and good i should know i myself am a game designerprogrammer they alone can never make a good video gameit looks as if all of pikmins levels were designed over the course of two or three days
the attention given to them is pitiful
ill grant you that the engine is quite impressive but so what
it means nothing to me as a gamer
as a programmer however im very intriged and i sure would love to see the source code
its a shame nintendo doesnt believe in the open source movement eh
so since most people playing pikmin arent programmers im guessing theyll get nearly nothing out of it
nothing but eyecandy anywaythis game although somewhat fun with  people has a terrible single player mode and fight physics that rival that of my grandmother
hardcore fighting fans must steer clear from this abomination of a game
inevitably once you get  friends over to play the game does become fun but then surely gets repetitive
as you play for a week you master it without any real skill involved and in the end your just said you spent  bucks on a mediocre party gamedont buy unless your have a  year old kid who has  friends following him aroundsuper smash bros was a dissapointing game there was no storyline what so ever once you beat everything there was nothing more to dodamn i wished the producers would put more places and characters in the gamegraphics are terrible
this game is boring and the game play is so bad its not worth playing
do not play this
also allen poe is a sick man
this game is not scary at all
re however
scared me
it was amazing gameplay this game however isnt i would not play this again
skip itnot going to lie i was not a fan at all
its like weird resident evil type play but so much harder to follow the story or even know what you should even be doing half of the timefirst of all this game is way too hardon the rd leverl for godssakes and you dont care whether the character lives or diesi like games that are challenging like zelda and metroid but to have something be really difficult on the rd level is just ridiculousyoure much better off with resident evil if you want a good game that is rated mim so glad i rented this thing instead of bought iti already want to return it its so horriblethis game is absolutely horrible
the playabilty is poor and the graphics are barely mediocre
dont waste your money the reviews said this is good but i mustve missed something in the tutorial
i thought the soldiers were supposed to fire on their own
its very realistic but i apparently failed to get the fun of the gameif anyone can advise me on this please commenti have all the rainbow six games and i think this is a stumbling attempt to create a battlefiel war game
i think it was stupid of ubi and red storm to put somthing this pitiful out there with operation flashpoint out its good if you like the rainbow six series but if you want somthing a little better go for operation flashpointgot this game for me and my nephew but we couldnt install it on windows  i got it to run by running xp in a virtual desktop and it worked fine
however no matter what type of compliance we ran in w it just wouldnt even install but it wasnt meant to i dont guessno big deal thoughi just need to read before jumping on to buy next time
someone else mentioned it in commentsso now i am a commenter fanunlike rogue spear and urban operations which were developed by the very talented people at red storm entertainment black thorn was developed by a team of ubisoft employees in their montreal office who were trained by people from rse but who obviously lack their talent
the level design modelling and particularly the texturing were secondrate and amateurish and doesnt compare to the quality of rses work on the previous installments in the rainbow sixrogue spear seriesif you are a fan of red storm entertainments work then it might be worth buying for the bonus cd american version only that contains a feature on the making of ghost recon but dont expect black thorn to be on par with red storm entertainments previous work in rogue spear or urban operations or even covert operations for that matter
if it werent for the bonus cd about ghost recon i would have returned it and asked for my money back its that badcontrary to the rave reviews that ubisoft employees have been posting around the net posing as fans and customers black thorn is by far the worst in the series  hardly quotthe bestquot as they have been claimingi see many other reviews raving about the graphics
theyre right
stunning
but to use an analogy  a beautiful woman with a poor personality makes for a lousy date
this star wars games is very beautiful but poor personality
flaw this game is just too hard
remember the star wars scene where luke loops rope around walkers
its in the game but insanely difficult
it took me about  attempts
not funthen i went against some shield  planet base
 minutes of boredom cruising through asteroids followed by  minute of insane punishment by killer guns
dead
repeat  more minutes of asteroid boredom
repeat
repeat
repeat
argh
then i had to kill a star destroyer
one tiny fighter against a destroyer
nuts
 hours later  about  attempts i just barely beat it with about  life left
it was frustrating not fun
now im on some planet where i get killed off in about  minutes
ive repeated this level another  times already and i made some progress but im not enjoying the time wasted
isnt that what gamings about
fun
well this aintim dumping this game
frankly id rather go replay colony wars or starfox or elite
they may not look as pretty but they make for better dates
all were challenging wo making you feel like a hampster stuck in an infinite rolling wheel
and they were funokay i like nintendo but its just gettin old i mean at e they showed a new game called ddr well its new because it has mario in it they copy great games and turns them into crappy versionsbut anyways the game cube is okay it just needs to be more less childishnintendo is turning crap the only good consoles of all time would be the nes and the snes
dont buythis really stinksmy cousin has it and he likes itbut the buttons are too far awaythis stinks
dont buy itthis stinksi own an xbox but decided to get a gamecube just to play some of the mario titles and some other exclusive titles to gamecube
all the games which i bought are all fantastic and provide endless fun
however the system itself leaves alot to be desired
i always thought of the gamecube as the worst of the current three consoles but actually owning one made me realise its one of the worst consoles ever
the xbox controller s is one of the best controllers ever and the ps controller isnt so badbut the gamecube controller is horrific
never have i seen or held such a terrible controller
it feels totally wrong and looks even worse
the original controllers cord is also terribly short
the startup screen for the system and the menu screen are also disgusting especially when you compare them to a system like the xbox
the system cant play dvds or audio cds unlike the other two competitors
every extra capability must be purchased as an addon
there are only two memory card slots compared to xboxs two slots per controller
even the power cord sucks with its large adapter
there are a few positive points however such as the very compact size of the system the nice small size of the gamecube discs and standard  controller ports
however these small extras dont make up for the absolute nonsense the actual system is
the exclusive games however are fantastic and make the system worth it
after all games are why you buy a gaming system
this review was only an assessment of the actual hardwarei did receive the unit on time and wrote a short statement on prompt service giving five stars
however i doubt the gamecube was new as advertised when i opened the package
the unit smelled like cigarette smoke and the controller looked as it had been used
when i received my game a few days later i noticed the left analog stick on the controller was broken
bit attic is guilty of false advertising
please avoid this vendorwhat happened to nintendo
it was a good fun and wonderul time with donkey kong and other nintendo game systems in the arcade the legendary nintendo entertainment system the snes but when d games has began not everything from nintendo feels the same
the fun atmosphere of games are fading and mario was less kiddy when he was d
now nintendo is fading and the fad has sadly gone
gamecube is like a childish system and where did the good times go
down the drain
well never have those moments again so sadwhy can nintendo just grow up and realize that normal people today only play games like gta and halo and not their gay kiddy games
nintendo needs to realize that their gaycube was a flop and become like ps and xbox
games like mario and donkey kong are only for whipped kids of hypocritical evanangicalsgta and company are for hip and open mined peopleim still very upseti bought this console because i got tired of playing my gamecube games on my wii system so i figured id be better off using its original console
just as i was looking for a replacement console i found a likenew condition for only  i thought it was too good to be true
so i went with itand as soon as it came to me i started trying to play it right away and guess what
this cheesy junk hardware couldnt read discs
i was so mad that i demanded a refund and i shipped it back asap and whats worse
damn seller wouldnt refund my money
so if youre reading this do not buy from tyler tealto see how ripped off nintendo is lets do a simple conversion maththe goal is to find a  blocks card has how many mega byte or kilo bytelet us do some calculation bit   byte mega bit or byte   kilo bit or bytememory card  blocks   mbit   kbit   kbyte kbyte   blocks   kbytehow much is nintendo charging
how large is playstation  card mega byte   mbit   blocks    blockshow much are we paying for  mbyte sd compact flash or memory stickaround  or even freeand who wants mb cards these daysnot a lot of peoplelets use the   mb   blocks as of todays standard
that means  blocks should be only e  wow so nintendo is actually making  profit by charging at this game really suckssometimes you can not see the enemy and they are shotting toyou
what nonsee nazisdo not buy this gamei have never heard of this game my boyfriend convinced me in buying it
it looked like a fun game and i found it at a game store for  so why not
biggest mistake i ever made i am glad i only spent  on it
it was so dull and boring
you practically do nothing
i wanted to give it  stars but it wouldnt let me
dont waste your money
even if its really cheap dont buy iti purchased the game it loaded but does not playreloaded to no availi recommend looking for another game for entertainmenta six pack of beer will give you more entertainment for your buckthe days of just anyone making a video game are gonea good game requires more than graphics
it requires people who know how to make a good control interface and write interesting creative stories
support excellence in gaming and save your moneyi was hoping for another great stratagy game that i could add to my large collection of pc games
i usually love stratagey games but this game is an exception
the game is very buggy and feels cheesy
for example when you try to click on something it takes many clicks before it gets the messgage
and no it isnt lagi forced myself to play it for several hours thinking that if i gave it a chance id learn to like it but i just hated it more an more with every waking moment
this game reminds me of a much downgraded civilization  trust me
there a many good stratagey games out there
this just isnt one of themthis might be your choice console because it was designed courted by and made for kids
with the excception of the resident evil series on the horizon there is not much to look forward to if you are over fourteen years oldthe one thing nintendo has going for it are its franchise game series such as mario zelda metroid etc
if it werent for those then nintendo would most likely cease to existi wouldnt recommend getting any console right now except for the microsoft xbox
while i am no ms hound i will say that if you are looking for longevity in a game console that would be it because with a giant like microsoft backing a console finally american competition again
with a huge array of ported pc games a hard drive dvd player and the best looking graphics on any system gamecube could not handle half of halos world because it has no hard drive i would go with xbox but if you want fun for the kids get a gamecubei hate this game
its not worth the money that went down thetoilet when i bought this its a horrible game even worst thaniwo jima and thats pretty badthe graphics suck the gameplay is horrible if you shoot a badguy youre kicked out of the swat organiztion oh yeah and oneshot kills which really blows
the ai is the worst from any game and thats as low as you can go if i tell a team member topick a lock it takes him five minutes to do so the controls arehorrible worst than max payne and those are pretty bad
take myadvice dont buy this dont even waste five bucks on renting it if a unfortunate freind bought this dont even borrow his
its just not worth installing itminus zero starsdont buy this iwo jimas even a better pickhope this warning helped only get it if youre a swat memberits just too hard too complicated with horrible graphics and gameplaywhen i got this i was expecting a really cool and kinda creepy fps but instead i got a game where all you do is raid buildings for criminals
sounds ok right
well if you put in the terrible gameplay graphics and absolutly no music this game starts to really suckive played alot of games and this isnt a good one i would know
so since your looking at fpss id recommend timeshift section  or fear
all of those are awesomeps
if your dependant on getting this you should know that it does work with vista even bit versionstested on ghz p with mb ram and ati rage  running windows  pro directx  latest video drivers from atii got the demo from pc gamer magazine and had a lot of fun with it
i noticed the price of the full game was the right amount of money so decided to buy it
what a wastethe same installs with no errors
however when i try to run it all i get is an hourglass for a few seconds then nothing
when i run taskmanager i can see nolfexe in the process list but there is no corresponding windowfox interactives idea of techinical support is a peertopeer discussion forum
there is no way to get any support from the company
reading the discussion forum gives you an idea of the huge number of problems this game hasthis will not work on my computer which uses windows   bit version
i have not tested it on my old computer which uses vista
it actually will install but has interference which would not make for any kind of good game play
i tried using windows compatibility settings and it still would not work correctly
i have to give this a bad rating because it will not work and really it should worki have been a castlevania chronicals fan from the beginning and i was very disappointed by this game
past games  even on sega genesis  were better looking and more difficult to play
i was surprised that they would release a game these days which was such a poor quality of graphics and design
it looks more like a mock up of ideas for the castlevania sotn rather than its own game
dont waste time with this onethis game really wore on my nerves on my last nerve if the truth must be known
fine i will admit that the graphics are decent and the story soso but the game playthe most important element of video games peopleis complete garbage
i havent been this disappointed since playing blood omen  camera angles are awful tending to work against you okay in this respect ill try and be fair when it comes to camera angles most games nowadays could use some major improvements
in my defense ive played enough platformers to know the difference between a challenge and a chore
this game was a hassle from start to finish an absolute waste of time and money
do yourself a favor and buy either game from the ratchet and clank series
they are ten times more user friendly and a hundred times more entertaining
oh yes and just so you know i beat this hunk of junk in a daythis game should burn in hell
it was a waist of money i wanted to get the whole series but this is the worstit has the worst storyline everi want my money back jak  daxterman alive is this game bad or what
the graphics are way below par even if it were on a playstation  never mind a gamecube
the gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorientating
what a worthless gamei totally love warners batman animation and its cool that they do all the games in this way
batman vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics
the result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever
i really must stress how bad the graphics are
dont let the color schemes fool you
ive seen better stuff on a commodore this is supposed to be the worst game of the year
what a supriseprosthere are no prosconseverythingthis is a stupid game trust me
if you think youll love it rent it first because i am confident that you wontthis game is awful for several reasons
the controls are awful
way too much jumping around
poor storyline
you cant really use the gadgets during combat you mostly just punch
the cut scenes like racing and flying the helicopter are next to impossible with the controls one bad turn and you get the i failed message and you have to start all over again
lack of being able to save at any pointother than that its great ha haif you want a great gaming experience trade this game in for  halo max payne or blood omen  even it it takes  for this game stinks on all  systems  if you count gba
there is more jumping around than fighting
and the fighting is just punching
so the whole game is jump jump jump jump jump punch punch punch jump jump etc
do not buy this gamethis is the cable that comes with every new xbox
whoever designed this cable should be beaten with a large bag of swedish fish
i guess they failed to realize that some people would like to connect the video yellow cable to their television and the audio red and white to their stereosurround receiver
too bad the  plugs are fused together leaving about  inches to spare between each one
with all the time spent designing this console you would think someone would realize its not a good idea to force the plugs togetheri would seriously give this cable a zero star if it would let me
now i am forced into buying the  advanced av pack just so i can hook up the console properlyi guess i cant complain to much being i got this game for the price of a value meal from a fast food restaurant
it couldve been a free toy in a kids meal and i still would have thought it was lame
and those graphics more like crapics if i was one of the creators for this game i would have refused its release
now i never base my reviews on graphics alone
the gameplay more like lameplay in this case is the most important factor
well thats another story its just so lame
lame lame lame
what a horrible game game game
  what a shame shame shame this is as bad as getting a fruit cake for christmas
this game does get an award though the award for worse game of the year
a lesson was learned here
more times then not you get what you pay fornew legends was just a bad game eveything about this game is horrible lets just list the prosconsprosthe game was cheapconsbad voice actinghorrible story plotbad martial arts fightingdont plan on it
it is bad
you will be in a bland environment with graphics made for the n then you will be in a story that doesnt involve you or anyone
awesome
not only is there no motivation but there is a boring gametake for example save points
to save you have to leave to leave you have to find an item or walk back
when you learn about team attacks from this dude he tells you all the different things then you try them
there is one that took me  hours to beat
it is called team defence
every turn  goblins would run at my guys one time i tried attacking the goblins but died horribly and had to redo my hour long work
ok so then i tried again
this time when i did team defence my girl would get lucky sometimes and hit something
it literally took me  hours just to do that battle
 hours because of the losing it and walking backconsthe game costs moneybattles are repetitivethe environments are stupid
it is blocks
all blocksyou hit up down left and right to do everythingthe town is all text and stuff there isnt any walking aroundthe game has such poor graphics that are some of the most boring and uninspired environments ever conceived in a gamethe atari has better graphics than this gameprosthe game is hard to findyou get a receipt for buying itits an old xbox game that wouldnt work on my xbox  console
thats the risk you run getting old gamesim not surebut i thought we returned it as it wasnt for xbox  again tired of wasting money on stuffi sure expected a lot more from this game than what it offers
the game itself is ok but the graphics are terrible
this game was obviously not built from the ground up to take advantage of the xbox
rather lucas just took an existing graphics engine and packaged it as a new game
im suprised that microsoft allowed this game to be one of the early xbox titles
with so many other games that have good gameplay and fantastic graphics i just dont understand why this one was released except as a fill in until other star wars games come out
with the power of the xbox this game could have been fantastic if it was built to be a top notch game like halo
instead we are left with a ok game and  type graphics for the same money that a game such as halo costsi am going to reveal the ending so do not read ahead if you still want to play this gamemany others have already posted their opinions here so i will not go through the whole game in detailbut as many others have said the voiceacting for the obiwan character is ridiculously unintentionally humorous  the actor sounds like a guy with a head cold trying to imitate ewan mcgregor doing obiwan exaggerating the distinctive traits mcgregors scottish accent  so even lilts in his voice are thrown into hyperdrive
as exaggerated as the honker the graphics dept
gave to quigon jinn  yes the bridge on liam neesons nose may be somewhat big but since when did he have karl maldens nose
the game is unfortunately lacking in the graphics department  sometimes you cant see features on facesbut onto the ending
the game is fun with a handful of challenging levels  mostly due to the swarms of droids that come your way and droids taking stance behind highpowered laser cannonsbut its marred by a disappointingly quick and alltooeasy ending
the moment arrives  you finally meet darth maul
just like in the movie you stand behind the laser wall and watch as quigon is struck down by mauland finally the wall opens you hold your breath ready for a tough battle  one that you may have to play repeatedly until you put together the right string of moves and blocks to take him out before your health runs out
but its not to bedarth maul is ridiculously easy to defeat
i beat him on my first try and in less than a minute
and you have to fight him twice  as once you take him down the first time he gets a new full meter of health
so in less than a minute i drew down two full health meters
i felt cheated to say the leasti remember fighting against mace windu to have to reach the next level and i had to go toe to toe against him some  to  times before i finally beat him
i was expecting at least a battle on that level of difficulty but it ended up being the easiest level of the whole game
all i had to do was slash at him and use some force saber twirls and maul was donehow in the world could the games makers create such a lackluster lifeless nothreat ending battle
i was left extremely wanting and if it were a movie i would have angrily asked for my money back
i cannot say enough how disappointing the ending was
even more now the darth maul character cries out for a game of his own
one can only wish  for this maul must have been a clone or imposter to go down with nary a fighti was looking forward to a complete packing of mk for gba but the controls and gameplay was horrible
very hard to execute moves and it was way too easy for the cpu opponent to sweep you into oblivion
i ended up trading this one backif you want portable kombat for game boy advance go for mkii and mkiii instead
looking foward to mk deadly alliancei buy egm alot and i read all their reviews but somethingcaught my eye
mortal kombat advance got a oo out of i read the review of it and began to laugh one reviewer quotedmortal kombat is a stinking pile of bloody dog krap
while another quoted id rather be locked in solitaryconfinment while gargling cat piss
ignor reviewer one ido not reccomend this to anyone this game is crap warningdo not play should be stuck to the box casehooorriblemortal kombat perfected itself when it brought out the mk trilogy on pc and psx
but before that the snes had great games of mk     and then buggered up the trilogy for the nnow that the power of the snes can be made into a hand held console youd think the gba version of the original style of mk would rock right
wrongwhat the hell have they made here
a gba is supposed to be a hand held snes yet the snes game never was as slow as this game the graphics where not as bad backgrounds are images the moves where executable with ease on the snes and yet this version it takes  or  tries to get something to work because the response of the game is not fast enough
and the worst thing is the feel of it you cant beat the computer with ease everything you do gets blocked the computer all of a sudden goes on a rampage kicking your butt and you cant do anything about itplus where the hell is johnny cage goro but most important of all raiden
you cant have a mk game without raidento screw it up even worse its a  button game now
no more jplplkhkb  rnope just k  p press backk for a roundhouse kick press downbackkick for a sweep that probably would have been ok to get used to if the bloody response of it actually worked i have to slow down my button pressing so the computer can execute the moves which sucks to high heaveni didnt even get a fatality off there is no one button fatality code
i played this with a gameshark and needed the infinite health code on
you even need the gameshark to unlock shoakahn montoro and human smoke because to access them you have to beat the game then get to use them for one round
why the hell go backwards from the trilogy
its a serious down step and its the worst mortal kombat ive ever played
it even makes me like the s version better with its less characters and no one button fatality cheat that every other version hadthis is the worst mk game ever
dont buy it its slow it doesnt have the right feel the response sucks the computer blocks everything there is hardly a cheat worth looking at the backgrounds suck there is nothing good to say about this gameplease if you do like this game its probably because you have never played any of the other mks before
so go and find an mk game on any other system and find out why i am saying what i am saying about this version and you will agree with me  when you play the gba version again and it runs so slow and boring and nothing goes rightmortal kombat advance was released years ago but as long as the game remains on the market people should be warned of the utter disgrace of a title they may one day consider
if youre reading this because that day has come heed my words closely there is no legitimate reason to buy mortal kombat advance
nonemidway was once wellknown as a failure in making handheld versions of their popular arcadequality titles
mortal kombat advance is one of these
the game is filled with bugs making the easiest difficulty as ridiculous as it is inconsistant then almost impossible on any difficulty from the default up
if youre still playing the game after a halfhour or so its probably to figure out how to beat anyone in the higher difficulty levels simply put it isnt
the game just wasnt made well enough to offer fair play against cpu and if thats all youve got for play options then your experience is going to be the worst possiblethe rest of mkas elements are a mixed bag
the graphics are standard for classic mortal kombat games but the animation is subpar giving it the air a bad snes port
the same goes for sound which is minimal and music which is poor if even existent
there really isnt anything for this game to fall back on not only is it shamefully unimpressive in its gameplay but its an embarrassment to hear and see toothe only thing this game is even remotely good for is twoplayer combat
there are over  kombatants giving players plenty of characters to keep things mixed up
not having to deal with the ai is a plus but the bugs make it difficult to execute moves consequently fights are reduced to buttonmashing and desperate attempts to pull off combos and special moves which may or may not even work
this too may ultimately leave you frustrated especially since the prospect of playing twoplayer meant two copies of this game were purchased thats simply two too manymidway has learned its lesson since releasing mortal kombat advance releasing far better titles in mk deadly alliance and mk tournament edition
again if youre even considering mortal kombat advance do yourself a favor and dont
there are plenty of better options out therealright
i had no idea what to expect from mortal kombat advance
i loved the series from mk to its fourth game on the n and playstation
then theres thisokaymaybe i should mention that i loved the console games
the only handheld game i like in the series is mortal kombat  for the game boyso i was treated with a rather glorious presentation
the graphics are still really colorful on the game boy advance and the sound is topnotch
oh and theres a huge variety of characters including the offbeat versions of some of them from mk
oh god does it fall from theresince i was new to this particular game i tried the warrior aka normal difficulty
my butt was brutally murdered by scorpion the second i came in
not once did i even inflict damage on him and i was trying the hardest as possible to even give the tiniest bit of damageapparently i knew i couldnt handle that difficulty
the next logical thing to do was try the novice difficulty
after all that is the easiest difficulty setting available at all rightokayim not making this up it
didnt
change
a freaking
thing
this game is impossible
its at the same standards of horrendous as dragons lair on the nes
do not play this
its a total waste of money
avoid it and play something better
likemk deadly alliance on the gba
same system totally better gamei thought this would be a great game
to be honest what would you expect
the graphics look like the snes ultimate mk
well ive played the crap out of this game and i hate it
feel free to disagree if youre good at it but im a year mk vet and i know exactly what im talking aboutthe graphics and sound are great
but the music loops mindlessly over and over again probably to accomodate all the voice files on the game
that can be forgiven
i started my first match picking scorpion and they throw you in a fight against scorpion
i got my butt handed to me in seconds
so after gaming over at least twice i went into options menu and put the difficulty on very easy assuming i would have a chancei didntthe games cpu ambushes you and once youre backed into a corner youre as good as dead
sure i was able to use scorpions spear from far away about three times but the contact boxes suck and most projectiles dont connect even when you see that they would
someone talked about adjusting the handicap but it only speeds up the asskicking rendering you a sitting duck or as us mk fans call them noobsbottom line if youre a collector and you want every single mk game buy it
but if youre a gamer or an mk fan or you want to try it out let me save you from wasting your money download a rom and waste space on your pc if you want to try it so badly but dont spend one red cent on this waste of plastic
i love mortal kombat but i hate mortal kombat advancei am a very big mk fanive been dedicated to the series since it was first released on the home consoles back in sept of that being saidi heard from alot of people how bad this game wasbut as a true fan of mki thought they didint know what they were talking about and it really couldnt be all that badi was sooooo wrong
this game is a total disgrace to the mortal kombat nameits basically just ultimate mkbut it is horrible
you only got two buttons to work withalong with the dpad of coursebut it is soooo hardand as i saidim an mk veti could not even get past the first fightall scorpion did was just blockevery punch or kick i tried to hit him withhe would just blockanother thingit is almost impossible to pull off a special movethe cpu just kicks your assbefore you even have a chance to attackbottom linethis game sucksyoure better off just picking up mkii for the original gameboy insteadstay away from this worthless piece of little plasticif you truly and utterly hate someone then i have a little hint for you
buy them this game
when they play and see the sketchy graphics the poor backgrounds and the fact that some of the special moves go through your opponent they will think the game is defective
when they go to the game store to exchange it for a real copy you will laugh with glee as they find that there was no defect but it was the real game
only use this against a bitter enemy however as this game is an incredible torture that i would wish upon noone
if that doesnt convince you to run away at the sight of this game then let me put it this way hitler is being forced to play it right now on the th level of hellim not a master at fighting games but i got to wiggle my way through the medium difficulty level of mk on snes and i finish the medium level of super street fighter ii revival
but mk advance is way too hard even on the easiest level
its not challenging its downright frustratingif you are reading this chances are you are a fan of rpgs and are already deciding on buying this
thats fine
my review wont change your opinion
if however you are one of the newer ones who want to venture into this world it might not be your cup of teadespite the rave reviews it has gotten the word i can sum the game up is repetitive
the core design of the game is essentially moving through areas slashing at monsters collecting items and leveling up
that is essentially what youll be doing for hours weeks months and perhaps yearsthe graphics are not up to the standards of other games
however i believe they had to do this in order to allow player splitscreen mode
the music is very interesting ranging from moody techno music to sorrowful tonesyou are given the choice to choose  of  classes and change the looks of the character you are given
the classes are broken down into  archetypes hunters rangers and force
hunters are melee fighters that fight headon with enemies
rangers use ranged weapons obviously and force is like the spellcasting class of the game
within each class youll have some divisions such as a guy whos beefier in damage and accuracy yet lacks the ability to cast any spell at allonce you make a character you are given some sort of id that determines item drops in the game for you
you then arrive in the lobby area
here is where youll spend your time in the game
there is a shop to trade sell and buy items a medical station to heal wounds a mission area to get more assignments and an elevator to allow you to talk to the space government
the story is loosely about a colony of humans that are inside a ship that want to colonize a planet
however they send hunters to check if the location is safe before landingthere are two chapters to the game hence the title episodes i and ii
for multiplayer you are given a splitscreen mode for up to four players
you used to be able to play online through sega if you purchased a hunters license which is a fee of  each month
its been discontinued but there are private servers floating around that you can jointo conclude pso is a game thats been done before here and there
slashing at monsters to loot them is not revolutionary nor does it require player skill
you are going to play this game for many hours but i dont think all those hours will be enjoyable
the true value of this game is in the online play but even that is marginalized when you think about all the other games that let you do that and more diablo if spending all your time grinding at simpleai programmed monsters to collect items is your idea of fun this game will be your fantasy
otherwise if you are like me youll feel unchallengedladies and gentlemen i have some terrible news
morrowind the third chapter in the elder scrolls saga has proven to be one of the biggest pc letdowns in history
the game is a definitive example of what happens when endless opportunities meet horrible gameplay
by endless opportunities i mean that our good friends at bethesda softworks spent countless hours developing an amazingly beautiful and immersive d worldone in which you can go anywhere and do almost anythingopen ended epic world and events
 though i did also say horrible gameplayand morrowind suffers immeasurably from just that
the fighting system is agonizingly weak
unless you have a great weapon and awesome abilities with that weapon youre going to spend a great deal of time getting beat by some of the games lowliest creatures
also  there are so many spells and enchantments to use that it gets overwhelming trying to remember what does what and how to use it
not only are the spells too many but the interface with which to use them is cumbersome and annoying as well
you get stuck in these skirmishes and youre struggling to attack and switch spells at the same time while your enemyimpossible to outrun beats you down with little effort
 like i said the world is very beautiful and the characters are amazingly detailed but all this is lost as the game tries to run before it can walk
im sure geeks with nothing to do with their lives will have a fun time modding this one to death and spending every hour playing it until their character can stand up to the games foes
but for the rest of us crap on that
  in short morrowinds designers tried to stuff  pounds worth of greatness into an  ounce box
 too much at once for any gamer who doesnt think an aggravation induced stroke should be part of epic fantasy gameplaying
 buy at your own riskthe requirements on the box state soemthing to the effect of quotif your video card is as fast as x you may playquotwell i have a voodoo  and it is definitely faster than the card they listed but it is totally unsupportedthey could at least list out the exact cards it supports for gods sake
since there are only  of them i think that is not a lot to askbeing a programmer myself i am forgiving of bugs as long as they make an effort to patch in the future or i would not have purchased the game considering how shoddy their past games were when initially released but this is a different story to require the directx features that they do they would have had to develop to that directx level before it was even released or supported by the graphics card vendorsat any real software shop such a thing would never be considered the engineers at bethesda are proving themselves hacks more than ever with this nonsensei for one will never be purchasing a game from this company againi will echo the words of so many others who have made the mistake of purchasing this game
my system exceeds the recommended requirements printed on the box and yet the game when it runs runs horrificlyfor example  every time you enter a new region in the game gameplay stops for solid minutes while the new region loads  every time i approach an npc to interact the game locks up for at least  seconds while it loads whatever snippet of info the npc has associated with it  the game will sporadically lock up for  minutes for no apparent reason  loading a game takes around  minutes  support is horrible
beyond the standard weak advice to load the most recent graphic card drivers and reinstall direct x  there is zero i repeat zero customer support available  the ingame graphic engine causes my geforce  to lock up even when the game is played at xgeez i could go on but i think the above  examples which trust me are the very tip of the iceberg of faults that this game comprises are reason enough to avoid this
playing this game is neither fun enjoyable or even tolerablefurthermore after uninstalling this game my copy of creature isle no longer plays properly
its rare that a game comes along that actually does damage to your systemman this game is the worst game i had ever played
everything is wrong about this game
the controls are aweful trhe graphics are outdated the moves  the caractors look bad the fighting is terrible
when i first rented this game because i am a avid game of fighting after the first match i returned it to blockbuster
i have never played such a failure
this game is abysmal
this game sholud have never been released because it is so awefulchad steingraberparadigminfogrameslevel designergame designerd artist on the terminator dawn of fatewhoever approved this game to be acceptable for xboxmicrosoft standards should be fired
this game is just absolutely horrendous and needs to just be removed from the shelves through a massive recall pilled up in the backyard of the person who approved this game for sale and burnt in the name of all thats wrong with the world today
whats bad about this game
the question should be whats good about it
nothing and i mean nothing
the dvd disc could be used as a coaster for drinks i supposebut thats the only good thing i can think of
i would have chosen no stars for this piece of flaming poobut im forced to choose  star
oh well nobodys perfect i guessabove all i feel pity for those that were forced to work on such an abominationevery single thing about this game sucks
without knowing what i was in fori bought this at a local video store about five years ago for like eight bucksand oh my godi hated myself for planting down eight dollars for this complete wasteits not even worth eight cents
i threw the game in the trashbecause unfortunatly the damn video store would not refund my moneyso i just tossed it right outthe game is terriblethe gameplay is god awfulthe music and sounds suck and the characters are just a total joke
hands downworst fighting game of all timeeven shaq fu isnt this badat least shaq fu has a so badits good thing going for it
kabuki warriors is just bad periodavoid this at all costsi purchased this with high hopes however i should have learned my lesson from interacts awful psone monitors
this is not a high resolution screen it is blurry and the sound quality is poor
some games move too fast for the screen and the image lags or has a trailer
on high level graphic games like resident evil the screen does not even translate some things like mist or smoke
you must sit at a pricise angle to see most of what is one the screen and its really dark
the sound quality is poor there is a constant buzz coming from the spaekers it is so loud that it drowns out most sound from the game
do not buysilent hill was without  question the most boring and non action or storyline of a game ive  ever playedfirst of all its almost imposible to get anywhere in the game without cheating with the book i dont buy games so i have to cheat and play with the book so i can play the stupid game finding stuff on your own is all the fun not with silnt hill and i played it on ps and i  hated on that game so i thought it might be a little different on xboxwell im sorry to say that it ranks down as low as britneys dance beatthey need to stop this mess now making a third game is gonna do only one thing make me write another bad review whitch i have not done in along time sorry its just plain badaaarrrrggghhhh
this game is awful
i must admit that i was taken in by the storyline and creepy aura of this game
but the game contol is the worst of any xbox game ive played
more than half of your gametime is spent just trying to make your character james go in the proper direction
there is only one thumbstick used to control both the direction he looks and the direction he moves
very awkward
on many occasion such as narrow hallways etc you find yourself pushing up on the thumbstick so that you can have a facetoface veiw of james walking right toward you
i guess this might be ok if james was a buxom hot chick but hes not and this camera angle makes it impossible to see where you are going
james doesnt jump james doesnt crouch heck you can barely just make him walk
konami needs to learn that no matter how good the storyline and graphics if you cant control the character the game is worthlessps
konami can i get my  backi dont know where some of these reviews came from maybe they own stock in the company but this game has extremely poor game play control and is a waste of money
not even close to a max payne
save your money and if you want to know anything more about the game rent it first even at that save your money and buy something decentwhen i purchased this game i thought it would be fun to play a classic game such as baldurs gate but when i got to play it omg it is so so slow and the graphics are incredibly horrible
i couldnt beleive what i was seeing
its horrible
the battles are the most awful thing the characters are the ugliest thing the gameplay just makes you want to hit your head with the cds and the box of baldurs gate and throw up on it
its the worst rpg i have ever played
its a disgrace to the rpgsi like the board game but this this is simply a bad bad pc dampd game
amazingly boring
absolutely awfuldo not buy
i repeat do not buy
im almost sure that youll regret itits been said that if it aint brokedont fix it
so why then does square soft keep fixing the classic elements of the ff series that so many veteran players have grown to love
square tired to change things drastically in ffand it failed horriblyafter playing ffwhich i rented before going straight out and buying iti believed square learned its lesson with messing with a good thingand that some times old school is truely the best optionff completely destroyed my hope by changing everythingmostly for the worstthe minigames are way too deep and confusingthe experience gaining system was completely ruined with a new wayand both the characters and plot were very plastic and unconvincingwhy did they make the lead hero a cockyarrogant sports player
i actually hated the hero in the storyhe kept making these witty remarks which werewellanything butthis also brings me to the very bad voice actingit reminded me of a pokemon or dragonball z episodeyech
the only impressive thing about ff is the graphicsbut im not throwing down money for mere eye candybesides didnt square try to make a ff movie relying soley on graphics
look what happened to itill stick with good ol fashioned  and think ill go ahead and pass with the whole online only th installment of this series as welli am not the best video game reviewer
i dont have hundreds of games in fact i am very limited
i have played ff and  i loved seven the most eight was fine but too depressing imo
i had seen so many good reviews and heard so many good things about x and seeing that they did a part  to x well i had to buy it needless to say i got the playstation  this christmas so like i said not the biggest video gameri wanted to like x i really did
it had some breathtaking scenes and cgs
some of the action was inviting
the characters themselves were very interesting
but
there was one anime movie after the next very little if any character choices to go here there and everywhere
the storyline was so convoluted that i could not make heads or tails of what was going on not to mention i could not understand what this sin being was looked like a mutant whale to me  it was so linear and it was so tight that i got bored easily very easily
i felt that there were waaayyy too many tutorials
i could not and cannot understand the character evolution dynamics
i dont understand the whole structure even with help from the walkthrough books and what i looked up on the net maybe its just me but this game did not fit me at alli seriously doubt i will get x now
oh well
live and learni have been waiting for final fantasy x to come out for a long time and when it came out i was obviously dissapointed
on the adverts or as you people call quotcommercialsquot it looked like a lot of fun but its not very fun if you dont get to do anything
most of it is just talking and it is even worse than nintendo s quotlegend of zelda  ocorania of timequot which was a good game but about four hours of it is just talking
on this itsm more like seven hours
take my advice
dont buy iti realize that a lot of people love this game but frankly it is just not my cup of tea
most of the time you do nothing but watch a movie
it has to be the longest movie ever
even when you do get to play all you do is walk from point a to b it is just plain boring and really slow
i admit it could get better at the end
i havent invested the  hours that my brother has but there are a lot better games out there where you get to play right from the beginning instead of a hundred hours into iti really really liked the game
i could think of a ton of positive things to say the story was good gameplay was decent
all the positive things other people have been sayingtheni spend over two hours fighting some impossibletokill monster
i had to fight him  times before i wonmaybe im just lousy at the game who knows
but seriously id been doing just fine up to this point
the game proceeded to the next scene without any opportunity to save
and of course im instantly killed in the next battle without even a chance to fight
two of the monsters literally kicked two of my characters out of the screen with special attacks and the third proceeded to flambe the remaining characterapparently i was ambushed
i didnt even know there was going to be a battle
just brilliant guystry it again
no thanks
i ended up trashing the dvd and throwing it away
any game that wants to waste my time like thatforget it
im sure the designers thought they were being cute
they werent
no more squaresoft games for meactually make that no more games that dont let you save at any arbitrary time
im totally fed up with rpgs that force you to play for hours because you cant save and this is definitely one of themthat and the weird random encounter technique that squaresoft uses really gets old
id much prefer to be able to explore an area without running into yet another random battle with the same three creaturesas the greatest final fantasy fan ever i was very much looking forward to a true sequel to final fantasy  and ive always fantasized to myself about a ff game that was on a new generation platform
i thought ffx was going to be the game i was always waiting for but sadly i was mistakenfirst of all they totally mucked up the graphics
why did they have to move away from the elegance and beauty of the ff graphics
ffx is all smooth and shiny and stuff
its totally just a copout made to look exactly like every other new rpg rather than steering its own evolutionary course like ff
who thought this game would be better by adding more polygons
that is ridiculousalso the story in ffx is more boring than church
they keep bashing you over the head with it again and again
i get it already
if you hate your father and become a successful funball player then you will create a giant sin ball that will destroy the fake fantasy world you just got transported to
gotchawhose bright idea was it to put voice acting in this game
seriously i can read
those dumbheads at square have severely underestimated me by doing this
i read the ff script like five hundred times
do you really think i want to listen to this long boring story
no way
also their voices arent right and i hate them
which reminds me tidus is stupid and all whiny and wussy and stuff
he was like my worst character nothing like the cold calculating majesty of cloud
boo tidusalso the ffx minigames arent nearly up to par
funball and chocobo race just arent any fun at all
not like the brilliance of ffs sub hunt or board race or mogs hidden fantasy castle adventure
please
im going to spend hundreds of hours playing minigames so they should be good enough to be their very own game like all of ffs games
all the bonus stuff you can do in ffx was stupid and easy too
i killed the ultimate weapon without even breaking the slightest of sweats unlike the titanic struggle it was in ffand whats the deal with the combat system
its like they thought i was too stupid to do things with a little action bar and now i need it to be turn based
and the summon animations only take like  seconds so that you dont get the full majesty and wonderment of the spell
sitting through all five minutes of knights of the round was a pleasure every time and it gave me an unnerving sense of power
and i never needed to change out any member of my cloud tifa cait sith dream team in the middle of a ff fight so why did they make ffx so stupid and hard and different and stuff so that sometimes i might want to switch people out
sometimes i just dont understand those screw ups at square at allwhy cant they just let you level up in a normal way
that was very confusing
when you fight things you get little balls or something and you put them in a thing
i didnt really get it
youre supposed to just get experience points and then every once in a while it says godly cloud has leveled up and it plays the little songin closing this game was pretty stupid despite my expectations
i mean as the greatest ff fan ever i think i can tell these things but this was just a hideous rehash of ff with nothing new added and no innovation and some huge backward steps in the story and character departments
youre probably better off just playing final fantasy  the sephiroth wars again because it is awesomesame music same battle engine same lame charactor dialogue as gandia iieven so it would have been a fun game if i could of skiped the crapy dialogue that was made for  year oldswould have been an excellent game if they would have hired some writers and voice tallent
but what they ended up with was a few hours of actualy fun game play mixed in with hour upon endless hour of crapy dialogue a five year old would find boringpros great graphicsgreat gameplay when there was anycons unending crapy dialogue made this game a no purchase for megame didnt work wellit worked for about  mins then it freezes up at one particular part and no amount of disc cleaning fixes thisi bought this game at the full price and discovered that all the hype was flat wrong
the cut scenes were amazing and the character leveling it very interesting but that is all
the game is very linear
there is no decision making on the part of the gamer about where to go or what to do
the battle scenes are contrived and turn based which ive always found boring and irritating
it takes no skill or imagination to manuver through this game
i wish id never bought this gameand thats about it folks
the end of final fantasy as we know it
why does every recent final fantasy have to be turnbased has to be a long haired blonde whiner fake voiceacting no real strategy in battle hard bosses and a bland story
because square cant make final fantasies anymore folks
whatever happened to the goodness of   and this for me was the biggest waste of money
it is an animated story that has very mild interaction
for me it is not a game
if you want to watch a cartoon for most of the time and then play for a couple of minutes and then watch a cartoon for a while and then play for a couple of minutes etc etc then you will love this game otherwise save your money
if you really are curious rent it first
this way you dont waste forty dollars like i did
the animation is good but im not going to review this for game play because i do not consider it a game
some love this game and some hate itthis is a rent first buy later if you like itthis game is a terrible game
i hated it in every way
the game involved little play most of it was movies
it was almost like pokemon yellow in the fighting system
the grapics were good but only is some scenes
in the rest the grapics were grainy
the bosses past the half point of the game were super impossibly hard to beat
before the half point the bosses were super incedibly easy to beat
the storyline was non progressive
it stayed the same through the whole game  there was a pokemon style of travel
you walk a bit fight a bit and thats about it
the cut scenes were sooooooo long and they wernt always with good grapics
personally the only thing that i would recommend this game for is to throw it in the trashi understand that many people love this game
i understand that people love the characters the storyline and the visually stunning cutscenes
there are even people who like the levelling up system find the combat fascinating and feel that the emotional development of the characters is well done and genuinely touchingi am not one of themthere are a lot of things wrong with final fantasy x one of the first and most noticable changes from previous final fantasies is the completely voiced dialogue
this lends itself to a more natural and immersive feel when done right but ffxs dialogue is so poorly delivered it is more cringe inducing than inspiringas though the scriptwriters felt they had to come up with dialogue to match the lackluster acting the storyline is one of the most blatantly obvious and hamfisted statements ive ever seen in any medium poorly written childrens books included
the main enemy is quotsinquot pleasein regards to the game itself the gameplay consists almost entirely of walking towards a red dot
i understand that that statement may seem confusing but on the quotmapquot on screen there is a red dot pointing to exactly where you need to go to progress in the story
looking for secret items
head exactly in the opposite direction from the red dot and youre more than likely to find some helpful items
this is not quotgameplayquot this is merely the illusion of interaction in between movies
movies that will make you want to tear your ears off the dialogue is so horrificthe combat system is rote rpg fare with subtle alterations to the norm that dont end up making it a better or worse experience
grandia iis combat system stomps all over it and honestly after grandia ii no company big or small should be making quotturnbasedquot rpg combat systems that are as dull as this onethe new level up and skill development system supposedly allows for character customization but theres simply no point
each character starts out on the grid in a position that has an optimal path and the only benefit to diverging from that path is for the novelty of having your brawler actually be a weak spellcaster and have no brawling abilities
wheei played about  hours of ffx before finally realizing that not only would i never bother to finish this game i found that i hated it
hated it with a passion
the insipid storyline the pathetically stupid main character the horribly written relationship between the two leads and the godawful hamfisted ridiculous writing makes this a game that i simply cannot recommend to anyone
the fact that its as popular as it is is a strong statement about how much influence marketing and pretty graphics have on the game buying population as a whole and its not a statement that i could repeat here without it getting editedi love videogames
i love rpgs
i love a quality story
i do not however have any love for final fantasy xin his room the adolescent jumped off his favorite gaming chair and screamed profanity
purposely he spat all over the tv and hurled the ps controller on the floor
the following crash sounded as if it were actual bone snapping
done with his barrage of wet missiles on the helpless tv the youngster brushed the saliva off his lips and frantically paced around
am i dreaming
he asked prancing like a demented loon arms swinging aboutaccidentally slapping his face he simultaneously answered no im afraid not
returning on his chair the tv screen displayed his progression through the epic rpg
twelve hours
it had taken him twelve hours from the latest rpg from square for him to cease convincing himself that this rpg was even a worthy stab
nope not this one not by a longshot
the inspiring final fantasy legacy is now fully disfigured and distorted
formerly forgiving square for the travesty what is final fantasy viii the kids faith in the series momentarily went frozen and shattered
final fantasy x is a devastation but to others a masterpiece and to him utter wreckage
and the next one a multiplayer one 
he was disgustedfeeling lassitude creep on him his distress silences him
when he says final fantasy x is a disappointment of lifetime it is as authentic as the air you breathe in and puff out
enveloped by rage he asked himself why was he in such revulsion
indeed his heart was racing his temples burning but all because of some electronic hobby
yes he felt as if he square pulled a trigger ejecting a swarm of upset upon him
his hardearned cash replaced by a game he surmised to accomplish title of greatest rpg ever crafted
his fiftyfour bucks were a definite waste he might as well have thrown the money down from his roof and cheer for his gluttonous neighbors
either way its fate was the samewas the final fantasy series gradually reducing itself into the equilibrium of rpg damnation
truly in a state of disgrace the franchise has lost its traditional substance in exchange for graphical grandeur
even though he treasured s ffvii he now speculates if it is still consummate
he decided it will remain as a fond memory but ultimately be known as the indisputable harbinger of squares greater goal to become a part of hollywoodfinal fantasy the spirits within flopped like a bad dream
what then square he thought
recycle your cinematic visions into your latest installment of final fantasy
final fantasy x a hybrid of little rpg significance with movieformat majority ruins the experience to stimulate imagination of the player  the reader  by deleting scripts of written dialogue and basing an epic with snappish and terse voices
he wished for broad intriguing reads and by the gods he wasnt a slothful boy
what driven him on the edge of vehemence were the maddening voiceovers
a gamer who valued his imagination he utilized his creative mind to mentally produce the voices of past final fantasy casts
final fantasy x puts the enjoyment to total extinction
despite the impressive apparatus of the well functioning grid sphere and the edgecutting battle system of letting all characters partake in the forceful battles the assets dig their own grave by the objectionable shortcomings of his worship for rpgs derived from plot and characters
oh how he waited to be immersed into squares next chapter he struggled but the more he threw himself into the venture the more he apprehended that the characters were secondhand versions of previous installments
his observation of auron summoned vincent ffvii and shadow ffvi in mind luna an almost exact replica of rinoa ffviii tidus was an older version of zidane ffix kimahri and rikku were the easiest to fathom kimahri is an identical version of mareg from grandia ii and rikku is yuffie ffvii
the thought of the beloved characters being disguised by a barrage of graphical distinction only proliferated his antipathy
worse the archvillain seymour he thought was a joke and there is nothing funny about it
he saw seymour as an inept villain who solely upheld the attributes of being immoral because he is undead and lost the balance of reality
every bit of the unoriginality killed off any reason to gobble the quest or even bring it to an end itunlike the spit he easily wiped off his mouth the kid couldnt free the fact that the storys direction suffocates an excellent battle system
what could have been worthwhile proportions is trodden by the humdrum purposes of the characters a lethally boring archvillain and the idea that the badcharacters are reincarnations of past final fantasies
all of it led him to the decision that indicated how low uncreative and moneyravenous the former console rpg messiahs sunksquares motive to him was grounded on the construction of videogames being incorporated with theatrical premises
in turn it costs the fundamentals of the rpg genre
is the company now a capitalist pig intent on deceiving players by saturating commercials and zines with a multitude of striking full motion videos
when a final fantasy disc comes out it isnt the gameplay that clocks in the hours its the superfluous videos and dreadfully voiced scenes
anything with the name of final fantasy in videogames mind you will have square put their speedos on and dive in an ocean of cash
where will all this cash go
maybe to  again  futilely make a come back in the movie industry
to reinstate their name of the laughingstock that they are in hollywood
you can call it paranoia you can call it absurd but sixto limiac calls it theoryi bought this based on most of the other reviews
i thought it would be exciting
not
you have to sit there and watch these boring scenes and stupid storylines
then you get a couple seconds of control
some of the battles are fun but you have to wait soooo long to get to them its not worth it
the worst thing is if you die you have to sit through all the storyline again to get back to your battle
no cuts or fastforwards
i still cant believe that
if i rented it first no way would i have bought iti have  hours into this moviegame because i refused to believe square would come out with a movie in the guise of a game
and ffx is just that
a movie with limited and i mean limited player interaction on a level with the horrible xenogears
there are no camera angle changes and no  degree control
the game is totally and completely linear
you spend the first two hours watching young tidus a supposedly great blitzball player whine and whimper about his old man disappearing when he was young
not only is the voice over emotionally inconsistant the pitch is irritable
and you cannot xmash through the scenes
the game is in complete control thoughout
the plot is entangled and i mean in knots with religious conflict and political manipulation the intricacies of which as an adult i understood and enjoyed
as a teen i wouldnt tolerate it and would be horrified when i found you cannot bypass a single scene throughout the game
while most of the backdrops are graphically superior there is little exploration allowed
your characters run only only on paths in area scenes and there is no world scene and no control over destination
you only go where the game sends you
i have  hours in i hope it changesbut there are some redeeming factors here
if you dont mind watching another final fantasy spirits within movie you are in luck
the computer graphics are absolutely breathtaking
as far as ganes go ffx is the cg feather in squares cap  especially the ocean scenes involving sin the megawhale sized creature bent on destruction
i have never seen creatures and water displayed with such realism
on land the trees sway and i wish square had invested as much time in the gameplay as they did making everyones hair move in the breeze
the voiceovers were a step up in reading text after text after text i turned the text off and just listenedthe battle scenes are copied from ffix with a few graphic enhancements
the sphere grid is a new way of powering up and learning spells and is the most amusing part of the game
weapons do not get stronger you buyfind ones with different attributes which is diappointing
now for the aeons your summoned beings
there are only  taken from ffix with some very nice enhanced graphics
unfortunately the summoning scenes are excrutiatingly long at least  seconds each and every time
apparently square was so enamured with the graphics you cannnot shorten them as in prior ff games
you might as well get up and make a sandwich everytime you summon so you prefer to leave yuna the heroine out of the battles
the sphere grid is a neat new way of upping hp and mp and is actually challenging to maze through
the side game of blitz is fair but i found the control buttons do not respond per the instructions
youll see
and the game controls the matches
i prefered the card games in ff viii and ix
and for you mothers of  year old boys ffx graphics are true to every scantily clad female body movement so be ready for lulu the black magei play nothing but rpgs and resevil style games
rpg stands for role playing game
there is little to be had here except for moving the characters in and out of the battle scenes
i have  hours into this game only because i couldnt believe square would come out with another gamemovie guess i forgot xenogears as a game this falls so far short
as an example of computer graphic capabilities square has given us the showcase of the year
and i do mean a showcase
this is the feather in squares graphics capi have played every ff game as well as almost every rpg made
i cannot recommend you buy this as a game new
i would wait a week for the movies fans to return theirs and buy it then
since it is totally linear without skip capabilities i would not rent this
you will have it a while
perhaps i will update this after i finish the game unless i just get sick of it and move onthere are several other square games much more suited to gaming
i recommend ff ix most highly as well as chronocross very nicely done the sequel to chronotrigger
also try legend of dragoon star ocean second story and breath of fire iii
for dreamcast try skies of arcadia
 hours of total  degree control through an extremely vast worldwell i am a huge fan of final fantasies but this one was just an embarassment
the point is just like any other ff but ill let ya know whats wrong with it
first of the main charactertidusi think the name speaks for itself
the kid is a moron
apparently he is a professional blitz ball player whatever the hell that is
one of the poorest excuses of a sport i have ever seen
more or less underwater soccer with cheap rules and unrealistic physics
but in short the entire time i was playing the game i was embarassed just playing as tidus
probably the worst ff character their is in the saga of final fantasiesthe magic and sphere grid was stupid as hell
you couldnt get your magic without waiting for a couple of years and it took forever to get around it
remember in the other ffs when you got your magic and spells by gaining expierence or by collecting items
well in this game tidus and the gang thought up something new
now you have to go through this annoying ass sphere grid which takes an hour to learn and another  hours to completeprobably morenow the concept is just like i said similar to the other ffs with a story of love involved with the saving of all human kind
well in this story tidus is supposed to save the world with his girlfriend yuna
the other characters are complete tagons and them making an impact on the story did not come into play at allanother thing wrong with this game was the boss
now over the years in a bunch of different games i have seen werid bosses and cool bosses
nevertheless it was nothing like i saw here
the boss sin is a big blob
not only that but hes brown kinda makes you think
so with a queerish fellow like tidus fighitng a brown blob sin the game reached an all time low
so think about it do you want to reduce yourself to a level of absolute disgraceif not dont play this game otherwise go for it and be embarassed out of your mind and be bored as hell
you will be disapointed
their is an absolute gurantee that you will be disapointed after your done playing this gamedont get me wrong i love final fantasy but ffx is poo
first you might be expecting a  disc set like previous versions but this one is a one disk game
this means less space for a variety of music the battle song gets real old real fast and less space for graphics all the good graphics are the same as they show you on the commercial nothing new after you see all the good graphics square really skimps on the characters details
they turn into  bit graphics before your half way through the game
final fantasy had a good reputation with previous versions but this one is just riding the comp wave
the next one will have to be better because this one stinkswhile the graphics are good among the best on ps the game itself is long tedious and boring
not the way video games should be made
what squaresoft should do is stop making final fantasy a video game and instead continue making movies of it that flop or books that no one will buyin closing save your money for a decent game or buy this game and take destroy it in some creative wayim not officially reviewing this game
rather im posting this in hopes that someone who is having the same problem with this game that i am might be able to help mei cannot get it to play for more than  minutes or so before it crashes and i must restart my system
i have the dvdrom and cdrom versions of this game and both act the same
the games site has produced no resutls and ive gotten no response from the sites webmaster
my system is technically ample for this game and i see no reason for it not to work
if anyone else has encountered this problem let me knowim sure this game is spectacular
i just have to get it to runixxrepstersanrrcomthis is the poorest design i have seen in  years of gaming
the interface is extremely confusing
you are moving in one direction until the cut scene then you are moving in the opposite direction
so until you get the hang of it youre running back and forth between scenes
most of the attractions will not allow you in until you accumulate enough points for either a cap or an e pass
how do you accumulate points
by picking up garbage and throwing it in trash cans
wow this is fun
or collecting letters that make up the name universal studios theme park
my daughter and i played for about half and hour and finally gave up
it was dull boring and frustrating
we had more fun making fun of the game than playing it
i cant believe they actually make you pay for this
stay away unless you want a lesson in how bad a game can bethis game is really bad
you go into the park and walk around picking up trash off the ground
then you become hopelessly lost in the park because there are no maps or signs or anything
and when you finally find one of the rides woody woodpecker says you cant go in because there are too many people
so you have to find your way back to the entrance good luck and buy a cap with the points you have earned shaking characters hands and picking up trash
the camera angles leave much to be desired and cant be adjusted at all
back to the future and wild wild west games are moderately fun for about  minutes
anyone can beat the game in a day or twowhen you blow you hard earned dosh on this and begin to play it you are given the chance to pick up rubbishermyep you read it right you play dustman for the day and pick up litterassuming you are not frantically searching for the reciept you then get to ride on one of the amusments for a prize before going back to play litter pick upin short this game sucks
the graphics may look ok but its this kind of game that gives gamecube a bad name

just guess
do you think the back to the future ride will be good
well its notthis game is awful
its the worst game ive ever played and im ashamed that i lost over an hour of my precious lifeloved moo one of the greatest games ever
maser of orion  is as far from  as cow poop is from filet minioni borrowed this game along with stagy guide from a friend right after this game came out
installed and tried it over the weekend
was so gosh darned awful that i brought it back to him the following monday
he wouldnt take it back
is such a pile of crap of a game that he would not even accept the game backif you pay money for this like any money at all you will regret it
someone gave this game to me and i regret owning itif youre on the fence about spending money on this take the money you are going to spend and give it to a midget to kick you in the nuts for  hours you will get more enjoyment out of it than this gamethere are many xspacestratagey fans out there and many attempts to make games in this genre
but sadly few are successes
some are good but few know about them such as pax imperia entiment domain one of my favorites
some are good and everyone who knows the genre exists knows the game such as master of orion  some are just colasal flops and usually for many different reasonsdo i have experience enough to judge a good x game
well i have played many of the games but some disagree with my views on them
here are the ones i have
my all time favorite pax imperia entiment domain master of orion  one of my less favorites space empires  in the middle of my list conquest frontier wars gets second place star wars rebelion had potental but didnt quite deliver star trek birth of the federation also had potential but didnt quite deliver
and thats all i can think of right nowanyway on to master of orion  the prequel moo was many peoples favorite and it was good for when it came out though i prefered pax imperia entiment domain but i wasnt one of its biggest fans
now moo is a different story
i didnt actually buy it mind you
i got the full version  minute demo and it was terrible
although better visually than most the menus and selection are very poorly done and getting anything done is nearly impossible
i didnt see the battles but that makes no difference if the main interface is so bad you cant get anything done
there is little helpful information for running your empireallinall this game isnt worth the time of day
if you want a x game i reccomend getting conquestfrontier wars moo or space empires  i havent tried galactic empires yet but it looks cool so that could be a possibility
but this isnt the game that you are looking for
so hit the back button and move on
if you dont believe me just read the other reviews on this gamethis is the worst game of its type
save your moneygraphics are about  years out of datemanual is just a story that takes places at the end of moothe only thing you will ever fight is troop transportslol
what a joke
glad my friend gave me his copy
oh nice cover art on the boxi tried to play this game untill i got to a fun point
i really did
but it was for naught
the game just plain  real time space combat in this game  watching little dots on your screen shoot at eachother for awhile
the space combat graphics look like they are from   their is very little in way of stradegy to it at all  levels of menues you have to navigate through just to manage a planet
each planet you go requires that you click through menu after menu to get anywhere the tech tree is basicly an ai controlled monstrosity that you cant really understand or control
your scientists study multipule sciences at the same time and go on to the next automaticly
the whole thing is very confusing
there is no sence of i need to get this tech so i can get x ability the enemy ai is horrible
completely stupid
i often found enemy races declaring war one turn making peace the next then declaring war again the turn after over and over for round after roundtake this for what its worth from someone who put a lot of initial time into the game
i wont be playing it again
total rip offif anything this game got me rehooked on master of orion   this game just sits there and plays its self and that makes it boring very boring
any chance we can get a master of orion  that is based on the aspects that made this line of games fun and popular instead of something newobviously i am rather biased about this game since i like asherons call better
but i have played them both and while they both have many of the same problems inherent to a mmorpg such as lag and cheating and ebay selling
but everquest has some problems that asherons call doesnt have all updates to asherons call are free all updates to eq are not free and you need to go out and buy the latest version to get the fix and be able to play with your friends again in comparison to the developer attention and responses to customer wants and needs asherons calls developer team seems to make a much larger effort to accomodate their customers as much as possible
the ac developers have a message board where they answer questions and make statements and they release build notes every month on their updates and they have a monthly live developer chat where you can ask your questions and get them answered right away with the transcript of the chat being posted afterwards
eq doesnt even come close to this and seems to like having a wall between their devs and their customers then there is gameplay
my number one problem with this game is like myself many people do not like to have to fight and play in groups
a lot of people play rpg and adventure games for the atmosphere and people but they also like to do things on their own
in eq you cannot fight and hunt solo
if you do you are monster food
in ac almost anyone can hunt solo and reap the rewards of solo huntinglike i said this is a biased review but everything i wrote here is true think about iti havent played this game and probably never will becausewarning  i read this game has no season or dynasty mode
i read this on a game related website
im not  sure but if this game truly doesnt have a season or dynasty mode only tourney or exhibition then im not buying it
what is the point in this game without a season mode or recruiting and all that stuff
easports has really let me downtheir ncaa football has a great recruiting system
nba live has all kinds of season and career options
now ea sports bball on the ps supposed to be a great system doesnt even have a season
i was going to get this game for by birthday but now im definitely not
what a joke and an insult
ill now look into nba k or just wait until baseball season to buy a sports game
heck i might even try hockeyi cannot believe that ea sports made this piece of junk as part of its otherwise superior sports series
no season mode no historical teams and limited replayability  buy a previous years edition insteadi cannot articulate how horrible this game is
see the key word here is quotgamequot quotgamequot is missing from this
sure the graphics and the sound are d sure they are cool the first time you see them but the quotrelative easequot that is referred to by many many reviewers who seem to be in cahoots with sega is that it takes a total of  minutes to beat all the boards
there are  missions and they make up for this lack by adding ridiculous features like quotscore attackquot which gasp lets you get points
who cares
what im going to beat my old points
very lame to get this as a bonusthe music is alright trance music but the th time you try to play a board to do it a little bit better it is just annoying to hear a boom boom boom boom drum beatwhen you are playing it it is very immersive
but then a whole  mins are past and youve completed the game and what youre supposed to want to play it again in a different quotmodequot
ridiculousthe first warning is the booklet
quotpress x to shootquot is about all it says
oh wait it also describes the whopping  power ups one makes you stronger one makes you  uh shoot a lotif you notice the glowing reviews they say quotits more than a shooter its an experience
quot along with quotits really cool to look at its not explainable as a gamequottranslation the gameplay is nonexistant and you can show off your ps sorta i thought the graphics were lame at times to grandma for  minutes and the shots and explosions are timed so they all coincide with the musicthis makes an experience
yawn
essentially the timed music thing is bogus anyway which is why the enemies are so spread apart
if you press fire very rapidly you can hear the shots coming out in a pattern
sometimes when you press the button you hear no shot
oooh
marvelous technologyseriously dont believe the hype  im sure its all about segas deep pockets which is why you hear about panzer dragoon and sc in the same breath even though this game mangles what was good with both of thosethis was such a dissapointment
its on a cd not a dvd couldnt they have made like  times more boards enemies items and stuffed it on a dvdunless you like to play the same  boards over and over again so you can quotmasterquot the techniques as said on the box the play is mindnumbing
how about make  levels rather than  bonusesbottomline  rent it its cool for a night
but warning youll feel ripped off if you rent it toothis game is so over rated or at least rated by those who only are addicted to the game and techno music
the only reason to buy the game is if you want to listen to the same techno music all the time
the sound effects are not all people crack them up to be
the gameplay is so simple my  year old nephew went through this game with ease
there is no challenge in the game and if you do like the music in this game you will be happy to know that there is a sound track coming out so you can pick that up for  bucks rather than wasteing your money on this less than satisfying game which is  bucksi loved the first sonic adventure game gamecube remake and i only expected this one to be as good if not better
but boy was i wrong
its a truly horrible game thats scattered all over the place with no nonlinear progression or free roaming abilities of the originalthe graphics are ugly the camera system is the worst i have ever come across and the levels are tiresome and repetitive
wheres the dynamic gameplay of the first game
or the cool minigames that keep you coming back again and again
it was just ugly and garish and far inferior to sonic adventure
do not buy or renti can only hope and pray that sonic heros is better because i have already bought itthis is not a review of incompetence for i am not careless with my discs
understanding what a piece of junk the ps is to begin with i found a large circular scratch that the disc tray had created considering the scratch had encompassed the disc and had been perfectly circular i know that i couldnt have created it
i followed all the instructions given and i found that the results i had gotten sound similar to what is said on this page
the codec conversations didnt work before i used the game dr but now the game doesnt work at all
because i think this is a problem with the ps it doesnt read my dvd movies anymore no matter what condition be sure not to use this product if you own a ps particularly if your system is over a year old as that is where most of the problematic consoles liei purchased this game while still reveling in gta and thought it would be comparable in at least action and goals but it wasnt
the erroneous comparisons of reviewers come from the maker rockstar and the violence but thats where the similarities end
ive managed to play it two or three times after bringing it home and havent bothered since
the game has no real direction cartoon like graphics and unimaginative gameplay
 obviously other gamers feel the same way that i do if a major chain is already selling off their excess
stick to the other rockstar hits and avoid this bomb
if you have even a modicum of intelligence youll grow bored with it quicklyno plot sense less no point violence
if some one can tell me wha the point of making this game is i may pay you
this game flat out isnt goodwhat a mess
this game stinky inky inks inks and that is my honest and most friendly opinion of this game
it doesnt even dip into the grand theft auto pool
this is a uneven unfinished and unfun game
i warn you once to stay awayoh manim in a mental state of depression i havent spoken to anyone in  days i havent eaten ive lost sleep and whenever i do get to sleep i have nightmares about this game actually being goodbut its not for the love of god please dont get your hopes up on this major disappoinment rockstar has hit the peak with grand theft auto  but got shot right back down and got buried twice with this game  missions taking at the most  minute  seconds each wow
were livin on the edge there
wooohooo
notbut ne wayz il admit itat the beginning its kinda fun blowing stuff up using an assortment of weaponsthats iteven the storyline isnt good
and not to mention the instability of game controlsoh my this game is so not for me no way a big no no for the your collection of  star gamesi mean i wouldnt even suggest to rent this game im sorrybut according to my own personal game fanatic opinionthis game stinks
ltvomit but thats just mego ahead and buy it its a free country state of emergency  ps games get worse and worse
it is only fun for the first  minutes or so then you can just throw it away or burn it on the camp firei mean this game is fantastic it truly is a great game you have to try it out
state of emergency for playstation  makes one hell of a coaster
never again will your drinks leave marks on the furnature with this remarkable gem from rockstar
i reccomend that anyone who is looking for a something to rest their drinks on try this gameno it isnt woo at all
boo its boo
the game is bad
it is repetitive
i took it back after  days
bad game easy to beat and even easier to hateyou walk around and shoot stuff
you find stuff like guns and shoot otehr things
there are no cool characters
there are like  environments that are small repetitive and bland
you honestly cant say anything good about this gameon the kaos mode you can shoot everything for points
all the time you will be under civilian penalty
o thats real fun
if you shoot a civilian you lose tons of points
for about  seconds the penalty is off but by that time you dont wanna break you boring streak of not killing anything and only shooting controlled burst to avoid killing any civiliansseriously there isnt any freedom in this game like gta
there are no extras there is nothing to do except follow some guys and do work for them
dont buy itmm hmm this game is all hype
it gets old so quick that by the time the rockstar splash logo has faded out youre already halfway asleep
it was a good concept ok ill admit that but it was done all wrong
rockstar hit the gspot with gta and sold this in its shadow
big mistake
this game is worse than the crow city of angels in the position of a followup
i know its not a sequel but it was banking on the same principle
ultimately only own this game if someone gives it to you as a gifteven then you might want to throw this cow chunk in the trash and slap the buyer in the face with a bag of staples
think about itim  years old and have been a avid video gamer since pong came out
atari commodore you name it
so if i say a game is really junki speak from experience
in fact i would prefer most commodore  games to this title
the ps was designed to offer much more than state of emergency asks of it
save your moneyhmmm this is pretty strange why is the main character and other characterscartoon characters
i thought this was going to be a game of revolt and mayhem but instead got a disney movie turned badi was smart enough to rent this game because its really mind dulling after only a short amount of time say about  minutes
dont be fooled by the fact this game is made by rockstar games which made excellent classics such as grand theft auto and max payne it simply is a bunch of cartoon characters running everywhere holding tv
s and other items that they have stolen basically getting in the waythe missions are pointless
the game is pointless
state of emergency could have been another rockstar masterpiece but unfortunately they took the cartoonish quotnba street stylequot of graphics with oompa loompas running everywhere
at least nba street had ebonics
nice try rockstar for a new approach but stick to the realistic actionadventure games
id rather play a video game without having the fear of knocking over a pokemonat first i thought this game was another rockstar smash but after  days i beat the game there was nuthin  do n da game was wack
i tried other modes but they got borin  fast
this game is nowhere close to gta
the game is fast and borin
i ended up tradin it to my brother for max payne
max payne was a much bigger hit than this
dont git this garbage unless u r a big fan of riot games and end up killin ever then rent it
even gta  and  were better than this
sfter all the screenshots and the good reviews i thought this would be great but it was a  rip off
this game is probobly rockstars worsti couldnt wait to get this
gta is the greatest game  everi cant stand playing this for more then  minutes
its mindnumbing just running around doing the same thing over and overthe characters are funny for the first  minutes but thats it
i rented it and didnt even keep it the full  days
thank god i didnt buy it
i think rockstar just threw some stuff together while gta is still hot
the story line block graphics lack of plot and awful gameplay all show that they put zero thought or effort into this gamei guess ill just have to wait for gta ivwe should have all known this would happen once gta made it big  that rockstar would try to follow it up with a similar themed game without the things that made the first one great
enter state of emergency a game that allows you to kill a lot of people occasionally for the benefit of a local thug and thats roughly it
gone are the engaging risky plot elements of gta the high speed chases the expansive worlds the threatening personalities
what remains is a shallow hollow attempt at a game which never acheives the same high caliber of the gta series
in state of emergency youll throw large objects at innocent bystanders heads bash in skulls with garbage cans fire away into a crowded mall or just punch strangers without care
sounds fun ill admit
but after about twenty minutes of wanton destruction youll wonder what else is there to do
sadly the game implicitly answers not much
zero replay value and only shortlived initial shockvalue intrigue
pass this one up and wait for vice citystate of emergency really puts you in a state of emergency when you spend so much on it and it turns out to be the worse game you have ever purchased
the graphics well theyre okay
but the gameplay has no meaning
you are running around like a lunatic with no substancial goal to achieve
overall the game serves no meaning and its a waste of money aswell as time
if you were expecting another gta this game is no where near iti rented this yesterday for a yearold figuring the music and graphics would be something shed enjoyimagine my chagrin when the game came on and there was no sound
i poked and prodded and looked for options but couldnt find any indication of why it didnt worksomeone online had the answer for me  for whatever reason the producers of this game elected not to include a digital audio out sound trackits a music game
hellomy ps is integrated into my home theatre systemto maximize performance its hooked up with a component video cable and an optical digital audio cable
if your system is hooked up in a similar way you will not hear the audio for this game without reconfiguring your ps hookupon my system a bad design choice makes this game unplayable
zero starsparappatherappa  is not only a tremendously long titlebut a pice of trashits about this midget dancing doghe gets a life time supplies of noodlesum
and thats all he thinks abouttheres  words to describe this gamenoodlesdancinglamewhatever you dont buy this game
unless you like midget dogs in a rapper outfit that dancessincerlykennyi absolutely hate this screen
it is so tiny that you cant even see anything barely
i play sports games mainly but on this screen its nearly impossible to play because you cant see anything
not worth  bucks at all
there is another option out there that i will tell you about herego to best buy or another electronics company and buy a power inverter
i have a jensen brand  watt inverter
it plugs straight into your cigarette lighter spot in the car
then if you have a small kitchen tv that some people have or about a  inch tv you can plug that into the inverter and have a full sized tv in the back of your car or whereever you want
defintittely the better option worth the moneyi think the inverter is the same cost as the piece of crap screencame broken on arrival
this is designed to hook on the back of the fat ps but when i hooked it up only the audio played
its also heavyhaha  bucks are you kidding me
what a waste
this is ridiculous
yes i am too poor to buy a tv so im going to buy a small lcd screen for  dollars pathetic
you can plainly tell from the product and the character on the screen of the product this is a shity as item
instead buy a small tv
or buy final fantasy x that doesnt require a tv
just requires a small brainterrible
i played a few levels and it is absolutely terrible
i think the only good james bond game i ever played was goldeneye but even that got old but this gets old from the first gun shot
terrible controls
i wont buy this game unless itson sale forget about thislet me start off by saying that i bought the ps only because i was waiting to buy this game thankfully nhl  gta  ko kings   victorious boxers have made the purchase well worthwhile anywayand have just ran out and bought it on its first day of releasemy first inkling of something possibly being wrong occurred when i read the directions and saw that the career mode if you can call it that no longer has training and is limited to a pyramid shaped grid in which you have to defeat  boxers on the lower level  on the next level  on the next and wallah you fight for the title
there is no longer a list of  contenders with records who you must train and fight and no real sense of a true careermy next inking of something amiss was when i saw the controls and found out there is no actual button for an uppercut
instead of having an uppercut button you have a right hook button which any boxing person knows does not exist for a right handed boxer in real boxing
the uppercut is thrown by holding the r button and pressing another buttondid i mention theres no options to configure the controls to make them more intuitive
so you have a straight right button and a right hook button that pretty much do the same thingreal realistic aint itanyway i was still looking forward to playing the game and just popped it in
the first thing i noticed was that the graphics are much more primative then last year a great game by the way and the fighters all looked emaciated and stooped like they had a bad back
the punch animations were stiff and actually reminded me of the crummy first version of ko kingsnow for the really awful partas if this failure of a game really needs morebody punchesthey do not exist
actually they do exist but you have no control over them
you throw a right to the head and if the computer deems it better to go to the body then it simply becomes a body blow
there is no button to actually choose a body blow just the computer deciding for you
needless to say this gives the game a feeling of complete lack of controlwhats more you cannot even choose to block body punchesthere is only a block button and if you opponent throws a punch the computer decides should go to the body then you block it by pressing the same button you would to block a head shot
even more ridiculous the l button which in previous versions allowed you to go to the body now is the low punch button
so by hitting it you can always throw a low blowthe only problem being that you get disqualified after around  of them and just by accident your going to throw a few since instincively you hit l thinking you will be throwing a body blowwhy black ops decided to give such an important button over to something that has so little use should just stand as an example of the ineptness of the bozos who designed this game
pretty much this is a button mashing mess with no redeeming qualities that becomes repetitive after a few minutesyes not much of a lasting value unless youre on your deathbed which is probably preferrable to playing yhis gamefrom my review i guess you can tell i was severely dissapointed with this game
i so wanted to like it and based on last years game am in utter shock as to how this could have happened
i appreciate that they wanted to incorporate a new engine like victorious boxers but that game based its system on realism where you have to learn to counter go to the body and just plain box
this game is simply a watered down version of teken with subpar graphics and no kicking
i am returning mine tommorow at a  penalty so i never have to polute my ps with this garbage
i implore anyone looking for a boxing simulation to stay away from this or the designers will not get the message that they cannot peddle garbage
even if you are not looking for a boxing simulation and are interested in a fighting game you can do way better then this
shame on black ops and ea sports for releasing this disgracei bought this game a few days ago because my pirated copy of knockout kings  was malfunctioning
i liked kk a lot and didnt think twice about buying the  version
to my surprise the game went backwards the graphics are not better the punches have no reality in them the control layout is terribleea  me on this one
ill stick to pirated copies of easgames in the futurethen was a time when you could look nowhere else for the best sports games
it did not matter how many sports games were made if it wasnt made by ea sports then it was not worth playing
that era is sadly gone
it has passed the same way that many of the old stadiums have
we now reflect on the games of old because the last thing one wants to do is look at what ea is producing nowtheir games are worse than michael jordans attempts to hit a curve
triple play  has shown again that the creativity imagination and dedication to the sport they are trying to emulate has fadedthe graphics of this game are just plain bad
it is slow the players are out of proportion and the overall effect just isnt there
the gameplay is bad and players are unresponsive to commands
batting is done via that new idea in baseball game
the stupid targetcrosshairs box
someone should just realise that idea is just plain dullrealism is not really there much either
at the end of the day it just is not that much fun
a game i did enjoy was high heat
not a great leader in any area
but the gameplay was strong enough to have fun with
and having fun is what i want from a game
but until we see a baseball game to the standard of nflk by segasports then i suggest we save our money and wait till we get something goodmlb triple play  was quite a disappointment from my standpoint
basically the graphics are very poor and the players faces dont look anything like players
for example luis gonzalez the player one the cover is missing his facial hair
its not that different than triple play  only updated rosters and added stadiums for teams who changed
when i compared the two games the stadiums in triple play  looked a lot better than the ones in the  versiontriple play  also skimped on the pitches for individual players
they gave a fastball and a changeup to every pitcher whether they really throw it or not and added some other pitches that did not match pitching styles ie
giving a curve ball to armando benitez instead of a splitter etcanother weak aspect of this game is the lack of game modes
they have all the same things as triple play  exhibition season playoffs and homerun derby
yawni suggest you dont buy this baseball game
i perfer major league baseball high heat  the graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is so well developed that sometimes i think im in the stands watching the game
also the players faces match the ones in real life which is nice to know considering triple play  didnt get anything right
buy major league baseball high heat  its a  dollar payment very well spent
check out this game at amazon reviews to find out more about it
i guarntee you will not regret getting this game over triple play i feel that dance dance revolution is better and this game only copied it
if you where interested in this game
get dance dance revolution or one of the sequals such as ddr maxi also recommend the mats for itthe mats last about a yearpros of dance dance revolutiongood exercise with matshelps you make quick desicisions with fast songshelps timingfuncons of dance dance revolutionvery very addictive but who caresmats only last a year long yes that addictiveum wowa game for britneyumyeashe um has no skillsshe cant sing or dancewhy buy a game about itbut as a boy thats just medont get me wrong i looove the sims i have all four
i didnt give this game a rating because i havent played it yet
however with sims hot date there are too many bugs and even though maxis did a recent patch for such problems as sims not being able to get off a couch after cuddling some purchase items not being transferred etc i tried downloading the most recent patch for hd and cant due to problems with their winzipi hope that most bugs are worked out for this program prior to release date
i think that maxis is coming out with these additions much too fast and are not really testing enough prior to releasing hence the many problems with the hot date program
i will just wait about  months to a year before purchasing vacation maybe theyll have all the bugs worked out by thenbuyer beware  if youre buying this because its the cheapest dance mat available youre going to get exactly what you paid for
i am just getting into ddr so i bought this to practice at home
it worked great for a couple of weeks but now the up arrow is screwy and doesnt always register which makes it extremely frustrating to play
i estimate i got less than  hours of use before it started to fail on me which is inexcusable
in short this pad is not worth the money or trouble
look elsewhereif you have any aspirations of actually becoming a decent dance dance revolution player and moving up to the more challenging and satisfying songs do not buy this pad  or any soft pad for that mattersoft pads slide on the floor
they crumple and wrinkle up
they miss steps and fail to register sometimes
the surface feels the same all over making it impossible to tell where your feet are without looking downmore advanced soft pads are available which are thicker but they still slide and have sensitivity problemsthe only way to properly enjoy ddr at home is to purchase a metal pad
just look up quotmetal ddr padquot on an internet auction site
yes they are expensive but theyll also last for a very very long time and put up with a lot of abuse
they also wont slide will be extremely sensitive and you can tell where your feet are without looking down
if you want the arcade experience at home a metal pad is the only way to get itfirst of all what were the people who designed this mat thinking
its ugly and the colors clash
also soft mats slip around way too much
you cant beat hard songs and it is frustrating even getting good scores on the easy songs
the response on soft mats is unreliable and unpredictable
if you want to enjoy ddr youre going to have to shell out for the expensive hard pads
sorry people there is no cheap way out of this one
and dont let any seller convince you that foam on the bottom of a soft mat or an antislip cover will make it better because it wonti got one of these because i thought it was a cool idea
i opened the box and it smelled like gasoline
i thought it would air out but it didnt
in order to play it you need to stand on your heels in order to not press the wrong buttons
it was almost impossible to press  buttons at once plus there are no l or r buttons
some of the other brands i tried were even worse
in short it stinksto sum this game up in one word horrible 
the graffics are weak beyond belief
the game play is agonizing and the storyline is so dumb an  year old couldnt enjoy it
this is one of the typical japanease anime games in which even the music is terribly japanease 
i dont know maybe in japan this is a popular style of game but i cant get anyone to play it for more than  minutes before they beg me to put something else in
id rather stab myself in the eye with a rusty pair of scissores than play this rancid game againthis game isnt even a gameyou just go around grinding for  of it
plus the musicahhhhh it isnt even music
it just makes these weird sounds the whole game except for one where there constantly swearingif i were you i would actually by a gamecheesy graphics bad soundtrack warning may cause depressionit is horriblenot as good as the gamecube or playstation versions
i have both consoles xbox and gamecube but i dont recommend buying this game for any console
i bought this for xbox thinking it was the same as the gamecube and playstation versions
the vehicles dont have weapons on the xbox version unless you earn the tank
plus there are not as many cars on the xbox version and all three versions have lousy graphics anywaybefore i start i just want you to know that i own a xbox system i love the machine i also love halo
by no means am i just ragging on the system for no reason
the last  or  games i got for the xbox have  wind
including this stupid game wrecklass
if you want to buy grand theft auto  just buy it dont buy xboxs lame version
wrecklass is great looking thats what sold me but the game itself is way too coached and the story is weak
i was greatly disapointed with this game i just hope xbox comes out with better games in the future
otherwise i will consider my xbox to be the worlds most expensive paper weightwrecklass will be yet another xbox game that i will end up trading in for hardly nothingi rented this game and i played it for about  minutes
then i turned it off
it was pretty bad for a couple reasons
you have a time limit which is barely enough to complete the missions
the only way to blow up other cars is to run into them
this is so stupid because it takes a while for the damage to go down and there is traffic so you are constantly getting hit by other cars and then you have to catch up to the bad guys againthere are no weapons
this kind of goes along with  but this game could be a lot better if they were weapons like twisted metal except in a different style
there isnt much freedom
you cant just drive around like in gta all you do is the missions which get frustrating and so i turned it offjust about the only good things in this game are the graphics
the streets and buildings are very realistic and so are the crashesi dont reccomend this game at all
i think it was a wast of my  bucks to rent it so it would absolutely be a waste of  bucks to buy itresident evil is a name that most gamers know by heart as one of the most original and compelling games to grace the industry
it perfected the genre of survival horror and created a cult following immediately
even today it is one of the most successful franchises in game history and definitely a large part of the bread and butter at capcom
however it did not achieve this status for nothing
with every classic game there is a special and carefully developed gameplay system
the resident evil series from the beginning was developed with exploration and puzzle solving in mind
then the graphical presentation was developed to supply enough detail and interest that a person would actually want to explore it
the setting in a mansion full of horror story influences was perfect for the type of game style that was being developed
at the time they used static backgrounds due to the fact that the sony playstation system couldnt display enough polygons to make a believable environment
but doing it this way also proved to make the graphical presentation much smoother and more detail rich
later the series would try full d in code veronica for sega dreamcast and then return to its roots on gamecube in perhaps the best looking game to date
resident evil gaiden for gbc was perhaps an unrealistic attempt from the beginning
the gameplay has completely changed so dramatically that it becomes a new game with a resident evil logo
it resembles more of a metal gear bit nintendo game from the s than a resident evil game
the battle system is completely boring and overly hard
it is more like a game of golf because you have to hit the button at the right time on a progress bar that scrolls left to right before you can shoot a zombie in combat mode
its tricky and timing is everything
but more importantly it just doesnt fit the re universe and it is a poor attempt to port a name over to a dead handheld system with way too little power for such a detailexploration latent game as re
the graphics are horrible even for gbc standards and the battle system is poorly developed and there is no since this is even a re game at all
invest in something else anything else
for  bucks more you could have re for gamecube the best re there is
stay away from this game i promise you will be taking it back the next day to trade for something else
it is that badthis game is absolutely terrible
i tried it out at the store first then decided to buy it
what a mistake
this game is so dark its hard to see where youre going
its actually a really difficult game and there are very few spots in the game that allow you to save
i dont recommend this game to anyoneugh this game was terrible
i will admit the graphics were pretty good but thats all i will say that it positive about it
the controls are the absolute worst
theres so much going on at once and youre trying to figure out how to control your character you just get frustrated
atleast i did
if you want to try it rent it firstget the xbox version which has better graphics dolby  surround sound makes a huge difference and easier controls
even the controller vibration seems a little more engaging on the xboxfirst things first im a big ps fanboy
i have a ps and i dont even want the others
there is one thing about this game though that really irks me ea already has it made for ps without a multiplayer and they are going to release it for gamecube and xbox with multiplayer
what is it with ea
why do they always have to make better products for the other systems
ps is just as good as the otherscome on i bought the game on the first day it came out and i beat the game on that first day its just too easy to beat the first level is fun but thats the only level thats fun goshyou cant even get in a tank or fighter planethis game is terriable
i cant believe people gave this game a good rating
realistic
you cant even kill your own allies
thats realistic
you people know nothing about video games
the game is linear and it seems that the allies would have lost the war without you you end up doing everthing
the history lesson after each mission was boring and should have never been put in the game
the symphony music sounded like you were at a funeral
this game is not as good as everyone claims it istheres a method a lot of developers use to keep a race tight in a racing game  its called quotrubber bandquot ai
rather than having each individual computer opponent actually race as they might in real life their speed is tied directly to your speed
if you slow down they slow down
if you speed up they speed up
in theory this keeps races close and excitingin sled storm it makes them obnoxiously difficult and takes any semblance of quotfunquot out of racing
it takes the quotracequot out of racing in fact
you can hit every shortcut every turbo boost and not make a single mistake throughout the entireity of a  minute long race and if you make a minor mistake at the end you can go from st place to th in less than half a second with no way to recover
this isnt an issue of making a huge mistake and falling behind its an issue that no matter how well you know a track and can exploit it youll never get more than half a second ahead of last placeas a result sled storm isnt a racing game its a game about not making any mistakes ever
its not fun its not interesting its a horrible way to have implemented the computer quotaiquot and it makes the game so utterly pointless and worthless that its not likely i will ever play it againas the review title implies i despise this game
sled storm for the ps is a huge disappointment
the graphics are ugly primarycolor polygons with no texture the tracks look like they were all stolen from ssx games the quotsnowmobilesquot sound like someone swatting at angry hornets with a rusty chainsaw and the tracks are way too linear
no offtrack exploration here folks
if you see this game just ignore it and walk awayfor some reason ea big decided to make a third ssx game only involving snowmobiles instead of snowboards
if you decide to explore the tracks looking for shortcuts you will find yourself crashing upon contact with thin air
the tracks themselves are similiar to ssx tracks with the everpresent clown and carnival theme that ea big loves to incorporate in all their racing games
the snowmobiles sound like garbage the graphics are polygons
crashing into thin air is the real frustrating part there is an invisible barrier on both sides on top and under the linear track that forces the driver to run the track like a roller coaster
this game is garbage plain and simple
the only demographic i think this cd rom would satisfy are kids under the age of seven
ssx was good but ea big is really running the linear rollercoaster type racing games into the ground fasti thought this game might be cool but when i played it was horrible heres stuff about itgraphicso it was to fuzzysound terriblegameplay very hardcoolness nothings cool about itresultterriblemaybe rent it but do not buy this dumb gamehow is it this game has all these reviews and high ratings when it wont be released for three more monthsi guess doc brown must be renting out his deloreanthis game is very boring
no acion what so everif you want an action game get haloi am a huge fan of the pirate game genre so i was excited to see this game in the xbox section of the store
i have owned most pirate games for the pcif youre expecting sea dogs or anything close to the old pirates game on the pc with pirates  the legend of black kat you will be as disappointed as i was with this gamethis game might be good for kids learning to play video games although it is violent
since i am not a kid i grew bored of this game after an hour
i will probably never play it againthe game play is extremely linearit would be a good game for elementary school children if it didnt have all the violencebasically its not kid enough for kids and not adult enough for adults
its just plain badif you need a crummy game fix buy it at amazon
they have the lowest price anywhere for this gamethis game is bad
i think that goldeneye the world is not enough and tommorow never dies are by far the best of the bond games
i think that this was not a good idea
the graphics are bad the gameplay is bad and the multiplayer is even worst
hopefully the next bond game will kick this ones fat  back to the industry to teach the makers a lessoni got this card and it erased my entire football team which took hours to create and my bond game which took me a week to beat
when i returned it to toysrus the video games sales clerk nerd told me that  of the people that bought this memory card from their store returned it with numerous complaints
what else is there to say
if you buy it it might work but if it doesnt
everything is gone
one friend of mine even got one of his games broken from this memory card
please do not make the same mistake i made and get this memory card
interact is a shamei two lost game saves on this card
uniquely enough it was only my pikmin game that was causing problems
my other game saves still worked
but i didnt keep it around long to figure if the other game saves would get corrupti sold itback to electronics boutique and bought the nintendo puny  memory card which has not ever failed
now that nintendo has a larger memory card do yourself a favor and buy the nintendo cardfirstly you can save a maximum of  games to a card not blocks
of you could only save  blocks the memory card wouldnt exist along with some upcoming sd memory card accessories
i thought this was a great card for a while but then it blew
so maybe it is true that i did have a couple save files equal to about  blocks and my memory card did feel pretty hot after bomberman
but no card should die like that
my recommendation is to go with the memory card  by nintendo
nintendo cards are a lot sturdier
i am thankful that the card would just no longer save rather than deleting my data and i could just move it overi didnt believe that this card could really be as bad as everyone said on here but boy was i wrong it will let me save a file maybe  or  times but if i go to overwrite it it would say corrupt data and force me to format all my savesluckily i kept backups on my nintendo brand memory card  though
i no longer trust interactthis game really upset me
i was looking forward to playing it and the game had some stupid qlitch in it that made it unable to start once i installed it
buyer beware
i could not find help for the problem and so i sold the game
i also read other reviews that the game is good but no real multiplayer unless you like only one on one battles and no real replayability i would wait for something better that you can play again and again and it be a new adventure every time
ps star wars galaxies rpg online check out the reviews
its not superhero but its better than that super space heros onlineafter being burnt on game after game morrowind black and white civ  all highlytouted games that failed to deliver even the slightest degree of gameply enjoyment i decided to stick my neck out and purchase freedom force what the hey
i thought the law of averages will eventually yield up a decent game and ive heard good reviewsneedless to say burned againfreedom force is an abysmal little game a horrendous cumbersome interface that makes gameplay confusing and erratic
enemies that can run off the edge of the map and attack you at a distance yet cannot be attacked
your heroes might as well be named idiot man and stupid boy as they will stand idly around at let themselves be attacked and shot at and not defend themselves
graphic glitches out the wazoo
you have to click on an enemy sometimes as many as four times before your hero will attackseriously ive been playing video and computer games for  years ever since the first ultima game came out for the apple  and i have never seen such an onslaught of inferior products being foisted into the marketwhat has happened to the art of game design
because from what i can tell it has diedi saw the reviews and figured it was a cant miss game
oops
luckily i was able to unload it on eay
horrible in all aspectsim not complaning because it stinks or anything but because of something big
the game doesnt work on xp
i returned it to see if it was my computer that is the problem but it is very common for hitman  to crash on windows xp
so if it says directd  unable to create device
try changing resolution or color depth and on xp
return it immediately
i returned it and got it on xboxa lot of survival horror games get a bad rep for possessing painfully clunky controls and too much backtracking but they all seem to be directed at the wrong games and never at the right game
the right game to blame for the worse controls known to man in survival horror gaming goes to one game and if not just this one then the rest of the franchise that spawned from it fatal frametecmo had a lot of unique ideas going through their heads for this game but apparently the one thing they werent thinking of was the one aspect that wouldve made this game worth the constant praise it getsdoes this make any sense
youre playing the entire game as a nineteen year old girl who walks and runs slower than a drunk elephant
plus the controls are permanently in d meaning that up will force your character to do a  and walk in the direction you point her in
fine in theory but you have to realize that using d controls in a d game based entirely off of exploration and using set camera angles that change every time you move to a different room or fight ghosts is not a good ideawhats worse is that enemies you face in this game move so fast and use up  of the terrain to their advantage that its next to impossible to try and hurt them without taking any damage in return
the ghosts are also so vocal whiny and badly spoken that their dialogue literally murders any atmosphere they had
plus i need to argue who would be terrified of blue ghost children tromping after you with their arms in the air
its like the game developers were trying to piss you off rather than scare youthe game is very innovative and unique what with using a camera as a weapon and fighting ghosts as your main enemy but facing such unfair aesthetically awkward questionably malevolent enemies with such unfair controls is about as fun and scary as being chased by a shag carpet in tennis shoesi didnt like this games at all
there are better games out theretrust me on this one dont buy itthis is want i hate about ubisoft
ubisoft actually makes bad party games
if you like a party game get crash boom bang for ds
get mario party  for wii
also get power puff girls z for dslthats all you need to know about quottest drivequot rubberband ai and pong
those are the only two things the game developers put any thought into and it just kills what possibly couldve been a fun gameits been said before and im gonna say it again in my review
the load times for this game are outrageous
really awful
theyre so bad that you are given the chance to play pong while you wait
sureits fun for about three games but then the next couple hundred times are boring
you just want the game to load up alreadythe load times would be tolerable if the game was worth the waitwhich its not
i dont know who first developed the whole rubberband ai concept but i have spent the better part of the last decade cursing them
could someone please explain to me what the point of getting good at a game is if it makes no difference whatsoever
why should i get to know the tracks and improve my powerslides if i dont have to
you could let your cat play this game up until theres about  seconds left before the end of the track
then you just pick up the controller from your precious little snowball and zoom past your opponents
how sillythe inability to fall far behind the computer racers makes this game a great title for kids and people who dont ever play racing games
theyll be proud of themselves for always being in every race
thats cool for them but a grave disappointment to those of us who want something that provides a challenge
poor graphics and repetitive gameplay make this a game most of you should skip unless its dirt cheap in a bargain bin somewherebad music awful handeling ect
i played test drive at my friends house and he said it was a million times better than grand theft auto 
devin lied
heres the comparisensgrand theft auto you can get out of the car and steal other onestest driveyour stuck in one car the whole timegtano time limittdtime limitgtayou can run over peopletdthe people always jump out of the way which gets annoyinggtaradio stationstdone terrible rap song playing the whole timegtauzis bazookas pistols flamethrowers grenadestdcargtaawesome controltdhorrid controlgtaget ittddontso i mark warcraft iii as the point where the franchise stopped being warcraft and became magecraft or magiccraft or some stupid snippy pun regarding a favor towards magic rather than warand dont worry this negative review isnt all just about the visceral hatred of high fantasy involving lots of magic
the game itself has plenty of bad flawsi used to love warcraft
but i hate warcraft since they made it blizzard presents magic the gatheringmy favorite thing about warcraft was exactly what they took out in iii and world of a sense of grittiness and uniqueness in a world of fantasy
there were no thyalawynd or darkhearts or ebonhearts or gyilwinds magic fantasy crap with gravitydefying robes and swords made of silver and no shields or any semblence of tactics or strategy or even bloodthere was no we ah the knoights of lothar the guilywind son of gunther the loinhearted son of baxter the baxton son of aragorn of aragorn and we foight fo peeeeeace versus graarrgh we are demon spawns from hell who want to crush the world and kill everything that moveswarcraft wasnt like that at allwarcraft had the orcs coming into azeroth because their own world was destroyed by civil war and rather than accomodate the humans responded with war
and it blew up in their faces as the orcs destroyed stormwind keep and forced the humans into lothleroin with the orcs following
i dont remember what happened after that but i think eventually the orcs were beaten back by the alliance of humans and elvesthen i completely do not remember a single thing about warcraft iii other than taurens supporting the orcs for absolutely no reason and the undead randomly appearing out of nowhere for no reason and night elves appearing out of nowhere for no reason and lots of pixie dust sprinkle winds magic and demons and wizards and keys and powerups and upgrades and magical fire pansy moves of doom for make benefit glorious magician of kingdom of godwynn everneverwind p darkebonheartwarcraft and warcraft ii were to me the modern medievalfantasy equivalent of conan the barbarian in that yes magic was there and magic was used but only the magicians practiced magic and the magicians could not stand up to an army of a billion orc grunts and troll axethrowers
sure then there came ogremages death knights paladins and the like but even those were but a small asset in an army made to fight with steel and wood and flesh not just magicinstead in warcraft iii and extending into world of warcraft magic becomes the centerpoint of virtually any army
you can still use the backbone of infantry and cavalry and the like but their effectiveness against magical heroes and magical elves and pixies is reduced by the sudden jump in population everything costs and the stupid upkeepbut while magic would become the more central point beyond warcraft iii wars focus instead came upon heroesthe entire rts aspect of this game is not fully broken but rather fractured by not just the inclusion but the heavy reliance upon individual heroes who have dozens of heroonly chests to pick up for upgrades and equipment that can make them more powerful and they have the ability to level up and research more abilities and powersat least half the missions in the campaign i was apart of either involved playing only as heroes or playing in such a mission that only heroes could determine the outcome of battlesthen upkeepthe idea of upkeep in this game is in no way relevant to how upkeep really works in games like total war or in real life
upkeep is the cost of maintaining an army
upkeep does not exist in traditional rts gamesin this game upkeep means you no longer mine as many resources when you have too many units
and too many ranges from  population points taken upand then comes the fact that fullarmy battles are rendered impossible when the average orc grunt starts costing three population points and the maximum population is no longer the blizzard standard of  but somewhere near  or socontrolling the first level of upkeep means your peasants now gather  of a resource rather than ten
medium upkeep reduces it to   high upkeep reduces it to   and an army under high upkeep can consist of a handful of heavy units not fit to take out a militia force twice their sizethis is only balanced by the fact that it affects all player on a map
but another problem involving this is that because the basic units take up so much population and are so ineffective the player is basically forced into an arms race with their opponents to build up their base technologies upgrade all they can then build the most powerful units available while ignoring the  of other units available to train just to meet an evenly matched opponent who has done the same thingand then again the rts idea is fractured and shattered by the powerful emphasis on building superunits and superweapons as quickly as possible and to hell with all other available unitsthis is not how a good rts works
starcraft comes to mind an army of  basic terran marines can slaughter an enemy army of hydralisks or ultralisks
an army of  battlecruisers seems unstoppable and yet can easily be torn asunder by a few corsairs or valkyries or a flood of scourges
or they can be broken up from allout attack from an arbiters stasis or a ghosts lockdown
they can suffer huge splash damage from psionic storms from high templar or infested kerriganin short in starcraft every unit is effective if utilized properly
you can win one game by playing a megalomaniac and massing dozens of super units and win another game in the same amount of time with a ragtag militia and some special tricks of infiltration and the likewarcraft iii has none of it
every unit that is not a superunit or a hero is simply cannon fodder andor base defense until that superunit or hero is available for buildingand so what was once warcraft and i so deridingly called magecraft could more accurately be called herocraft because heroes are so ridiculously overpowered that they become the center point of every game even the skirmishes as you cannot start unless you pick a hero for your side
and you can get more than one hero on a map one for heavy combat one for support and one for magicthree words for this franchise out of gas
warcraft  and  were excellent games however as with blizzards last few outings this game falls well short of where it should be offering nothing new or any kind of originality to the rts genre
in game hero system
warlords battlecry  does it better great graphics
hardly colorful cartoonish triangles if anything elsegameplay
eh boring after the first couple missions or so no new missions of any kind to add life into this genre
finally the story is why this game gets one star it does have a fairly decent storyline however not up to par with some of the other great rpg storylinesbeware this program like many other recent games will only run on an account that has administrator privileges on windows xp or  that means that in most common home settings school settings or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game
if you have configured your home pc for example so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them limited accounts a recommended best practice you should certainly be following your kids will not be able to play this game
similarly if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to userlevel access then only the administrators will be able to play the gamenote that although i agree with the general consensus that warcraft iii is an excellent game my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box it is not and thus i cannot give this product more than a single star because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentationmore information on this issue is available atgamblers have it the worst in the video game department
for every half decent gambling related game that comes out ie
multiplay video poker real deal slots slots ii there are twenty released that are complete junk
this is one of themyou play steve wynn in so many words by taking a poorly run casino and attempting to make it into something spectacular
the concept is great but the execution is awful
the casinos themselves are poorlyrendered ripoffs of the luxor excalibur treasure island and binions horseshoe
they even managed to do really creepy looking renditions of siegfried and roy apparently they own the excalibur in this game
the only original casino is one that looks like an old s style jukeboxso what machines do you have to choose from
slots video poker and video blackjack
thats it
what table games do you have
blackjack and craps
if you move up the ranks youll get roulette paigow and a wheel of fortune table
wow
the graphics on this game are so generic you really cant tell the difference between slot machines and blackjack machines
the craps tables are only barely distinguishable from the other tables
its really awful how you supposedly have a variety of slot machines yet they all look the same
not that it matters as you cant play any of them and having different machines doesnt affect the game anyway
the gameplay is completely generic
its a matter of build enough items and the casino will fill up
i really dont see any advantage of using one machine over another or table games versus machines for that matter
just dump enough items on the floor and youll advance to the next level
exciting huhill get really nitpicky now
the restaurants and shops you build
just d images you paste on a wall
thats it
you cant go into these wallpaper shops or change anything about them except youre able to offer keno in the restaurants  big deal
would it have been so difficult to allow us to adjust the prices on the items we sell
thats just one example
add the fact the customers all say the same thing over and over and the fact the music is the same song over and over and you get the feeling a lot of corners were cut to rush this game out the doorsupposedly you can adjust how much the pit bosses give out in comps
if thats true ive never seen anything happen
all they do is stand around and do nothing
ok maybe that part of the game is realistic
you can view how much cash customers have but not how much cash theyve spent  defeats the whole purpose of giving comps doesnt it
speaking of which if you click on a drunk customer he or she will start babbling like a drunk
give them a comp and all of a sudden the speech sounds normal
wow i didnt know comps sober people up
the heavilyaccented asian customers say things like are any of the waitresses for sale
if i had a politically correct bone in my body id think that sounds like a racist stereotypeyou can set the house edge on the games to somehow control how much money you collect
how is this done
by using a slider bar you set from low to medium to high
think about this for a second
anyone remotely familiar with gambling the editor who chopped this section out of my review isnt one of them knows you can change the odds on a slot machine but you cant change the odds on most table games
so how do you get more money out of them
are you putting a magnet on the roulette wheel
are you using loaded dice on the craps table
i could go on and on but i think you get my point
the game is just totally unrealistic and nothing like whats really involved in operating a casinothe best economic sim released recently is virtual resort spring break
if the subject matter doesnt appeal to you and you must have a gambling tycoon game then search for a copy of casino tycoon
its better but not by much
better yet save your money or come to vegas and bet it all on red or a hand of blackjack
even if you lose youll have more fun than you will playing this gamehope the review helpedno wonder wwhy this game went to greatest hits so quicktheir are no story lines confusing movesand it is practically impossible to beat the game on kumity mode
if you like fighting games get tekken gamesthis game is sooooo boring
the kumite mode goes on forever and you dont get anything
the characters are okay and so are the arenas but they could be a lot betterthis item does not work with my xbox at all  says i need a hard drive storage  and i also did not realize that even if it did work it was only for one playerit was baddly srached up and and barely works i wished that the owner would take pictures of the used disc so that people can see that there being rip off yesi like watching the simpsons on tvno i do not like playing simpsons video games cause theyre horriblethis has been going on since bit nintendoand developers still cant make a decent simpsons gameif they really wanted to make a great simpsons video gamethen they should release the original simpsons arcade gamethe one you had to pop quarters into on a consolei dont know why that hasnt been done yetcause that was a simpsons game i had a blast playing esp
when  people could play at the same timeas for simpsons skateboardinga big thumbs downthe simpsons is one of the weirdest shows
they just got even worst
this game is also way too hard
the simpsons should be taken off the air so should all the other adult programs
now the charecters sware even more they get into more trouble unpurpis and they just got evenb more violentim seeing a disturbing trend in games featuring the simpsons
first there was simpsons road rage which was crazy taxi with simpsons characters which was half decent
but when they tried to apply the simpsons to the tony hawk formula they fell flat on their face much like you will find youself doing quite often if you play this game
the controls so horrible that they render the game practically unplayable
the physics will not allow you to do what youd like to do making many of the goals completely unrealistic
the only thing this game has going for it are its graphicsbottom line if you are going to buy this game make sure you are willing to spend a lot of time learning the controls because otherwise you will put it down after fifteen minutes and never have a desire to play it again
if you are a big fan of the tony hawks pro skater series and big simpsons fan do not buy this game thinking you will get the best of both worlds because you will be very disappointedsigh
this has to be one of the worst games i have ever played
i went back to the video rental store and demanded for my money back after playing this  if you have ever played tony hawk then you will notice that the moves are opposite and slow
if you havent played tony hawk get that instead
if you have played tony hawk run away from this gamelet me start by saying that i am a comic book fan and i know my super heroes
i was looking forward to this game ever since i heard about it and i was extraordinarily disappointed when i played it
now let me also say that this game is very beautiful
the graphics are amazing but everything else is completely mediocre and most of the time just plain bad
the biggest complaint one can muster is of the control scheme
seeing as how the controls drive the entire game this tends to ruin the experience
amazingly stiff controls and notatallinnovative use of gadgets plague this title
you try to punch a guy and you get shot by a hail of bullets which causes you to fall to the floor every time so you cant fight back
this is on the first level mind you
you try to execute a move and the camera suddenly switches directly in front of you thus reversing controls and making you miss
you try to jump but the controls are so stiff and unpolished that you only go straight up
now assuming you have enough skill and attention span to get past the horrible fights that occur every few seconds and get to a boss fight you wont win
not for a long time anyway
if you do congratulations you play too many video games
the very first boss black mask totes double magnums
you come near him which is necessary to defeat him and you get pulverized with three or four shots
this doesnt even scratch the surface of the problems with this game
lets move onto the story
im sure youve heard all this garbage about final fantasys kenji terada
well looks like he lost his touch
youll find more originality in a james bond movie
the plot goes something like this  evil evil people have conjured up an evilsatellitedeathray and are planning to take over the world but he is going to stop them
make sure you dont forget to try and be dramatic by emphasizing he and him instead of saying batman
you wouldnt want to sound normal
well ive said enough
dont buy itthis game really stunk in the graphics areathe people look like blobs and mostly just float across the rooms
my two year old could have done a better job creating this game than whoever diddo not buy unless you just really want to be bored and frustratedif you are a fan of some of the better simulation games like the simcity series or even tropico etc dont buy this game
the graphics are substandard the gameplay is boring and unimaginative and the interface is less than intuitive
this game is a blatant attempt to cash in on the reputation of some of the more succesful and bettermade tycoon gamesi received this game for christmas and i was very disappointed in the graphics and the game play
its the worst tycoon game ever
i cant my family payed full price for this tycoon reject
roller coaster tycoon airline tycoon sim city zoo tycoon etc all have great game play and is very addictive unlike this gameon the box it says a completely d world
that is total false its basically has bit graphics the type of graphics that were on the super nintendo video game consoles
another problem i have faced was that the game crashed a lot
you have to save frequently and it takes forever to save
its just like the sims it take  minutes to save
i loaded this game on my windows  and would crash when you got to the preloader
then i bought a windows xp and it would crash every  to  minutesi hope i made an impact on your decision not to buy this game its not worth the money and it has many flaws
if you want to just try the game buy it usedopened up a new line of genre very unique gameplay and expansive environment
but riddled with glitches and imperfections
enough so to make this very frustrating
almost seems impossible at times
fun for a few hours but afterwards i wouldnt ever play it again
not worth the moneygta is indeed an amazing game
it has a large environment decent graphics and decent gameplay
but its too often unnecessarily complicated
some of the missions are next to impossible to finish which makes the game more frustrating than needed
i really tried to like the gamewhat a crying shame
gta is an amazing game but i wouldnt know
rockstar did such a poor job of porting this game to the pc it almost seems like theyre mocking us nonsony gamers
anyone who can install this game and play it immediately without needing hours of technical support and screaming at your monitor must have some gift from god
the technical support by the way is not available to call on weekends and it takes a minimum of  hours for an email response
im not waiting nearly a week to be told that its not compatible
my pentium  computer works like a dream but its still not enough
it works poorly if at all with an optical mouse it doesnt show text at all the graphics are absolutely abysmal and choppy and the blood stains are pretty much red boxes on the ground
pity
a word of advice listen to these other reviews and skip this unacceptable piece of garbage
get the ps version or a pc game thats actually playablethis game had so many conflicts with existing drivers on my system i never was able to play it even though my system exceeds all recommendations and requirements stated
after spending  days writing exhaustive emails to socalled customer support and downloading drivers for nearly every piece of hardware on my system all their recommendations led up to the unsolvable error quotgta requires at least mb of free video memoryquot  i have mb of free video memory but the game cannot recognize this
all my other games play with no hitches but i will be returning this onei know there is a lot of hype for this game
the new gtaiii vice city is supposed to be another hit with newer cars and things of that nature
but aside from all the killing and blowing up stuff is there really anything else that captures the immagination in this game
ive seen friends play this over and over again saying how great it is
so i get it and play it
after  min of missions of killing things and blowing stuff up with practically no sense of purpose and any form of variety in the missions i had to uninstall this game
its horrible
if you love games where its mindless killing filled with great codes i should add then go for it
but if you need a plot with an actual challenge that stimulates the mind then you might want to go another routeas a lover of street i was very excited to hear about this game and bought it immediately
to my surprise its not even a tenth as good
this game is five on five with only street players i had a feeling that was coming with no nba endorsement on the cover and boring backdrops
there is just too much going on on the court in order to really have fun with street style moves
i also think the arial attack could be made more interesting
it plays like a generic basketball game with the addition of ankle breaking moves which is a big step down from nba street which was more like the arcade nba jam style of ballin
i returned this game after a day and bought slugfest instead
at least i can punch gayrod nowthis is seriously the worst game ever made
it plays like a  version of nba live  only it  way more
    the graphics are bad the sound is bad and game play is bad
i rented this game from blockbuster then took it back to them and demanded a different game it was so bad
dont even rent it if its freeeidos really dropped the ball here folks
as usual the story is great although there are a few notable inconsistancies that will hopefully be explained in the next game
however the poor controls and obvious lack of beta testing kill this game
first to attack you have to target an enemy
usually not a problem but while targeting you cannot jump
you can also only dodge leftright not back or jumping
second while sucking blood youre stuck in the equivalent of a very repetitive cutscene where you are still vulnerable to attack though can do nothing to avoid the blow
third if you die you have to watch any cutscenes between you and the last checkpoint over again no way to skip themas for glitches there are hundreds if not more
clipping is horrible people fall through walls
not a problem unless you wanted their weapon
well into the game many people myself included lose the ability to save by either getting a save failed message or a corrupt new file which has led to a few people having to start over
as much as i love the story this hardly seems worth the hassle and frustration of playing a game eidos and crystal dynamics failed so horrifically onthis series keeps getting worse
the first game for the ps was good
the second in the series soul reaver was fairly entertaining
the third soul reaver ii was soso but far too short
blood omen ii is just plain bad
on the plus side the urban feel of the level design is a nice change from the rest of the series where the developers focused more on ancient ruins canyons and forests
on the down side game play is sluggish at best
the controls are not responsive making fight sequences tedious
the dialog during the cut scenes is totally off
i dont mean by a second or two im talking about voices coming from the wrong characters
sometimes the soundtrack is nonexistent
on top of that ambient sounds have a tendency to get stuck in a loop repeating themselves over and over drowning out every other sound
the only remedy is to restart the game
i have also had some problems with the graphics
on occasion when i enter a new area the entire screen aside from kain goes blank
once again the only effective remedy i have found is to restart the game
ive used other discs on my console so i know my system isnt on the blink
last but not least this game suffers from the curse of mandatory cut scenes
im tired of having to sit through long drawn out movies with no bypass option every time i replay a section of the game
i really wish i could give this game a better review seeing that the developers must have put some sort of time and effort into making it but i cantdo not buy this game its a definite waste of money
and in the end its a game controller thrown across the room
especially when you have to beat the bosses
this is the end of the line for eidos games for me
if you love eidos and you play this eidos game you will never want one again
fair warning dont play this eidos game just clear it from your mind
psit is fun at first until you get to a boss stage that isok as for the title of this review ill get back to that later
but as for the game itselfits awful
you run through these mazelike levels pounding the buttons sometimes stopping to solve boring switchdoor puzzles they didnt even bother with boxes
you cannot move the camera the levels are so linear your view so limited that this might as well be dyet creating a mindless boring buttonmasher wasnt enough for midway
they had to go and add rpg elements
which means that they take the absolute worst part of the rpg genreendless experience grinding
you see merely mashing buttons is not enough
you must mash buttons through the same levels over and over in order to level up enough otherwise your chances of beating the game are shotand also although the rest of the game is ridiculously easy youll never win if you cant get the special items to defeat the bosses
which of course are nearimpossible to getnow that thats off my chest ill explain the title
this game stole dozens of hours of my friends life
she cant beat it on her own because the difficulty is ridiculous so she just enters the invincibility code over and over and blows through the game time and time againshes over her gauntlet phase now thank goodness but for a while there it was all she diddont get this game
seriously
real gamers will be bored out of their skulls casual gamers like my friend are at risk of getting addicted
now go buy something better
like a game by nintendothose  words are sloppystupid and ugly
after playing this game i am so happy that i bought  instead
as you know both are ports of ps games with one major difference james bond has actually been improved on and spy hunter has been cut up
it is an extremely sloppy port from the ps version
graphics just plain stink pretty much no real damage to anything at all and it gets boring faster than the levels can load
there are driving levels on james bond and sad to say they are better than this whole game
and you get to shoot suff and have multiplayer
but seriously on the driving  levels there is real damage and all the weapons and gadgets of spy hunter so just get it and have fun running into ped carsi rented this game an couple of weeks ago and was extremely dissapointed
the graphics are sloppy and the car handles like a  year old junker form the junkyard
it slides around on turnes and accelerates very poorly
for some super soupedup spy car it isnt very impressive
the gameplay is poor and the weapons control is hard to learn between guns and defensive weapons
do not buy this gamethe movies between levels are very bad andoverall  stargraphicsthe graphics are terrible compared to any other game
even of its not baseball the graphics are inacceptable
all the people look the same accept for their race and the outfit they are wearing
half the players dont even have a picture stargameplaythis game was sooooooooo poorly made
in the easiest difficulty i lost  with the same teams in  harder difficulties i won 
also u always get away with stealing from first to second but u never be safe stealing from second to third star this game gets boring soo eaily becuase it only has  good modes
there is practice and exibition which is the same
home run derby which is terrible becuase u cant face the computer and a season which is terrible because half way through the season u always get a roster problom which is impossible to fix starcrashes easily and takes  minutes to instal this game which is about  meg took  minutes to install on my super good  ghz amd athelon pc
diablo  which is  gig  times the amount took  minutes to install
also when u play this and u forget to close ur instant messeges and u get an instant messege the game minimizes
once it minimizes say good bye
cuase once u click on the game to bring it back the screen turns black and it freezesdo not buy this gamefor the past three offtheshelf versions of high heat there have been bugs galorei will name only the first three that come to mindyou cant watch your team play in manager only mode if you try it will kick you to your desktop after the top half of the first inningtrying to play home run derby can make your computer hangyet again snafu with transferring seasons from older versions of the gameim sure the game itself will be great once it is patched
so do yourself a favor and wait until it is
even at the low shelf price its not worth the frustration yeti have played all of the might and magic games over the years and do not believe i can really express how awful this game is
stay away
you will be much better off with wizardry viii a fine example of how a series should be endedthis game literally made me feel sick
i actually really enjoyed the older graphics it made the game original
the new graphics and game play make me motion sick
what a shame it was dos last shot before they went belly up that pretty much sums it up
the first getaway was fantastic in my opinion
it was original enough to be great
shooting around walls was awesome
getting lost was fun in itself because i could marvel at london
say goodbye to thatblack monday is flat out terrible
there were some problems with the original getaway but i could overlook them as i fell in love with the game
black monday fixes nothing it actually has caused a ton of problems itselfthe first apartment you raid is absolutely stupid
the main problem is that the camera is jerky
you can always see what you need to see but when you move the camera jerks to follow you
you will notice this right at the start of the gameanother problem is how easy this game is
enemies cant hit anything
even at pointblank range the enemies dont seem to be able to hold their gun straight
i walked up to about  dudes and just handcuffed them
while i was handcuffing them everyone stopped and politely waited for me to finish
the fighting in the game is stupid as well because you just walk up and punch dudes
occasionaly you can grab them then turn them around and snap their necks
it is so unbelievably boringthe worst idea was putting in the crappy stealth missions
they are horrible
every game wants to do this now
almost every game i play puts you in a stupid stealth mission that just drags
stop making stealth missions
i just played shadow of rome and the stealth missions are pure crap
i love metal gear solid and splinter cell but honestly those are the only times i appreciate stealth
the stealth missions in this game consist of you walking around occasionaly hiding until a guard leaves
i dont think they tested this game with real people
had they of done that they would of been told to take out the stealth missions and kill themselves for making such a horrible gamelondon is recreated perfectly
the only problem is i dont care
now you have a map option
to me this is a terrible idea
the whole concept of the original getaway is realism
sure you could buy a map
when youre driving alone though you cant freeze the time continum and take a break to see what road you need next
you will use the map function only to finish this game so you can take it back
i only got  dollars for it
im surprised they even took it back seeing as how horrible it isthe graphics are terrible
blah blah blah
everything about this game is bad
im just so mad i spent fifty dollars on it
truthfully this game is flat out terrible and i dont think they will be creating another getaway anytime soon
if they do i think it will be the first game in history to sell zero copiesdont get this unless you have a specific intention for it
if you just want to buy cool gamecube accessories stay away from this
it does not function for many games at all and even though it is a cool idea i sold mine as fast as possible after i learned of its minimal capabilities
a product like this has potential but definately wait until some good game comes out that supports it in a big way
dont let any review that says that its good without giving specific reasons of specific games that it is good forwhen i open it and put it in the gamecube it did not work disc game error
i am trying to pulish it
i pulish it and is working but i dont think that this should happen with a used game buyed on such a nice storeplease buy wwf raw because it is a  or  star game
ill say  stars for wwf raw because a lack of match variety but other than that raw is great
legends of wrestling is bad you have to buy moves and wrestlers through earning points through making so far through different levels of the game
not only that the wrestlers do not come out to their classic entrance music they come out to some generic menu music wwf raw is a whole lot bettertrust methis is nothing but a bunch of politicaly correcttreehugging enviromentalist crap
all you do is swim around and uhm swim around and ahhhyeah swim aroundyour weapon is that annoyingfingernailsagainstachalkboard skreetcheeeeehhhh eeeiii eeeee
i purposely died throughout the game just to see him float belly up to the surfaceecco the dolphin needs to stop making video games and go get beached or caught in a netonly get this game if its free my friend and i both have gamecubes and we couldnt wait for this game
my friend bought it the day it came out full price its not worth it its is utter crap everything is crap about this game id have a sexchange b id buy this gamehaving loved the akiasmik wwe games on n wrestlemania amp no mercy ive been looking forward to this for a long time amp ive never been more disappointed by a game in my life
the game has been developed by yukes who did the smackdown series on ps amp  amp while it looks very impressive when running on demo its awful to play
no story modes no interference a lack of some characters real theme tunes a criminal lack of moves amp the worst blocking system in the history of gaming
it plays like a very rushed unfinished game amp is simply no fun to play at all
avoid like the plaguebefore i begin this review im not going to pick on anyone elses review on amazon but i will state that this is my personal opinion of the abomination that is wrestlemania xheres my reviewgraphicsthe graphics for this game arent the best and theres no excuse being that the majority of gamecube games have excellent graphics
still im at least able to say the wrestler models are smooth and the framerate is consistent but man o man are the graphics buggy and collision detection is truly crap
in fact most wrestlers lack detail altogether and look about as generic as possible
the arenas themselves are decent at best and looks very crisp with clean textures however the crowd looks about as bad as it can get which would be a giant block of humanity flattened and displayed at frame loopsnothing special to talk about here
the wrestlers dont sell moves generally do not look hurt and arent exactly too accurate in size
generic boring graphics galoresoundone redeeming quality of wrestlemania x would be the soundand thats as far as music goes because the sound effects are muffled and bad
the music is really good
each theme is accurate and a lot better than i anticipated
just dont expect much when you hit a wrestler or slam them other than a light slapping noise or a muffled thudtheres no commentary which really sucks
i often wondered why wwe games for gamecube couldnt have commentary when ultimate muscle legends vs new generation for gamecube doesgameplayheres the really bad part as if the sound and graphics werent bad enough in comes the incredibly boring gameplaywestlemania x does feature a decent enough roster but the moves are limited and thats the main problem with this game
the movesets given to each wrestler is about  or so moves a finisher running attacks standing attacks and some ground attacks
on paper this wouldnt be bad but considering every wrestler has the same bodyslam suplex as well as other moves shows just how much this game truly sucks
even the smaller wrestlers movesets are about the same with minor exceptionsthe match types wouldnt be bad if this game was better
you get single tag team tlc hell in a cell cage rumble handicap and some other match typesthe roster couldve been really good but the graphics are so bad that i could truly care less whos featured in this game
the roster consists of the hardy boys rob van dam hulk hogan the rock stone cold steve austin triple h undertaker kane and a few others
there are about  some odd wrestlers plus some unlockables
but the one thing that truly pissed me off was the fact that this game had the nwo in it and is such a crappy game
i cant stress it any more how much you should stay away from this game
bad controls collision detection problems bad graphics limited engine and so many more screwups makes this title only worth owning if you intend on buying the entire series of wrestling games like myself
if youre a collector get it if not avoid this one
its literally the worst wrestling game of the th gen and possibly ever ranking alongside such failures like wcw nitro wcw thunder and the abysmal wcw backstage assaultwcw vs the world for the n is a helluva lot better than this game in every way and thats a wrestling game thats  years away from being  years old
terriblethe year is  president bush is plaining an invasion on iraq because of threats of nuclear weapons america is entertained with american idol
and the wwe just celebrated another wrestlemania
in  thq came out with this wrestling game
when i saw it i thought it was going to be one of the best wrestling games
but i was wrong
the controls are easy
but the game is bad
if your stone cold and you nail the stunner they get up right away
just like on smackdown you can pop a finisher anytime
the music is bad
and the story mode is god awful
if your champion you dont come out with the belt
my friends dont get smackdown err i mean wrestlemania x get day of reckoning
this game is very bad and should have never been created
shame on you thq for this game
shame shame shameive bought many wrestling titles by thq for the nintendo and have found them all to be great
when this game came out for the gamecube i was excited
excitement quickly turned into disapointment
everything that was great about the previous thq wrestling games is missing in this
the controls are subpar and the graphics in my opinion are not as good as the s
the computer ai is annoyingly cheap reversing your best moves when you are at full momentum
bascially this is a rental and not a good rental at that
hopefully theyll be able to improve this title in later installmentsfans of the n wrestling game series waited long for a nextgen successor to take nintendo to the next level of sports entertainement
they will have to keep waitingwrestlemania x sports what feels very much like smackdown  but lacks many of the features the smackdown series made it big for
the create a wrestler caw system  while creating smooth wrestlers  is very limited
heres a rundowngraphics  the graphics are great in some places  but are inconsistant
while some wreslters look very much like their counterparts  many dont
the movements onscreen are rather jerky and dont quite line up
its a step up from previous nintendo platform games  but nothing for a next gen systemsound  the only complaint ive come up with so far  from myself or others is that the levels are a bit low
if cranking your stereo or tv up a couple of notches is the only problem  youre pretty much standing on solid ground
the sound does indeed need some extra volume  but is otherwise excellentcontrols  the controls are clumsy and unintuitive
while theyre not impossible to manage  many commands double for mulptiple things you might attempt to do in the same circumstances
the instruction manual is horribly organized for attempting to find what buttons you hit to perform whatgameplay  well  this is what matters in a wrestling game
controls  as mentioned above  are unintuitive  but responsive at the very least
timing seems less important in this game  compared to other titlesthe moveset is incredibly limited
no mercy had  different grapple moves per wrestler counting only front grapples for simplicity in this review  smackdown had ten  wm x has  the selection of grapple options is pretty limited tooprerelease hype pointed to slower  more realistic gameplay  and better quotsellingquot of moves selling refers to taking the move and making it look good
the gameplay is slower than the mindless funger numbing poundanybuttonandwin frenzy of smackdown  but win strategies are still pretty limited
as for the quotsell timequot  expect your opponents to stay down only a little longer after a twist of fate or stone cold stunner than if they had been nailed with an eye rake or fireman carrythe grappling is also a holdover from smackdown
what is there of no mercy in this game  as we were promised
not much
attacks to the groin give a quotdingquot sound  and the countering system uses a foundation based off of no mercy
however  whereas there were dozens of possible counters  including varied reversals for heavyweights  light heavyweights  an martial artists  there is usually only one reversal to a move  and most are shared among many  many moves
finishers can be reversed  howeveramong the good are a wide variety of matches  every sort of match your little heart could desire  provided it makes a showing on wwfe tv
hell in a cell  cage  tornado tag  etcto summarize the gameplay  it plays like a cheesy arcade game
in the early nineties  we moved away from this kind of game for just that reason
its return is unwelcome  and its demise will not be mournedcreate a wreslter  sadly  the caw works like the smackdown series  without the benefit of all the options
selections are limited and hardly sufficient for coming up with a wrestler that is anything more than a hodge podge of the current pop favorites
the caw system from smackdowns  and  was a huge selling point  even to people disappointed with the gameplay
this is but a pale imitation of better systemswrestlemania x has remained a fairly big disappointment
some will enjoy this title  but id suggest renting it  even if you are a fan of the smackdown series and this review has done nothing to sway youthis game is frustrating
each level or scene has about  stunts to do
in the very first scene u have to go full speed and do a  first you have to have the right car or you will end up failing the mission
if you go a couple of mph less than the full speed of the car than you wont jump high enough and the director wont like it
also i found myself doing very close to a  but it didnt count cuase i missed by a couple of degrees
the commercial overrates this game although it has cool graphics the game play stinks and the controls are too much hardtohandleproscar handling is easy and responsiveconslack of walkthroughs adds a needless level of difficulty to an already challenging gamethere are reload screens between each takei would have probably rated it  stars but the fact that grand auto theft  is out there i gave it a   go to grand auto theft   you wont regret itthis game is super bad
it is difficult and very frustrating
unlike some games where the challenge is figuring out the puzzle this game makes you repeat and repeat the same move over and over
the load times are very long and very frequent
im sure if you spent years you could get good at it
in my opinion a game has to be a little fun at first or who else but a masochist will want to play itthis game literally made me furious
to be fair driving games usually arent my cup of tea but this game is a real turd
the graphics are good not great but solid
the only good thing about this game is that i rented itif you like extremely hard driving games that take months to master then this is right up your alley
if you like games that are fun and that you can play the first night without getting very angry then stay away from this gamei hated it im going to rent way of the samuri again that is an awesome gamethis game is terrible
lets start it hereyoure a stuntman
you get to follow orders from a director who demands you do some of the most stupidly rigorous tasks to complete stunts
some of the stunts are cool but the game gets hard at about the th level
the first movie you shoot is like a tutorial
i rented this game and never beat it
the first level of the first real movie in which your basically like dukes of hazards is tremendously hard
you have to do things in split seconds and the game is so hard that it is frustrating
the game has no good points that i can think of
on one of the first missions i didnt barrel roll and i still won it
another time i was suppose to hit a  board and spin sideways near a garbage can i barely did it and i wonbut once you get to the dukes of hazards type movie no
its ridiculously stupid
there are cooling towers in random places falling on your car
then you have to jump through a train at the start which is kinda luck
anyways the game could of gotten things right
for one the game is fun when your not all stuntman
right after you jump over a house you get to cruise for like  seconds which is fun considering the environment looks good
the game though doesnt lay out maps for you and doesnt give you any help
the director almost wants to make this thing as hard as possible because he never edits the movieslike normal directors and stunt coordinators do and he never attempts to tell you where to go beforehand
you will be flipping left and right going up and down with no sence of direction
one second costs you the matchthe game is terrible
there are some extras
trailers or some crap
the map editor is terrible
you can put about  items in and that is it
i never figured out mechanical carsi just decided to use cheats to unlock the editor stuff and i never found out if there were any extra maps to unlock in the campaign
but this game offers nothing except frustration and crap
honestly i would like to see the creators beat their own game
if they could do that it would be great beacause not many people canyeah weve all seen the commerical while all those pretty little actors are sitting in their trailers being pampered and fond over the stuntmen are out having all the frickin fun
just that line makes you want to go over to circuit city and buy this game
stop
do not do that
this game is a horrible waist
truly an awesome video game idea but it couldve been brought to life on a totally different approachthe first level starts off with a few simple tasks
or so they seem
you complete the first task hey no problem ive got this nailed then almost immediatly the director shouts out another task you have to do usaully within  seconds
despite how terribly hard annoying and frustrating it is i just have to wonder how the makers thought this would be fun
i mean completing task after task after task
now in games like grand theft auto the whole task things fun
you can actully get out the car and do other things but not in this game
you are strictly stuck onto one direct path for each level and there is no time for rest
as i said before all it is is do this do that do this you failed do it again time up restart level do this do that do this do that do this you failed start overplease spare yourself and rent it first
my friend and i both rented it and didnt even want to play it more than once
the first time we played was for about  hours  hours i could have been sleeping and in that whole time we did not even pass the first level
now to end this review ill be as frank as possibly this game is a mediocre piece of gamingi saw the commercials for this game and the game looked awesome
until i bought it
i played it over and over again trying to just get past my first stunt
some stunts are easy but if you go mph too fast or mph too slow or cut a corner too widely or not wide enough the blood vessels begin to burst from the frustration
believe me the only cool part about this game is the commercialsif you like dragonball z the show and you bought this game you would know exactly why i think this
every single thing in it is off course to the show
the very first things you fight are wolves but for some reason they made it so the wolves can kill you in  shots when you have to punch them  times to kill one
also when you fight radits piccolo says lets do this already he dosent do one thing to help you
he just sits there watchinganother dumb thing about the game is that you have to do little side missions such as saving a boy in the forest
when goku is going to fight napa and vegeta in the episodes do you see goku helping people getting a toy boat or saving little boys in the forest
i thought notthe game is very short and easy too
you can go to a level of  there is one challenging thing in the game and you will find that out on your ownthis is the worst game ever
do not by it
it will make you hate dragon ball zquotthis isnt so bad is that a rabbit
i think it might be a squirrel actually its eating my flesh
im dead
spectacularquot thats basically a short summary of this game
talk about boring
you can die to the harmless butterflys if they touch you
honestly this game is terrible
to beat monsters you have to take damage or use up all your kai
to beat bosses you have to do some crappy solar flare  million times hit them with  punches max then run and do it over againon the positive side this game is seriously beautiful
just looking at the environments kept me playing when the gameplay didnt
but the control systemterrible
the way the world whips around constantly at the slightest mouse movement made me want to throw up
youd think you could fix this tendency by altering the mouse sensitiviy but youd be wrong
at the lowest setting bo still resembles the jerky camera parts of saving private ryanand i mean that in a bad unexciting way
also whats up with no strafe controls
you cant bind any keys to move your player sideways
when you get in a fight the keys that previously and redundantly since the mouse does that already rotated the character are mysteriously transformed into the missing strafe keys
why eidos would abandon the triedandtrue quaketype controls in this game is a mystery
i suspect its an artifact left over from bos console port
with its whacky control system the hardest part about bo is keeping your lunch downalso parents should take note of the mature rating for this game
if ever a game deserved an m rating or worse this one does
this is coming from someone whos enjoyed other m rated games like soldier of fortune which features gory wartype violence directed at armed soldiers with a penalty for killing civilians
but blood omen  takes violence in a very dark direction
as a vampire youre encouraged to view humans as food and feed on them wherever you find them
in practical terms this includes walking up to old ladies and clubbing them to death as they scream for you to stop
they fall down and try to crawl away while begging for their life and you have to beat them to death before you drink their blood necessary to refill your health meter
while i generally view kills in video games as cartoonishly entertaining i found this level of violence disturbing
i suppose its passed off as natural vampire behavior though i wonder about the public response if these were say harp seals being clubbed instead of people
everyones got their own standard regarding game violence
mines pretty liberal but this is the first game that made me feel like id seriously signed up with the dark side
the mature rating means someone out there thinks its suitable for your year old son
i suggest you make that call yourselfit is bad  the graphics are poor the game is lacking in so many ways
story does not mesh with the soul reaver series which is worth buying
it was dull and boring i can not stress how bad it is
save your moneyi bought this game when it was new its very fun and has good graphics for when it came out but it will not work on newer computers no matter what you try  windows  compatibility mode doesnt work
x resolution doesnt work
 color doesnt work
do not buy this game if you have a computer built after get the nintendo  version if you really want to play or write to lucasarts asking them to release it on wiis virtual console if you dont own a nintendo words cannot express how much i hate this game
there are very few games that i flat out hate but this is one of them
this could actually be the worst game ive ever played so thats saying alotthe game tries to be a choose your own adventure samurai story set in the last days of the tokugawa shogunate era of japan but completely fails
heres whyeven though there are multiple paths you can take through the game you can beat the game in about  min
either way
not even most bit games are that short and those are certainly a helluva lot more funthe swordfighting is boring due to the slow pace lack of moves and underevolved fighting engine
and since thats the main gameplay hook it leaves you with little reason to play
dynasty warriors and devil may cry both sweep the floor with this onetheres no voice acting
just grunting and giggling sound effects
for a game that wants to have a story this sure is a raw dealthe save system is just messed up
period
there were occasions where id save my game die and find out that my file had  mysteriously been erased
and a quick look at some of the other reviews tell me im not alone on this onethe black guy with the afro
seriously what the hell is this guy doing here
maybe if he actually said something funny once in a while itd be pretty neat but as it is he has no personality and seems to just take up space
leave him alonethe game world is tiny
it consists of  i think areas that are each about the size of a football field
for a game that wants to have adventure game elements this totally destroys everything and is the final nail in this games coffinheres my haikugreat ideaoriginal and uniquevery badly donei rented this game with no instructions
the first thing i noticed was that there was a tutorial
this tutorial was slow torture but i learned some things
then i started the game
the graphics were pretty good and i sensed that some great stuff was going to happen
i started off nicely explored around and i got killed
so i started again explored some other parts and got killed again
this time i decided to avoid getting killedthats when this game got dull
really really dull
i played for two hours painfully walking from one place to another
the fighting though interesting at first was monotonous
the setting soon became boring
worst of all i wanted to save
for the love of goodness i kind not find out how to save
the controls and tutorials taught me everything else but how to do
after playing for three hours straight i turned off my ps hoping the game was saved automatically
it wasnt and i wasnt going to repeat those three hours of gameplay so i said forget iti promptly returned it to the video store hoping that the few hours that the game resided in my house didnt lower my property value
this game was cheap
first of all there were no voices at all
voice actors are not expensive yet they couldnt even afford that
secondly there is no compass
many times i would want to go north but i could only hope i was walking there
i could only check when i reached a new area whether i went north south east or west
finally you can not save immediately
granted i could have looked it up how to do it on the internet but by that time i realized this game wasnt even worth itits a great idea terrible execution
avoid this game at all costsi just knocked my keyboard drawer off the runners and smashed the cd into little pieces is that any idea of how i feel about this game
it has great graphics but the controls are like that of indiana jones emperors tomb meaning absolutely terrible
many times i couldnt get the character to stop or to jump when i hit the buttons
and like indy no saves on tough spots
you have to start all over again from the very beginning
jesus dont game designers ever listen to gamers
fortunately i only paid  for this game
busting the cd into little pieces was gratifying god i hate it when designers come up with shoddy games like this
dont buy this piece of crap
really
the only thing positive i can say about it is the graphics
theyre terrific but it doesnt do you any good if you cant control the character
i even downloaded a patch hoping that would correct the problems but no good
honestly its more aggravating than the money you waste on it
absolutely terrible dirty stinking rotten i would rate it zero stars but there is no such option
just as you are about to conquer the world almost every single provence revolts
even if you have two spies in every provence
any loyalty of above   even if the enemy king is  years old and all of his fellow horse men have been killed he can rout  archers that have him surrounded then kill your  something year old king and his three fellow knights
the game has internal logic but it stacks the odds against you in ways that are oddly illogical
it is just a frustrating gamei have tried this game and broken my controler in the atempt to play it
and to sum this game up in word would be impossible so i will try it in  words quotthis game really really suckedquotthe worst fps available for the gba is wolfenstein d
its not the worst by much medal of honor underground is pretty darn close
wolfenstein d was the fifth fps for the gba but the first fps ever to be released for any system
bringing this title back from the dead probably wasnt such a good idea with games like ecks vs sever competeing with it
doom and duke nukem were old games coming back to life on the gba but those turned out so darn good
those games featured beautiful graphics
wolfenstein ds are just plain outdated and ugly however not as ugly as medal of honor undergrounds
the game features the original  levels and  weapons
only 
yes i know there were only  in the original but that is to little
this game is even outdated on the game boy
the game is still fun but there are a lot of better choices in the fps genre for gba
trust mewhy on earth are the startbacklittle buttons placed so that trying to reach them gives you carpal tunnel
the japanese sure have some incredible thumbsim very disapointed with this  the cord must be loose or have a bad connection  when your playing you keep getting a message says please plug in paddle
i could have bought a used not good condition paddle half the price but spent few extra dollars for good condition paddle  it is not thats right
if you found this controller more comfortable you have little girly hands obviously not an insult to female gamers out there
i never saw anything wrong with the original controller and still laugh at all who own one of these controller ss because they cant handle a lb controller that fits adult hands welldont get me started on ps and gc controllers a camera button
 but i think the xbox was innovative in designing a controller for someone with hands bigger and stronger than a  year olds
theyre durable too
i threw mine out a second floor window onto concrete i dont take losing well and it has barely a scratch
i accidentally broke my friends ps controller by just shifting it in my hands wrong ultimately not my fault for my hands were much stronger and versed to useing a tough controllerso while technically this controller does the exact same functions as the original i couldnt see myself wielding one anytime soon
cheers to those who whined until xbox put this out
i only wished you whined for something that really mattered like more rpgs or less sports titlesi purchased this xbox controller s used
the description by the seller was condition near new
however the way the controllers wires were wrapped suggested otherwise and the controller only lasted  weeks before shorts and freezes began during game play
but for  bucks there is not much to complain about
i still have one of the original xbox controller s from the st launch and it still works flawless
oh well time to pony up for a rd party controllerwe only gave this one star because that is as low as we could go
if we could go any lower we would give it a  stars
do not waste your money or time on this game
it stinksthis game should be called igc quotim going crazyquotthis game isnt hard for any legitimate reasons
anyone can build a budget game that has a buggy save system the main characters aim is so bad it seems like he just stopped drinking the day before the first mission started and enemies that can cut you down with a pistol from orbit
but this is supposed to a high quality game
buy soldier of fortune splinter cell or ghost recon insteadthis has to be  by far the worst gamecube game ever madei bought this game a few years ago for the snes after playing bof
i was looking for more of that wonderful gameplay in the first classsic game
i was terribly disappointed and i endorse the comments of the other reviewer from valencia ca usa
i quote them immediately below
the sequel to one of the best rpg games with the best story line is a total and complete flop
breath of fire  does not follow anything even remotly like a story and is not in any way realated to the first gamethe game should have had some thing to do with defeating tyr after she comes back at the end of breath of fire  the fighting is different and when i tried to select a enemy to fight out of  enemies i ended up shooting myself
what is probably the worst part about fighting is when you meet a new enemy
you cant see how much health they have so it is frustarating not knowing how long until you kill them
the graphics are horrible and are worse than any game i have ever played
the hunting in this game is extremly disipointing and you spend the time waiting for a deer or boar to come out of the grass
if you are looking for a good rpg play breath of fire  or golden sunadditionally the storyline what there is of it is horrid
it is not even a true sequel but seems to be an attempt by the company to simply capitalise on the success of the first without too much effort
in short people
do not buy this gamei see why other people like this game but its not the type of game for me
i think i decided to buy it because i was so amazed that they made a remake of d game
when i was  or  i bought the first resident evil used at a rental store
i thought you would battle zombies in a enclosed area
i was terrified the first time i played
i remember when jills freind shoots off the zombies head
maby the zombies should die this way
this is one of the parts where the game is stupid
in the new game a zombie backs you into a corner
so what does you charachter deside to do
fall down and trip
that was a great idea
lets do it again and again and again
maybe house of the dead is more my type
in re is you try to turn around and run away and when the zombie finally gets near you you have to turn around as slow as a blind cow with a broken leg on sleeping pills whose drunki am a total hardcore actionadventurerpg fan and thats what this falls into
ill play almost any game and mostly like it but this game disappoints
the graphics are really nasty seriously they are really cartoony
the voice acting is soo bad and there are plenty of glitches in what he says
the storyline iswhat is the storyline
youre not an important character at all
the gameplay is the only somewhat good part
its just really bad that you throw your weapon around
you can go into hand to hand too
if you dont have  controllers this game is even more stupid
if you are an rpg gamer or like actionadventure this game is not what you think
if you liked all the gauntlet games this is for you
but i think this game disappointsthis game  it says it is  players simultaneosly but it isnt
it is only  so it  if you have friends and want to play
either that or my multi taps b c and d ports are messed up
also the single player is too linear
you can barely explore or anything
the graphics are ok but the sound effects are very bad
everything sounds so cheap and inhuman
i rented this at blockbuster i hope the game is messed up or something because it stinks
turok  was alot better
i think gaming companies are all about graphics now and not gameplay which is really sad
some where i read that this game was going to be awesome i totally disapprove
all the reviews i read anyways only talk about what they heard and saw do not rent this game
wait for armored core ive played enough first person shooters to know that this one wasnt worth the time or money i spent on it
graphics are soso
level designs arent much better
the game play seems to drag and skip whenever the action heats up
at first i thought the flight sim sequences were a novel idea but the moment things started to get exciting the game paused to load the next section which totally broke the game rhythm
switching weapons also happens to be sluggish making combat sequences far more difficult than they should be
considering the quality of most games acclaim puts out this one was a major disappointment
if youre in the mood for an entertaining fps i would strongly suggest something like deus ex the conspiracy
the medal of honor and red faction series are also strong
i wish i could put a finger on what really irritated me about this game but i cantsome games are a challenge while others are a chore to get through
simply put its not funlike a lot of people i ran out and bought this much hyped game immediately and like a lot of people i was sorely disappointed
this travesty ranges from the mediocre to the just plain bad
most of the levels in this game are average at best and thats not including the horrible flight missions
the graphics are weak and the multiplayer is a freaking joke on the ps anywayoverall id probably give this game one and a half stars but i cant and to tell you the truth it doesnt pain me that much to have to settle for one stari love first person shooters and when i saw some of the screen shots for the new turok game i was excited
i rented this game last weekend and i was thourghly disappointed
first the game takes forever and a day to load up which i have never experienced before on a console
second while the graphics are not bad they are not a great use of the gaming systems capabilities
as for the game play well its horrible
it takes one forever to get used to the controls and then the play is unispiring and boring
the game goes from insanely difficult and times to just plain easy
the ai is also sometimes too hard then just too easy
i did not like the flow of the game or its style
while i did not get to use the multiplayer function im assuming it to not be bad so this maybe a good rental but if you are looking for a good first person shooter dont get thisi should start off by saying that i am a huge fan of the firstpersonshooter fps genre
unfortunately this game sorely fails to live up to any expectations
the game play is sluggish and unappealing
the graphics are sorely lacking especially given the xboxs potential
the rd person flying mode is also uninteresting
like the st person shooting mode the flying mode has sluggish game control and boring graphics
sadly if you want a good fps game all you really have for xbox right now is halothe main reason for this game getting such a low rating is because the control configuration is really messed up
you have to play with one of the two ways they give you which are basicly the same
and also the levels are easy to get lost on
if you dont already have halo buy it instead of this garbagei love this game
the copy i got was terribly corrupt
it could not save after the second mission
i could not return it
do not buy from this dealeri rented turok evolution and boy am i glad i didit saved me money buying such a lousey gamethe first chapter is ok but after that it goes down hillthey give you a scope for the gun that drifts and the enemy is already lobeing gernades and fireing at you befor you get therethen they give you only one way to go but your ememies can still sneak up behind you and surround you on all sidesyou can never sneak up on the enemy they know your comming before you dodo not buy do not even rent this it is a waste of your money and timedo not buy this game
even though it is only  bucks on amazon and probably cheaper elsewhere the shipping wait is not worth it as you will put it down in the first hour or so
when i got it it was lame when all you do is shoot tiny little dinosaurs that could easily be stepped on
all the weopans suck and the only one i wanted was the nuke that you only get onceif you dont use it it doesnt carry on  to the next level i wanted to see the end of the game but i despised it too much to bother playing it so i used cheat codes the end almost sucks as much as the game
multiplayer blows and the controls are retardedsave yourself the frustration of looking at it next to your xboxthis game is just not that fun
i go in on hard and the game is still easy
on top of that you have to fly in specified war zones
if you leave
game over get a real flight game for like the computer because this game is stupid
on top of that this game has some nice graphics but that is only in the clouds
everything else is way too boring
another thing the models on the planes are a little too big because sometimes you can hit your tail on the ground and not even really touch itthis game is sooooo bad the plane is slow and sooo un realistic the game its self is not realistic
the game is soooo dumb and boring and hard sooooooooo hard
now for the good stuff  different missions set over   distinct period of time
and master the navys top plans
and thats pretty much itthis game is terrible
you move way to slow your attacks dont even kill beginning monsters and the graphics look like a playstation one gamedont even rent it it is terrible but then again so were the other kings field gameswhile this game is a critically acclaimed rpg for its gameplay it fails to meet minimum graphics standards
this has to be one of the ugliest games i have ever played despite the fact that  neverwinter nights morrowind arx fataliswas a strong year graphically for many great rpgs
why settle for icewind dale ii when you can get so much more for the same pricethis game is just like fallout tactics brotherhood of steel in that they both have absolutely no story and no real role to play
if you like mass combat with no reasoning or brain hurting dialogue in other words you use the phrase grog smash
more than twice a day you will love this game
if you want storyline and such might i direct you to planescape torment fallout fallout  or even shrudder baldurs gate  instead
youll thank me lateri cant believe black isle made such a motarded gamethis game is garbage
avoid it at all cost
its the biggest piece of  ive ever had to play
and its too bad because to the true moh fan it would have been a nice take along but its more of a leave behindmedal of honor underground is the eleven best second to the worst fps for gba and the ninth released for the system
medal of honor underground looked promising for the gba because the ps one version was so good
when i turned on the game i thought it wasnt so bad
cut me some slack im only reading the mission briefing
after i was done reading the game started
what the heck am i looking at
these graphics are horrible some of the worst ive seen on gba
i liked how the other reviewer worded it it was like sticking a turd in your game boy cartridge slot and flipping the on switch
thats pretty much the only way i can describe how bad the graphics are
after a while you get used to the chunky graphics and sluggish control and realize okay its not that bad
the game features a good story neat cutscenes and varied objectives
this gives it more depth than the gardenvariety shooter ahem 
doom
this is definitly one of the worst fpss for the gba
beware of the graphicsyou think with games like doom and ecks vs server out they can make a decent fps for the gba but nope not in this case
the single major flaw that ruins the game is the graphics
i mean i know its a gameboy and all but they are sooo bad its like they tried making an fps on the nes
walls dispear patterns move making you dizzy
they enemys are just a blurr in the back ground
the objectives and idea are all pretty good but you cant see anything t all
try doomthe original unreal tournament is the very definition of fun
it was interesting and i could play the demo for hours without becoming bored
the game remained interesting with cool characters maps and weapons
then they released new maps modsrelics in particular and assault mode
that game was a successunreal tournament  changes the original into a lame game
there are all new guns and worst of all there are uninspired new maps
the new fort is a sand like level that doesnt have the same feeling
the other maps just dont have anything to be talked about
the all new guns i mentioned
crap
they all blow except the redeemer
the new sniper riflelighting gun
is retarded
the new pistol is pretty stupid
theres also a gun now which instead of doing damage it pushes the opponent
this is rather useless in pretty much any situation
if you are on the top of a tower it is good but that is rareget the original unreal tournament or unreal tournament  they both rock and this game can just be skippedi know there are a lot of nolf fans out there but i didnt play nolf  so i had no extreme expectations of this game
my computer is waaay beyond the recommended configuration yet load times are about  seconds which is unacceptablei admit graphics and sound are excellent but thats about it the story is barely ok with stupid story elements which are sometimes referred as quotfunnyquot  i think they sucked at best some of them are downright offending im not russian but i know quite a few i felt offended because of the idiotic jokesmissions are sooo boring its unbelievable most missions are like quotkill everyone get key open doorquot
some levels are very tough and the randomly respawning enemies really pissed me offone very frustrating thing was that this game is the only one to date and to my knowledge that crashes windows xp so that you have to reboot it
just this alone should mean the end of sierraif youre a hardcore nolf fan you might like this thing but i give  star out of  only for the nice graphics
ill probably never buy a sierra product again and certainly hope that they go out of businessthere is way too much stuff to be picked up and sent all over the place for testing and researching and whatnot
unfortunately some witnesses are only unlocked after you submit the right item so unless youre quite fast picking up stuff etc
you cant solve the case within the allotted time framethis game would be very interesting and entertaining if they didnt cut off the investigation after a week thats game time not real timethe game itself is great graphics sounds and concept is just like the tv show
the major issue i have with it is the fact that it constanly locks up
im running a piii  mb ram  mb video card  mb sound card and dont have such problems with other games which require a higher minimum system requirement
due to these technical issues ive encountered with the game i have not been able to complete it
it becomes extremely fustrating especially if youve got something and getting hotter and closer to cracking the case
if it wasnt for all this lock up the game would be great
the game is worth  star even if there was an option for no stars it still is worth  the  star i gave itive never revised a review before but i felt i had to this time
first off do not think that the requirement listed on the package are all thats required for an enjoyable gaming experience here
if you do not have one of the newer video cards dont even bother
based on the requirements listed on the box i should have been able to play this game without a problem
but after dealing with a spinning screen a game that paused for long stretches of time and even a screen that went white i called tech support only to find out after buying the game that i needed a newer video card if i really wanted to play
even after downloading and installing a few drivers provided by legacy interactive i couldnt get it to run as it was supposed tothen there is the trial section
at least during the investigative half you can pause the game or walk away from it for a while and you have plenty of opportunities to save your game
save before you go to trial and if you think youre going to be distracted dont go to trial
save your game go live your life and come back to it later
because once youre in trial phase you cant save or quit the game until that phase of the trial is over
and again if you dont have a newer video card youll be frustrated when you do get to trial because the d animation be jerky and will skip to such a degree that you will inevitably miss some of the testimony of the defense witnesses and some of the defense attorneys questions
and you cant object to what you dont hear
not effectively anyway
i played through to the end of the trial phase and all the way to the verdict just once because i wanted finish at least one game
and i then uninstalled the game and got rid of it
if i want the law and order experience ill catch the show itself on televisionyou play as a cop in this game
you can rob a car just like in grand theft auto
the worst problem of this game is the graphicit does not have many detailsthe car youre driving look almost the same as others on the street
they are all black or dark brownid rather play maxpayne  or burnout hardest game i ever beat hands down
i still have nightmares about how much i hate this game
the second i beat it i took the game out slammed it into its cover of which i had thrown across the room several times along with the pile of controllers and traded it in
dont know why i stuck with it till the end
just didnt want the game to beat me i guess
to this day have not been half as angry as when i played this god forsaken game
hate hate hate haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate this gamethis has to be the worst max payne ripoff in history
poor graphics linear story  a cheeseball character
plus the auto aim is annoying
there isnt anything awesome youre missing if you skip this gamethis game has a great concept but the game play and controls really stink
its a rd person perspective shooter game with very poor camera views
most of the time you wont even know where the enemy is firing at you from
to make things worse the right thumbstick which is used to control the camera view is backwards pressing right makes the camera go left and vise versa
the graphics are definitely ps graphics this game shouldnt have been released for the xbox
overall if youre looking for a great shootingadventure game id recommend splinter cellextra extracorey hart breaks out and becomes a cop with his sunglasses at nightso the folks at namco played max payne and thoughtwe can do better so here it is
i rented this at block busterand played it for about  minutes
the controls are toocomplicated for a shooter
i found myself once againputting in halo to cleanse myself of that garbage
itmakes sense that nobody has rated this game becauseit is so bad it doesnt merit a review
why am i doing this you ask only to say i now have a stack of games but onlyhalo is worth the replaynot much more to say except that this game wasnt worth the ten dollars i spent on it when i purchased it used
though there is somewhat of a story line the game is boring
its one of those that you wished you had borrowed first before you purchased iti think the only thing that this game would be useful for is to use the disc as a coaster on an end tablebottom line  fwell ive been searching for chess games recently and im surprised that this version which is being released in september  is not compatible with windows xpyes look at the requirements windows     meor go to ubi softs website and indeed they are not supporting windows xp for most of their games including this one
they say something about windows xp having a new file type that is not compatible with their softwaregrrrr i mean come on
i have a new tower pc and a new laptop both with windows xp and i would love to have a nice chess game available for it
ubi soft get it right
support windows xpwell ive love to play this game if i could
they only get a  star review from me until they support a windows xp versionstephanielook out folks despite there being no warning on quotsome ofquot the boxes according to ubisoft tech support ubisoft has brilliantly decided to prevent installation from a cdrw drive
i have a dell inspiron  that came standard with a samsung cdrwdvd drive and i am unable to install
called tech support and before i even got going he knew exactly what i was talking about and claimed there is no workaround for it
i will simply have to return the game even though i cant now that its open to the retailer and will not be able to play it until i buy a cd or dvd drive with no writerewrite capacity just for this gamei dont know what genius at ubisoft came up with this as a notion to prevent piracy but ive got news for them youre only hurting potential customers
blocking cdrw use on the disc itself isnt going to slow down some game cracker
its only going screw me upso since theres no warning about this quotfeaturequot on amazon and as theres no warning about it on the box itself that i just today received from amazon i thought id come on here and let people know lest they waste the purchase price as i didthese days almost all laptops come standard with cdrwdvd drives why ubisoft chose to cut off an entire slice of the market is beyond me
apparently this quotfeaturequot is now on all of their pc games
so look outim sure were i able to play it it would deserve more than a single star
but because i cant and because i feel ubisoft effectively duped me into buying by forgetting the warning i cant give it higher than that
im not slamming the game itself but rather their policyloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewloading reviewfinallyas you can see there are two words to describe this gameplease waitthis games title in region  australiauk is crashed
im also reviewing the ps version not the xbox version but amazon has no listing for the ps version
dont worry both games are exactly the same from what i can tell badif you wanna play a great demolition derby smash up game then look much further beyond this atrocious game
its not so much the graphics or amount of different arenas you can play in it comes down to the sloppy controls
it feels too tight to turn your car and if you try a handbrake turn you car does a stop skid turn not a smooth follow through anytime you hit the hand brake you may as well have hit brake as all it does is spin you in the opposite direction and bring you to a halt
you get useless nitrous that you dont even know if they are working or not half the time just a spark from the muffler and the collision damage is a joke its more like playing dodgem cars then getting the sense you are demolishing vehiclesif you wanna decent demo derby game then go for destruction derby arenas or driving emotion types but for the love of hell stay clear of this onegraphics sound   controls replay v extras   overall  an ancient evil stirs an impatient adventurer sets out from an insular village that has no other warriors at least none that ever appear or help you but is mysteriously wellequipped for training them
the story is the best part about this game after the graphics but theres nothing here you havent seen better before
most of it is forgettable but acceptable to get you from point a to point b provided the gameplay or graphics dont put you offstory the game went with a relatively painted sort of cellshaded style watching the scenes written into being as the games equivalent of cinematics is mildly interesting but loses interest
some people will automatically dislike the apparently cutesy graphics others will be offput by the limbhewing and spurting blood
i didnt think they worked well together but look up gameplay videos on youtube to decide for yourself this is one case where what you see is what youll get and you may either like or dislike itgraphics there are some cries of anger pain and ambient noises that all seemed fitting
there werent spectacular effects or voicing more than a few of the lines are corny but i thought that it fit the general tone and themesound the background music is rather bland not especially annoying but a pale shadow of what video game music can bemusic gameplay is where this game really falls apart
moving and trying to get the camera to cooperate was clunky and uncooperative
the combat felt rather awkward and unpolished i had the distinct impression that it was rushed because there was a variety of combo attacks but none of them were really more effective than mashing the attack buttons and if youre fighting multiple opponents most moves wont be available anyway
lack of effective smart targeting or good lockon didnt help and if youd been mashing away at one enemy and they fell rau was liable to continue hacking in that direction while three more soldiers bear down on him from other directions
i believe one word describes every stage of this game including combat and platforming clunkygameplay there are little rewards and minor easter eggs you can unlock by accomplishing submissions within areas such as utilizing certain combos but none of them really helped gameplay and nothing felt worth the time and hassle of going backreplayability for all of the our game is unique hoopla i wish they wouldve spent some more time refining the play and areas
it looks like a cartoon spurts blood like a survival horror and will probably annoy you like a screaming baby
it definitely doesnt flow or captivate
definitely rent before you buy and if you cant try it first i would recommend seeking other games first theres nothing here that isnt done better elsewhereoverall i cannot understand how any other reviewers on amazon could give this game any better than  star
you see i used to be of the mind that every video game no matter how bad had at least one redeeming quality
sure tenchu was slow and poorly animated but it had neat backgrounds and was it occasionally unintentionally hilarious
and on i ninja the beat the clock missions sucked but the kill everyone missions more than made up for it
then i played this game
there was nothing redeeming about it
nothingin fact the only good thing about the game an unlockable mode in which you fight solely against the games bosses mysterious disappeared shortly after i found it
the only other good thing about this game was the off button
this was of course voted one of the top  worst games of all time onsome show
but what was bad about the game
well your enemies suck
they range from brainless idiots to masters of the martial arts
and sometimes they change from one to the other on a whim
they all look the same
all the ninjas have the same outfit it just changes color blue for boys red for girls
and there is the witty banter they assault you with which ranges from lets teach him a lesson to i think im in love
bruce himself is pretty messed up
when hes fighting he sounds like a chicken
when hes not he sounds nothing like bruce lee
he also has the extremely useless and life threatening ability to lock on to a specific enemy from a horde of many
this allows him to block that specific enemy while all the rest of them sneak up behind him and kick his butt
hard
by the way the block button was x x is not a block button
x is an attack button
they couldnt even get that righti guess in an effort to show how much bruce lee looks like himself the design team inflated his head a bit to make it stand out
that was kind of silly but then again so was the fact that bruce changes his outfit every chance he gets
and not just from level to level
i mean when he starts chasing a ninja chick through pouring rain he is wearing a chinese style coat
but when he catches her hes shirtless
then the coats back on
where did he stick it down his pantsive got to admit i never liked bruce lee
i thought enter the dragon was boring
so i hoped that this video game would allow me to look at bruce with a whole new light
it did
i am now even less in bruce lees cornerthis game is a failure on every level
from the very begginning cinematic sequences you can tell how little of the xboxs capacity is being used
the cinematics are worse than some i have seen on the original playstationand the gameplay
ouch
this game needed a few more months in development to work the bugs out
supposedly you can go through and earn new kung fu moves but who cares as you will have to perform them through bad graphics and severe drops in framerate any time there are more than  characters on the screen
think back to the old  bit nintendo games and you will get the idea
i rented this game fortunately because i am a huge fan of bruce lee and i really wanted to like it but alas it stinks
those who have compared this game to final fight should write a letter of apology to the good folks at capcom
final fight is a much better game despite being  yrs older and having a fraction of the system resources available that qod has
at least final fight had a multiplayer mode and smooth graphicsdo not waste your money on this gamethis game has bad everything
bad setup aka you can beat bosses with your eyes closed
bad graphics
bad consistancy with gameplay and graphics
all of that together  a game that is not worth buying
i am very disapointing thinking this would actually be good and it amuses me to think i once thought it would be goodbruce lee quest of the dragon is a horrific game that is even worse than many old d street fighting games like the bare knuckle series
there is probably only handful of combos you can pull off and they all stink
also the voice acting and overall audio in the game is terrible for example one of the minibosses that one will encounter in the game will say you are dead in such a monotone manner that you probably will die in your seat from disgust
taunting like that happens throughout the whole game which is possible to beat in as little as  short hours
additionally the games visuals are horrible too even though there are some xboxspecific graphical features the game runs extremely choppy
the biggest problem is the loading time which adds up to the choppiness and makes it even worse
first when the level is picked it will take like a minute or even more to load
then there will be loads after every time the player advances to a new scene in the same level
and finally there will be yet another load when the player quits to the main menuthank god that i did not buy this game
i hope nobody else does so either
all i can say if you dont believe me on how bad it is rent it and i am sure you will understand and bring it back on the very next daythere are so many things about this game that make it stupid
luckily i only rented it and returned it the same night lol
i feel sorry for anyone who had to buy it
this has got to be the most disapointing game ever for the mighty xbox
heres why the gameplay its just uninteresting
you walk around as bruce lee from a side view a side view
you kill people with  lame moves punch and kick and collect the coins that come after they die
its so lame and dull its laughable
its way to easy and beating up the people is so dull
 lame moves and all the bad guys look the same
you advance and keep collecting coins
an ametuer gamer could beat this in  night
the graphics  horrible
oh my goodness bruce lee looks like a girl in tights which is such an insult to his memory and all the villains look exactly the same red ninjas
oh and the coins that you get our the size of bruces head
the  lame moves dont even look real either
i played this game ad beat  levels in  minutes
i basily fell asleep in my chair
when i woke up i returned it immediatly
the reputation it tried to take
i mean come on bruce lee
what kind of people created this game to insult his memory this game is horrible
on the cover it even went as far as to say it was better than doa
i own doa and it is a hundred million times better than this junki hope ive proved to you why u shouldnt buy this game
it is so easy to beat and so boring at that
id rather watch grass grow
there are so many better games to buy for its price if it was about  bucks i might counsider buying it
but for everything else i can get for that price i guess ill have to passlolgrafix on the xbox mediocrestory bland and pointlesscontrolls slow and difficultaction and play abysmal terrible boringchallenge level not possible without cheatingresults shame on whoever disgraced bruce leewith this stinker of the yearpeople are nuts this game sucked
worst game i have ever played
the graphics were terrible the charcters interaction is beyond stupid
and the charcters them self are just pure junk
this was by far the crappiest game i have ever played
and i play a lot of games
sorry people but this is just space junk
no gems here just bargain barn trash
pass it by
and run like hellhow can this game be any fun at all if the disc keeps locking up on you halfway through the storysorry but my ps is working perfectlyok first of all i never finished the game but that is because it is so frustrating and boring to the point where you cant possibly finish it without having dreadful thoughts of putting a gun in your mouth
actually the thoughts i had of putting a gun in my mouth were much more entertaining than this piece of shiz
i mean seriously at least if i put a gun in my mouth i get to have complete control of the gun and where the bullet ends up
the latter statement brings me to my main point and that point being if i cant control the aiming process of my gun then what am i actually doing
why do the gaming companies feel like they have to cater to people by implementing a lock on aiming system rather than a manual one
it completely takes the fun out of the entire experience
whats truly amazing about this game is the fact that even with automatic aim implemented its still a freaking hard game
so lets backtrack the game is boring frustrating and flat out stupidi loved onimusha
i hated onimusha  an utter waste of time and money and i bought it for only  when i got to the final boss battle i couldnt help but think this is it
then i tried beating nobunaga a half dozen times or so but couldnt since i used all my healing items and magic replenishers going into the purple phantom realm
if i had known that the final boss was right after i would have skipped it and whipped him good
so i finished the purple phantom realm and was hurt irreparably and only got some dinky sword
what a tur
since i completed the whole game on normal i wasnt about to drop to easy mode just to beat the last boss
so i tossed the cdrom in the garbage something i had thought about doing quite a few times before as the game never started and never really got going
a game without a soul
but there were a couple of pretty places with some nice graphics that is the only positiveavoidi have played many ps  games and this is bad
i cant use the analog stick to move
i have to use the pad
when i use the game pad i still cant move in the direction i want to go
up is not up more like moving back wards
there is no option to change to the controller stick
yea the graphics are great but that is all i will say for this game
i will return back to game stop
i would rate this video game a big  if i could
and i love fighting gamesfirst of alli didnt even want to rent this game cause i thought it looked stupid and insulted everything that was great about final fantasyi should have listened to my first instinctsbut instead i gave into to so many whining squaresoftquotfansquot who said that this really is a great gameyou just have to get past the fact that theres disneyha
id like to know how that is possible when everywhere you turndisney is screamed in your facethe shield has a mickey mouse emblem on itthe sword has a mickey mouse emblem on iteverything has a mickey mouse emblem on itwhat really bothered me the most about this game was all the subliminal messages in itfor example one of the final fantasy characters in the final fantasy world saysquotour world is just one tiny peice that is part of something much greaterquotohi seeso final fantasy is just something insignificant and whats sooo much greater is disneythis also leads me to ask that if each individual disney storymovie had its own worldthen why couldnt they have done the same for each individual installment of final fantasyevery final fantasy fan knows that the diffrent stories in the series where always on an epic levelso why does disney treat the final fantasy anthology so unimportantlyby just mixing all the final fantasy characters from diffrent games into one world to call its own was a slap in squaresofts faceand just look how they depicted poor cid from ffthey gave him blonde hairhes older and has grey hairplus they got rid of his cigarette and put a twig in his mouthgrrrrof course i suppose disney was the right partner to choose for this project since squaresoft seems only to want to make interactive movies instead of gamesby thisi mean the same problem with kingdom hearts was what i saw in final fantasy x play a little bit then watch a cinemawhich you cant skip over eitherplay a little bit more then watch another cinemathis replays itself over and over and gets extremely annoyinggraphicsseem to be more important than gameplaylastly kingdom hearts is not a true rpg to which it passes itselfover as on the boxit isnt a true rpg in the sense that there isno turn based battle systemits an action rpg with free moving enemies and heroesthis tied in with the locking system makes it much more like zeldaocarina of time than any of the final fantasy serieswhy squaresoft chose to do this is a mystery to mesince the game is supposed to tie in with final fantasymy only guess is that it was probabaly disneys ideasince they see fit to march right in and change every aspect about anything with this worldthe saying for kingdom hearts is quotyoull never know who youll run into nextquoti think the saying for disney should bequotyou never know what well take over nextquotid rather eat a bucket full of broken glass than play this disney comerciali tried so hard to get into this game
i love rpgs and especially the final fantasy series along with dungeon crawlers such as dark cloud and zelda
this game bored me so incredibly with its easy button pressing and redundant music whenever i was walking or fighting the cutscene music is excellent
the gameplay is seriously lacking in the ff strategy and zelda variety being a simplified version of a dungeon crawler
this is not for rpg veterans
it will offer them no challenge and just put them to sleep
i recommend this to the younger gamers who have not played any or many rpgs
if you are not a part of this crowd steer clearnow before you say anything i have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbustergrudgingly playing it thoughand now for the unbaiased opinion
i think that this game is so completely stupid
it and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinionif youre by any means a seroius gamer this is definitely a big waste of your time
im not quite sure whether its rated m or t but its a silly game based on characters from other games and the whole thing doesnt make much sensethis game has a great idea behind it
putting characters from two beloved franchises final fantasy and disney into a brandnew storyline with a few new original characters is a stroke of genius and it works well
the environments are colorful and perfectly capture the fantasy vibe the original psone models of old ff characters are brought to the nextgen world with great graphics and superb voiceacting
the story itself is also interesting
so i happily leapt into this game really excited about the whole thingthen something terrible happened gameplay
sora the main character moves so clunkily and imprecisely that both combat and exploration are a chore
if battles were turnbased in classic square fashion this would be easier to deal with but theyre not
theyre done in realtime meaning that you are never given a rest from the painful controls
no matter how fast i tapped the buttons or moved the control stick soras attacks were always several steps behind my commands
and when i was platforming in the exploration segments his pitiful jumps and tendency to keep moving once i released the analog stick was continually frustratingall this wouldnt be so bad if the game was forgiving enough to accomodate the interface but that isnt the case
indeed the difficulty is actually harder than many games ive played with better control schemes
enemies are whipquick and surround you in a flash platforms are tiny and widely spaced and replenishing items are always in short supplyanother complaint i have is that the puzzles dont make sense
unlike better rpgs paper mario  for example where you can analyze the area and figure out what youre supposed to do kingdom hearts gives you no clues
i would have been stumped within minutes if i didnt have the strategy guide to back me up
like everything else in the game the puzzles must be done perfectly with no mistakes or you have to start over
seeing as you dont know if something is a mistake or not until you do it this gets very tedious and frustratingoverall playing this game felt like trying to dismantle a ticking time bomb with no tools where touching one wire could mean death stressful confusing and definitely not fun
and after a while it doesnt even matter that the bomb is decorated with beloved characters and bright colorsi loved final fantasy  final fantasy  was pretty good
then final fantasy  was the worst game ive ever played
 was pretty bad too
but now square is doing something different
kingdom hearts is a way to make money off previous characters
i doubt anyone would buy this game if final fantasy characters were not in itlets be honest its horrible
for once just admit square made a bad game
the controls are the worst
whenever you want to manipulate the camera it goes spinning in the other direction
it took me like  hours just to beat this alice in wonderland level
and yes it is a hack and slash game
all i do is hit x and the game locks into things and attacks
pretty easy
there is no fun factor reallycool old square characters
i can see why they had to add those in
without cloud or squall the game would have been thrown out by most
now dont just say my review is horrible because you like the game
most of the reveiwers have not even played it
the plot is probably one of the worst plots ever
you lock doors that seemingly hold the entire worlds existence and you need to close them before they are opened by the bad people
so the bad people are looking for the  princesses to open the ultimate door
wow that took real genius not
i bet square thought of this whole game in one day
also this is just like all the other final fantasys
your best friend of member of your party turns on you
kairi or whatever turns to hate you because he wants your girl
some witch tells him to hate you because you hang out with donald and goofy and kairi is just like yea he should be hanging out with me
but i never want to be his friend again because he was so loyal to me
its kinda stupid that we were best friends one minute now he wants to slaughter me
well i can tell you that hes just a sad seifer rip off from ffnow before you go dissing my review look at the facts i have given you
the only reason this games been gettin mad reviews is because square made it old final fantasy characters come back
just before you go and play it let me warn you
it is not a final fantasy
it is a platform game
you will spend hours falling because the camera and controls
now that i have given you this knowledge do not give square any more moneyits not really action rpgthis is more of a platform game which is why i hate it
you have to do alot of stupid jumps that are not easy to do because the platforms are ridiculously far apart
dont buy this game
frustrating not fun at all
worst game everoh boy squaresoft is on a role
they have been dishin out some shtty as games lately but this has to be the biggest piece of sht squaresoft has dispensed out of their behind
so lets take a look at the title firsta little fruity i know
ok ok lets take it from the basics
i bought the game a year after it came outdue to the huge hype about
you know all these little nerds sayin man kingdom hearts is awesome
or man i couldnt take a crap without kingdom hearts
personally i dispiesed the game but you know what peer pressure does to you
living here in japan squaresoft was hailed as the greatest rpg maker ever which i can understand ie
mystic quest personal fav nevertheless with a name like kingdom heartsmakes you question the game
know in this day in age when to people use the word kingdom
ive never even heard the word empire used unless people were punning at the united states government
anyways kingdom makes you think of faries and nonsensehence disney and their perverted godness
hearts makes you think of a smelly old love storyor a great classic card game
so if the name doesnt drive you away lets see what doesupon further dissection the game is simply compiled of a gay character who looks like a cheaply made version of all the final fantasy characters
now for a lot of you readers maybe i should have told you this before but if you dont like final fantasy you mighti mean you wont like this game at all
the truth of the matter is that this game is a fantasy of its own
a bunch of fantasy looking characters hanging out with the queers of disney
how fun
so the theme of the game is to search for your gay loveractually i never took the time to understand the point of the game though i believe it had to do with searching
nevertheless the gay characters will pretty much make you want to go and buy soul reaver its that bad
squaresoft has outdone itself this time
teaming up with disney must have been a sign of squaresoft reaching rock bottom
their time on deathrow was almost up but with disney on their back nothing is to fear
so they made up some lame queerish characters and made a bad story and whipped it all togetherhence kindom hearts how sad
when i remembered great classical games they took time and dedicationthis game took a whole bunch of asholes and just glued them together
the game is retarded as hell and i know for a fact that a  year old could throw up a better game then thisfor your own saftey i would stay away from this game
its cheap graphics gameplay music charactersthere are just so many aspects of this game that suck its so hard for me to tell you
but seriously if your that bored to buy this game sure do it
but youll have x more fun buy breaking it with a hammerokay im a minority in this but i hated this gamebut before i rant and rave the good parts
the controls were good the graphics were nice and tidy and the music was so goodbut the bad oh the bad
quickly i found myself confused as to where to go
i could not work the gummy ship or travel to other levels easily
i was so confused and the story itself is not appealing to me
i like disney films or some of them anyway but mixing disney and final fantasy was dumbuh
it was like shoving two puzzle sets together and trying to make a picture with the mess and you cant do that
square peg doesnt go into triangle hole
and i hear that the sequels are doubly confusingit was unpleasant for me
for others it may be a nostalgic joy ride with two great casts final fantasy and disney characters going sidebyside
i wanted to see the winnie the poo level and the nightmare before christmas level bud saddly i could not get it to work right no matter who i talked to what i did how far i leveled up or anythingthis game is horrrrrrrrrrrrrrible
i have tried the demo and it is way to slow basically just a complete copy of mech warrior
they shouldnt bother with this game they should just stick to mech warriortrust methe game cheats
when you keep burning the computer he just starts making your recievers drop balls
that is about the lamest thing i have ever seen
the developers just failed to make a good enough ai to stop your offense to the game just cheats this is stupid unrealistic and completely unnerving
and what is up with his rd down percentage
give me a break i cannot tell how hard it is to stop the computer on rd down it is almost impossible
i have played a lot of football games in my life and i found none to be so unrealistic and infuriating as this one
i really liked the k version but this game is a piece of junkwhen eq came out i screamed horray
but as i played it i felt let down betrayed scammed etc
i switch over to wow and i am having a good time but graphics are toonish thoughdo not waste your moneyim sure eq will have plenty of pretty graphics but the fact remains that soe will still be the business behind the game which means crappy support lots of bugs and many upgrades that you must pay for to support their companyi played eq for  years and will count myself out of this onethe general consensus amongst the mmorpg community would seem to be this everquest ii is yet another example of sonys fanatical obsession with eye candy over contenttheres little to no meat here in fact sonys own online websites cant seem to provide any sort of storyline behind everquest ii other than it being set  years or so from the time of the original everquest the moon of luclin blew up and now the entire huge sprawling world of norrath has been reduced to two measly starting cities on one continentsounds pretty cheesy to me
wanna see another red flag
the sheer size of the installation of this game positively screams that its loaded with resourcesucking bells and whistles which sony is wellknown for focusing on when their overall storyline and content are weakmost veteran everquest players have watched sony online entertainment completely ruin the original everquest ever since late  when sony bought out verant the originators of that onceclassic mmorpg game
given what weve all seen from soe over the past few years the destruction of everquest the absurdly pointless star wars galaxies horrible customer service and insultingly shameless greed i see absoultely no reason whatsoever to believe that everquest ii will be anything short of an overpriced inane memory hog of a game that will ultimately leave the player feeling unsatisfied and cheatedlike so many other people i fell in love with everquest when it came out
it was the first game to approach a complete virtual world in d with tens of thousands of other people interacting with each other in a fantasy setting
however i know that the great things about eq the real spark came from the initial developers all of whom have since left to join various other companies because of sony
in my  years playing eq i have only seen sony make bad decision after bad decision release   or is it now  
money grubbing expansions and consistantly ignore their absurdly loyal customer base
mmgs even more than other games require companies that pay attention and value their customer base and also play and love these games themselves
i can tell you without a doubt in my mind that eqii is going to be a disaster for sony and i hope it drives them into the ground
buy world of warcraft insteadummm no thanks
i dont care how pretty it is i as well as just about every eq player i know and i know many of them all agree the timesinks stop at eq
there will be no starting over for any reason
weve all invested too much time on eq to just drop it and move forward especially with sonys infamously horrific customer servicei am a paying beta tester for everquest in my opinion that game still hasnt left beta and since i pay to play it well that makes me a paid beta tester doesnt it hehe
i will not pay sony for the privaledge of testing their new gameif sony was smart they would make everquest ii a complete rewrite of eq with this fabled new engine of theirs and allow people to import the characters into it that they have worked so incredibly hard oneq is going to be a total loser mark my wordsregardless of its prettiness or features
it will be another anarchy online uo ummm what uo
heh dark ages of camelot etc
it simply will never reach critical mass because eq players will not switch in droves like they are hopingsony is crazy to make eq incompatible with eq
not smart at allit truly seems that the soul of verant has left the building in a big way since their acquisitionthis game is bad
it is the worst game i have ever played
the point of the game is to shoot the choppy aliens with your green glowing balls before they shoot you with their red glowing balls of death
its a game that people should be executed over making
or selling
   so please for your sake dont buy this game it is bad
rent it first so you can agree with meit was so fun i fell asleep
the grafiks was way better then my super nintendo
the peeple move better then the rok in my bak yard
the accent sounds like my brother wen he quotstonedquot
i recomend this to anyone who likes really bad games
kuz it was really really badok
when someone gives a game only  star  they can sometimes have an agenda
my only agenda is to inform gamers how dissapointed i was at this game and let the gamer makeup his or her own mind
i was very excited when i brought pow home and placed the disc in my xbox
the intro scene was well done and signalled that codemasters were capable programmers
then i played the game
the graphics are seriously below par for an xbox title
the poor quality of graphics made it impossible for me to forget that i was staring at my  sony instead of having the impression i was back in  in a german pow camp
if i thought the graphics bad  imagine how i felt when i played the game
the gameplay is absolutely awful
movement  think halo for the left thumbstick which is cool
however for whatever reason the right thumbstick only allows you to look left or right  not up or down
howeverthe values are reversed  to look left requires that you push right  and vice versa
i know what your thinking because i thought the same thing  there has to be a menu that allows you to change the polarity of the right thumbstick  nope
with halo i was effeciently killing bad guys in no time
with pow i was taking my frustration out on the innocent xbox controller within  minutes
oh and it only gets worse
to climb over  wallfence requires you to stand facing the fence
then press the left thumbstick forward and press the a button to jump and grasp the ledge if a wall or grab hold of the fence
next press the left thumstick forward once more to climb to the top of the wall or as many times as needed to climb over the fence
next the camera angle automatically swivles  degrees  to the other side of the wallfence
now you must press the left thumstick down once to grasp the ledge and again to drop to the other side
you cannot imagine how clumbsy this feels
in the early levels  when guards are not overly aggressivesmart  you can ignore this clumbsy requirement  but later youll be quite frustrated
if you press and hold the left trigger you are in first person view only mode  meaning you can look sidetoside and upanddown using the right thumbstick  think halos right thumbstick but without the ability to move when the left trigger is depressed
now youve finally scaled a wall and you stealthily enter a building looking for currency and useful items
well when inside buildings your pointofview becomes fixed from inexplicably some of the worst vantage places  without any roomlevel zooming capability  and your right thumbstick becomes useless  until you enter the previously mentioned first person view only mode by pressing the left trigger
useful itemsloot twinkle and all you have to do is walk next to the item for it to be placed in your inventory
however your instincts will be urging you to perform a thorough search of the room  open a few drawers  well they must not have had drawers in wwii because all you can do is walk around a static room
so you do just that  but due diligence requires that you walk a few inches enter the first person view only mode look around for goodies and then walk another few inches enter the first person view only modeetc
you quickly discover that the only loot in the room is what twinkled upon entering  this must mean that germans dont hide things  interesting
the inventory management subsystem was poorly conceived
anything you cannot fit in your pockets is carried for all to see in your hands
there are hiding places you can find scattered thoughout the camps and you have a personal footlocker in your barracks
it took me forever just to figure out how to examineuse inventory items
game saving  you must be in your barracks and next to your bed in order to save your game
the game designers felt that one of the driving forces behind a prisoner of war game had to be the daily routine that a prisoner was forced to adhere by
so they devised a lame gimmick  a timepiece  that helps you plan mischeif around static morning and evening roll calls
so you are allowed to go exploring as long as you do not get caught in a guards visioncone while in an illegal area as long as you get back to morningevening roll call
from the moment i began playing this game i was extremely dissapointed
after playing for a day  i knew i was going to get rid of the game quickly before word got out
the graphics are boring
the character controls are the worst in xbox history  why do i have to press right to look left  that infuriates me
the idea of being a prisoner of war trying to escape is golden and i hope someone pulls it off but this implementation is shameful
codemasters quality assurance team should be firedi like stealth games and i figured this one was going to be good i was wrong
despite the graphics being kind of bad i can sometimes look past that as long as the game play and controls are good
i saw this and read the back of the case and it seemed like it would be good so i got it from my local eb games for  glad i didnt pay  when it officially came out
needless to say i played this for about  minutes got bored and frustrated with it and took it out
i was worried after seeing the opening sequence how typical cheesy and the bad graphics but when the actual gameplay came to be was even worse
this is one of the worse games ive played in awhile definately avoid this one at all cost i wouldnt even take it for freethis is rediculessy hard
i can only see a video wisard beating this gamei bought it for  dollars at gamestop what a rip offi picked this up in a bargain bin at a local video games store
my mistake
there are good and even great star wars games kotor star wars galaxies precu and there are terrible star wars games star wars galaxies postcu
this is totally horrible and isnt worth picking up for  bucksim sorry to say this but this game is pathetic and the level of fame that developer bioware has gained over it really saddens me
now ill admit that im not the biggest star wars fan read i saw one movie when i was eight but i am a huge rpg fan and this game plummets far below my expectations
i will describe my experience with the game and hopefully you will choose to pass it by and skip the agony i went throughat the start of the game i was asked to choose my characters appearance skill point allocation and basic moveset
sounds fun and cool right
thats what i thought too
until i realized that every character model was blocky and pseudorealistic you know that weird pale supposedtolookhumanbutreallydoesnt look the skillpoint system was convoluted and confusing to anyone who isnt a hardcore dungeons and dragons player and choosing my moves was so difficult and frustrating that in the end i didnt even know which ones i had
creating the character took an hour and i didnt feel at all satisfied after i finishedonce i started the actual game things only got worse
i headed to my first battle expecting a standard turnbased system at the least and an innovative actionrpg blend at the most
i got neither
instead i was greeted a bizarre mess
in fact this combat system was so strange and awkward that i dont think i could even describe it
all i know is that first off my character was somehow moving on its own and second the commands i entered didnt seem to effect what happened onscreen at allafter making my way through several battles by way of random button mashing and liberal use of medpacks that was the easiest way to do it and seemed to have the same result as trying to concentrate and strategize i met my first party member
what happened after that just plain scared me
first the voiceovers made me want to both laugh and scream
secondly while the horrendous voice is grating your ears you have to look at a disturbing closeup of the characters face as hes talking
and finally the face doesnt change
his expression stayed exactly the same throughout the entire conversation and this happened with every single other character i talked to
freakythe final part of the game that i played through was the first city
it was big with lots of people walking around going about their lives
this would be cool if i had known where to go in this massive maze
but did i
nope
although my horriblyvoiced partner apparently knew the city well i recieved no guidance from him
instead he followed me around giving me no hints but the instruction to find bastilla
by the way i knew nothing about what bastilla looked like or where she might beafter twenty minutes of running around in the maze talking to random badlyvoiced people most of whom had mean things to say i gave up
maybe people who like star wars and dd will appreciate this but i just cant
bioware quit pretending youre the next great rpg maker and go back to putting your characters in mtv music videosthe only reason i bought this game is because it had this so called game of the year thingy
you cant even attack whats up with that
im a big boy i can fight for myself i dont need the xbox doing it for me
after an hour all i got done was making my stupid charater then i found out that you cant attack
practicly the whole game is talking talking talking its like the social gathering game gone wrong
do yourslef a favor and dont buy it
its a total waste
da u lucas artsi picked this game up a few months back
i got it because i just got through with mass effect and loved that game
well the folks who did mass effect for the most part also had a hand in making this star wars game knights of the old republicill make this short because i think some people need to know just how flipping boring this game is
the dialogue is okay
you have to read it and there is no actual speach
i can live with that especially since this game did come out a few years backhowever the action sequences are left the game found wanting
you press a button and watch your characters do all the work
wow
thats it
is what i thought to myself
im not much of an rpg guy but when i hear the words action and fun to play associated with it i tend to think their might be some challenging action scenes to go along with a game with story line
you know something like deus ex or mass effect
heck even the final fantasy guys get it right year after year
i say all of that so i dont get people flaming me saying i just dont like rpgs
i do like rpgs just the good onesi felt like i was being spoon fed everything to continue on with the game
it wasnt challenging at all
i had to quit after playing this game for about an hour
i kept telling myself it will get better and it never didsorry folks but star wars games like the xwingtie fighter series dark forcesjedi knight series and even the rebel assault games were better than this crapyou want a good rpg from bioware
play mass effect
you want a good rpg period
play lost odyssey or diablo or titans quest or the elder scrolls series or the fallout series or final fantasy
just not this gamedid i miss something
im at a complete loss as to how this game has been receiving such rave reviews
i agree with the other reviewer the quotgamequot consists of walking ten feet meeting an npc then interviewing them with what seems like an endless and mostly pointless conversation
then you walk another ten feet meet another character and start all over again
occasionally you run into someone you have to attack but the combat is so boring that it makes watching a bunch of senior citizens playing golf look like extreme sports
simply hit quotyesquot when asked if you want to attack and then just sit and watch and hope your complete lack of participation somehow affects the outcome
so join the excitement of star wars knights of the old republic talk
then talk some more
then fight by pressing quotxquot once
then talk yet again
dont just do something stand theremy neghibor is in th grade and he beat it in one night
does this tell you anythingmace griffin will probably be remembered as one of the greater disappointments for the ps
this was one of those titles that sounded promising in the development stages but never panned out even though its release was delayed for about a yearwhere do i begin
first like others have warnedthis game is hard
there is no difficulty selection so you have no choice but to try and tough it out
the save system is awful
its one of those games that only allows you to save at certain points
that would be totally fine if those chosen points were logical
theyre not
its frustrating when you have  percent health and have been playing for half an houronly to have some guy hit you in the head with a rocket and kill you
oopsguess you have to replay the last half hour again
sometimes though they let you walk through an area for only a few minutes with hardly any enemies and then the game gets to a save point again
dumbthe transition between ground fighting and air combat was highly touted
it is a seamless transition but they left out that one important factor
its called fun
the flying parts of the game are even worse than in air force delta strike
what about the ground fighting
well i cant say its bad because its not
the thing isthis had already been done plenty of times before  and its been done much better
you get your usual array of unoriginal weapons
you get to shoot at tons of people and aliens
you get to wander aimlessly through corridor after corridor
yawnthe graphics are average at best this aint no splinter cell and there is unbelievably no multiplayer feature
too many exceptional games have come out over the past few years and our standards are a lot higher these days
unless you enjoy walking around shooting enemies with your machine gun level after level after level then i sure wouldnt recommend you wasting any money at all on mace griffinlet me tell you about my experience with this gamefirst level  dark
you have to crawl through a lot of ventilation ducts but you cant see the entrance to them even though youre standing right in front of them because its so dark
other than that the graphics have a very ps look to them and the weapons were rather dull
the weapon selection menu sucks you have to cycle through all your weapons to get to the one you want
try doing that in the middle of combat with guys shooting at yousecond level  space combat sucks
your enemies fly around you like a swarm of bugs
theyre so much more maneuverable than you that youre lucky just to see one on your tv screen much less get a weapon aimed at them
the rest of the level is combat onboard a spaceship it gets repetitive and boring
you have to go an unbelievably long period of time between save points
when you pass a checkpoint the game may save automatically or it may not
youll get a nice surprise next time you turn the game on
you are given the option to quit and save but not to save and continue playing
even if you do manually save it it might not save anywaythird level  frustrating
the spiders really suck they jump around and you can waste hundreds of rounds of ammo killing them
they can kill you in a couple of seconds if youre not careful and lucky
other enemies need to be shot  times to kill them  they can even survive a pointblank shot with your rocket launcher
so i get to this one really long and rather difficult portion of the game and after playing through it about  times i finally get to the next part
no save point
i get killed by a spider that drops down behind me
i swear at the tv
i do it again make it past the spiders and what do i get
ive go to jump from one place to another
miss the jump
run across the room up a ramp jump on the box and try again
after  attempts i finally make it across
now ive got to make another jump and another  theyve got to be done in rapid succession or youll get knocked off and have to start again
so im supposed to sit here running around in circles attempting this jump about  times
are you freakin kidding me
this is a first person shooter not a platformer
gimme a breakabout the only good thing i have to say about this game is that i bought it used for next to nothingas my topic suggests world of warcraft does a lot of damage to the warcraft universe
fans of the rts games who have followed the arcing storyline will be disappointed with this mess of a gamein an attempt to dumb this mmo enough for the masses to understand it they pretty much destroyed the warcraft universe with some of the most mundane storylines ive seen in a game
i sometimes shudder to think this might be the end all of the warcraft series and cant for the life of me picture what warcraft  the rts will have as its story since wow has pretty much destroyed the foundation previously laid by the other gamesthe game mechanics are simple at best
a new player gets to create their avatar i use the word create loosely as the customization provided by this game is laughable at best
after that you start in the newbie area where you will have to complete the usual mindless quests ie go kill a certain amount of monsters and get a certain amount of itemsleveling is boring and easy for the first ten levels
at level  you are given talent points so that you can invest them in  trees of development
this is probably the only redeeming part of character development because it does allow for more character differentiation
it is not enough however to save this mediocre gameleveling constitutes completing a series of mindnumbing quests which most likely youll rarely read except to find out where to go and what you need to get
any story told through the quest text is sleepinducing anyhowafter you finally reach level  if you are able to stand the boredom and repetitiveness you can look forward to endgame content
this of course requires you to actually belong to a decent guild
odds are however that youll be in one of the crappy guilds who get eaten alive in the harder game instancesin a nutshell after  you can look forward to either not being able to do the endgame instances or doing them over and over again in order to get phat lootz purplz etc
getting a full set of epic gear will take you a long time so expect to do bwl at least a full year before you are able to get  of any of the epic armor sets
yay i hope you look forward to mindless repetition of these instances over and over againi was told by some friends how great this game is and i bought it and played and for awhile i though it was good
then after the second day i got tired of it
now i never want to play this game again worse i cant return the game
i am going to cancel my subscription in the next two days or so before they send me my first monthly bill
really disappointing
i went back to playing battlefield special forces i will stick with that game until they come out with something better
best part is that game is free to play online unlike this game
get it and you will enjoy itinteresting game at certain levels
at low levels this game can be very fun
lots of people and easier leveling make it very entertaining
and then it stops there is a pretty large gap in people and grouping from the low levels about ish until your level   the game has become a solo grind until you get  because a majority of the game content is written for level  or is so outdated that its not useful or even possible to get people to explore the content on most occasions
once a character reaches level  it is pretty much a requirement for a person to devote themselves to either pvp which then is mostly a solo act again unless you happen to find an active pvp guild which can be very challenging and on a whole is a very limited experience
pvp requires that you grind for the gear that make a character able to compete with other characters
very little of the pvp system relies on a players skill
the other major option is to engage in pve which the player can experiance a wide range of content
this can be a very interesting way to explore wow though once again very quickly it becomes a limited venue do to the social demands of guilding and gear that are required to continue to explore the content
months can be spent to gain a new item that is only marginally better than a previous one and one that could be replaced in days if a player was willing to devote their free time and suffer the whims of a higher ranked guildall for all if your a new player expect at least a couple of months of solo grinding to get your character to a point that you will be even socially eligible to be able to enjoy the majority of the content of the game
if your willing to do that the game can be very funwhen the game came out things worked pretty well
the glowing reviews were well deserved
but with each passing day since the bugs and stability have gotten worse
it has now gotten to the point that the servers go down everyday
and each time the servers go down the length of time they are down gets longer
most of the time the servers are down for a few minutes to a couple of hours
today it is now approaching  hours downtime and that is for nearly half the servers and the most popular ones
it wouldnt be that bad if the downtimes were when most people were not playing
but the downtimes almost always occur in the evening at the peak player timesthere are many bugs that many players know about and go unfixed
it has become the old doctor joke
you know the patient says doctor it hurts every time i do this and the doctor says dont do that
that is how many players play the game there are many things we are supposed to be able to do but when we do it the game locks up or crashes among other things
so we avoid doing certain things
again with each passing day more and more bugs appearthe pvpplayer versus player system in the game is probably the worst and most pointless of any online only game in existence
this can be especially frustrating for players trying to level on a pvp server
there is supposed to be a system that punishes players from killing other players of a significantly lower level
this is called ganking
after the first couple of areas on a pvp server you enter areas that are pvp enabled meaning the other faction can attack you
unless you have very high level players with you you will be ganked and many times
which makes it very hard to level and complete missions in these areas
after about level  you enter the pvp enabled areaswhen you do pvp with players of nearly equal level there is no reward for winning or punishment for losing
you also do not gain any experience
it is pointless
the community has been screaming to blizzard to give pvp meaning
blizzard was supposed to have a meaningful pvp system in place when the game was released and have promised this ever since the game came out
but again with each passing day we are told something is coming soon
we are still waitingall things considered with the server instability the bugs and the meaningless pvp system i would suggest waiting to buy the game at this time
i would wait about  to  months check the latest reviewsmake sure you read the date the reviews were submitted dont be fooled by reviews that were written when the game first came out to see if things have improved
edited august  as you can see the original review was written over a year ago
what has happened since then
if i didnt know better it almost appears that blizzard had my concerns at the top of the list for things to addressthe game works almost flawlessly with only the occasional down time lags and bugs
but honestly what mmo doesnt have these problems
wow now works as good or better than any mmosome people now say the pvp is the best part of the game and it is something that everyone should give a try especially the pvp haters you may be surprised how much you like itkudos to blizzard for doing it rightthere is a monthly charge to play online and game does not play offline was disappointed with the game not what i wanted at alli bought this game thinking that i could play it on my own
nope
once you pay the fourty bucks for it then you get the privilege of paying a monthly fee to play because it is only an online game
nothing mentioned in the amazon ad about that
i returned the game and amazon was very fair regarding a refund
i think that all on line games are basically a rip off since it forces you to have to play to get your moneys worth which never happens because you always have to pay more
sorry i am not into dealing with that since i have a lifei give this one star simply not because the game isnt good but the dvd is outdated you would be better off just buying it from blizzards site online and downloading it as the dvd itself here will be worthless considering that pretty much all the content of world of warcraft has been upgraded since cataclysmwhy they have not pulled these disks and come out with a new boxed product say called world of warcraft the shattering which contains most of the data needed for patch a so that it would actually be useful for those who either have slow downloads or like me have now have to deal with the stupid download cap that many isps are now putting on subscribers
the game itself is great and the cd key that comes with it will give you the full game and burning crusade too
but this product as a boxed product is out of datealso if you are not sure about getting the game you can go on world of warcrafts website and play the game as long as you want free up until level  now
which is pretty sweet
its a great game but just keep in mind this disk is out of date and aside for the key itself is pretty much uselessthis game starts with the premise that the casual gamer can advance relatively easily and in a fun meaningful way
you can even as a casual gamer reach the current level cap of  will be  when the expansion comes out later this year
the quests are fun and grouping is fun
the scenery is wonderful and the animations are quite good as wellall of that changes at level thanks to the game designers jeff kaplan and alex asfrasiabi  exeq hardcore guild raiders this game shifts into overdrive at level  these two hrday eq idiots have managed to turn this game into a huge timesink raidfest at level  to put it mildly if you dont have a hardcore raiding guild and arent willing to put in anywhere from  hours nightly every night youll be sitting around the capitol cities with your fingers up your rear doing absolutely nothing
let me state that again if you dont have  hours per week at level  to put into this game you will be running the same low level instanced dungeons over and overand overand overand overand overand overand over againthey keep adding content but for whom
you guessed it the hardcore elite
there is a ton of content that you if you are a casual gamer will never see
nice of them to introduce new dungeons bosses loot etc that  of the playerbase wont see ehthanks jeff
thanks alex assfrasiabihmmm where to start
well i played for almost a year trying to find that interesting or rewarding part it apparently doesnt exist
after level  of  it takes about  months of playing daily to reach  the gameplay becomes mundane generally you get abilities that are damage or recovery from damage and the attention of the enemy monsters and kill things thats it there is no way to lose level or stay dead other than game bugs there are plenty of those
essentially if you played up to level  youve encountered everything it has to offer later levels just mean more buttons and slightly different textures
oh and the characters and geometry appears to be designed by an antisocial teenager like the ones the draw pictures of distorted muscle men with giant shoulders interestingly enough thats the target market and the main player profile
you will encounter quests that tell you to murder people commit genocide and of course steal from your victims with lots of racist and factionalism dialog
essentially this is a game that can only be described as for sociopaths and the mundane
the actual game mechanics are built to make sure more sophisticated and intelligent gamers have no advantage and the reward system is based on time spent playing rather than accomplishment or skill
there are hours of filler in order to extend playtime  in order to extend your subscription  rather than compelling content
fillers include time penalties effects that make you wait until they expire absurdly long and very slow travel very low loot drops for items required for quests extremely long and boring battles and of course lots of server downtime
in the end i only feel that this game was a complete scam a waste of my time and money i feel ripped off and i will under no circumstance buy a game from blizzard or anyone that has worked for themim fairly a newbie to role playing games rpg and to gaming in general
i heard a lot about world of warcraft wow before trying it outi only tried it because i got a free trial from gamespy website
i took one look at it and was completely turned off by the cartoonish graphics and the fact that everybody in the game looked like monsters
i was starting to turn away from rpgs in general but i read some good reviews on amazon about guild wars gw and decided to try it out to see if there was anything to itguild wars blew me completely away
it rocks
i am totally addicted to it now
gw has extremely beautiful realistic graphics
i mean exquisite
and the only monsters you see in it are the ones you have to fight
i know i end up writing a review for guild wars but i cant help itwow probably is a good game but i will never play it because i cant deal with the cartoon graphics and all the people looking like monsters
moreover  dollars a month
get outta here
not me
guild wars is much much betterand its free to playthis game which i think is much like diablo  same general shutff is addicting to no end
you will be playing this game all the time and you will feel like crap when you are not
it is the same thing as tobacco withdrawl expect virtual
most of the people who play yes most are jerks who care only about gold and items and raids
it is like a second life which gains importance over your first
it also is not cheap to play this game  a month which is  a year which means some people have already payed  to play this game for  years
due credit is given to the developers however because they created a immersive enormous world plus a goldmine
use your discresion when considering this purchaseplease dont discount me as a random detractor or as a noob
i have plenty of end game experience on my  and my friends on theirs and we share an opinion that this game is in fact fairly pointless and poorly done
although it is fun for a while you get dragged in and then when you reach  you suddenly have no options for how to advance
you can either become a mindless part of a guild in which you go on incredibly restrictive several hour raids in boring zones or whither
most experienced mmo players would ask what the alternative is or disagree because they think there are other options within this game
the alternative is devising small raiding  person max for the good gear so that players are part of a real group and also to put in more balanced content for crafting and pvp
thank heaven for lord of the rings online wait for that dont play this trashi thought this game was going to be fun but it was not
it was fun in the beginning when you could actually gain level kinda fast by yourself
soon though you realize that gaining fast levels by yourself is an impossibility
instead you need to get in a group and just sit around while high levels kill everything for you
hurray what a blast
dont buy this gamefirst off you need to understand this game has actually gotten worse with time
hard to beleive that  bucks a month leads to a worse game
just for anyone curious i have to list off the main points of what is wrongthe combat system for the game is god awful
five professions are super unstoppable strong and the rest are relatively weak
the system is overly dependent on template strenght as opposed to player skill
in other words you can get by mashing one button
then to top it off there is no variety reward
there is only one acceptable armor and a handful of acceptable weapons
all the rest is garbage
in a game that did not have crafters that would make sense
next on the list is the fact that the game now incorporates player powerups buffs
that are now mandatory and must be administered by one player class
not uncommon for a player to sit around in a city for an hour just to go out and kill somethingenviroment and dungeons
sure they are huge but there is a problem
the game has a quick fix player vehicles
that can cover a on foot fourty five minute run in three or four minutes
part of the fun is getting there
now you are there in an instant
on a side note it does seem they tried to make the planets very atmoshperic but what you get is too much of one thing or another
tattoine for example is blinding bright and dathomir is pitch black
you will find yourself fiddling with the filters in the game alot
just so you can see where you are going
the dungeons are almost cookie cutter in nature
out of the fourty dungeons in the game only five or six are worth playing
the good ones are always camped by players looking to loot rare items
add to that alot of the dungeons have spawn timers on them in the game
so you can easily go to a dungeon and wait half an hour for the creatures to respawnlag the game is chopped full of it
not uncommon to go in an area and have it slow to  frames a minutes
increadibly easy to just lockup and be helpless
this is not just an issue in heavily trafficed in game areas
it can afflict you at any place in the gamecrafting most likely the most well designed feature in the game
its time conumeing but rewarding
the entire system is rather well done but is still afflicted by many bugs
to make matters worse
you will need to collect hundreds of resources to make everything you can make
then the crafter simply shoves a schematic in a factory and waits three hours for the factory to get done
most items are made on an assembly line basis and are often sold in crates or huge quantities of items
sadly after that you have to deal with the fact that ninety five percent of what you can make nobody wantsprofessions the game has fourty titles to acheive
not going further into the fact that many are broken worthless
most of them can be done in under three days
detracting from any satisfaction you might get from mastering them
plus mastering a player class usually involves players being forced to do skills that are neither useful to the the final product or give any real bonus at allthe economy and items
at this point the game is totally reduced to camping dungeons for rare super good items or doing repetitive missions over and over
the ingame economy is flooded with easy money and nothing to spend it on
the ingame missions are not only redundant but are drained of all fun value
people do them because they have to do them and there is nothing else to do
it breaks down like this you go to a terminal you grab two missions in the same direction
you pull out a bike ride out kill them usually with great ease and return to the terminal and repeat
there is no variety at all
even the bounty hunter missions are reduced to this
you simply have to take a few steps and go to another planet to run out and kill target
the quests are equally unfullfilling being that they are the same to missions and have absolutely no storyline to followgalactic civil war this is what starwars is all about right
well not in this game
the pvp the fun part rarely happens due to the broken combat
there are no starwarsy events to participate in
being in a faction rebel or imp is reduced to being able to wear a faction armor and the imps get atsts pets
that they can only use on faction targets
this has gone on so long that neither side has any faction pride left and its not uncommon for a player to see two opposeing overts standing and talking in the middle of a player city
two players that are advertiseing they want to player vrs player are not even doing thatall in all the game is majorly broken
ninety percent of the players playing the game will tell you they are sticking it out till the game gets better
people are playing out of hope that they will actually get a starwars game
sadly with pathetic combats systems enviroments and no starwars to actually speak of buying and paying  bucks for this game is a real waste at this time
maybe another year and a half from now
they might actually finish this product and make it fun to playalso do not get blinded by other reviews with five stars
these are usually people who just started to play the game and are overjoyed by the concept of a mmorpg
a new gameing style they have never seen
in mmorpg terms swg is a wholey pathetic producti had high hopes for this game
i finally had broadband in my area and what better way to test it than with online gaming right
the game in its current state can be summed up in one wordboringrun or jog for minutes at a time look for needles in haystacks kill vermin and hope nobody kills you
thats about it
sound adventurous
no space travel
no piloting of any craft
you might get to ride a dewback if youre luckyi wish i could find someone to give my copy
to get my moneys worth ive given it a dualpurpose  door stop and paper weightlucasarts and soe really missed the mark with this oneyou are paying for a product that is incomplete
the only thing star wars about this game is the name of the planets
i have been playing the game since launch and have yet to see any intresting depth or dynamic
it tries to force players to roleplay and communicate by having insane amounts of downtown
normally though most people just go afk during that downtime hoping someone will heal them
the only intresting thing in the game is the crafting system but teh player driven economy means you will be spending all your time getting your own resources as there is no commodity marketthe game does have promise but i have played enough mmos to know that  of the promises that companies make is a lie
look at anarchy online everquest and so on they keep stringing you along getting that monthly fee while they finsih the game as you test it for them
maybe in a year with something other than boring missions and inane level grind swg might be fun to play and hang out in as for now steer clearyou thought this would be better than everquest playing a wookie on different planets tons of nerding for sure
unfortunately it is nothing but everquest
sure it is addicting but the design is fundamentally weak and the graphics are brilliant but only because it is funded wellits pretty much mmorpg back to the basics dont get this game whatever you doi wish this game was good ive owned it for a long time this is the first  ive given a game
some people say this game is great and i dont really want to be rude but they were either high or freshly released from the looney bin or it could have been the first mmo they played i have to be honest i liked this game when i first played it it was the first mmo i played but after playing good games like wow or coh or ragnarok yes ragnarok is better i was disgusted at the game it should not have been made
i have to admit that it could have been more but it isnt what it should have been buy wow or coh or ragnarok just dont play this gamei played this game already and can say that it doesnt live up to the hype
dont expect anything new or anything that even meets the new standards of gaming
this game is like every other game on the market but dressed up as star wars for marketing purposes
its really boring the textures arent impressive at all and the characters are shallow
playing this game is comparable to being beaten by an old ladyyou pay out the yeng yang for this game and then after you get it loaded you discover that to get online to play you have to pay a monthly server fee
i guess that will teach me to read the fine printdrat it i totally missed that
i suggest the game be cheaper to afford the monthly fees or ixnay the monthly server fees
if youre not willing to fork out  for a game dont make the mistake that i didi wrote a review when i first bought this game
i gave it  stars because of all the inovative ideas put into the game
i also raved about its excellent surrounding environment in the different planets you can chose to play in
i now take back what i have said with part  of my swg reviewafter noticing the fact that i used to play an hour a day i was still just a novice pistoleer
why is this
because you have to play a lot to become anywhere good in the game
a huge flaw in this game is that it takes no skill at all whatsoever
the entire game is based off of the amount of time clocked into your life to play
your grandmother could play this game the rest of her life knowing nothing about video games and still do very well
once past the steep learning curve in the game all that stands in your way is time itself
if you have the time then go ahead nolifer play play play and play until you become a master marksman or medic or whateverthis isnt the worst problem though
the game is extremely repetative
sure going out with  people in lok killing space bunnies with many different types of players is fun at first
then you start to realize taht you can only make money by doing pointless missions and crafting weaponsarmor for bigger and more extreme players
alright that isnt so much fun
then we have the skill system
possibly the only good part about the game the skill system is a great way to mix skills to have more unique characters
ok you can be a master medic and a master pistoleer and a somewhat good creature handler but whats after that
i dont know absolutely nothing
once you max out your skill points the only thing else to do is to give up skills and start new ones or if you are that good of a character redo your skills again
great i am paying  dollars of my hardearned money every month to learn max out about  different professions funand about that  dollars a month
even within  months of release servers are frequently down getting updated
those  dollars are not going to the right places
when i had technical problems with the game the soe reps on the phone were not only giving me a big headache but were so unprofessional that they were wasting my time thus the  dollar phonecall to california that day
atleast use that money to get better reps and to get people that actually know how to make good patches for the game
then i might have considered keeping my accountearlier i discussed repetativeness
did i mention that there isnt one single vehicle that you are able to freely drive in this game
sure take a shuttle port to different cities or a starport to different planets
good luck walking  meters away from town for an  credit mission
doing so will require you to use autorun thank god that was implemented
for any players reading this review it is the numlock key
i was able to watch the first quarter of the screensavers on tech tv and still have a few minutes before i got to my destination
the best players will be the ones with nothing else better to do than sit around holding the forward key or watching your stupid character traverse across the world
fun fun funall of this for a rediculous price of  dollars a month
i can easily have more fun playing disneys new toontown mmorpg which costs  bucks a month
yay
i can even include a subscription to planetside  a critically acclaimed mmorpg  to still have a lower cost than one account to swg
and i would probably have more fun playing these games as wellto conclude the game was fun while it lasted
now i am selling my perfectly conditioned game back to the store for  of the original price and moarning over the loss of  dollars which i could have spent in much better ways
this is the last of my money sony online entertainment is getting from mei had high expectations for star wars galaxies and who didnt
it promised to be the revolution in mmorpgs
but revolution its not
after the first  minutes of galaxies i knew i was in for a big nasty surprise
first off no one is in charactor absolutely no one
and if you want to talk to someone you better type quotwaitquot as quick as you possibly can because people move far too fast to talk to them as they go byanother problem out of the many galaxies has are the missions
i meanwhen i saw the caption quotand now for the greatest star wars saga ever toldquot  i figured i was in for an adventure
what i was really in for was farm laborthats right you find yourself working as a rat hitman half the time
normally the missions break down like someone has a farm and they need you to kill this nest of critters to save their cropsthere are good things about this game dont get me wrong
in my travels i saw alot of things that impressed me for instance the cantinas and such
however i saw nothing that warrants a  dollar purchase
im sure there are people with good arguments as to why this is a good game however to me i found it to be dull poorly made and glitchythe point here is this game is just not finished there really isnt any other way to put it kindly
they needed to release something and it was released to early with far too many cut corners
i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone but diehard fans of the seriesprosnice graphicshuge areasfactionslots of skills and weaponsconsglitcheslagtoo many patchesno one icon june  sony and lucas arts announced that the game would be shut down as of dec    if you buy this game you will not get value for your moneythese items should be pulled from amazonafter september th  all new star wars galaxies account codes are no longer able to be used
the game is shutting down on the th of december and new players are no longer allowed to enter the gameif you buy this you will not be able to have access to what you paid for so unless you just want the box then you should not buy thisrepeat no one who buys a new cd key for star wars galaxies will be able to enter the game and any account who has not been active as of september th  will not be able to reactivate and enter the game
please be awaremy open letter to the people who reportedly get paid a salary at soeswg is dead
yes it had problems before
it was a grindfest and boring mostly
but now its truly dead
the cu despite massive protest and widespread dissatisfaction from the fanbase landed like a giant bugged bomb looking to infect every server with its merd
you never fixed the original game soe so you had to redo it into this pile of steaming tripe
oh wellyour subscription numbers tell the story
hahai and everyone else i know will not pay to beta test a broken game which has become infinitely worse with the release of the combat upgrade
major cu issues combat levels the game breaker
makes swg a sad place devoid of skill in combat
higher level boom
instawin button
lower level ooooohhhhh sorry shouldnt have even tried young padawan
with the multipliers to the higher level combatant and the reverse for the lower level schlub that xyz monster just hit you for  damage
hahaha idiots
cooldownwarmupwhat
you morons
haha
no more combat queue
forcing everyone to have to double master or more to get lvl  to be competitive see 
idiots
oh where oh where have all the crafters gone
where have the combatcrafters gone
to wow with everyone else
hahaahahbtw soeidiots for any further or previous usage of idiots crafters screwed over combat classes screwed over jedi screwed over damn everyone screwed overrotw cancelledswg cancelledsoe eat me you loserssee you all in wow my bloodfin peepsbuying star wars galaxies installing and patching the game  hoursrealizing that the manual you read during that time along with the strategy guide that you picked up talk about an entirely different swg than the one you are playing and are thus useless
pricelessthere are some games that are fun and rewarding to play
for everything else  theres sonysony online entertainment has turned this game into a severely bugged shadow of its former self
a new firstpersoncombat system similar to planetside was shoved into the game breaking the previous systems and returning the game to an alphastateif youre fine paying  per month for what is essentially an alphatest on servers which are devoid of all but    players at a time by all means pick this upif you value the money you work for and would like to play what this game is trying to be  spend your money on battlefront  instead
if you want a decent mmorpg i suggest anything not marketed by sony online entertainmentworst customer service everin  i was four years old
my mom says she took me to see the first star wars in the theater but i dont remember it
i do remember esb and rotj
and i certainly remember growing up in that time where the toys to have were star wars relatedmy point
i grew up waiting for a game like swg
when it came out in  i was ecstatic and ive been playing it ever since
sure there were always problems with it but what mmo pleases everyone all the time
yet i stuck with it through some very rough spots because i had faith that no matter how bad it got it would always get better
after all who could screw up star warswell now i have the answer to that question
soe can apparently
i played eq and watched as it devolved into a game for uberleet lewt whres so perhaps i shouldve seen this coming
im torn whether im to blame for my naivete or soe is for their abominable handling of the star wars licensein the end it doesnt matter
because the bottom line is that soe has absolutely crushed its playerbase with the recent combat upgradeit used to be that the game economy was player based
no longer
crafters can barely step outside their houses lest they get oneshot killed by a creature that resembles a bunny
insert monty python joke here if you pleaseit used to be that combatants had some solo content and wouldnt have to spend hours finding and maintaining groups
no longer
soloing in the game is frustrating at best impossible at worstit used to be that the vast majority of equipment worth having was made by player crafters
and while that may still be true with every patch and upgrade it becomes less true as soe desperately courts those for whom loot is the only thing in the game worth pursuingit used to be that patches and upgrades for swg while never bug free at least were given a reasonable amount of time in the test center for beta testing
no longer
the cu was released with almost no substantive beta testing
what little beta testing did exist made utterly no difference as the feedback from beta testers was completely ignoredi could go on but whats the point really
the bottom line is that swg as it exists now is a terrible terrible game
buyer beware
buyer beverywarei am a longtime gamer and you can trust me when i tell you that your hardearned money is best spent outside of soes coffersi loved this game
when i first played it as a demo a year ago i immediately purchased it because of the fun community aspects and advanced and unique interactions within the game
i met many people in the game and developed many friends worked tirelessly to advance my character and had a whole lot of fun
for a guy who loves star wars and a guy who likes computer gaming this game was fantastic
but all that changed on the dark day of april   when sony online entertainment butchered this game in a weak attempt to lighten it up for casual players they hoped to draw in after episode iiii will not get into specifics but suffice to say this so called combat upgrade tore the soul out of this game
a mass exodus of easily fiftypercent of the games total playerbase commenced within the first few weeks of this patch some of these players being veterans of the games who had been playing for nearly two years
glitches were abound balance fell apart and it became so bitterly comical that my character a pretty experienced avatar fell dead to the killer sting of a butterfly in game
combine this with the fact that some peoples characters are irrefutably damaged many of my personal ingame items including my home and weapons all disappeared and the fact that this game is now nothing more than a  dollar a month exercise in futility and youll soon realize that this is one game you dont want to ownso be smart
dont buy star wars galaxies or its derivitives
it costs money to play and there are more bugs and glitches in this game than in the first release of it back in august of  it breaks my heart that i have lost so many friends and a great experience but this game is truly forsaken
it is not the same game anymore it is completely different
if you want star wars take it from me this is no longer it and is not worthy of anyones hardearned cashno use buying it now sony killed the game off with the combat upgrade
it was so much better before but these clowns have taken a great game and just hacked it all apartstar wars galaxies an empire dividedsigh where to beginthis game could be better namedstar wars galaxies a development team vs a player basenever in all my life have i seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar
its truly sickening
i was a month veteran of the game i had been playing since week one ive canceled my account and will never do business with soe again
wave hand this is not the game you are looking for move along
please read onin the beginningthis game was alright it was fun it was unique and it was totally bugridden and unbalanced
over the course of the last  months the soe dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game
they in fact did very little if anything at all
they milked us
they exploited the star wars name to make a buck
they made promise after promise after promise and never delivered squat
dont believe me
just ask any smuggler in the game for their opinionthey strung us along and led us to believe that the fixes to the game were right around the corner
instead they were hard at work on an expansion pack to sell us
and then once again promised us that the fixes weve all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us just hang on this game is going to be great
they promised us that they were going to do this combat upgrade and do it right and it wouldnt be released until its ready
we all had a lot of hope we thought that they had finally figured out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse
god how wrong we all werewell much to everyones surprise they made the announcement that the long awaited cu would be coming out along with the rage of the wookiees expansion pack
uhhhmmm did i miss something somewhere
the alpha test for the cu was supposed to begin in january it never happened
beta testing began in april  whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live
we all rolled up our sleeves and dove in
i think after the first week or so the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink inthey went and copypasted eq code into the swg game so they could streamline their operation by having one dev team work on both swg and eq
the cu was supposed to go live on may th
soe decided to push it to live a whole  weeks sooner than that
honestly with all the bugs that were still in beta and now in live beta could have gone on another  months
i guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it
why am i not surprisedthe cu itself is unplayable
it has become everquest in space or everstar galaxies questwars as we call it
there are just too many things to list
im sure a lot of other reviews here go into much more detailas you all can imagine the player community was totally enraged
we went to the swg forum boards to voice our concerns
the only response we ever got back from soe was thousands of deleted threads and players banned from the forums
facing futility a large portion of the player base has left the game permanently this timethis is just not how you do business
i personally will never deal with sony online entertainment soe ever again
i do not pay my hard earned money to be lied to deceived ignored strung along censored and banned for voicing my concerns
i do not pay money to folks who treat me a paying customer in this fashionstar wars galaxies is dead
servers are emptying
people are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons
if you are a fan of star wars and this is the only reason i ever started playing this game to begin with you will be sadly disappointedswg is nothing more than an exploit of a title a milk machine
i for one am tired of being milkedyou have been warnedthis review will be short and sweet save your money
heres whyas with the disappointing postverant international expansions to sonys popular everquest franchise star wars galaxies is very short on content but very high on greeddriven programming choices
for one thing forget about making multiple characters on the same account a courtesy which nearly every previous mmorpg game ever created has featured
in star wars galaxies you are forcibly limited to one and only one character per paid account period
if you play for  months and discover that you hate that character you must start all over again from scratch and will have wasted your previous subscription fees naturally
unlike every other game which has preceded it galaxies does not allow you to try out different characters simultaneously until you settle upon the one which you like best
the only possible reason for such an imposed limitation is a simple one greed
sony wants your subscription fees and this is an obvious ploy to milk as much money from their subscribers as possible
i could accept this a bit better if the game content warranted it but it does not the game world is entirely too small and bland overalladditionally when greed such as this so rudely limits the gameplay options combined with the typically poor to nonexistant customer support already made famous by sonys infamous everquest experience well such lack of concern for the gamer frequently becomes invasive to the gameplay experience itselfand thats simply not very much fun unless you enjoy roleplaying a sucker lining the pockets of grinning japanese businessmen um no thanks
star wars galaxies has thus far managed to disappoint nearly everyone who has courageously given it a try
unless you are seriously hung up on the star wars films and simply can not live unless you get to be a han solo clone in an extremely limited gameplay world i would recommend passing on this one
save your money for a more promising game such as the upcoming worlds of warcraft for exampleanother big thumbs downediting addition back when i wrote this review in august i was still waiting for sony to patch and fix the immense number of bugs in swg
i assumed based upon sonys infamous prior history of exploiting their customers and forcing us all to pay to be sonys beta testers that soe would eventually make the necessary repairs that this game required
after all the game had only been released fairly recently when i wrote this review
well here i am still waiting for those fixes and it is now october of have they finally properly patched and fixed the unbelievable plethora of bugs in star wars galaxies
they have not
whats worse when you complain to them they become condescending towards you their paying customer and attempt to make you feel as if you simply do not get it
oh i get it alright swg just like most other sony games is simply a getrichquickbeforetheycatchontousandcancel scheme
the various patches applied to this game have made the problems worse not better
classes have been nerfed to the point of being nearly unplayable no one wants to play medics because they are generally unrewarding hospitaltype areas where players must go to heal up after battles are overcrowded due to lack of services and generally everything in this game seems geared toward making you wait days or weeks before you enjoy even a tiny amount of meaningful progress
days or weeks that you continue to pay for whilst getting little to no satisfaction from either the game itself or sonys nearly nonexistant customer supportmy advice
i hate to say it but at this point i favour a massive and total boycott of all products from sony online entertainment
since greed is apparently the sole motivation they have behind their various decisions and practises then fine hit them where they apparently live
hit them in their wallets
i just did i cancelled every subscription i had to all the sony online entertainment games i had been playing including everquest after nearly  years another game soe has managed to nearly destroy after buying the franchise from verant internationalthe game was playable before the combat revamp
no things werent perfect
i played for  years and personally discovered every inconvienient bug in the game from having my money dissappear to being killed repeatedly because i couldnt fight back
but now i am ready to give up
the customer support has gone from bad to either nonexistant or blatantly antagonistic and  the professions in the game no longer work at all
the other  work partially
and forget it if you try and make a new character
it is impossible to level
this from a guy that went from novice to master rifleman in  days in the old system without working hardthat what pretty much describes this game
pure  garbage trashjunk how much junk when the orginal box set is now under  bucks that is pretty much talking volumes
the the total experience is for some odd reason now over 
and the star kit 
soe can make all the changes they want just they better not except people to put and pay for trash
there products are simply not worth the time grief and grind time anymore
once upon a time this was a very unique gamenothing but junk
the time for swg is pretty much overthe only way that soe maybe able to save this game if they swallow there pride there stupidty and go back to the orginal format but that will create a new problem
for those who did it with the cu and the nge assuming the game is around that long
leave it to soe to put themselves into a catch  either way there going to losemy wife and i bought this and dove into the star wars universe full of hope and expectation
after all what can possibly be lacking in anything with the star wars nameoh boy
let me be a little technical first before giving my gut feelingsthe interface was good at first glance
not great just good
it could have been far better
some controls can be rewritten some cant and some rewritten controls interfere with others when they arent supposed to
for instance chatting was a chore if you attempt to rekey anything on the keyboard
you dont want to be involved in a chore when youre fighting talking and trying to stay alivethe pvp is jacked all to heck and back with just a couple of classes being way overstrengthed with quotuberrockyourworldpwnquot abilities and or equipment
there is no reason at all to engage in pvp unless you just want to hear the other guy scream obscenities at you
plus the game is overrun with pets
dont bother picking a manoamano fight  those dont exist
you have your pets do all the fightingthe world is limited
a handful of planets with an area mapped out on each
plenty of room to run around but not much out there
most of your time will be spent in cities getting killed over and over in spaceportthe gameplay is somewhat like ao
players can take missions for money exp and faction points
unfortunately the missions send you out to only  different types of mission points either a metal outhouse with  guys around it or a smoking pile of poop with several animals around it
the swg game was bought from uo as the defunct uo system so i understand which is why the game is based on animals and skins and bones and gut puddingsthe crafting is at first impressive
at first
both i and my wife took up crafting when we saw pvp was so pointless that we had nothing left to do
diablo made my wrist ache sometimes but no game like swg has ever jacked my wrist all to heck
you want carpal tunnel
play this game as a crafter
and i macroed as much as i couldthe bugs in this game have yet to be fixed whole classes broken whole faction perks broken nerfs to anything that gets whined about on the official boards whats the worst you can imagine
swg has itif you like the rebels join this game
rebels rule every single world in the swg and walk the planets fully declared
the empire has absolutely zero ballz in this universe
the emporer is wetting his robeokay my gut feelings this game has been taken over by the pokemon players
you want to pvp
make sure you have some handy pokepets to whip out of your datapad and say quotaquot
thats the game
there are hardly any droids to speak of and this is supposed to be star wars
this game is a joke
i watched star wars in its theater debut in the s
this game bears no resemblance
background effects of tie engine whines dont count when the whole game is based on pokemonbut hey thats the majority of the audience kids that grew up with pokemon and liked it
swg is pokemon in space and it wont ever changeam i the only one that thought that civ outright sucked
civilization and civ were earthshattering for me
then call to power   became favorites
civ just seemed like a huge step backwards
anyway along comes medievil total war
mtw is actually two games in one
it is a militarydictatorship strategy game on the one hand
expect intuitive city management and troop creation menus
however it is also an awesome combat engine
you can lead your troops during a battle
you can decide if it makes more since to have your longbowman fight melee style or leave that to your spearmen which i strongly suggest
everything about mtw is polished and intuitive
comparing mtw to civ would be like comparing halo the coolest game ever for those of you that havent played halo  drop what you are doing and get it to quake  they are both first person shooters but halo has taken it to a whole new galaxy
do not waste your hard earned money on civ
mtw is an intuitive addictive strategy game that wont let you gocivilization was one of the computer games which gave me my enthusiasm for gaming way back in computer gamings bronze age
civilization  was unquestionably an enormous leap forward with the core design of the original game
i also very much loved sid meiers alpha centauri in some ways it is my favorite of the three games and i still play it quite oftenso of course i bought civilization  the moment it was available
oddly i stopped playing it after two months
i told myself that it was because i was busy or distracted by other games or by events in my life
in preparation for the release of play the world i decided to start playing civ  againthe first problem with play the world unfortunately is civilization  itself
its just not a very good game
it has some good ideasthe effect of culture for examplewhich are mostly badly implemented and lead to extremely frustrating or annoying gameplay
does anyone enjoy conquering an enemy city moving troops back out of the city having it revert to its original holder no matter what you do reconquering it and so on until the city is reduced to size 
the paradoxical effect of culture designed to allow for peaceful absorption of other civilizations is that it often leads to a much more genocidal approach to military conquest
theres a lot like that in civ design elements that may be interesting ideas or not but that dont work well at all as implementednow i foolishly ventured into getting play the world just to see whether that made a difference
im not sure whether multiplayer would make the game better because multiplayer in play the world doesnt work unless youre on a lan
thank god i bought it from a store where i could return it
im disappointed because the one thing i have looked for from firaxis is a certain degree of professional reliability
play the world is in terms of basic bugginess and functionality one of the worst major releases in the past yeari felt rippedoff
i love civ iii but this addon is total trash
nothing to it
it is only good for their pocket books i was very let down that this trash was put on the market
it is not worth even a dime
wyatt kaldenbergspoilers alertin one of those rare instances where you play someone other than a jedi in a star wars game bounty hunter provided a very interesting and highly entertaining thrillride through the underbowels of star wars planetssuch levels as coruscant take you from the roof tops of some of the middlelevel buildings to the lower levels where shady nightclubs and such are
other levels take you to very interesting and highly lavishly built levels which provide a complex and interesting backstory as to how and why count dooku pretending to be syfodias chose jango fett to be the clone prototype for the republics clone armythe gameplay is solid and jango is very powerful and not invincible
his weapons are easy to figure out and fun to use and his jetpack is very useful in almost any situation
you have the ability to lock on to opponents with your guns though this does not guarantee that all shots will hit it certainly makes it easier when shooting and attempting to evade a flurry of blaster bolts hurled at you and you not being a jedi deflecting them with a lightsaberunfortunately for a well crafted game its biggest and ultimately fatal flaw is that it has absolutely no replayability
it has a relatively short campaign of some  missions or so and that is it
there is no multiplayer either online or with other controllers there are no additions to the campaign or nonstoryline battles you can do
there is only the campaign and once that is over you are essentially done with the entire game
perhaps waiting a year would make it worth playing again but otherwise this is not a game you should buy expecting too muchreally be honest
this has got to be the worst lucasarts game out there besides the fact that they all are really horrible
the game has no real objective besides get the bounty on an alien while shooting five hundred others that look exactly alike
the gameplay is like a broken recordst you scan an aliennd you capture him dead or aliverd repeat the process for  levels while being blasted by dozens of other aliens that dont die until they have about fifty red hot laser beams in themi really fooled myself buying this without renting it firsti wasted  dollars on a game that isnt worth two
the long and the short of it
do not buy this game unless you like to be driven to the nearest padded room in a white coati havent played this game but ive read the reviews from other gamers and i feel that this game is just a ploy to get the space war fans first before star wars galaxies comes out which from the reviews looks to be incredible and will definatly lay this game to waste
swg took the cake at the game show st place
i think anyone concidering buying this game should think twice and read the reviews for star wars galaxies and compare them to this game reviews and see for yourself
save your pennies its only around the cornerthis game has been unplayable for five years now
i am aghast at why this is still for sale when it cannot be played
is there really such a thing as a game collector who would be interested in making the game a part of some grand collectionand just for clarity there is no single player mode and no way to host your own miniuniverse for itagain not sure why it is still being sold when it cannot be played and why the sellers are not noting this in their product pages
here is a quote from one of the vendors pc game complete in box with all contents  cds are in great shape and play great  hmm cds play great eh
howsorry for being so down on this it is not my style to be rude but i have been burned four times now with online universe games that sellers failed to mention could no longer be playedhail flaviuswasnt horrible while it lasted
except for some serious balance issues and lack of content
however this game was canceled
you cant play it anymore the most you will ever get to do is watch the intro so unless you need the box for your collection
i would not buy this and i cant believe they are still allowed to sell this
want a good spaced based mmo  go with eve online
it doesnt have much in the way of pve content but the pvp contents is expansive and beyond any mmo i have played
with a complete player based economy and only a small portion of space patroled by npcs
there are  solar systems to set up shop in so even the npc petroled areas are pretty big you dont have to be a pirate but the danger sure makes being a trader more interesting
you really dont like danger
then you can still run missions trade goods and mine ore in high security space but its not nearly as valuablethis game is terribleif your going to play this game you need to have a very powerful computer with incredibly fast internet
because there is no single player
or at least you dont want to play it because it is about as entertaining as cspan
the bots are worse than any game ive ever seen even the old  bit games has far better bots that could actually do damage to you
you can literally walk behind a bot forever and they will not see you
you can stand in a room of them and they will not even moovebut yet you can get sniped all the way across the map by a rpg or pistol by a botthe multiplay is also very badthe servers are run by  year old unemployed loosers that try to make themselves feel better about themselves by banning everyone who wont sercumb to their insults
btw you cannot get unbanned and there are only about  servers that have more than  people playing in themfor the sake of money and having a job do not get this game
get a nes and have a game that will be waayyy better thatll last  yearsi was really looking forward to buying and playing battlefield   i had heard so much hype about it
you know what
you need a super computer to play this game
now dont tell me to go buy a newer computer because i already have a new computer
i have a dell ghz with mb ram and a mb nvidia geforce  graphics card
no matter what setting i put this game on this game lags and movement of everything is very slow
i ended up taking the game back to the store and putting in a preorder for the expansion pack to medal of honor allied assault which comes out next month
i never had any trouble at all with medal of honor allied assault and it ran as smooth as silk on my computer
electronic arts ea has published both battlefield  and medal of honor allied assault and i cant believe they would let battlefield  be published with all of the bugs in it
this game needs alot of work and alot of patches to be able to work right
im very disappointed that ea released this game so early with so many bugsthis is the most dissapointing pc game i have bought in quite a while
i enjoyed the earlier duke titles and thought they were great fps games
the manhatten project retains some of the feel of the previous duke games but is not up to par with its ancestors
the biggest complaint i have is with the user interface
it is nearly impossible to control the onscreen character with either keyboard commands or the joystick
also the horizontal only movement and the third person perspective does not work well with a shootemup such as this
i like the graphics and the game concept but control is of paramount importance in a shooter and this game just does not have itif you liked duke nukem d you may hate manhattan project
ive just wasted amt on this game
problem is that you cannot move forward or back
you can only move left or right
i thought there was a problem with my joystickkeyboardconfigetc but no that appears to be the way this game was made
i ran duke d and it worked perfectly
i was really looking forward to this game and am a little upset at the dummy who decided to make it a side scroller as it just does not make sense
this is exactly why people borrow software and i wish i would have done that as i could have saved some moneyill be brief since this game is not worth wasting much time onshort versionif you have ever played any other football game on any other platform this one will probably disappointthis is the worst football game ever on any platform going back to this is the worst xbox game that ive seengraphics  dworst of any xbox football game even last years madden for the pc was much better
truely disappointing
for example the goal posts dont look like poles but a stack of poorly aligned lego blocks very bad jaggiessound  csoso
nothing special nothing horrible
very few choices and very redundent after  minsfeatures  fmissing even simple things
you can not review your roster or set your starters
there is no coachmode only arcade play
doesnt even pretend to be a simsupposedly you can import players from this game into madden  but what would be the point when the players in this game do not have any names
and dont seem to be based on actual playersgameplay  fvery very very bad
play last years nfl fever  for an example of how an arcade football game should play or last years madden  for the pc for an example of how a strategy football game should play or if you want try an oldie called front page sports football pro for even a better example of a strategy football simdont believe me
take a stroll over to the ncaa  message board at ea sports website and examine the multiple discussions over the xbox version both freezing and resulting in quotdisc dirtydamagedquot errors during savingloadingcoulda been a great game
if not for a little thing called quotquality controlquotfrequent lockups and total system crashes
this is the only retail software that ive experienced these problems with since the days of dos
when it is running there are quite a few details that give the impression it is a beta version that was never completely finished before hitting the shelvesea tech support operates under the quotno not us somebody elsequot method of problem solutioni have a question for all the reviewers professional and otherwise how can you write a favorable review on a software program that i like several other people i know cannot get the game to install even on quotstate of the artquot computers
further and in my experience ea as an organization give only lip service to customertech support
the madden franchise in my opinion are poorly designed faulty products
it should be avoided no matter how much you love football at all costsunless of course unable to install constant crashesmadden  and failure to issue roster updates is your fortenote to pc sport games  oh great microsoft have pity on the poor pc gamer and bring back nfl fever to usmy tomb raider game is filled with bugs
within  minutes of downloading it i had to restart my computer  times
when the game does show up i get a blank screen
i can hear the sounds and all but there are no pictures
whatever i do i cannot get it to work
ive tried so many websites for help
ive waited a year for this and now i wish i didnt get it
maybe its just my game
but other people have been having the same problems too
well at least the box is coolive always enjoyed tomb raider games
but i bought this game and it did not work on my computer
my computer didnt match the maximum requirements which they dont show you until after you open the box but it did match the minimum requirements
i didnt buy this from amazoncom but i bought it from a different store
they had this stupid policy that you cant get a full refund if you opened it
how the heck are you supposed to know that it doesnt work if you cant open it
anyway after a while i got a ps
so i decided to try it on ps
it worked but its not that fun
its almost impossible to control laura
there are certain points in the game that you have to be at an exact angle to jump onto a ledge and you can spend like a half hour trying to jump onto the stupid ledge
its also not that fun because one of the cool new features is that she can only hold on for a certain amount of time
if you want to stay on a ledge for longer you need to break a window or kick a door down
then she looses her strength againi dont know if any of you guys remember the first doom on super nintindo but this game is similar to it and that is sad
today games should be around the level of hightech
for example halo  games need to stay in that level or continue to get better which they are ps xbox  wii and future game systems to comeback to the reviewgraphics d things in a d world  gameplay bad  sound good and bad  story didnt really pay close attention  replayable no  this game shouldnt have been for xbox at all
its a discrace to xbox and the unreal series
save your money for something better unless you really like the old stuffthis game just had so much potential
sweet graphics cool storyline gameplay like halo xbox live play
what the hell happenned then
i popped the game into my xbox started a single player game and was immediatly greeted with an ugly cutscene that looked like it was programmed for the atari jaguar
i thought quotwell ok the graphics will get better and the gameplay will kick ass rightquot wrong
i got into my first battle and i thought i had a slow mo cheat on
i mean the game was chugging at about  frames per second
to make matters worse the monsters have  frames of animation
and no i am not exagerating the monsters literally look that pathetic
as the game was pretty much unplayable at that point i just gave up quotplayingquot more like watching a flip book and sold it as fast as i could
not having xbox live i could not test the online component of the game but it has to be better than single player
overall i would stay far way from this and go buy halo or halo  or brute force or pretty much any first person shooting game out there
if atari had actually taken the time to iron out all the bugs unreal  actually has some asskicking potential
as it is the game is an overhyped piece of junkim a big fan of military and fps well this one is rd person anyway games
this is the worst squad game ive ever played
your teammates do not react as a real human would they stand and try to shoot ennemies in plain sight a group of ennemies appear and your teammates do not even go to find a spot to hide way too many bugs your teammates shoot but they do not dudge ennemies bullets what is that wall next to u for
an enemy throws a grenade and your teammate do not even jump out from the area or throw back the grenade to the enemy etcthey might walk like commandosspec ops shoot precisely like commandosspec ops but they do not respond at all like commandosspec ops i approach an entrance and these guys do not even get to hide on both side before the entrance nor a guy is watching my back
i go inside a building these guys do not even follow me in line
u call that teamworkthis game is only good in multiplayernot even worth a star
not even worth to buygo for star wars republic commando
now thats what i call a squad that respond according to the situation with real military proceduressly cooper  the thievious raccoonus is a dumb game
the grafics are like a cartoon which is kind of cool but after a while it gets annoying
the game is hard too
i couldnt get past the  level
dont get the gamei spent about  minutes playing this game before i realized what a bad game it is
i love the cell shading and i wish ps would have more games better games that is with art like this one
however i found this game to be far too simplistic to be enjoyable
you dont get a health meter
at all
if you touch anything youre not supposed to for me it was a plant you die instantly and are sent back to the beginning
if you fall into the water you die instantly
if you die three times you start all over like you did in old nintendo gamestrue i didnt get past the first level so i dont know if this situation improves at all but for a game to have that kind of set up in the first place is pointless
hasnt gaming come far enough in the past  years that have rendered the concept of how many lives i do i have left
totally useless
my suggestion rent it and see for yourselfnever played any madden game before i tried one out with madden  of ps that i recently bought for two bucks at a flea market
i am not a fan of ps but i was curious about the game
i had hoped that the game would be satisfying to the point of being a good football game a worthwhile game to play
alas it turned out not for me
my greatest fear was quickly realized too many buttons on the controller thus a very complicated gameplay
the more i played the game the less i liked it
the longer i went with the game the more my wrists and fingers hurt
i was more annoyed by the long pauses and loading times during the waiting periods and most especially between plays of the game
i was like just freaking snap the ball and get on with the drive or loading for what
whats taking so long
lets get moving
i swear that it was like being trapped being forced to watch the endlessly long commercials during an actual nfl game
i found the complicated buttons for different moves utterly ridiculous
i couldnt even remember everything for players in different positions offense and defense
i was like why cant there be a single button for everything only that ill trust the players discretion to make a move best suited for the moment
that would have simplified everything for me
anyway i am from old school and my days were filled with atari and  bit nintendo
to this day the greatest football game ever made was tecmo bowl
later it got replaced with tecmo super bowl
anyone who has played the game will quickly agree with me
the game play is so absurdly simple the action is quick and fast and there are no pauses between plays
it just flows well and the game per se rewards back with a lot of great moments
the celebrations in the end also the dramatic moments are the best parts of the game
all in all madden  is an awful game and i cant play it anymore
just give me tecmo bowl any time of the day over this cumbrous junknever received item romance of the three kingdom vii for ps from vanderlow
vendor hasnt repliedto my email of three weeks agoafter many reinstallations i have given up on this game
it keeps crashing my sixmonth old computer running xp
after i installed a new hard drive after my old one got corrupted due to a virus i reinstalled scrabble to see if it would work again
the game loaded up okay but when i went to play it against maven the computer player the game was on autopilot
i had no control over what words i could make on my turn  the computer program was doing everything
obviously there are some serious bugs in this game
i am very disappointed that once again i blew  on a game i cannot play
there are no patches on the companys website eithercant get this program to work with windows xp at all
screen goes black and locks up the computer
atari does not offer any kind of patch to fix their program but suggests you open windows task manager and start shutting down all the background program on your computer to eliminate conflicts
sorry but im not shutting down my antivirus antispyware and firewall programs to play a stupid video gamejust a word of warning for anyone expecting a completely new game
before you preorder this title take a look at the screenshots for the new game
you can find some on the companys website or any pc game review website
the sequel looks exactly like the original game
theyve altered the roller coaster design features a little and inserted a few different rides but overall this game is almost a carbon copy of the first one
if you enjoyed corkscrew follies and the other expansion game this game is for you as all it really is is more maps and a few more rides but if youre expecting something different which i always do with sequels youre going to be horribly disappointed
even the graphics engine is still the same
this game is primarily meant to cash in on one of the most popular game series everafter playing eu i was very excited about this game
as a graduate with a history and political science major in college i was extremely impressed with the historical accuracy of eu which engaged the player in the historical milieu of europe from  through the problem with this game is that unless you want to play a major power you have no chance of having any fun
i tried playing poland south africa and ethiopia
with poland i worked with the idea of at least holding off germany with a decent defensive war
unfortunately starting in  gave me three years to try to undo all the polish military shortfalls
even with the  hindsight of history i could not stop the germans juggernaut
likewise good luck if you play ethopia
if you are required to play the major powers to have any chance of success it completely undoes the fun of eu in which you could play any country and with some skill and luck make a reasonable show of skill and change the course of history which is why you are playing this gamein eu i was able to make the declining power venice into a mediterranean power defeating turkey
likewise i was able to change history completely when poland eliminated russia allied with austria and survived to fight napoleon or when brittany decline to accede to be part of france or a lackey of england
in this game the short time span makes it impossible to do anything with the minor powers
thus it essentially allows you to fiddle with nazi germany to see if it can defeat russia early and stop the allies in the west whoopee
i get to make the genocidal maniacs succeed how funthis is a game with a ton of possibilties that is limited by a too short time frame
if it started in  then there might be  a chance to make the game fun playing unusual minor powers
as it stands just pray you survive the nazi onslaught if you decide to play the allies
very disappointingcrash died years ago
the original should have been the first and only
sony even realised these games were garbage and sold the liscence to konami so they could produce this game on xbox and gamecube and let them suffer low sales
good idea on sonys part
if you still want to get this game bang your head on the wall and stop thinking about it
youll one day thank meto start it off dont buy it heck dont even rent it
the graphics are horrible for what a gamecube can crank out
and all of these different grooves to fight in whats with that
also the gameplay gets really repedative
all of the characters look strange and there moves stink
if i could i would give it a negative  stars
if you want a good game get def jam vendetta it even has  player action
but dont waste your money on this load of fluffthis game was the same like the first vicecity but you play as a black guy and it has a different story
gta is really getting boaring its just the same stuff so this game was not goodthis game is just flat out horrible
if you want a game that is fun to play over and over again and want great graphics and everything else you should look elsewhere
there is no variety in this game whatsoeverthis game gets old fast
the graphics are ugly
the gameplay is bad
it all seems pointless and stupid
not in any way fun
how could someone like this crap
what is it that they see in this game
there are so many better games out there
it goes out of its way to seem violent and wrong
the plot is so unbelievalbe in a bad way
it stereotypes big timewhat can i say its just like the old game
boring after  minutesdont buy iti have tried playing this game for the xbox with several different grand theft discs each time it gets locked up more often than a career criminal do not rent do not buy
it is more frustrating than it is worththe controls are horrible especially the first person targeting ugly graphics missions are stupidly difficult could be ok if not for the frustrating controls and some of them have insane time limit
this game probably never went through quality control
crossstitching is more fun than this stupid gamei was expecting this game to be easy but it wasnt  i think sonic team at least shouldve added a handicapp mode on story mode where it gets easy but instead they didnt  the levels are just to hard and annyoying and walkthroughs make it sound like the game is easy when its noti wont sugarcoat your expectations here this game is bad
its almost worse than bad and its no wonder sega had to resort to giving copies of it away with the xbox in the winter of 
it just wouldnt move on its own the entire package is so shoddy and second rate
your expectations for a packin game are already a little bit lower than they would have been if youd spent an extra fifty dollars on it but even with those downgraded standards i cant fathom how word about this games ugliness didnt quite reach me before that fateful day when i finally decided to give it a shot
its so bad im surprised i didnt notice a foul odor coming from the clam shellwhere the average racer does a good job of giving you the sensation of control the feel of horsepower underneath your thumb and a fair idea of how most cars respond to such insane acceleration sega gt accomplishes none of these
its use of vibration an oftoverlooked key component of the experience is slim at best and often amounts to nothing more than a quiet stir should you happen to drive over a huge patch of rocks
acceleration feels more like a ride on the ferris wheel than a moment behind the wheel of a earthbound rocket ship as your car will join four or five others in eversogently building their way up from a standstill to a moderate speed
its like jumping into the body of a sixty year old woman mildly confused behind the wheel of her lincoln continental and racing against similarlymaligned spirits in one of the most  anticlimactic experiences ive ever put myself through
turning is a slow arduous process and more closely resembles a series of soft graceful slides on a toboggan than precision cornering
id assume that the idea there was to emphasize a rallystyle drift racing not unlike that of rallysport challenge since that seems to be an ongoing obsession of segas but it really doesnt work right in this instance and the quality suffers because of itone unique surprisingly cool addon to most of gt ks races is the inclusion of a postrace replay editor and photo system
the photo editor in particular is something that sounds completely stupid at first but becomes extremely cool in action
after an important race on one of the career modes circuits the game will automatically jump right into a replay of your efforts but rather than sitting back as a mere spectator youre given the ability to change angles zoom and capture up to six different inaction shots
after youve used up all of your film youre taken to a screen to review the shots and select your favorite of the bunch which is then displayed on the wall of your ingame garage right above the trophy case
its a fresh way of giving the player a sense of personal accomplishment visually identifying your achievements with the actual act of achieving them and is one of the few aspects of the game thats an unbridled successsega gt s variety of differing modes for game play are conspicuously similar to those of sonys gran turismo series youve got a straight day in the life of career simulation the standard try to beat my best time socalled arcade setup a headtohead competitive racer with support for a maximum of two players and a mildly interesting storyline option dubbed chronicle mode
the career mode officially titled sega gt mode certainly aspires to be a gran turismo killer but opts for a more straightforward linear path in contrast to turismos famous freeform career progression
sure you start in the same place a couple thousand dollars in your pocket a dream a knack for the track and endless amounts of free time to dedicate to your craft
the similarities however really end once youve chosen a bottomoftheline car with which to begin your journey and actually start to take part in a few races
the staggering scale of gran turismos world and that games amazing ability to project a feeling of awe directly onto the player is a big part of what makes it so highly respected so iconic among gamers
in the world of gt  youll buy your starter car perhaps spend a few minutes tuning and improving its performance and head out into a world filled with a stiflingly narrow career path and maybe one or two choices to make along the way
you wont even take your first license test until youre already three races into your career and the tests themselves are as bargainbasement as they comeinstead of slowly working your way through each important aspect of racing a highperformance automobile showing the judges that you know how to accurately brake to turn without nipping some offturf terrain to pass without ramming your opposition into a stationary object you drive a gamespecified car around a gamespecified track for one lap
if you dont finish with a time that the judges deem to be acceptable you fail
for the purposes of license testing youre also granted a strange sort of failure meter which quickly drains if you nudge a wall allow your wheels to leave the track at any point perform a power slide around a corner or potentially turn your head the wrong way
if the meter hits empty you guessed it the test is over and you automatically fail
so in addition to timing you on your run the judges also expect you to drive like a grizzled veteran along the way which is cute because theres no sort of training module to introduce you to the titles flippedout physics engine
hope you like flying blind because sega is here to dispense the blindfoldswhile the headtohead mode is your standard split screen affair and the quick race option is run of the mill the chronicle mode seems to have its heart set in the right place even if the results are less than spectacular
aiming to fill gamers in on the history of circuit racing as well as the trends in car manufacturing that have come and gone chronicle mode asks you to climb behind the wheel of one of a dozen different s muscle cars and race against opposition from three historical decades
youll work your way through the historical ranks by racing it against cars from the s early s late s early s late s and st century observing as its early strengths are surpassed by the rapid progression of technology and toiling as the older models inherent weaknesses become harder and harder to ignore
before each race the game gives you a little historical lesson in the form of a three or four paragraph essay explaining what advances had been made in the automotive industry over the five years in question
its a great concept but the historical essays seem to have been written by someone with only a passing knowledge of the english language and considering the inherent flaws in the standard game itself the last thing youre going to want to do is handicap yourself by racing an antique against a soupedup st century monsteras far as visuals are concerned this isnt really a game that youre going to want to show off to friends
its mediocre at best topping the visuals of its immediate predecessor sega gt on the dreamcast but failing to live up to the standards established by its direct competition
the car models look oversimplified the environments are lacking in detail and the spectators are blatantly twodimensional animated cardboard cutout fare
even the prerenders featured on the front cover of the dvd casing are substandard attempting to simulate the brilliant reflections glares and textures later accomplished by project gotham  and failing spectacularly in the process
this is a game that couldve benefitted tremendously from a few additional months of focused concentration and development in the graphics department but for whatever reason that potential was never realized and were left to deal with yet another visually unimpressive alsorani know its tough to compare a game like gt  to such a wellestablished universallypraised behemoth such as the epic gran turismo series but by positioning itself so directly as a supposed competitor to the industryleader sega leaves me little choice
its like passing around a platter at a huge social gathering where tiny slices of twoweekold baloney sit right alongside flawlessly steamed slices of ham and gorgeous mouthwatering hunks of turkey
when all of the good meat has been picked over the slowermoving guests who find themselves stuck with the smelly discountbrand baloney to snack on will be complaining
loudlythese people are going to far with the shooter games
they have enough already and there ending up to be exactly the same
sure eidos interactive is a great maker for games but havent they made enough shooters for xboxi had heard a lot of great things about this game and was very tempted to buy it but i decided to rent it first
i was right the game isnt that great
the controls are ok but the graphics are ps graphics
hitman  has a good concept but the gameplay itself is very poor
its a first player perspective so if youre one to get dizzy playing first shooter games then this game is not for you
if youre looking for a good game youd be better off with splinter cell
after playing splinter cell no other games compare to itif you were born with  fingers youll love this game
the keyboard controls dont work and the frustration level for this game is off the hook
hitman contracts
maybe at the  cent storehitman seemed like it was going to be lots of fun until it took me  hours out of one day just to try to attempt to beat the first mission
i got it this morning and will be trading it in tomorrow
just for the record i still have not assassinated the don in the first mission
this game will frustrate you to the point of migraine and thats not something id like to endure in my leisure time
i thought video games were supposed to be fun with a bit of a challenge not this one though this is all challenge no fun
dont but it unless you want a headacheevery year around thanksgiving i always get several new games for ps
ive had faith in my magazine i subscribe to and have managed so well in the past at getting awesome games that my bros seem to depend on me to make a good decision
this year i went out on the limb to buy hitman  which i thought would surely make a great game as every review ive seen has been almost perfect
for the first year in my fantabulous game streak i got a terrible gamewhen you start out in hitman you get a basic if not overly simple tutorial on how to play the game
its enough to get you hyped up to play the game but thats about as fun as the game getsalthough the game does have a unique story line an interesting concept and a nice list of weapons it fails to deliver a quick paced get in  get out feel that youd imagine a hitman would have
the game depends far too much on the players patiencefor example once you start in on your first mission you feel like you can take on the world  like the perfect hitman
so you listen to what the game all but tells you and kill and assume the role of a helpless postman
fair enough
but as soon as you walk to the gate and get searched by the guards you get gunned down after they discover your sidearms
okayso this time you try again by leaving your weapons outside
again youre gunned down for letting a guard see you try to enter a room beyond the front door
am i the only one that finds that ridiculous
after replaying the mission to death i decided to run in guns blazing and managed to beat the first missionbeyond just requiring your patience the game seems to ask the impossible at times
for another example some missions require you to find your sniper rifle and then head to a designated sniping point to make a shot
sounds easy enough but just getting to the location is a feat in itself
if guards see you with the rifle they start blazing
if you try to assume the role of a guard and then try to carry a sniper rifle they still start blazing upon seeing you
why does it have to be this hardeven just walking from place to place is annoying
if you run guards will get suspicious and you guessed it shoot you
but if you try to walk to where you need to be it could take hours to play one mission
the sneak mode that you can enter by pressing l may help you to take out one guard but you move so slow that either hell eventually turn around and see you or his friends will come to his aid
all this is on the easiest settingwow
i have to say ive never played a game quite this bad
the only thing this game is good for is helping you realize that life is short and you need to get off your butt and get outsidebeing a spy is one thing but being a hitman is another
a hitman is not a good idea for a video game hero
the game looks like  as well
you kill someone and you have to hide their body so no one sees it
what about that huge blood mess you made on the ground
oh well if anyone sees it theyll just think someone spilled their fruit punch all over the ground and forgot to wipe it up
what a stupid game
give me a breakit is nothing compared to blood money and absolution its just too difficult and too much of a headache when it comes to disguises and etcwhy oh why are all the mortal kombat games the same
ever since the first one the games have repeated themselves over and over and over again
this one is no different with only a few new charachters and old ones that are supposed to be dead
kano was killed by sonya in trilogy yet hes back
kung lao was killed by shao kahn but hes alive and kicking
and kenshi wherever the idea for him came from it wasnt good
how does that guy fight with blindfolds
its simply dumbone more thing about every last mortal kombat game why is novice the level so hard
sure it starts out easy but gets way too hard climaxing on moloch
moloch came out of nowhere and he is a big cheapshot repeating moves over and over kicking your man while hes down etc
the game is impossible to win making it pointlessanother interesting thing is while it says that there is a new fighting engine the only thing that is different is that there are  fighting styles and while it isnt hard to switch styles they are usually all the same
weapon mode is different but very limitedthis is just another game in a series of games that are all the same
save your money and dont buy this clicheacute
the only different thing about this game is the way the charachters look
what a jokeboringthat pretty much says it all about this game
ive been trying to think of at least some redeeming qualities to this game for those who enjoy its premise but sadly there are nonesure you can design rooms and kitchens bars game rooms and meeting rooms but thats about all there is to it
theres none of the snappy humor you get in other sim games and the customers are whiny about every detail from not buying the most expensive sink in the public restrooms to not being on the most expensive chairs in the restauranteven the challenge levels are quite dull
its definately not the game i was expectingthis game sucks big timei have played tons of rpgs and i never put down a game unless it absolutely deserves it and this one certainly doesas many stated already the controls are horrible
you have to like push the up arrow key and then click the left mouse botton while trying to keep yourself in line with the enemies to even stike a blow and god forbid you have more than one enemy after you at a timethe graphics sound and realism is nice but what good is that if you cannot fight your enemies effectivelyhonestly i think any game is better than this garbage dumpsave your cash and pass on this onewhere did all the great ratings come from
did they actually play syberia
i found this game a true yawner  over simplistic and dull
i paid  dollars might as well finish it type of game
it should have been named almost syberia since you never actually get there without buying the sequel
i now need my own wind up key for a train to oblivian since this game drove me madi believe the adventure game developers need to quit wasting their time along with ours and come out with a real adventure game
a game with great graphics great interaction and mind boggling puzzles without the use of hintcheats
ill pay the extra  dollars for itim not sure where all these great reviews came from
i hoped that this game would help wean me off my addiction to the her interactive nancy drew games but it didnt even come close
i thought that moving the character around was clunky and slow and even when i knew there was a key or something that i needed to pick up or interact with it took me forever to maneuver around in order to do so
the only good thing i can say about this game is that the scenery was nice to look at
after playing  times i gave up entirelyi cannot get past the first scene because the main character moves around in real slow motion
its terrible
it takes her a minute to run across the room which is not very big at alli dont know whats wrong with this game but i know its not my computer
there are  different ways to install it and ive tried all   i tried changing the setting and everything
i cannot get it to play right
i would not recommend this gamedespite the highly impressive introductory scene and menu screen dont be deceived
this game is far too conventional and undeniably sloppy
terrible low quality graphics and messy animation lifeless paper dioramalike environments corny cliched looped background noise which fails to evoke a dark haunting atmosphere
the controls can become extremely confusing and frustrating in times of crisis plenty of mutilation blood spillage and cleavage wobbling though
the characters are in many ways stereotyped and dull yet cheaply sexy and appealing in the busty exotic bombshell type way  a cross between elvira and mortal kombats sonya bladethe concept and storyline or lack of is shallow and focuses more on showcasing stereotypical gothic style lacking substance and depthits a shame this game potentially couldve been much better
it certainly doesnt do justice for the xbox either  its still an appealing shortlasting novelty like playing old platformers for nostalgic value
its fun and wasteful but certainly not for those who want a worthwhile challengeit is horibuledo not buy itthe game dident work on my refurbished gamecube system i got from gamestopi love this game and disappointed i couldent even play it in my first review i gave hack only two starsbut after having played a couple more hoursi can honestly say that thats too good of a rating for this terriblebackend stink of a gamei would give it zero stars but thats not an optionhow many horrible things about this game can i mentionlets seeoh yeahyour weapons and armor level up by tossing them into a pondand depending on what the weather is likeit gets weaker or strongersound stupidwait theres moreyou can only use skillsspellsspecial moves if youre wearing certain weapons or armorlevels mean nothingno learning cool spells by leveling up the old fashoined wayall you have to do is sport the right threadswowyou only get a certain amount of exp depending on how many levels the monster is stronger or weaker than youi guess just having a set amount of exp for each monster is just too much to asklets make something even more complex even though you already have to learn  diffrent rules just to play this peice of junkdont be fooled by thinking that this game has two worlds this game always takes place in the online gamethe worldthe real world is just the computer desktop with that annoying musicall you do on the desktop is read pointless emails that tell youboring and if you dont kiss every characters  in the game theyll get mad at you and wont play with youohdarnas for the whole illusion of being on an online virtual worldthats a total jokethe dungeon graphics are very bland and repetitive in fact if it wasnt for the flashy cutscenesthis could easily be put on the playstation ohand the other online players say the same three things over and over including the ones that join your partyand as for the whole storyi just didnt careit doesnt ever make you want to find out what happens nextthe plot isnt gripping at alli mean yeahyoure friend goes into a comabut as to why he didits just abstract and stupidsome ghost chic gets chased by a guy with a pink staff and then he beats your friend with itugh
and youre telling me that bandai wants to drag this out to three more sequals
alsocontrolling the camera manually gets reallyreally oldat first it might seems like a good ideabut youll get a headache constantly switching the camera back and forthit gets tiresome doing this just when walking in a dungeonbut when youve got a group of enemies that always run out of viewlastlythe music was completely indistinct and unnoticeable super mario bros had better music than thisplease rent this game before wasting your hardearned cash on itlike i made the mistake of doingwow
i was thuroughly disappointed with this game
i feel lucky i am going to sell it to a friend for a fraction of what i paid for thisthe story is spotty the graphics are soooo  years ago hehe the gameplay is boring and repetitive and the game is so short that an introductory price to this installment of the whole game should be around 
if you paid full price for this game and the rest in the series i hope you have a fat bank accountwith the lackluster graphics being so cheap looking found and won items being uninteresting or not useful until you buy another game in the series i have to say i want to warn everyone that you do not get what you paid forif you are one of those who are happy with this game good
im not so off to target to buy final fantasy unlimited saga
final fantasy series not thats a real gameblahi found this game to be one of the worst games ive ever played
why why is it so bad
heres an idea get a life
get over the anime and stop voting  because you love the animethis game is way too short
i did plenty of extra dungeons and found this game to be so incomplex
i traded this guy for these knives at the beggining and i never found a better weapon too easyanyways heres the problemscannot change the class of character any weapon you find that arent dual sabers cannot be equipped everthe dungeons are repetitive
they use the same terrains and pots and dead bodies and stufftrading system boring its basically the only interaction you needpeople say the same thing constantlyin total this game has  characters i believe
all together civilians and players
i got the ryu book and it told me
i honestly dont know how boring it can get then  characters
like  of them being playableboring plot your friend goes in a coma some chick is running around and the game doesnt have any plotin order to mooch as much money as possible from the game bandai decided to release four four games
for fifty dollars each
meaning this series requires  bucks to be completed
considered the first one took me  hours basically bandai could of easily fit in more instead they want more and more money
basically this means the game isnt even a full game
its a part of a gamegood thingsthere are so many bad things
dungeons that look the same over and over the same pots dead bodies and destructibles and the same items
boringtheres no good things i can think of its a boring game get over the animei was excited about this game at first but found the game to be a big disappointment
zenasaga is a much better gamemy biggest disappointment was game play
graphics are poor and the dungeons are plain and boring
bandai should take note of the game play in kingdom heartsthe movies however are well donea fiend broke his hack cd
bandai would not replace it for a small fee as other video game companies do
they wanted the full amountthe game idea has great potential however the camera angles our disgusting to say and you spend a lot of time fighting them
the controls are slow and has so many bugs in the game that you would think it was made by amateurs
it saddens me to say since i love tomb raider dont buy it
your just going to get frustrated and fed up with it
my guess is it was a rush job by then judging from the amount of screw up in it
save your money its not worth it
i ended up useing a cheat disk to get round all the screw ups in the gamehii am sorry to say that since tombraider was reworkedand has so many glitchesi cant play iti dont blame amazoncombecause all they do is sell themanother boring tomb raider game complete with the same goofy puzzles and blocky interface
nothing new here just the same old game with better graphicsas for laras big guns hohum
kids looking to see laras barely covered chachas will not be disappointed but is that really worth the cost of this gameafter literally months of waiting tomb raider angel of darkness finally hit the shelves today
after such a long delay it would be fair to say that my expectations were high but not too lofty
i try not to expect a transcendant experience as you are almost always sure to be disappointed
i was patient as are all tomb raider fans im sure and quietly counted the days to its release
after several hours of game play i can safely say that this game is a total catastrophe
from the get go you can get a feel of the horrid controls and camera movement
moving lara around is more of a chore than second nature and the camera angles are just downright annoying
for instance when you want to make just the tiniest of turns the slightest nudge of the left thumb pad causes her entire body to move in the opposite direction in a  degree turn rendering it difficult to do the most mundane and trival action
in addition you end up taking way too much time positioning lara to do any of her limited actions when climbing through a window you have to position her in such a way that the camera doesnt make in the least bit obvious
it simply ends up being irritating just to get lara to walk in a straight line
which leads me to the awful camera angles
the camera angles are so choppy and inexcusable that you most likely will want to quit in the first five minutes
the right thumb pad allows the player to adjust the angle but as you climb shimmy swim or jump the camera will automatically jump to a different angle rendering your manual movement completely useless
an example would be shimmying along a wall in which you experience another wall in the foreground
as you manually turn the camera to whatever angle fits you best the camera system will switch to its own angle to avoid the wall in the foreground
its stupid and as a result it never gives the player a sense of total control
another glaring negative is the game engine
in a few words its awful
in the beginning of the game lara climbs a roof which houses a few crows and shacks littered about
as it rains there is much to see and as a result the game slows down to a mere crawl
remember all those old nintendo and playstation games that would freeze when too much was happening at once
well it happens here and with a system such as ps and a game with such a high standard as tomb raider it is unacceptable at any length
lastly the graphics just arent that hot
theyre pretty standard and the cinemas are tired and uninspired
after hearing the developers rave on and on about how the graphics are going to be groundbreaking you have to wonder if they are still living in in the games defense i had expectations
probably higher than i realize
but this game is crap pure and simple
its shocking to think that way back in november they decided they wanted to polish the game and thus begin the months and months of delays
its even scarier to think how bad it was back in november to warrant such a delay and to deliver this junk after such a long stall
could it be that they wanted to conincide the games release with the launch of the movie
me thinks soive only had the game for one day and im a little bit heart broken
hopefully after a few more plays i can be friends with lara again
but as of now this game just sucksin this day and age are we as gamers really expected to put up with this level of crap
possibly the biggest disappointment in the history of videogames since the sega saturn tomb raider the angel of darkness is the first nextgen outing for the intrepid ms croftstuck in development hell for the best part of  years core and eidos should be very very ashamed of themselves for allowing such a bugfilled poorly thoughtout piece of software onto the shelves much less a game with such a rich and popular reputation to live up toput simply tomb raider the angel of darkness is an absolute dogfirst the graphics just do not cut the mustard
granted the human characters in the tomb raider series were never graphically astounding but here theyre just badly done
textures are pixelated and the frame rate is low
laras animations are smooth and her new costumes are diverting but thats it
characters like bouchard and carvier are not good enough for the ps  being underdetailed and very badly animatedlevel design is very substandard for a tr game
and horror of horrors theres only one tomb the rest of the game is like a horrible cross between metal gear solid and a weak rpg where lara is forced to run about parisian streets and warehouses with no real sense of raiding anythingsecond the control system is an absolute abomination
lara is just not meant to be analog
gone is the intuitive quadstyle floor layout and now jumps and falls are impossible to judge the upshot of which is core have created a game which is insanely easy to beat
lining up the camera controlled by the right analog stick every time you want to make a jump is just annoying and the collision detection is ridiculousthird this is such an easy game to beat
although i should point out youd better get to like the phrases overwrite successful and load successful becuase youll be seeing them a hell of a lot
thanks to the ridiculous control system saving and loading happens far more often than is acceptable and when you do manage to make the jumps and climbs without the control system hampering your every move or the game crashing out happens a lot sound and event glitches abound you wonder what happened to the rest of the levela horrible horrible game that yields no rewards and will cause great distress to fans of the tr series tomb raider the angel of darkness is something we should all forgetcore never let this happen againclunkyalmost impossible controlscamera angles that refuse to correct themselvesdid i mention the horrible controls
try to move in a direction she turns around
and what is with her constantly drawing her gun when you try to jump onto an objectdid i mention the userunfriendly controlsone star deserved because they finally got past the lousy polygon graphics and went with smooth texture mapping and some very nice light sourcing
by the way the light sourcing slows the game down youll see that right away on a rainy rooftopoh and my game went black screen twice in the first half hour and had to be restartedtoo bad i waited so long for this
i personally looked forward to a revisit to tr one and two
such groundbreaking games
hope this game gets better or it goes in the shiny frisbee stackthe first tomb raider was what got me interested in the playstation console
over the years theyve gotten progressively better
then there was a long lapse between the th installment and now
what in the world happened
this title is utterly useless
the controls are terrible
the camera angle is annoying and the levels are very uninspiring
then you have this interaction with other humans that is just useless
you choose certain sentences and that is supposed to alter the game somewhat
all it does is use up precious game space on the disc
utterly useless
the music is beautiful
but these games are known for their music
the graphics are nice when you can see them
the game is way too dark
i know it supposed to be dark as you are in a tomb or cavern but it doesnt have to be that dark to where you cant see certain objects or other nuancesi also judge a game on how i can just sit and play without reading
in this instance i had to consult the manual because the controls werent intuitive
like the autoaim and manual aim
some of the bosses were so lame
at first you think its going to be a challenge
but you try and try and try and you cant beat it
then you do the unthinkable
you consult the web for a walkthrough and when you read it its like how dumb is that
after performing the moves to kill the creature it was really quick and not very satisifyingthey include this lame making of which is supposed to be insight on how the game was designed and what it took
all it did was waste space on the dvd
who cares how you made the game
it didnt give any special insight into the way it was created because the game itself is terrible
overall this game left a very bad taste in my mouth
one that i hope will not resurface in the next installmentmy recommendation is to skip this one
if i could give it less than one star i would but amazon doesnt have that optioni rented this game and to my horror i had to use the right anologue stick to fight thats so uncomfortable
i played it for  mins and took it back to blockbuster and thats the first time ive done that with a rented gamebeing a blade movie fan and a ps geek i was excited about purchasing this game
unfortunatley it fell beneath my gaming expectations
the graphics are quotcartoonquot like the  degree movements start to get annoying if not dizzy and the lack of a map will leave you directionless although their are quotglyphsquot that help occasionally to steer you in the right path but not enough of them
those three thing that i pointed out was enough for me to wish that i had rented it before i purchased itmy friend recomended i get this gameits soooo sweet
its soooo violentthis game is soooo stupid is what i told him
this games story was pretty intresting at first but then it all falls downugh
the graphics are horrible
the combos are uniqueone of em im still trying to learn but i stoped with the gamethe game is pretty violent but as violent as i thought it would bethe game gets pretty boring after awhile and its very dullid give it  stars if i couldbut i cant well if you wanna waster your time with the game be my guestim forcing you not to play the game cause heyi cantwhat els is there to sayso go out and buy it with your own opinionbut for meim gonna have to say this game sucks big timeyouve got to rentits the only way to protectyourself from stupid gamesand this is oneof themthey traded its great gameplay for graphicsthis is very evident with all the pointless unskipable cinemasplus they made the characters shout their battlecries in english instead of japaneseand hearing a guy say yeah
for the th time gets oldi hated the fact that they introduced a concept of combining items to create better onesive never liked this in a game cause you either end up with something really coolwith help from a guide or you end up with something worthlessplus you only win combiningitems after a battleinstead of a powerful weapon or defensive armoraccesoryneedless to say thats all you can steal from enemies as well which completely takes all the fun out of stealingthey also did away with a freeroaming world mapin legaia  it has an arrow that takes you from point a to point b and back and forthno exploring
i felt that was unforgivablethe game also made the enemies alot harder for some reasonthis is very noticable in the second area of the game when you go into the mountainsas for the traditonal raseru type creatures that you could summon by defeating them in battlein legaia i have no idea if they return in this installmentas far as i played i did not find themand that was too long for me esp when you learn them in the very begining of legaia ill keep playing legaia but ill pass on legaia the followup to one of my favorite playstation  rpgs of all time legend of legaia has definitely improved upon every aspect of that game and then some
developed by the team that made wild arms legaia  duel saga begins in a small village called nohl where a young hero named lang  his friends are tossed into a monster infested land where the crystal they protectan infinite ho supplying water crystal is stolen right from under them by a mysterious traveler named avalon
the theft soon plunges the land into a horrible state
bound by duty  a need to protect his village lang sets off into the world to get the crystal back and end the mayhem around the countryside
needless to say its not as cut and dried as you think
avalon is more dangerous than you first expect
and thats where your journey truly beginsthe real star here is the games battle system or better known as the tactical arts system
learned through scrolls arts combinations and storybased events the different techniques can all be chained together to form bigger more powerful attacksthe massive variety of possible combos are almost endless
the battle graphics are absolutely stunning at times with all kinds of pyrotechnic special effects and whatnotlegaia  duel saga shows alot more promise than the first game for sure yet there is one small thing that bothered me about the game
that being the battles or lack thereof
i spent most of my time looking for more battles to face than actually wanting to move along the story
still its a small gripe and didnt take any enjoyment from the game
if the truth be known i guess in a sense i appreciated the fact i could take a breather between battles
still it woulda been nice for them to have upped the ante of the battles just a bitregardless legaia  duel saga is still worth your time if rpgs are your thing
i loved the game  seriously hope we see a third in the series
if not for the ps then the psp insteadnegativesok im half way through this game and i have to say that im not impressed
the plot is weak
the game play is linear
and instead of making it challenging in other ways the designers had a brain stormlets make  of the game in the dark
so you have to switch from flash light to gun and back again
i have died more times in the dark shooting at where i thought the enemy was located then any other way
the story line is so simple a  year old could and might have come up with it
i just wish the programmers would have spent more time on the story and less on deciding what places need to be without lightslastly their joking about the retail price being 
this game is barely playable and i got it as a gift
i would feel seriously shafted if i paid  for this much less 
all in all play doom  and save yourself a bunch of money
if you want fun play the id classic wolfenstien dpositivesgraphics are good not worth the requirements but they are good
the sound is good as well
i also like the fact that you can go onto the martian terrain
the one thing i do not like is the short amount of air that you can have
many people can hold their breath longer then the amount of air you have in an oxygen tankall in all one and  starsupdatefun     starsoverall     starswell below is the review i wrote after a couple of hours of gameplay
as someone else said it starts out slow and then the story develops
later in the game you get couple of new guns and new freaks show upit seems someone did not pay a lot of attention to detail for the weapons
if there are  rounds left and i push in  more rounds to make total of  roundsyou dont need to pump the shotguna round is already in the muzzle
you pump the shotgun if you completely run out of rounds and feed fresh  rounds now you need to pump one into the chamber before you can fireapparentlythis is something simple and should be expected of all fps by now
its little things and attention to detail that make all the difference between a  star and  start fpsmost importantlythis game is the most scary game ever
periodoverall this game is weakthe only good things about this game are the graphicsthe game play is bad same old going through levels and shooting bad guys
same old guns that make sad sounds
you are playing the whole game is darknessbut if you need a flash light you need to switch to flashlight and then switch back to the weapon you were using
what the heck can i not have my flash light taped to my gunand them you are at a top notch research facility weapons research and what not  but there are is no night vision goggles
you fire the same old gunsthat ofcourse look different but are no betterlet me put it this wayhalflife was better than this game except the graphicsand lets not even start comparing it with halo cause this game is not even close to halooh and did i mention this game has to replay value to itdo not buy this game youll just end up wasting your money
wait for halflife and halo to come out i can bet they will be better than this piece of junkthis game is good on its own but its just not doom
if id had stayed true to the game that made them and remade it it would have been  times as scary as the alien looking things in this game
this game feels like if you went to buy a doom game but got alien resurrection with hell
the monsters in this game aside from the zombies are terrible and look like garbage
np pinkies no cacodemons no barons no their not no hellknights no spider demons to aracnatrons no rooms full of monsters to blast down the weapons again look like an alien movie not doom except the chainsaw  the controls are not near as good as classic doom or quake causing the multiplayer to be pretty much useless  id just could never get to that level of greatness again
i mean look how how butchered the quake series is since quake   thankfully id has been stopped and bought out from ruining their game series with garbage like doom 
 quake  quake  quake  quake enemy territory or heretic  ii
doom knee deep in the dead all the way through doom tntplutonium project w doom legacy is all you need the best game ever made with easy new multiplayer bots modes and extras
get the doom collectors bundle instead of this crap way more fun going into actual hell to fight actual demons not poorly designed aliensmutantsafter more doom time under my belt i started to wonder what these guys have been doing for four years making this
were they hand painting and editing each level down to the finest detail
i hope not because its so dark few people are going to care about some nice thing here or a nice thing there
doom is so devoid of quality story and gameplay that it has me wondering  every level shows something doom people copied from another game literally tons of things from various games out there  including painkiller and halolets see some great games and stop being a technology graphics lapdogs for ati and nvidia where you appear like your just trying to impress them and not make games for gamers that are innovative and newdoom is a poor game does nothing new to the genre and bores you to tears with endless waves of the same repasted levels mobs and pathetically weak gunssadthe graphics for doom are the best anywhere right now assuming you have the flashlight turned on so you can see them
most of the time the game is pitch black so you demons can jump out at you
initially the demons were frightening then the simple ai
became boring then it became anoying
the enemy is very predictable except for some of the scripted eventsthe flashlight was annoying because it could not be used along with weapons
you have to lower your weapon everytime you use it
mods are available to fix this but the game seems to be centered on leaving you in almost pitch black to make it frightening
without the default flashlight set up the suprises are minimal
i quickly found the gameplay becoming boring because it is very similar to the original doom
personally i prefer more tactics in my gameplay
halo  and halflive  look better but i look forward to the doom engine being used on future games with better gameplay and aiwhy is this game getting pushed back so far
at least valve had an excuse source code got stolen but activision doesnt have a leg to stand on
i upgraded my pc when i heard about these gamesnow my upgrades are obsolete
the funniest thing is that ubi soft came out of nowhere with farcry and beat valve and activision to the punch
this game better kick massive ass for all of these delaysyou like hallwaysif you can answer yes to that simple question youll love doom   if you like the majority of people think hallways are really not very interesting then youre going to absolutely hate doom   and with good reason  of the game takes place in one long dark hallway
the major differences between levels usually consist of the difference between ramps and flat ground or catwalks versus regular ground
i played about  of the game and i remember walking out to the surface of mars about  times
i remember about  levels that were not hallways
they were short
i am currently on level  out of  and im about ready to put this one away for goodlevel design aside the entire game suffers from being incredibly long and repetitive
the same bad guys the same boring guns the same little hidden areas everything in fact theres only one new gun in the entire game and its ammo is so limited you can hardly use it
every single time you see a dark corner you might as well load up your chainsaw and just start walking forwards
you could do it the proper way i suppose by switching from flashlight to revolver and blasting but why
youll run into the same  zombies and one darkorangedemonguy pick up some random ammo and wonder why you spent so much money on this damn gameoverall one of the most disappointing games ive ever played because the graphics even  years after its release are pretty darn nice
unfortunately thats the only good thing i have to say about itd is looking really nice but i have to agree with vanzagarkingpin  needs the graphic engingei also like to add that kingpin is the best gangster game everwhy doesnt amazon have this on saleif some one knows please post if for methis game has bin delayed so many times its probably not going to come outi loved doom i was an addict to that gamei never played d but i cant wait for disaw the trailer for xbox version and that also shocked mecause the graphics are just as good on the pc versionoh wellhope this game comes out sooni am excited about this game but when i got it today i barely could run on my p  ghz
turns out you have to have a hella fast computer and top of the line video card to run this game
i just dont have that kind of money to upgrade
dont waste your money on this game if you dont have the hardwarei could write a three page review of what all is wrong with this game
its terrible
im amazed at how bad it really is
i played doom    for years when they came out and they are much better than this garbage even without any nostalgia
its hard to find anything at all good to say about it
i guess the graphics are the best thing but even they arent anything all that special
games that came out  years prior were at least on par with it
it has the worst sound of any fps ive ever played by far
the explosions and the sounds of the weapons are absolutely pathetic
its not spooky at all which i thought was supposed to be the big deal about it
bioshock has it beat easily in every aspect
ive played it for about  hours and ive not died yet so im not angry about difficulty or anything but its just so boring listening to voice messages reading in game emails and the combat is terrible just room full of surprises where you cant help but take some damage then heres some health and armor and its on to the next room
the engine even sucks
maneuverability is awful
story is a predictable disaster
i cant stand this weak mess of a game anymore im not curious as to what happens next in the least
not worth  much less so i went surfing for old games i might enjoy playing never expected this to be more expensive now then when it was when released
good luck selling it for  dollars
im sure i can find it in some backwater store locally for a decent price  dollars
yeah the outrageous price annoyed me enough to post this
gl next
ive played it before at a friends it was okay but not  dollars save your money get deadspace  for  dollars on amazon currently much better game and for th the price
short of that ill just wait until doom  becomes one of those free download games in a few more years its already ancienti hate all sims games
listen ppl
the game is just incredibly boring
whoop de doo da im having so much fun watching my sim stare at a tv screen with a still picture on it
o joy
get with it the game is plain bogus okif u wanna play godi suggest another game trust me ive bought  expansion packs and the original sims and im  so u can guess that took away pretty much my whole fortunelike other reviewers said there is always something missing in the simssomething that makes it just not worth your money and no matter how many new objects or pets or downtown areas maxis is gonna come up with there will always be a hole in the sims
and that hole wont ever be filled
why
because it doesnt have an ending
it has absolutely no point whatsoever
i assure u youll be ticked off at the huge amount of memory it takes upto sum it all upits expensive takes up too much space fries ur brain gets annoying has no point and is an overratedive heard so many people rave about the sims over the past couple of years that i finally decided to break down and buy it
this is one of the few times that i have to say i honestly have no idea what the big deal is all aboutthe sim is a people simulator
you create little people plop them down in a house and control thier lives
you buy them clothes furniture make them meet people
just about everything real people do
and thats basically the problemthe thing i that i found least entertaining about the sims is that the whole game revolves around what i call micromanagment
every last little detail you have to scrutinize
though some might find this appealing i found it tedious and boring
it makes me feel less like im playing a game and more like an accountant
the game is also quite slow paced
even if you speed up time the game can move too fast and then you can really lose control over the gamethe gameplay consists of a point click and watch formula for gameplay
you click on an object your sim person will walk to it use it and then go back to being idle
after time if you develop a pattern the sim person will do things on his own but that takes a while
after endlessly pointing and clicking and watching i started to do things like try to set my sim person on fire or not have him go to the bathroom for a while
it is rather fun to torture your sim person but it wears thin after a whilethe graphics are good
the sims speak in some kind of jibberish
and theres lots of sim skins available for download on the internetall in all id have to say that i really dont get this game
maybe its because im more used to games like metal gear solid and socom that i have trouble playing a game of this type
i tend to like having more direct control over the outcome of a game
the sims made me feel like im a spectator
id have to say pick this up only you find a really good deal
otherwise its best to take the  you were going to spend and pick up something else
sorry but this is one i cant recomendthe sims was a bad idea to start off with and the fact that they have draged it on says something about the publishers and the people buying it
i buy this game every single expansion pack and i hate them all
this game is so boring so trite so unimaginative
this game has all the makings of a very bad gameokay i apologize for my earlier review
for some odd reason i was reading reviews on this game and someone said to run it with a keyboard
well i have a forcefeedback steering wheel which worked very poorly on this game very poorly
however when i started using the keyboard this game was as fun as the nfs games of oldthe physics model does stink in my opinion compared to colin mcrae rally  or need for speed porsche unleashed however it is funoldi have every need for speed game ever made from the original need for speed to porsche unleashed
they were all greatthis game is horrible
save your moneyi dont know who coded it but to say that the physics model is bad is a grossssss understatement
the gameplay is beyond bad its a travestyi just tried it and it runs fine it just 
horrible
i just installed it and played it  hour ago
 hour from now it will be uninstalled
oh its so bad i feel bad even selling itim going to write that its bad in my item description just to stop people from buying it
ahhh
runtrust me when i say this game is weak
i dont know what all the  and  star ratings are about for this game
if you are under  maybe this game is interesting
but if you have played moh or cod counter strike raven shieldthen this game will seem very lame and silly to youthe missions are uninspired recycled garbage
the game engine graphics and the game ai are horrible
it is no fun when you are trying to shoot enemy troops and your soldiers just walk right in front of you and stop or just ignore the troops shooting at them from  feet away or when they constantly shoot into a wall because an enemy soldier is hiding behind itfunny how they cannot figure out how to kill an enemy  feet away in the open but they can see through walls
believe me when i say your squad mates will constantly get in your way and block your path 
at the very least  either download a demo or borrow a copy from a friend and test drive this yourself before spending  or more on this garbagenovalogic used to make some decent games back when i had a  dx with a mb hard drive and windows  and even then the game ai was soso
novalogic has not changed a bitskip this and spend your money on the games that are really going to knock your socks offif you happen to own one of the new ati cards the game wont work
so i gave it  star because ea sports should have fixed an issue like this before releasing a gamemy systempentium  running windows xp with an ati  pro
it restarts the system every time i try to run the gamei am disappointed because the game we release only a couple of days ago and the ati cards have been in the market for more than  months already and it just doesnt run with iti cannot comment on anything game specific
i just wanted to warn people out there with new graphic cardsthere are yellow sparks that come out whenever i plug this in an outlet
it also messes up the tv image
the only way to safely use this power adapter is to hook it up to a surge protector it is best to buy the official nintendo brand adapter
it is worth spending the extra few bucks to avoid any electrical firesavoid this dogpile look lots of people like lots of different things
i hate this game
i couldnt get rid of it fast enough
the graphics are crappy the game play is utterly repetitive
did these jokers spend any time designing this product
you will need to be a real diehard fan type of person to enjoy this more than a few minutes
you cannot turn into the flying mode at will
that sucks
and the graphics look like a kids coloring book
get yourself a used copy of mechassault or even battle engine aquila  youll be better offi was a diehard robotech fan as a kid
this game did a lot to ruin that for methe game itself is glitchy for example when a character talks their picture appears on the bottom third of the screen with the text of what they said
sometimes this stays there blocking out both the text and audio of future messages which sometime contain mission objectives and yes you fail the mission if you dot complete them in a timely manner even if you never got the darn message as well as a good portion of the gameplay screenone of the great things about the show were the massive battles with dozens of fighters from each side in a freeforall
in the game its usually you versus the world with maybe one or two allies but only sometimes if youre lucky and youre usually stuck defending a helpless transport that has no sort of evasive ai and will usually fly smack into the middle of an enemy formation even when there are a dozen other lesssuicidal routes to takethere are also invisible boundaries and ceilings in most of the levels and if you hit them while in fighter mode you will come to a screeching halt and automatically go to humanoid mode  a bad prospect when you are being pursued by half a dozen enemies which is more times than not the case
these boundaries sometimes occur in places that dont make any sense  like in a valley linking two playable areasas for the nongameplay elements the original english voice actors were brought back which is nice but they also voice characters just like those that they played
this leads to several confusing audio exchanges where two supposedly unique characters have the same exact voicei went into this game with high expectations and it ended up being one of if not the worst games ive ever played
now when i see it for sale in the discount rack for under three bucks i know exactly whythey dont tell you that the game will not play on a mac even if the disc says its compatiblei was very disappointed in this game
it looked like a fun game where you walk around in a mirror look for keys solve puzzles and maybe use magic but no
instead theres a little hand on the screen that you move around
all you do is click on stuff
i thought you would control mickey
i mean who the heck thought of the stupid hand clicking
this is not how the game should have been
every time you do something it shows like a  minute movie
dont buy this game
save your money for good games like smash bros  resident evil series mario sunshine something goodi cant believe this game was released
normally a game like mickey mouse i would think would be fun at any age
i love disney movies and such
this was painful
it looks like on the box you use mickey to walk around and gather coins
instead you have a hand that you point everywhere
it takes getting used to and thats even questionable
gets boring fast
i cant imagine a child figuring this out
neat story poor execution
i think if you could control mickey without the pointy finger curser itd be a lot betterhis little hmmm every  secs gets old and annoying
its the only thing he really says other then an okay  glad i didnt pay muchseansp time out kids wont like that word you got to be kidding me
anyway anyone who says this game is for children and bought and were not happyis obvius we are talking about mickey mouse game not resident evil so if you dont like silly stupid easy games dont buy this one proximoi bought this game for my  year old triplets
the cursor doesnt always respond well and is very frustrating
the games childrens mode is actually more frustrating than the normal mode as it doesnt have the hint icon
the game occasionally plays a cartoon for up to  minutes that you cannot move past until it finishes which frustrated my kids and myself to no end
the childrens mode sometimes moves automatically and sometimes goes to the same rooms over and over again
the ghost terrifies my kids
we all strongly dislike this game very very frustrating on all levels
a total waste of the only thing good about this game is the texans and the seahawks new uniforms
donavan mcnabb couldnt complete a pass against the cowboys
so embarrasing
there are better things like night games in seasons or the hand warmer but id rather waste my  bucks on a seahawks game
it is pretty much impossible
do not buy nfl fever 
stick with nfl fever i just got these about a month ago and they will not work at all the playstation will not recognize them
i dont know what kind of junk they are making now because i had an old sony that worked for years
too late to send them back now tooi love the spyro series
my favorite was spyro year of the dragon which was perfect
when i heard spyro was gonna be on next gen systems i was excited
boyi did not espect them to butcher the series for mefor one this game was not made by insomniac games who are responsible for making the first  kickass games
that was my first sign this probably wasnt gonna be as good as i want it to be
may contain spoilersstory this entire story is a plot hole
in the nd spyro ripto was the main villian and you kill him at the end
this game gives no explanation on how the hell he returns
i understand the dragonfly plot but riptos return is just crazygraphics even though the graphics looked pretty good i found lots of graphical glitches
for one the game lags alot
before trading my copy i had a glitch where the all the sheep in the game front leg stretched into the sky
i restarted my console but the glitch remained
it wouldnt go away
i also noticed the character designs seemed a little distorted at time
in the honey world theres a graphical glitch where all the honey stops flowing too
damn
did they have any quality assurancegameplay the gameplay works the same as the first  games but new firebreathing techniques are added
i found lots of trouble wuth the bubble breath
i would be chasing a dragonfly and i will clearly be hitting it with the bubblebreath but he wont be caught
that is a huge pain in the ass later on when you have to chase them annoying things on platforms and are faster
once again theres lag
lagging is a huge issue in this game because it happens often and slow gameplay
theres also this funny ass glitch where you swim un the air
in the homeworld just swim to the edge of the water at the beach world entrance
do a headslam and hold square when you do it and start swimming in the air like its water
you can go all over the place with it
this prooves they didnt test the game before releasing it
i also had trouble figuring out what to do after fighting ripto
i got no ending or nothing so i tried collecting everything
it was impossible
i needed one gem and it was in the thieves den
i spent days looking for it even using sparks to help but it never showed up
in the dragon dojo there was a glitch that happens when you try to get the kites for the baby dragons
iif you jump in the right spot around the kite trees the game will make the mistake of thinking you touched the kite and give it to the baby
removing any strategy involved with getting it the normal waysound one of the highlights of spyro games was always the sound and music
the music wasnt too bad
its definately not the usual spyro formula but it wasnt too bad
i notived alot of the music consisted of what sounds to me like indian chants
my favorite tracks were in the thieves den level
the music is kind of boring though
its lacks the intensity and fun of the older games
sadly even the sound has glitches
sometimes the music and sounds skip
in the dragon dojo the sound of the enemies attacking skipped the entire time i was in the level and wouldnt go away until i leftlengh this game is short
i mean short
its only one world
i mean wtf
spyro the dragon had  worlds including a bonus riptos rage had  including an bonus and year of the dragon had  including many extras
this has one world with  or  short levels
from my knowledge theres not even a bonus for getting all coins and dragonflies
you dont get all your money from moneybags the bear theres no extra powers nosatisfying cutscene or any reason to try and complete the levels 
as mention earlier nothing happened when i defeated ripto so i know this because of a lp i saw on youtubein short spyro enter the dragonfly was a huge disappointment
this game could have been good if put in the right hands
i would love to see it remade with all these problems taken care of but given the bad recession this series has had lately i dont see that happening anytime soonwhen i heard a new spyro game was out i happily rented it
when i entered it into my ps i quickly noticed that this game was not made by insomniac my favorite video game creators
i assumed that i may still like this game
well i was  wrong
why
 they have ripto return after you defeated him in the first game
 graphics that make it look like the worlds are made of paper and  the glitches
i then thought the perfect spyro series has been ruined
so instead of buying this awful and stupid game play the ps spyro games
sadly this is the worst game i have ever and always will be other than any ps spyro game
byethis game is one of the worst games that i have ever tried
when my friend went to his hometown for the weekend he lent me the ps lending me gta vc and spyro enter the dragonfly
gta was pretty good i dont see whats so great about it but spyro is just horrible
the other spyro games make it seem like you are free jumping into the air and feel like an actual flying thing
this is so annoying it feels like you are controlling an elephant seriously
he jumps and waddles down onto the ground
the abilities are really stupid and the plot is just plain shtty
i mean come on this game doesnt take more than  hours to completely unlock everything and thats if you want to waste money and time on this crap
its disgusting with jumping limited he can jump like  inches ive attempted to jump up to a platform which makes me fall  of the time then i have to climb  other platforms to get back to it
and when you run into a wall or object it rumbles and gives you a feeling that a slow stupid elephant has ran into a wall and gotten hurt
i would never buy this game you have to unfreeze dragons which look like a bigger fatter even stupider if you can imagine possible spyro that gives you a bunch of coins
the loading times are just horrible
i had to wait like  minutes for the game to get to the title screen then another half hour getting through all the stupid cutscenes and loading times to actually play this game
this game is a complete waste of money and it will be disappointing for all spyros fansbottom line if you buy this game you will definately be disappointed if u like it get it but im warning you the game gets very annoying in all aspects and now that ive tried it out there is no way i am ever getting thisat first i thought this game might be cool  but it was a huge dissapointment first off it was to short second its not fun its really boring and its really slow while loading do not buy this get year of the dragon insted worst spyro game ever createdive said it before and ill say it again universal vivendi ruined this series for me
this game is better than the one i have for the wii but not by much
theres only one world to explore and like a previous reviewer said the level portals arent named so that is a bit of a pain
yes you do have to collect something other than gems in this one as in previous spyro titles but mine froze quite a bit probably got one of the earlier copies released and the load time was annoying
im used to the ps games taking time to load but this one took forever
i couldve gone and made a five course meal in the time it took
okay so im exaggerating but as i recall the first  spyro titles had quicker load times
either way even though its been almost six years since i bought this game im still disappointed with itthis spyro game had everyone excited but when it finally came out it sucked
the game looks great and it has new features but that doesnt make up for all the problems with it
its gameplay is slow and the storyline is for a  year old
with this game spyro lost all his attitude
in my point of view the developers didnt even try on this oneit it not worth a pennyim a huge spyro fan when it came in the mail of course i was excited but that quickly changedthere are only  levels
it take sooo long to load
it loads the loading
i cant play it without finding a glitch
one time i ran past a seagull in the beach level and the sound of it chirping stuck then the sound of underwater stuck on top of that and it sounded like nothing ive ever heard before
i had to shut it off because it wouldnt stop i even reset itthe characters look dumb like there is no bone in their body or brain in their skull
if they had one they look too jello like and the voices dont match their mouthwhen you attack an enemy you cant tell that you made s successful hit till it dissapears
in the old games the controller would jump and you would hear and see the impact of spyros head so you know you hit him
and when you charge a sheep it burns into lamb chops sorry i though that only happend with fire
they ruined the sheep they are all fat and slow instead of quick and springyover all the only thing that i found nice in the game was the graphics it is beautifulwithout insomniac spyro will never be the samei am a big spyro fan and i bought this right when it came out and was bummed out
i seriously wouldnt recommend this game
if youve never played any spyro games id recommend the st  they are really awesome  but this ps game is boring and the graphics pretty much suck
it gets me dizzy just playing it bc the camera shakes at times
if you still want to play this game in my opinion you should probably rent itquotmetal gear solid  is more sneaky than splinter cell
splinter cell is just about the graphics
in metal gear solid  you get to sit through three hours of cutscenes and try to comprehend the screwed up storyline they throw in your face
when you get to play youll see how short the game really is how idiotic the bosses are and how better it is than splinter cellquot this is what i usually hear from people who dont like splinter cell
this could have been a good game if they didnt try to make a movie out of it but sadly thats exactly what they did
the storyline is terrible
the conversations you have to listen to are sappy and boring
there didnt really need to be a character change in the game
you switch from solid snake to ravenwhy
i would be better off playing as solid snake but you have to switch for some reason
you fight most of the bosses in the nd portion while playing as raven and the bosses are pathetic
theres a stormlike boss with a big lightning gun a vampire with swords who happens to be in love with the boss with the lightning gun a fat bomb carrying boss and a boss who reminds me of dr octopus
there is a corny plot for each of them and i dont want to sit through them again because theyre so stupid
the games plot gets more bizzare as it goes on
im not going to expain what they are because its too much
the last thing im going to say is splinter cell is  times better
the graphics are good the storyline is more realistic and it actually feels like a stealth game
i get mad when people yell at me for not liking metal gear solid  i read that even the guy who owns konami thinks metal gear solid  is stupid and that the original is better which is probably true
go cry now msg fansthis game sucks
i played it with my dad about  years ago and we had to sit through the flippin tutorial for like  hours
we quit after a half an hour and we never played it again
the main problems are its nothing like yugioh
you have to sit through the tutorial for  hours
the controls dont make any sense
its more like dungeon dice monstersdont buy this at allif you are going to go out and buy a yu gi oh game this sohlud be the last one on your list
it is terrible bad storyline dueling system is horrible and youll get tired of it after  minutes
yu gi oh forbidden memories on the other hand never gets old
you will enjoy that game much more than this oneyugioh
duelists of the roses should have been great
the series is amazingly popular and the card game can be quite fun
somehow konami managed to ruin a game despite the oddsfirst this ps game takes the world of yugioh
and transplants it into the middle ages with the war of the roses
the houses of lancaster and york are vying for the throne of england and only cards can settle itok i dont mind that
i love english history and i also enjoy card games
so into the tutorial we head
while they go over every step in the game its one gigantically long rush of about  hour or more
and instead of letting you practice the commands and repeat them its a slideshowlike sequence where you just keep hitting x  x  x you really need a walkthrough to print out to have it all available and ignore their slideshowfinally you get to the game
you choose a default deck and take it into battle as you try to move across england
problem   theres no practice
you go from that slideshow right into a nasty battle that many find difficult to win
you are often dealt awful cards that even skilled players find it hard to win with
its hard to learn the game when your monsters are stomped easily left and rightat least you might have pretty things to look at and listen to while you die right
wrong
the graphics for the cards are awful
you can barely tell what element something is or anything else
even the important numbers are hard to decipher
and for sound you get the same droning loop of synth music again and againcardplay is new and unusual with monsters moving across the board and facing each other on different terrain types
its sort of interesting but can be extremely frustrating especially for new players
you do get a semicool d quick battle when the cards meet but even that is on a boring background and lasts maybe  secondsperhaps worth it for the incrediblydedicated yugioh
fan but the rest of us should demand something better next time
this game is an embarassment given the quality of ps games coming out todaywhat a snoozefest
whenever a game review includes fun for the whole family that is always a good warning sign
most of these blockbustermovie based games are usually pretty lame but this one is actually playable this is probably why people are gushing all over it
it does not mean that it is good no way
harry potter is just a well polished slapped together cashin quick game
parents will be forced to buy it so it will automatically generate alot of cash
it really doesnt need minefirstly i have the pc version
the ps bit on the description has thrown me a bitthat aside i loved simcity  played it for hours
heard about sc got it unwrapped it andwell it looks nice
has a bundle of extras that  didnt have
so i dived in to the rich graphics and started building my city
crashfrozen computer
hmm
the readmes said ensure you have the latest drivers for your soundcards graphics cards etc so off i went spent about  weeks upgrading drivers playing the game for a bit watching it crash trying another driver watching it crashso i contacted the admitedly very responsive ea tech support via email
we spent about a week trying different things to a point where it worked ok in very slow software mode
at this point ea told me how i could get a refundnot impressedall my computer specs exceed those printed on the case
im also a bit of a pc geek so following the readme instructions tech support advice and upgrading drivers wasnt a problem
so why am i left with a very nice looking but unstable gamei have now got it working with medium detail settings rather than the full glory i should be able to see but after several weeks of constant crashing i cant face playing it again
i fear the next crash
yes i have tried eas first issued patch for sc
no it doesnt helpthis game wasnt good at all
maybe if it wouldnt crash so much i would have loved it
did they put it out too early or something
this game truly isnt good
or fun
okay i play the regular sims like hdhotdate and sssuperstar and so on and maybe im just comparing them
but i didnt like simcity  i thought it would be great
and my mom and dad wasted  on this stupid game
and we couldnt get a refund
what a waste of money
i wouldnt risk buying this game
it kept freezing
and i got bored with it right when we just got the game
so youll get bored easily
very easily
boringif you buy this game please be warned that it is very badif you think this game will offer you the action packed thrills of gta or anything along that line please reconsider
i play a lot of games and i know video gamesi loved playing sim city  unlimited and couldnt wait for sim city  but as with the sims ea has made it so complicated that it was not fun at all
i have played all the sim games and am trully disappointed that they have taken the fun out of the gamesthis game was released about  and developed over the  years prior to that
it also is completely unsupported by its owners ea which bought it from maxisand has been for pushing a decade it is a cash cow only
it is out of its element on todays machines
the game is singlethreaded and has its own scheduler
it is not welladapted to a multitasking environment
it also can be rather snarky in getting along with some graphics cards
this means it has some real quirks and issues such as occasional failures to save or lost cities or crash to desktop ctds
on the other hand these can be countered by frequent saves and backups along with certain habits in the play methodologyif one does this this game has some real appeal to many peoplethe game was released as a core game simcity  sc and an expansion rush hour rh which in combination was dubbed simcity  deluxe scd
the rushhour expansion used to be available seperately but is quite scarce and or very expensive nowsimcity  rush hour expansion packthis particular release is only sc and frankly is essentially unusable by itself as much of the elements of the game and much of the expanded customizable hooks especially the networks part that part which handles the commuting and travel mechanics allowing a wide array of transportation simulations
to be really useful you must imo have the full set available in several forms see below
my low rating is for this version only
i really quite like the game itself in its full properlyregistered formthere also is a very active community especially in the usa germany and japan and lessor followings in many other countries
this group is very community oriented and supportive
maxis was clever to embed into the game stubs which support a wide array of end user customization content and this community generates active interest which carries the game well beyond its years
this group congregates on a half dozen or so support sites all free which are accessable by all
id estimate there are probably about a half million fairly active players worldwidethe game is not played versus other players other than in comparing accomplishments or progress or sharing custom content
it is a strategy game based on figuring out the operation and biases of the game and designing your city designs to best overcome and conform to these needs
there isnt an answer but rather a broad array of approaches that work to varying degrees based on what you are trying to achieve dense ghettos idylic contryside sleepy towns etc a single regional development can easily take weeks to months of off and on attention to work through these issues
if these kinds of things appeal to you this may be the game for you just not in this versionthe game uses a copy protection scheme that requires the cd to be in the machine to play or in the downloadable amazon or steam versions a running game support program that validates the game some folk are rather put off by thisin summary though this is still the core of the game dont buy this version buy the full setsimcity  deluxe editionor the downloadable versionsimcity  deluxe edition download also available via steam or as a subset of a box set with other games includedthe simcity boxi have heard there are support problems with the patches on the box set but dont  have personal experience with it
the downloadable versions should be prepatchedbe very cautious buying a used version from ebay etc as you must have the registration membership in the eamaxis web site to update the game with its patches only buy if you can get this membership with its user name and password included or certification that the serial number has never been registered many people have been burned on this matter even buying new versions is risky as many are just pirate copies of the game and the registration number will report already in use even though you bought it as new
get the seller to guarantee the version is registerablesorry to be so longwinded but i felt most of this needed to be touched upon
in whatever form you buy it i recommend immediately taking a look at web sites which have active communities interested in the game
you can happily invest many hundreds of interesting hours in the game if youre willing to invest the timei enjoyed the simcity games and felt ripped off with simcity  as it was basically the same package as the previous simcity
if you love the basic city building concepts of the simcity games simcity  is the exact same thing
at least they changed the graphics for this one and gave it an updated look for todays video cards but if you look at screenshots for simcity  youll see that it has the same rules building types etc
if youd like to play simcity again with an updated graphics engine go for this title but if youve been simcitied out save your money and buy another title
sims anything sells like hotcakes and ea realizes this
its another attempt to cash in on the sim namewhy not to buygame is very slowafter playing for a while the game actually freezesbuggy as all get outtook out many great features in previous gamesthe graphics arent better
you have to turn all the graphics options down completely in order to get the game to run on your computermaxisea bombed this one dont buy itoh god how i hate this gamewhats most important in this game the combos you have to make and it never works
maybe its because im lefthanded and i do not have enough control power and speed in my right hand fingers but i suspect it has to do with gamecubes controller with this particular game
the gamecube controller i actually like very much there isnt a single game that gives me problems for being a lefthanded gamer the cstick for instance an annoyance for many people  i handle pretty wellthis game did ruin my good mood completelynot only do you have to push the right combinations but it also has to be done in a certain fashion rhythm and timing must be  percent accurate or else you fail and fail over and over againgood lord what a terrible waste of time this game iswell obviously it isnt any fun for me but i can imagine that with a different controller ps ii or xbox itll be more comfortable
still any game that depends heavily not to say completely on swift and acrobatic fingerworks suck big timethis game is so horrible
the graphics are bad the fighters are boring and i think this game doesnt have fatalitiestrying to target the dragons in this game was increadibly frustrating
could not get past the dragons in level three
complete garbage no fun what so ever
would not even recommend renting this gameim so glad i rented this game instead of buying it
animal crossing is cute but completely pointless
its a little like quotthe simsquot in that you have a character and a house in a virtual world but unlike quotthe simsquot there are no relationships and its not even much fun decorating the house its only one tiny roomi got bored after about  minutes i could tell the game was going to be nothing more than running repetitive errands for the residents of the little towni truly dont understand why anyone likes this kind of game
this is just as bad as quotthe sims onlinequot another boring pointless realtime gamewhat do i sayno point nothing fun to doexcept pick weeds and the music drives me crazydont get it not worth itdont even borrow it from a friend
personally you couldnt pay me to play this gameunless youre you willing to paythen well talki hoped that this game was fun seeing on all the reviews and stuff but its not
this game needs like this expansion to make it moresupposedly fun dont buy iti put this game in my game cube for about ten minutes and had to remove it
my friend came over and wanted to see why i said it was like torture to play that game and he realized it as i stared away from the screen while it was being played
i considered snapping this game in two and flushing it down my toilet but that might be too good for it
this game is much worse than games that are so boring or easy that you sleep while you play through them
it is indeed torturous because of the noises that the animals make while they talk so that you cannot sleep through the game while you play it
the answer to this problem is simply do not play it
fortunately i bought it used and it sits in my collection but is not played
i bought it because so many critics gave it excellent reviews but the critics can and quite often are wrong about games
i may give it another chance someday but not anytime soon
hey nintendo i have a great idea for a spinoff of this game
the spinoff would be called the incredible hulk ultimate destruction of animal crossing in which the hulk has to go around and smash the animals of animal crossing and their surroundings
and the hulk would have all the incentive he needs as soon as he would see and hear the annoying talking of these animals and their annoying behaviors
hulk smash good hulk
nintendo at least consider a spinoff called batman vengeance on animal crossing in which batman uses all his bat weaponsarsenalutilities and his stealth abilities to take vengeance on the animals of animal crossing
on a positive note for animal crossing it might be potentially liked by children that like to play house but it would probably be better for children to play house the oldfashioned way with their friendsyeahwell dont get on here expecting a board walkused to winningbut not on this onei feel like i have to hit the pit more often then the computereven when i hit the pit at the same time as the computerbs strikesmy car is running short on gasgo figure when im rarely in first placedont buy thunder
its not a bad game just that you can better spend your money on nascar heat dirt to daytona
thunder only offers stock car racing whereas heat offers  games in  dirtgokartmodifiedstruckcar and therefore heat offers a lot more variety and fun
buy nascar heat dirt to daytona insteadi feel robbed just renting it
this game is miserable in so many ways i dont know where to begin
as the race started the first thing i noticed was the frame rate is about  frames per secondthe average is  a gooddecent game is  frames per second
heck most racer games can generate  fps
there is no excuse for this horrible frame rate
it looks more like pictures flashing in front of the screen
its so choppy that i never felt like i was racing just watching a bad cartoon
the second thing i noticed was the graphics are pitiful
this game is not worthy to be on the xbox the xbox is capable of much more and i expect itcheap chinese pos dont buy this knock off the thumb sticks squeak loudly and it weighs oz less then the real one
i tore this apart after it broke in  weeks and nothing was salvageable
i tossed this in the fire pit
dont waste your money on crap that is probably full of lead
screw you chinathe official ps controller is what you need in case the one that came with the syetem breaks  its a good idea to have  controllers for one person just in case when i bought the item  it said that it was like new  when the controller to me the entire right side doesnt work
and there is a crack in the right side as wellthe movie was bad but the game is much much worse
i cant believe this is even going to be released what an embarassment to the company
oh my word ive never played such a awful game in my meaningless existenceplease save your money and do not buy this game
if you want a good lotr game buy the two towers for any platform
first off i had problems with sound i have sb live plat  so if it doesnt work well for sound blaster what does it work well for
the graphics are okay but being as how the gameplay is lame and the quests you get are lame do not buy this
they took a good story and went off in the wrong direction
i ended up returning this after giving it a decent chance even with the sound problemsthis was a gift and i finally got around to installing it
or i should say tried
i tried to run it on a laptop and  computers but the game will not start
just a black screenthe one thing to be aware of is the fact that your monitor card has to be texture and lighting compliant
my nvidia quardo fx  from some reason will not workalso note that black isle is dead and vivendi has a not that they will no longer support this gamedo not buy itif i ever get it running i will come back and change this reviewthis game is incredibly shallow and boring
by the time they had me looking for mushrooms i turned the game off and used the disk as a frisbee
save your money and get two towers insteadreviewed on a ghz piii with ati rage pro  m ramthis is a joke right
were not seriously expected to pay for this program which would have been considered unimpressive five years ago
the graphics are mundane the character movement is crude and awkward it doesnt play fullscreen its always in a window
the cut scenes are played by rd rate amateur hacks with videoaudio synchronization like a dubbed martialarts movie
the third person view constantly blocks the objects your looking for and you cant change the view to be more overheadthe graphics are so crude the program should run smoothly on a mhz box but its really sluggish on my ghz
whats it doing with all the cpu time
looking for extraterrestrial intelligence
if tolkein were alive this dross wouldnt bear the name of the lord of the ringsi expect more from vivendi  much morebeware this program like many other recent games will only run on an account that has administrator privileges on windows xp or  that means that in most common home settings school settings or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game
if you have configured your home pc for example so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them limited accounts a recommended best practice you should certainly be following your kids will not be able to play this game
similarly if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to userlevel access then only the administrators will be able to play the gamenote that although i agree with the general consensus that age of mythology is a good game my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box it is not and thus i cannot give this product more than a single star because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentationwhile i understand that franchise games tend to lean on their franchise as a crutch even despite the cutscenes from the movie this game is virtually devoid of story
the fact that you cant skip the poorlydone game cinematics doesnt help the poor presentation and while the series is supposed to be grand this ends up walk forward and kill things
the fact that the fellowship will follow and help sometimes but not others feels untrue to the movies and bookstory im not the kind of person to demand photorealism or exact replication  i still enjoy playingchrono cross but this game was truly unimpressive
its not gasp its dong zhuo
ugly but its disappointinggraphics at least the sound effects do all the right stealing
the movies sound pretty good and the game sounds fair
music and ingame soundeffect volume can be altered independently but the ambiance lacks a certain polish that i expected from the movies the game is based offsound while the music is indeed stolen from the movies what shows in the game is toned down background material
whilethe lord of the rings the third agemay not have been the most innovative rpg at least it sounded and looked nice throughoutmusic this is repetitive action requiring complex combos for unimpressivelooking moves along a narrow path that offers none of the free exploration of the wide impressive lands of the movies
your ability to upgrade your character is based on how skilled lucky you are in the level because you cant replay and this means that if you have a bad run your only option is to reset the game and load all over again
none of the skills really seem to change gameplay that much as an rpg this game falls flat on its face and as a hackandslash it makesdynasty warriors look great its not
the local coop consists of the middle six levels where a friend can follow you along the narrow short levels but isnt nearly as easy to get into as good coop games where you can generally have a friend help from the startgameplay you dont even get the option to play coop until after youve already spent at least a halfhour beating the first two levels and then you have to save and quit to the main menu to discover that levels cant be repeated
what
you didnt have a lucky run with gimli and youre too short for that one minimally helpful upgrade
start all over
the fact that the first two levels can only be played with one fixed character and all but one of the rest are locked to aragorn legolas and gimli dont help
there are extras you automatically unlock by progressing through the missions but unlike the third age theres little good organization or sense of true satisfactionreplayability with the large number of fivestar reviews i had high expectations and perhaps that was part of the problem
everything it tries to do has already been done better elsewhere and while im not going to say this game was horrible it was short and lackluster  barring getting stuck on a level you can finish in one sitting of just a few hours though boring load times and unskippable cutscenes dont help
if you want a good lord of the rings rpgthe lord of the rings the third ageis superb compared to this
if you want hackandslash look for a different franchise
i wouldnt even suggest a rental but do that before you consider buying even for bargainbin pricesoverall the main problem i have with this game is the stupid camera
im not generally a big fan of the rd person games unless theyre sidescrollers or topdown esp
when youre expected to aim at something but this one really stinks it up because the camera angle is not consistent since theyre trying to make it look cinematic
if you run back a little to regroup eg
in fangorn forest due to artistic changes in camera angle you may find yourself surrounded and unable to even see the character youre controlling
this game was made to be looked at not played
if you want to fight and use cool combos try tekken tag
if you want to shoot at things go with timesplitters  silent scope or a bond game
if you want a medieval fantasy fighting game try dark alliance
if you want to watch a movie watch a moviewat were they thinking when they made this game i would have more fun watching the clothes in a laundry machine go up and downi like the roleplaying games and thought that this would be fun i was wrong
the sims get tired easily and they seem to always need to go to the bathroom
this game is quite boringthe sims games are just crap
they are so boring
all you do is control peoples lives
all they do is go to the bathroom sleep and stand in one spot for hours
i cant see why people like this game
save your money and buy another game
it took me  minutes to get used to the controls and by then i wanted to trow it out
i never liked the sims but i thought this sims would be a ok game
i was wrong
the grafics are good but that doesnt make the game funnerfirst of all i tried this game and i do not think this is a great one to get
unless this game includes the sims with the original  career jobs living large with  additional careers unleashed with culinary education circus animal care and fashion and hot date as a great suggestion
other than that stick to the complete pc collectionpeople will say whatever companies want them to but not me
what the companies dont want you to hear about splinter cell is its horrible story line its lack of options and the atari style graphics that fill this game
i am a computer gamer i play more games than anyone and i know games better
trust mei originall said that this game was an excellent game but after playing the xbox version and the playstation  demo i now know that this computer version is the gayest thing that can ever happen to the personal computer
i have to say that the only good thing about this game is that it is challenging but in between the game jumping around with you graphics settings and the fact that the controls are kind of messed up this is in actual fact a terrible game for the computer because of the fact that it probably wont run as well as you want it toim sick of mario party titles
the first one was fun the second one was weak but still good and from there on the series hit rock bottom and dragged its way across it
it may entertain someone whos never played the series but everyone else will be dead sick of it
mario party should have stayed mario party and there shouldnt have been any sequels
obviously nintendos in this franchise for the money and only the moneythis game was addictive to me for a while but it got real old fast
the storyline is stupid i mean really who wants to work their back off trying to get presents for your birthday
also the game way too easy and the game is a repeat of mario party   no new character and character voices its once again just a bunch of annoying squeaking animals
in addition there are only  boards in total and they are so plain
this game seriously needs to take advantage of the gamecube features
apparently hudson and nintendo are still living in the nintendo  era
the only thing ok about the game is the graphics
beside that its a waste of money
dont get it i warn you youll want your money back very soon after purchase
you can also see my review on mario party  if you visit that pagei liked stronghold  and stronghold legends was ok but this game is just so outdated and the graphics stank so much i could only play it twice before i never looked at it againi didnt care for the first cameron files so i didnt expect much from this the second one  and i was right
it is so linear that its boring and illogical you cant leave the hotel without first finding certain items in your own room  what sense does that make
plus the movement is tedious and repetitive
you end up going around in circles trying to figure out what the game wants you to do next not what makes any sensei managed about one hours game time before i uninstalled it
well thats an hour of my life ill never get backon the plus side it installed  and uninstalled  without a glitch
big dealim so frustrated i dont know where to begin
i bought half life  expecting an outstanding gaming experience
what i got was hours of frustration trying to figure out how to make it boot up
in all my years of gaming i simply needed to doubleclick the desktop icon and away i went
but some genius there at valve decided to make the most convoluted invasive and frustrating interface ever conceived in the world of gaming
can i simply click the half life  icon for the game i paid for and play
nooooooo
i have to go through some online nonsense called steam
one day i click the icon and i have the option to play in offline mode the next day i cant play because steam wont let me
what were these people thinking
i have uninstalled the game and have loaded up an old copy of gta vice citynow theres a gamesincerely frustratedka stonekernville cato run halflife you have to install an interface and create an account with an online service called steam even if all you want to do is play offline
an internet connection is required  as it says on the box  not for gameplay but for registrationunfortunately the game ships with no documentation except a cheat sheet of ingame commands
the steam interface doesnt have any online or context sensitive help
its operation is not intuitive and it doesnt appear to work very wellim sure halflife is spectacular  according to all reviews  but i havent been playing halflife
for the last  hours ive been playing steam which is much less funyou might say that the rating of one star should not be for halflife but unfortunately valve made the decision to go with steam and therefore gets full credit for a frustrating experience and perhaps a complete waste of  
depends on whether i can get this to work before i get tired of playing steam offline modefive stars for the game fun factor if you can eventually get it loaded and bugless but unfortunately really deserves the one star overall because of the horrible horrible installation requirements and because of many awful installation specific bugs that grossly interfere with game playthe game itself truly is excellent with the graphics game play controls all setting new standards
i personally dont like the plot and setting as much as the first half life and find it unnecessarily dark and depressing and i thought the ending was a little abrupt and unsatisfying but in comparison with doom  it is really a fun romp
truly a great gameas to the really bad part
i am a computer programmer and have half a dozen assorted computers
i spent  hours trying to get a working install on my new xps with pci express buss and mb ati ultra video board
the steam on line install system is a mess
first it insists on installing steam then an update over one hour on dial up then decrypting another hour plus
then registering and the list goes on
then when its done it doesnt work
i get a disk not installed message
so ok go to steam and planet half life web site and look at bug faqs i find one that tells me if i get this message i need to uninstall my sonic dvd driver and reinstall half life  i dont really want to remove my sonic driver but i do and way and spend another four hours reinstalling half life
this time up comes the starting half life  message but half life  never comes up either on or off line
so i go back and look at the rest of the faqs all  of them none of which cover my problem
i try one more remove and reinstall of half life  four more hours
same result
finally give up and go and install it on my old dell inspiron lap top four more hours
works perfectly play game in standard mode and works perfectly
but wait theres more
on a hunch i try a remove and reinstall one more time on my xps system four more hours this time removing steam as well as half life  first and it works fine and i play it through on hard mode and it is hard
youd think id be done now but no theres more
i though id play the redone half life source through on hard mode since id only originally done it in standard mode and it should have been all installed when i installed half life  right wrong  three more hours installing half life source and it works well sort of
each time you start the game it works fine for the first ten or fifteen minutes then it starts taking little fifteen second breaks picture and sound freeze every minute or two
after another ten minutes or so the breaks stretch to  seconds and after another ten or fifteen minutes they stretch to  seconds eventually reach more time frozen than playing within an hour of starting each time
i sort of recall from the faqs that there is a fix dealing with this that is accomplished by disabling the advanced stereo features of your sound card and you guessed it reloading all of half life  and source from scratch again but some how that wasnt too appealing to me any more so i played it through in hard mode as it was freezes and all
half life source is still low poly but appears to be substantially improved over the original half life and is really quite hard in hard modelast level half life source strategy
for the nihilanth go into the level with your rocket launcher armed and take out the  crystals on the wall before you are dumped to the ground then immediately run behind the spiky rock nearest the wall and snipe at fatheads head and brain till he dies
in hard mode getting hit with the white balls is equivalent to instant death and the green ball sends you to a really unfriendly space avoid them both at all costs
skip the jump onto the ledge thing in this versionthe games are both great but valve has made such an utter hash of the installation procedure and of leaving in totally unacceptable bugs that they should be boiled in oil or stuck in with their own nihilanth
they have made this mess because of getting their code ripped off last year and are making their paying customers now pay for their own stupidity then
i would really like to see a half life  but at this point i would really prefer to see valve go broke insteada final thought is skip the limited edition it is truly not worth it
the supplied prima guide is a joke only covering the entry to the game and is really an add for prima guides i wouldnt use one anyway and the supplied shirt is uninteresting in the extreme
the dvd rom version is the only thing of value that is supplied and it isnt worth thirty bucks more than the cd versionthe game is top notchno complaints there
my gripe is dealing with steam
yeah it took a long time to download several hours and register with steam
all was fine for many months until i foolishly let steam update its files while i tried to start the game while still connected to the internet i just do single player no multi for me
the steam update which i suspect i didnt have to have totally screwed up my game
it wont let me play now
i cant access the game at all
ive tried a myriad a way to figure out this puzzle
be cautious of this game unless you are a total geekmeister
i do ok but im no geekmeister
after numerous emails and faq searches with steam i gave up and havent played since my ability to do so was stolen by steamwhich really means a steaming pile of pooi just got the game and to my surprise even though its a single player game i have to be connected to the net to play it 
not only that but the game converts all your old valve games to the new technology so you also cant play them anymore unless youre connectednow i dont know which website this is but can you imagine the scene
you and  million kids all wanna play this game on saturday morning
what do you think the chances are
particularly if you have a dialupim returning the game unplayed
no way am i paying  for a game and dont really own it
very stiff rental fee
ill buy no more valvesteam productsthough i never originally purchased a half life game now i definitely wont
you people on here are pathetic
only fanboys of valve would tollerate whatever the company does
praise the company
your blood is boiling as you read this
goood
i hope so
i like people mad at me
because instead of knocking this review you should be knocking the aa h at valve and steam
if your not then i hope you rupture a splean and get a stroke from this review
you are a waist of human tissue and material that could be used to make other babies
when the people at cgw who are rude in general start pansying up to the valve people like newel then something is indeed wrong
jeff green can insult his costumers but we know he wouldnt dare knock the allmightyvalve
what a woosie
let me explain something to you pc layman types
windows xp has an activation process  okay i dont like it but you only do it once
half life half life ii and all other accompying games require you to be online not only during activation but when playing the gamesingle included
you have to continually prove you own the game
how hitler is that
neverwinter nights is trying this with thier fan based mods but they have also lost a customer as i only play the trilogy and dont buy into mods that require connection all the time when it is unnessasary
also
weather you  like it or not your credit card is charged without prior knowledge and once you activate steam they can charge youlegally for anything at anytime
so you had best know what your getting into before purchasing the game whether boxed or downloaded its the same
you should be spanked for saying kudos to such a greed bunch of paranoid overly protective jerks like valve and thier partners
thats the news and i am outta hereyou must register online before you can even play offlinethis is ludicrousthis is also a very disturbing trend for a game  if you buy this one you can expect to see more games use a similar schemewhat happens once you uninstall the game and it is no longer even supported years doen the road
you are out of luck
they could just as easily decide to stop supporting it once the next version is out and force you to upgradestop the madness now before it gets out of hand or we will all come to regret it and pc gaming will be choked out of existencei found the first half life and the following two expansion packs interesting to play but the degree of violence rampant throughout the series was a constant hamper to their overall enjoyment
in many portions the action went beyond realistic into ridiculously gruesome
the game would have been just as good without all the extra blood and guts
the storyline action adventure and game engine were what made the original half life an exceptional gaming experience not the extreme violencesad to say half life  picks up where the original version left on and dramatically pumps up the level of objectionable content
to be quite honest im surprised no one else here has picked up on this
the content is pure trash
instead of thriving on level design or even story the game relies heavily on the shock value of gruesome violence
so severe is the level of such content that you have to wonder if the designers intentionally crafted it to be purely sadistic
lets be realistic about this folks
overthetop violence is not cool
its not innovative
its not for mature audience only
its time we realized mature people dont go in for such filthgranted the half life  physics engine is incredibly well designed but that alone is hardly reason to plunk down  for the game
a few months down the road all firstperson style games will have the same advancements and many of these wont contain such sordid content
personally ill be investing my money in games that provide great graphics challenge and gripping storylines but do not contain such objectionable content
look around
there are plenty of such games available
why waste your money on pure filthi hate to think what kind of damage this game is doing to impressionable young kids who are undoubtedly its biggest market right now
and its affect is not reserved just for children
no adult human being with an intelligence quotient above room temperature could continually expose him or herself to such content without being negatively affected
it might not manifest itself in actual violence but the influence on our minds and souls will still be there
sure we all know its fake but if we continually allow sordid images into our minds we will inevitably be desensitized to them altogether
we will find it more and more difficult to practice such traits as compassion and selfdiscipline in real lifethe safest bet avoid this game altogether
there are countless other titles including those in the firstperson shooter genre that provide the same benefits as half life 
its about time we told the game industry enough is enough
use your money wisely and avoid this trashif you buy this used you will have to send the cd and all packaging intact back to valve for replacement due to cd key being registered to only one user
it will cost  and take  to  weeksthe instructions at valve say that if you buy it used then all the packaging has to be sent back
how often do you receive all the original packaging when you buy somethingi just bought a used copy and found that valves registration system was a ripoff
rather than dump this game on another unsuspecting idiot i have thrown it awaythough i am sure this is a good game i may never know thanks to this aweful little devil called steam
this program is clearly a violation of privacy as it hijacks your pc in the attemps to keep the game from being pirated
in doing so it alienates all of the good people out there just wanting to play the game of the year
it is such a buggy program that all of a sudden i cannot even put in a half life cd without my pc freezing up requiring a restart
i will never purchase any product containing steam and anyone who does is asking for trouble
i warned ya
thank me later
thanks steamvalvei will spend my money on products not associated with youas some reveiwers have already mentioned halflife  requires registration on a program called steam
well to make a long story short ive spent my entire day salivating over a mere taste of the game i just forked over  to play but instead of battling aliens in city  im battling network problems that valve should have anticipated but thats absurd because i want the single player campaign and my internet connection etc etc shouldnt even be an issuemost games average  new but no valve demanded  as did doom  and diablo  and all those overhyped were doing you a favor letting you buy this masterpiece at all games and to add insult to injury i cant even play what i paid good money for
i dont know what the game is like so i cant judge it  but i can vent my frustration as others have done and are doing in increasing numbers by informing potential buyers of all the pains that come with owning halflife  you shouldnt have to jump hoops when youve already paid and to say im steamed forgive the pun is quite an understatementim showing valve how much i appreciate this mess by selling my copy of halflife  and turning my back on it
i dont care how great pc gamer thinks it is  my principles of a consumer demand itwell if you read the reviews you will see it all spelled out for you
do not buy this game
you cant even play it
you need a highspeed always on connection in order to play this title unless you want to wait for  hours on dialup
the heck with that trash i spent  on this title  and i need steams permission each time i want to play it
where was that on the box
also not on the box is the fact that you have to wait in line for your turn to get permission  yes this from the same company that had its source code hacked so you can just imagine how reliable their servers are
apparently there is a way to play the game offline but it doesnt work for everyone and some people are being told by steamvalve that they have to disable their lans  no waynote to anyone that hasnt opened the box  dont
unopened you can return it easily
you open it and returning it is an entirely different ball gameso tell everyone that you can to stay away from this game maybe when the dust settles they will release a patch that revokes the necessary steam membership
if not well the only thing i can suggest to people who want to play the game they paid for look for someone who is sharing a hack online
for once i think the pirates are justified  and that sickens meto begin with this game made me extremely dizzy and nauseous
i have been playing pc games for many many years and i have never had a game to do that to me
i had to quit playing for a while just not to literally throw up
there is so much quick spinning around to check for enemies and maybe its the game engine too but this game made me literally sick
the game itself is also very linear and scripted
you just follow along shooting at enemies until the next cutscene
also there are many load screens everywhere
and the world of half life  is very depressing
i wouldnt want play it again to return to that world at allnext and the worst part of this game issteam
you have to be connected to the internet at all times to install the game and even play it in single player mode
i will never again purchase another game where this is a requirement
steam can also load any software it wants to onto your computer
how does that sound
thats what you agree to when you install the game after a long arduous processand you cant resell the game if you ever want to due to registering your computer with the id that comes with the game
now i have a game that i dont ever want to play
it comes on  cds so i guess thats  coasters i can place around my housei loved the first halflife and this one looks pretty awesome but unfortunately it is marred by what could possibly be one of the worst installation procedures ever devised
you need to register online for the singleplayer game
what a pain
if you buy this be prepared to spend hours installling it
really really lamenot a comment on the substance of the game but just a note of caution to buyers  even though this is an offline game you need to be connected to the internet to play the game in any modewhybecause the creatorspublishers are paranoid about piracy  so the game discs you are buying do not contain all the files needed to play the game
in order to get these needed files you need to download them from the creators website on the internet
on launch day this was taking  hours to do
in addition after the files are downloaded you need to register the game at the website before it will allow you to play it when you are not connected to the internet  and that registration line can be long and slow
and this is for the offline portion of the game not the multiplayer portionthe retail box apparently says internet connection required
they mean this folks  not just for multiplayer
you need to set aside several internetconnected hours in order to download the remaining files and register the game before you can play one second of it offlinebooo
hiss
the creators and publishers here are putting their own paranoid security above the ability of gamers to play their offline games in peace without having to deal with the lag associated with online games
poor show indeed valve and vivendi poor showi have had a horrible experience with this game
i hate valve now and will not buy another game from this company
i have wasted a whole day trying to play this game
there are several problems
 tremendous load time
it took nearly an hour to load after the installation process was over
 steam may the company rot in hell is required in order to play the game
you have to register with them before you can play half life   by the way they also took over my original half life game
i cant play that one now either even though this morning before installing hl i had no problems
my system is a pentium   gigahertz system with  megs of ram and oodles of hard drive space
i have a killer all in wonder video card
thats well within the minimum specs of this game but the darn thing seems to choke on hl
please save your money and time and get another game
i wish that i hadupate    everything i said above still stands
thats how much i dislike this game
please buy fear insteadi tried installing hl for  hours before i finally gave up
i kept getting error  cannot read hard drive messages
after following the instructions on the valve support page of which there are precious few and doing ridiculous things like updating my dvdrom bios at their request it still wouldnt worki finally looked online and found that a score of others are having the same problem
the answer faulty disks
the media valve used to distribute the game is horrible some of it getting corrupted between release and my time of purchase less than  days
i had to return the cds for replacements and then the game installed the first time
oh by the way if you have dialup thanks to living in a rural area installation will take at least  minutes
you have to install steama ridiculous program that is the ultimate digital rights management kick in the neck minutes install the game  minutes with cd swapping on  cds
 let steam update itself  minutes register for a steam account  minutes register your game with your steam account  minutes and then allow steam to decrypt your game so its playable  minutesafter all that it still takes more than  seconds just to get to the games main menu when you run it
i had commodore  games in the late s that loaded faster than that
to to it all off with this new innovation in game installation read annoying ploy to destroy our souls to keep someones yearold cousin from burning his own copy there are no directions no game manual no nothing
theres a reference card to help with install which says nothing of what steam actually is or will do to your machine it resides in the system tray and eats resources  even when youre not playing
for a game that was so severely delayed this is not just disappointingthis is unconscionable design
there are as many pages of advertising for ati video cards as there are instructions
by the way forget about tech support
i emailed them  days ago and have heard nothing back
of course you can try live tech chat
good luck with that if you can even get connected
no telephone support and no contact info for support on the ridiculous card thats not even a manual
theres no game manual even on the cd from what i can findfor those who say you cant rate a game based on its install and interface i have to disagree
in fact i think it is inane to think otherwise
how can you rate a car thats nearly impossible to get into
sure it might drive great but if you cant actually squeeze through the door to get in what use is all that speedthats pretty much it
i cant run my brandnew game because it requires broadband and i didnt know iti will wait until all the bugs are ironed out on this game
i had trouble even running the demo so i gave up
it is not my systems fault either
i have a current system with current specs so the programers have not done a good jobits unpatriotici know what youre saying what the are you crazy
unpatriotic
yes i said unpatrioticthe original half life was set in the middle of the american midwest at a deep underground us government facility
this latest game is set somewhere in europe and gives us a multiethnic love interest
the love interest isnt bad in and of itself and it really doesnt matter what race she is so put your racist accusations away
what im getting at is the fact that all of the games contents are marketed not as an american product but as one for a global communityto me thats a stab in the back
its subversive with good intentions but still underhanded and dilutes everything for which my nation created and stood for
let gordon be gordon and let the games love interest be whatever race creed or nationality the can be
just put the damn thing back in the us of awhat does this have to do with half life 
well how come we dont see us special forces trying to interfere again
suddenly the gman isnt some us secret service agent but just some mysterious jerk
suddenly the american flag isnt posted anywhere
suddenly were not in the us anymore but in some european settingwhat the hellin an attempt to make commercial art viable for international markets national identities and ethnicities are stripped
note how gordon freeman went from being a white mit grad to a ambiguously ethnic scientist
again put your racist label away because what im wondering is why if theres such a concern over making this game marketable why tinker with the games foundationsthe graphics are sexy as is the sound and the story for what it is is okay
but i still dont like it
i want the gordon freeman and facility i bought in the late s brought back to life
its not going to happen
it never will
the g of nations have built their new social dynamic and unfortunately it means pirating american culture and thought and giving it to the worldand thats why i dont like half life its been a few years since i played this masterpiece but i remember it wellhalf life  is a scififirst person shooter that follows the adventures of gordon freeman
and by adventures i mean shooting stuff and being denied information about whats going on by everyone
of course you can infer a vague aliens took over the planet plot in the first  minutes and the inference is about all youll ever know
cliche ridden scifi ambience aside the real problem with half life  isnt the monsters in game but the monsters in the programmingyou see when it came out there was a bug that seemed to randomly hit people
the bug caused stuttering with sound and hitches in gameplay even on high end machines
the bug still exists and shows up in source licensed games
i can only be confounded at how a development studio which as much money as they have cant make a stable game
id can do it
crytek can do it and beat the pants off everyone elses technology
whats up with valve
aside from the infamous stutter bug there are the load times that dont make any sense
load times that are as if youre defragging your entire hd each time it takes so long
how do you play a game under such maddening intermissions taking you out of the action
this is a problem that also has not been fixed despite valves ability to update their game
add in the sloppy jalopy that is steam a piece of software you are forced to run to play their games and i am utterly fed up with valves software practices
they just arent up to parthe last point i would like to bring up is the level design of hl was a joke
it was linear
as in well a straight line of gameplay
its almost shocking like am i playing star fox
am i playing a d scrolling shooter for the nes
why on earth would they take the ability to make open d designs and make every level a linear walk to point abc ugh some of the worst shooter levels ive seen although the office areas of fear
trump it i guess
the thing is far cry came out before half life  and you know what
it was wonderfully open ended
sure you had to complete the objectives but you werent in a little of tube of gameplay with no other choices
valve seemed to have gone backwards gameplaywise like another bigshot that crashed id with doom  they could not capitalize on the things that make gameplay great and so the game was just a hollow tribute to lots of money spent on art and self worshipthat said i think valve is very gradually trying to overcome the criticisms levied at them
its not happening overnight but i wonder maybe well see a half life  that makes everyone happy and not just those who like their games dead simplebought game through amazon marketplace
sealed and new with no manual and no key code
be carefulhalf life  is possibly the best game ever made
this game is truly a work of art
the graphics are gorgeous the story is compelling the environment and physics are superb but the whole game is ruined by the steam logon processafter you install the game you have to log on to a steam server to unlock it
this takes  mins   hour
i dont mind this if it keeps people from illegally copying the game
heres the bad part every single time you want to play the game you have to logon to the steam servers
to play a single player game you have to log on to a freaking server
this is ridiculous
with millions and millions of people trying to play the game every night it can take forever to log onif you ever get ondont buy this game
save yourself the money and time because you wont be able to get on the steam serversi just spent over an hour installing this game on my dial up modem which uses the most insane installation process i have ever seen
there is no booklet included in the box
there is only one cheap card which tells you that you can play offline if you check the remember my password box except there is no remember my password box to check anywhere during the installation process
so when i tried to play the game i was told that i would have to wait  minutes and i presume that was online
these people are so paranoid that somebody might rip them off that they have devised an installation scheme which is unbelieveable
but if they want to rip me off well thats another matter altogether
i regard valve and sierra as thieves and criminals
i uninstalled their garbage from my pc and will have it in the garbage can tomorrow
i will never buy anything else from these crookswhile shopping browsing or whatever on some internet site the site told you to make your pc wideopen to it to grant it supreme access to do whatever it wants to do wheneverit wants to
what would you think
what would you do
well thats what it takes to install and run half lifeyou might do the above to allow microsoft liveupdate to patch your pc or norton to upgrade your antivirus software but a game site
be warned to play this game you just about have to sell your soul to valve and steam
after loading the  software disks you will be spending the next  to  hours based on my and friends experience creating a steam account and having steam set up hl  if you can
while this is all going on your pc is sending god know what back to steam and steam is returning the favor to your pc
all this so you can finally play the game that you paid big  forheres some helpful hints from steam and steam forums to fix what is obviously your problem  you need to open portsthrough your firewall you need to disable norton script blocking you need to grant steam god rights to your pc antivirus software
obviously thats the problem
turn it off
these are being presented like they are your problems or nortons or zone alarm
worse gamers are complaining how horrid it is that norton should cause them all this trouble
does anyone besides me see something terribly wrong heredo yourself favor  pass on this one
its a good game but not a great game and certainly not good enough to warrant the trouble and risk you are going to take
you may be doing others a favor too
if the half life  steam way of doing business becomes prevelant pc gaming is doomed
i absolutely will never purchase another game that forces me to go through all this again and expose my pc to the risk
if every game company starts doing this im done with pc games
its back to reading and music
i might even pay some attention to the wife who gets little now because i play too many pc gamesone last comment  i assume that all the folks giving half life  stars are either  year kids or are completely computer illiterate or are gamming zombies who will put up with almost anything to play hl
if your none of these i cant say little enough about you
if i tried amazon probably wouldnt publish this
any adult who bought this game and attempts to install it will realize they have been had and try to get their money back if they canuninstalling steamuninstalling halflifei received a copy of half life  for christmas
i have been waiting for this game to be released for two years
yep we have all been through the our ideas were stolenyadayadayada i was appalled to discover that in order to load the game i had to sign up for an account online
sure they said you could play the game offline once you signed up but what kind of stronged arm robbery is this
you have to sign up for their online crap that you do not want or need
valve and sierra should be hung and quartered for this blatant ripping off of the public
nowif you can swallow all that bs and decide to try the game for all its hipe you will quickly discover that sierra and valve released the game on five cds
who on gods green earth puts out a game as a multiswap cd anymore
one darn dvd would have handled the complete game
okay so you play the cd swap only to find out that their is a crucial file missing at the end of the th cd
oh did i mention the craptacular box and no manual
i did not bother to return the game
i threw it in the trash where it and all other games like it belong
it is a shame that i never got to experience any of the game itself
maybe the companies will release a non rip off version on dvd that actually loads and that has a hard copy of the manualyou know there was a time when sierra games were to die forkings quest seriesphantasmagoria etcbut no more  i waited and waited and waited and waited for the game to be on the store shelves
finally no more delays and i got my over fifty dollar version
okay
its gonna be a great game 
thats what i have read  it was and after so many delays it had to be considering its predecessors
five disks to install
kind of like shades of xiiidont get a nice thick jewel case however
got it all installed and then i had to activate it
i can see  their reason why
no problem i thought to myself
i said that  and after an hour activating and decrypting files im still not ready to play the gamethink ill just take it out and put a nice easy to install  no fussno mess game in and put my long waited for and beautiful copy of hl in a closet where i cant see how much money i wastedi have no idea how this game is getting so much hype
i mean its not even that goodprosgood graphics but not the bestsome unique weapons eg
gravity gunmidly interesting storyconssteam you have to download after the last cd for like an hour
then whenever you play the single player you are linked to the internet
now this is a problem because it can leave some computers vulnerableending was very badway too linear
i felt like i was being forced to do stuff by a higher powerwhenever i was  it felt very unconvincing and i couldnt get into this game at alloverall this game is bad and defiantely not worth the hype it has gotten from so many peoplei would suggest buying quake  if you have a good enough graphics card for itall the reviews bitching and moaning about steam
theyre spoton
steam simply ruined this game for me
it was hours from the time i unwrapped the box to the time when i could actually play it
and the trouble never stopped
for weeks i stubbornly kept playing in spite of system freezes interminable delays between maps and frustration with one of the damn dune buggies which was terribly difficult to drive because the graphics kept jumping and stuttering in spite of my pretty decent system well above minimum requirements
and all this for the singleplayer game
i would say that i was playing the game maybe  of the time i spent trying to play it
the other  was spent waiting for a map to load waiting for steam to authenticate me and rebooting my damn pc every damn time the game brought it to a screeching frozen haltand then one day i had an epiphany
the game play was pretty good
the puzzles were pretty good
i really liked that gravity gun
but it just wasnt worth the hassle
and it certainly wasnt worth relinquishing control of my system to that invasive steam app
so i stopped playing
i uninstalled it
and i never looked back
ive not even been tempted this year to reinstall it and see if maybe some of the early bugs have been worked outid give the game away or sell it but i wouldnt wish it on anyone with whom im on speaking terms  or even an unwitting stranger
and i will never ever buy another game that uses steam or its ilk
i was shocked when i installed the game to see what kind of control i had to hand over to steam in order to run the singleplayer game
i crossed my fingers ignored my instincts and let it run anyway
dumb dumb dumb
what a terrible precedent to set in the pc software world
i wont succumb againhalflife  is a great game no doubt about that
but steam just about ruins it
steam tells you when you can play or not
steam will attach itself to your computer like a virus update when it feels like it and decide to crash when it feels like it
all im trying to do is play the single player campaign for a game that i paid  bucks for
but this is the th time this week that im unable to play because the servers on steams side nothing wrong with my own computer decided to choke and i cant play
if all this sounds ridiculous it is
how they paired the greatest game with the worst idea ever to hit the gaming community i dont know
their explanation  stop piracy
what at the cost of legitimate customers like me that actually go out and buy the game
now more people who actually bought the game are looking for hacked version just so they can play the game they already paid for
sounds like a farce to me
do yourself a favor and boycott all steam products lest it become a standard for the future gaming which would be a total nightmareright off the bat ive never ever heard of this game at all
whats up with that
after playing the original which is greatback in  i was so ready to get that sequal
who can deny the chaos thats going to come when it comes out
im not sure if it will suceed over the original but who knows
ill tell you only valve knows these answers and their keeping it as a suprise
i hate suprises
oh sure theyve gave out hints and treats but that isnt enough for an enthusiest like me
so if anyone knows truely knows when this game is coming please tell me
ive got to know if it will work on my computeri got this game for  its and ok game it just so easy but at the end last boss is so hard
ok all you do is go from level to level fighting bad guy thats all and it so stupid after about  min of the gamerent it firstutterly disappointing and this from a chap who gave microsofts fs  fs  and combat flight sim    stars respectively
the box notes claim that quotcombat flight sim  was built using an entirely new graphics enginequot if this is truly the case and theres no reason for me to dismiss this statement as a bold faced lie then my next burning question would be for the love of god why
although i love to fly simulated that is i have to admit i am first and foremost a graphics geek so my eyes tend to bend that way immediately and on first inspection of cfs  i was struck by the lack of  pop cfs  offers visually sure the aircraft skins are top notch but beyond that the textures are flat the sky looks as if someone simply scattered a handful of cottons balls over a blue field the menus look like something pulled off the shelves way back in the mid s remember those days matter of fact cfs  was a stellar achievement compared to the milk toast drabness of microsofts latest combat outing
and oh yes did i mention the panels cockpits and pathetic gunner views of the fighters and bombers are so dated visually that i thought at first glance my graphics settings were on low
note on my specs for reference compaq presario t pentium   e ghz processor windows xp home edition  gb ddr  pc ram gb  rpm seagate barracuda hard drive x max
dvdrom drive mb ddr ati radeon  direct x  creative sound blaster audigy  needless to say i had the offender in question maxed out
the poor visuals inside these buckets of bolts only compound an even greater problem playability or flyability are those real words
the headsup targeting display is arranged at such an awkward angle that training your sights on the enemy is like navigating a highwire on the tip of your tong you cant see where youre going and trying to think ahead of your enemys ai is near impossible because you cant see him and the oldest trick in the book of leading your target simply doesnt apply here because your forced to blindly spray a line of bullets somewhere into space in a direction you think or hope your quarry might be headed
i could go on and on but i simply dont have the mental strength or enough negative adjectives to describe the horror that is found inside such a pretty box
hopes were high then crushed by nothing short of an amateur offering by an industry giant
it makes me wonder does the design team responsible for this flagrant act of shoddy craftsmanship still have jobs at microsoft and if so are they wearing gray uniforms and carrying buckets and mops
microsoft should be nothing short of embarrassed by cfs  its a tremendous set back for the true innovator of flight sim technology
look out microsoft ubisofts on your six with il forgotten battles which looks better runs better and feels better theyve got four gold stars stenciled neatly on their fuselage and theyre looking to make that fivemy son bought this game and complained to me that it didnt seem to work right he is   well what can i say as a linux userfirst this game does not adhere to the system requirements that are listed on the box
in fact after installing all the fixes it comes nowhere near mss early fs gamessecond i suspect it has serious memory leaks in it which cause your virtual memory to sky rocket after a few missions and hours of play
you have to shut everything down on your computer if you run xpthird i have witness my son pitching his aircraft into a dive and the plane goes straight down from k feet into the ground even though he isnt going that fast and is pulling back on the stickfourth as with everything ms it loads slow goes from one part of the game to another slow and learns slowthe only good thing are the clouds and some of the musik which never stops probably intended for you to forget how slow the thing is runninganother piece of ms crap
dont waste your money like we didshort version it
does
not
runtake your money and set fire to it youll save time trying to troubleshoot this piece of crud  it just wasnt written very robustly
or if youd rather buy it and spend three hours downloading various patches and trying to tweak various settings on your machine trying to get it to functionthe emperor wears no clothes
this is badly written software and it should not be purchased by anyone for any reason
microsoft produces trash as far as im concerned and im angry with myself for not remembering that i wanted to play this game i wanted it to function on a basic level and it does not do so
this software does not function
do not waste your timeshenmue and its sequel are like having a real jobbut even less fun
if tedious wandering and horrible dialogue are your forte you might dig it
everyone else save your money
not even worth rentingas the opening cutscene introduces you to blinx the cat the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures i found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story
the idea is that a secret offworld clan of humanoid cat creatures armed with souped up vacuum cleaners are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map
it seems that time when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats takes the form of one of five different brightlycolored shapes
if these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things they turn into monsters
i could go on because the game certainly doesnt stop there but i think you get the pointi like to think that theres a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and superdetailed realism
generally a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game because theyre almost exclusively set in a photorealistic lifelike location
cartoons on the other hand generally dont worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time
how much fun would the wile e coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics
blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story thats overly detailcentric in an environment thats right out of a kids show
the result is a tale that comes off as way way out of left field and almost completely abstract
it focuses on things that would be better left to the viewers imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the waybeneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic
theres a princess evil pigs have kidnapped her and its up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world
thats it no sidestories no reasoning no subplots  just a straightforward rush from point a to point b and here i thought the phrase save the princess was universally recognized as an agesold clichenow i dont want it to sound like im railing on this game just because its got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor
its also completely lacking in character development general storytelling and ongoing inspiration
none of the characters in blinx really establish themselves as individuals including the lead character himself
you dont hate the pig on the spaceship because hes trying to destroy the world you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money
i honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three because shes never mentioned between the games start and its finish
i mean the very first super mario brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fighti dont honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging
the first level and a half are set up in the standard get to know you format with the simplest of enemies the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools
shortly thereafter youre thrown to the wolves
for the most part the level designs are very short with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge
i noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts whether its retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk har har above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point
youll almost always know what needs to be done but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick
i just cant overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is
if theres a bottomless pit nearby and chances are very good that there is blinx will find a way to force himself into it regardless of what youre hitting on the control pad
if theres an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button hell aim at a random switch on the other side of the room rather than the imminent threatthats not to say that the entirety of the time sweeper is totally without merit because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings
the ability to control time for instance was at the time a really fresh interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged
you can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time knock the level into slow motion etc
all the while blinx is moving around in real time
its a great idea but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized
why cant i use two controls at the same time
why dont more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers
why doesnt the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause speed up or rewind when i use my time powers
why is their duration so brief and why cant i hold more than a dozen uses at a time
i mean this couldve really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise runofthemill platformerthe controls too are an undeveloped undertested nightmare
blinx himself is often sluggish to respond especially when implementing his time controls
he has difficulty making a precise turn whether on midair or on solid ground
he stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks
he routinely moves in the direction of certain death as though pulled by a magnetic field whether youve instructed him to do so or not
hell occasionally refuse to perform a double jump particularly when attempting a difficult precise leap across a gaping chasmi think its these controls that most make blinx so mindsquashingly aggravating
at a glance youd imagine theyd be fairly difficult to screw up
youve got a jump button a suction  fire button a time control button and an analog stick to control movement
plus there had already been a long established line of threedimensional platformers on the market in the years before the titles release paving the way to an ideal control experience
super mario  had its issues sure but nothing like this and it was the trailblazer for the entire genres jump to the world of d
its like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anywayi cant even say im impressed by the graphics showcased throughout the time sweeper either
with the exception of the lead character himsef these are some incredibly cheesy preschoolish character designs  they feel unfinished and hurried less purposeful than youd imagine especially in contrast with blinx himself
particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury
heres a finely detailed main character with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again and hes pitted against a set of monsters that couldve sprung to life directly out of the pages of a fouryearolds sketchbookdespite featuring a spoken dialog track theres no english voice acting
i couldnt pinpoint the language but my wife seems to think its either french or some close variation of it
it certainly didnt sound japanese
while this does add a touch of personality to the title and its not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television
everyones vocal personalities are so blackandwhite too that i feel like a great chance to establish some muchneeded individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here
the bad guys all have the same deep gravelly transparently evil tone while the good guys are all bright cheery squeaky and highpitched like the monkeys in super monkey ball
its like a parody of the games that had come before but i wont give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purposeoverall blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package strapped to the shell of a farbelowaverage third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public
at the time of its release it was still in need of a lot of polishing some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a reevaluation of just how far some of these concepts and halfhearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality
on top of that i really dont know which audience they were targeting with it
the game is ridiculously difficult which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there but so bright kidfriendly and annoyingly cutesy that i cant imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day
the number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with blinx reaching nearmarvel vs capcom  levels with its unashamed excruciatingly cheap hits especially in later levels
i have no idea how i acquired the willpower to finish level eightthe game is adequately lengthy and offers some replay value with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches promotional materials and the like
once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those supertough later levels though youll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place
unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps i shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process and enjoy selfmutilation id recommend you stay far awayhow bad this game really is
the controls are absolutely horrible
i was unbelievably upset that i actually spent  to rent this awful garbage
the only good thing about this game was the many different characters and different types of matches you could play
it nowhere near makes up for the lack of a decent control system
the people who made this game need to take lessons off the old wwf games for the n because this one is horrid
dont waste your time or money people
pleaseok so heres the idea of the gametake an action genre such as first person shooterthats typicaly fulled of action and funand instead make it incredibly boringbut give the consumer lots of needless information like this plant is the jugahuga planti dont care
this game bores meeee the boss fight where u were runnign around it was pretty fun but thats the only action in the gamethe world was beautiful and everythign was beautifulbut i didnt click with this world it just felt like i was looking at a pretty moving picturekind of the equivalent of watching somebody else playingthen again i like watching my friends play gamesbutjust not this onei hate this game it has  more parts and the story doesnt make sense its super hard
and makes you epileptic because you dont know what to dosorry all but i am about to step on a ton of nintendo lovers with this brief review about the travesty known as metroid prime
if it werent for the shoddy control and ridiculous save points i would be sharing the opinions of every reviewer out there and say this game is a  out of  or a  out of  like ign
unfortunately cool graphics a great map wonderful environments super smooth fps and a compelling story does not make up for the fact that you will be fighting the godawful controls all the way throughadmittedly  this game is from which would be the infancy of first person shooters on consoles
this hardly excuses not using the damn second stick on the gamecube controller to make this game livable
sure the left trigger locks on which is great to straff and blast through enemies
the problem comes when you have to shoot at things which the game does not consider enemieslike exploding mushrooms or that rapidly respawning killer grass or the hives where those big flying bugs come out of
aiming is nearly impossible
you hold the right trigger and try to move the left stickthe only stick used for control in this game praying beyond everything that the damn reticule will stay in one place
you see the cursor does not stop when you release pressure on the stick
so you have to do minute motions with the stick and basically fire blindly until random chance has the reticule go over the item you want to shoot atall of these things were bearable for the first  or  hours of the gamei explored every nook and cranny i was loving the game so much the first few bosses were not too bad and then i got to a big bug boss who would recharge with these mirrors
here is the method
you shoot this bossfor some reason the lock on was very shoddy for this boss until he gets kind of winded
you then have to shoot a little red spot on the base of the mirrorsorry for the spoilers but if you want to play this game you are probably not going to want to read this review anyway right
to destroy the mirror you have to hold the fire button to do a power shot at it
but the aim is so crappy that you miss half the time
the first boss of the game was real easy and you could lock and jump sideways
not sure why but that method did not work with this boss and he absolutely raped me time and time againto make matters ever worse this game uses save spots
this would be okay if the damn save spots were right next to the boss
nooooo
you respawn way the hell away from the boss and have to do a  minute platforming section to get back to him
why do japanese games not believe the the checkpoint system
please tell me whyuggh
i think i am just too used to modern games which are a lot more forgiving
so far my experience with the wii has been pretty bad
should have just stuck with my psthis game sucks 
first of all this game is so hard
it sucks
i cant even get through the first level without getting stuck  times
dont buy this   gamei had the sorcerers stone for the pc and it was excellent then i played chamber of secrets for the pc and it was okay but very easy except the broom flying challenges
i was hoping the gc version was better
wrongthe playability is horrible
it is hard to get the camera angle to see what is in front of harry and who wants to try to jump from one object to the next at an angle
the camera likes to show the front of harry most of the time so when you try to turn around to see where you are going you usually end up getting hit by something
that is the hardest part of the game
otherwise a two year old could play this and it could be won in about  minutes
very irritating
if youve played the pc version of any of these games and are thinking of getting them for the gc  dont
all the fun stuff is gone
you will be greatly disappointedi hate this game
i cant even get through the leaky cauldren
you have to get all of ron and herminies stuff before you can go to hogwarts
hagreds drinking beer in a barn while you find other peoples stuff
dont make the same mistake i made
rent it firstwhen i first bought this game i thought it would be great
well it was the first time i played of course
the poor aspects of the game are countless
if you jump from two feet high you will lose about  of your health
when jumping from ledgeswhich appears way too many times in this game you will fall off if you are an inch off course making most obsticles difficult and tedius
also the bosses are extremely easythe game gets everything in relation to the book wrong
they completely leave out dobby the beginning of the story with the dursleys the writing on the wall and gildroy lockhart being a fraud
also when harry is viewing tom riddles diary he watches the scene in which hagrid is expelled as if in a small tv
they also make things that were fascinating is the book combletely dull by making them bosses
also the general plot of the game is brought up like a whatshouldidotoday concept
the game is also very short
my cousin beat it in a mere two days
now im not trashing nintendo i am completley faithful and want them to suceed even though warner brothers made this  but for your own good do not buy this game
read the book and see the movie they are much better than thisthis game is one of the worst tycoon games i have ever played and most of them are terrible to begin with
what is the point in adding on to an already terrible gameunable to run on either my desktop xp or my vista laptoplocks up my laptop and either locks up or blue screens my desktop on which i can run anything from crysis to the latest iteration of microsoft flight sim with everything on high and all available periphialsyoke and wheelrudder pedalsfour throttleetcwound up shredding the discthatll teach it not to mess with me boyif it was possible i would have given it no starssystem specsp mb ramgeforce  mb itcable internetnot exactly top of the line but i had to turn all of the graphical options to very low or offsystem specsp mb ramgeforce  it  mbcable internetthis one has a better video card and more ram but i was able to bring the settings up to high
in group combat  players vs npcs however server lag killspros breathtaking graphics monthly updates able to unlearn spellscons no real content
story quest limited to  after which you can get a scarce quest here and there no npc venders
npcs are only there for quest no use for money except learning smith and whatnot breathtaking graphics if you have a mb video card radeon  monthly updates are always an anticlimax authentication problems when logging on massive lag if you are fighting with a group of  groups are limited to  players  pkers are able to camp zone spots most of the games population has a character at level  the level cap is limited at  and will not be removed until september at the earliest lack of ingame admin support no point in towns because there is nothing to do there npc mobs all look the same but are given different names and strengths waste of the premise of the game sounded great a gba version of lotr
just what i needed to relive the fun of the movie
sure there were a few glitches here  there but initially i had a fun playing it
plus it came with little cards of the characters which was neatthen came the big glitch
the glitch that made it impossible for me to continue playing
the glitch that froze up my game
at one point during the game about  of the way through i tried entering a new area
evidently the game decided that i shouldve finished something else first so it completely froze up making further gameplay impossible
since some parts of the game were incredibly frustrating due to glitches that made it very hard to complete i just lost interest in trying to replay to get to that spot in the game
i traded it in only to discover that i wasnt the only one who was having this troublethis couldve been far better done
this was just a shoddily made game that was thrown together at the last minute
save your money  dont even get thisthis game is more based on the book then any other lotr game
but the battles are terribly slow some items dont work things that the game promised are taken out the graphics are awful and there are some terrible glitches in the game especially the moria glitch which made me go out buy another one i thought the first one was a defect and go through the same glitch again
even if you are a huge lotr fan you should probably stay away from this gamebad
very bad
slow as the books without any of the interesting dialogue or plot developmentinstead one is treated to the wild thrills and spills of wandering about collecting items for hours and being subjected to horribly done rpg battles
it takes over an hour to get out of the shireand what do you do in that time
meandering at approximately  mph through dull washedout backgrounds collecting tools for gardeners and seeds and fruits
whee
frodo the errandboythen it gets better
you meet tom bombadil
and what does the singing spirit of nature ask of you
why of course to wander about collecting things
boy howdy
im having a blast here
apparantly vivendis idea of a puzzle is lets hide an item make them wander for  minutes finding it with no action whatsoever then well hide another one and make them start over
but you get past tom bombadil and into the great wide world of middleearth and what do you dobecome engaged in what is undeniably the most boring rpg ever to hit the gba
walk around
get involved in pointless nonexperiencepointgiving battles
thats right
you get no reward for the excruciatingly slow battles whatsoever
i cannot deny though that the game gets much deeper once pointlessbattling augments pointlesswalking
i found myself forcing myself to play just to see if the next line of dialogue actually came from the books
thats never a good signoh and then we get to moria
thats a bit better
except for the fact that in cartridges has a critical error that prevents you from continuing past the stage
really
  i have no idea what amon hen is like
maybe it gets better
i dont know
this game is a disgracei am a tolkien nut
i am an rpg fan
i enjoyed golden sun tactics ogre and the pair of breath of fire games immensely
i love the books to death and thought the movies were sheer magic
this on the other hand offends me on two fronts
its a mediocre rpg and a poor translation of tolkieni cannot imagine anyone who is in the slightest demanding about their rpgs or games in general enjoying this game
the only redeeming fact about this game is that it is lord of the rings
i admit it was somewhat less aggrivating when i saw familiar locations
not fun mind you but it did lessen the frustrationbottom lineif you really want tolkien buy the extended dvd of fellowship of the ring the lotr trilogy the hobbit silmarillion unfinished tales etcif you really want a gba rpg buy one of the excellent titles mentioned above or one of the mega man battle network gamesif you want a video game adaptation of the movie buy eas the two towersif you want to be disappointed buy thisfirst off those stating how great this gba game is obviously havent played it or they find happiness in torture this gba version of lord of the rings fellowship of the ring is one of the absolute worst games ive ever played and is a prime example of a  licensed video game gone awry
you play as frodo and you go through just about all the areas described in the original book while interacting with villagers and performing favors to get special items while also taking place in turn based battles with enemies
while this sounds good on paper and like some old bit rpgs that will remain nameless there are so many glitches bugs and control issues not to mention the battles take such an excruciating long time your head will spin in agony that the overall feel of the game seems unfinished
all in all this game will disappoint even the most hardcore fans of the lord of the rings series and they along with any self respecting gba owner should avoid this at all costsis this the same gba quotlord of the rings fellowship of the ringsquot that was produced by vivendi
now it is said to be by quotjack of all gamesquot
if this is the same cartrige and it looks identical this is the buggiest game ive ever seen
i have never even been able to get out of rivendell because bilbo wont drop sting the elves wont drop gimlis axe and gimli doesnt show up at the exit to get his axe
unless these things happen you cannot leave rivendel
i have played through to rivendell twice and it just gets stuck there
there are numerous other bugs as well the game freezes in the house where you fight spiders and when you enter the mines of moria although i have never even gotten that far
this would be a good game if it worked
but it does notthis game was fun until i got to rivendell and i couldnt find gimli
i had read this was a bug and i thought i was prepared because he was supposed to be in a certain location that i read about online but he wasnt there
i could not leave rivendell and then i found another bug where if i dropped items and left the room they simply disappeared in rivendell
i couldnt continue and was very frustrated
up to then i thought the game was cool
now im very unhappywe got this game for our  year old when xbox still had so few little kids games
this is the worst game we have ever purchased
it is hard to figure outhard to playand hard to see what you are doing
it just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game endsalsomany levels that my daughter would want to play are locked and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play themthe game has been collecting dust since the st week we bought iti am sad to say after being so excited to get my kids this game it is horrible
dont waste your time
save your money and wait for a better or get a different game
igncom gave this game a  out of  also
which i read after playing it
sadly this game is only frustrating and no fun
save your moneylooks bad functions bad
cant charge while in case
does not protect sides of vita during a fall
hangs off awkwardly while playing games
extremely uglypros might protect front and back of vita
looks good in garbage can might be biodegradablewow this thing is really badlooki get that you want to let the vita swing lose to allow access to the back for use with the camera and whatnot but this is not a casea case implies protection from the elements
i would be ok with and expecting a case that i had to take my vita out of to use but when not in use would afford my device some level of protection from things like rain and children and droppagethis thing does none of that
what it does is expose the entire device on the sides to everything near it
this is literally two pieces of hard leather padding roughly oval shaped with the clip in the middle to attach the vita
so you have a leathervitaleather sandwich
that is not an exaggerationseriously
this thing sucks
youre better off with a fanny pack and some foam peanutsafter being dissapointed with neverwinter nights i hestitated to buy another bioware game but my sons persuaded me
we tried we really tried to play this game
it looked good and started out okay but quickly got very very boring
basically you just run around up and down the same corridorsafter an initial frenzy of play all three of us just slowly stopped playing it
after a few weeks i did a quick poll and then uninstalled and sold it
during the game you are supposed to earn light or dark points
by the time i stopped playing i realized i was still exactly neutral
my oldest son who was trying to get on the dark side ended up going toward the light sidei couldnt give this game a fun rating because you have to be able to play a game to know if its any fun
i ranked it a  because i certainly didnt have any fun with this productkotor didnt allow me that opportunitywhen i loaded the game the framerate was something like  frames per second and that was just the main menu screen
once i got into the actual game it ran at about  fpsits not like i was playing this on an overclocked  either
this was on a brand new computer that i had literally bought the week before i tried to play this gamemy specscompaq presario  notebookamd athlon   processormb of ramati mobility xpress  graphics cardi spent three days mucking about with biowares tech support forums before i got an email back from biowares tech support that told me that ati graphics cards in the family that my graphics card is in are incompatible with this game
if i wanted to play it id need a card from nvidiagee that would have been nice to know before buying the game
maybe they could have put something in the system requirements far cry for example lists the compatible graphics cards in the system requirementsfurthermore that doesnt explain the fact that the reviewers at gamespot who for some inexplicable reason gave the game an  ranking noted that they game flatout wouldnt play on three of the four systems they tried it on
these are professional game reviewers
surely if a system exists that could handle this game they would have more than one
and one that it crashed frequently on i might addthe review is hereits obvious that bioware developed this game for one hardware configuration and didnt playtest it on anything that didnt match that configuration
bioware is currently blaming ati for faulty drivers adbicating any responsibility they have to release a product that actually works as advertisedheres a word of advice  before you buy this game or any game from bioware make darn sure you contact their tech support staff and ask them if the game will work with your specific hardware setup
and dont accept a should work answer either
otherwise you might just wind up with a very expensive set of shiny coasterswhen i try to play the game i get a securom error message saying disc emulator detected
the documentation says that to avoid this error i need to turn off my virus checker
are they kiddingwarning
this game and its sequel do not work ony anything above xp
vista   fuggedaboudit
if you get the xbox version do not play it on the  or itll be riddled with slowdowntrust me this game will be a stinkeri bought live  last yearthe graphics stink who cares about coaches or player reactionsthats there problem they spend too much time on reactions and not enough time on gameplayget nba k not live get real this game is really bad bad and more badit is not going to improve unless they get some better graphics in therethe ps games of live are better so listen up and stay awaythe game will be better then street hoops but not ki have to say they shure did a better job on maddenlive just keeps gettin worse and worse and worse
thats why segas k saga is the new and better generation of baskerball games
lives last greatr game was   ever since then its been getting worse and less realistic
to me live  to  are the same game just a diffrent title and new ranks and changed teams
i highly recomend k rather than this garbagei admit that i havent gotten very far in this game
the reason is that i dont like to play this game
when i turned it on during the day it was fun when i was helping the hobbitt village people with the little tasks they needed but then night fall came and i couldnt see jack
so i thought i would put the game away and play it later that night
my place was black as pitch except for the light coming from the television and i still couldnt see a thing
im supposed to be avoiding those black riders but i couldnt see anything
somehow i got past that part
then more helping villagers
thats the best part of this game
i dont remember exactly where im at with this game but i doubt ill go backthere are far better games to buy for the xbox than this one
oddworld blood omen and enclave just to name a few
dont waste your hard earned money on thiswow what a let down
i was looking forward to this game for a couple of reasons
i love the books
i love rd person actionadventure games
surreal had something to do with it and i loved drakan the ancients gate which this engine obviously shares a lot in common withwell except for most of the good parts
where to start on this turkeya  graphics
very very similar looking to drakan the ancients gate but no where near the sizedepth of the environments in that game
the game looks passable and thats the most favorable word i can use but the mapsenvironments are very very small for the most part and you are more or less on a very narrow track
the graphics in general have a sort of cartoony empty feel
the game lacks much mood from a visual standpoint and thats a shame given the sourceb  gameplay
 wordhorrible
all the problems that plague bad rd person adventure games are here
camera panningorientation is one of the worst ive played in a long time which again is a real shock as drakan the ancients gate is one of the best in that regard ive ever played
weapon selection not that there is muchany is clumsy and its a real problem when using gandalf especially not that it matters much as the fighting is so simplistic
in short just about everything that can be annoying about control issues in games like this is
i really dont understand what happened as the engine is obviously by and large the same one used in drakan and its fantastic in that game
perhaps this game had a different team of people or was actually in development before drakan waswhatever the problem is it sure is lousyon top of those two things the gameplay being the major flaw the game is shockingly short
i finnished this game in  hours with no cheats no online help no guides its laughably shorteasy
also the game just feels thrown together
the cut scenes seem very rushedits hard to describe this unless you play it but it really seems very thrown togetherin summary
i wouldnt buy this game and i have a hard time even recommending that you rent it
im not sure its even worth the  bucks or whatever your local rental place chargesavoid at all costwhat a shame such potential to make a truly great game and from at least in part a company that has made a fantastic game with more or less the same engine
if your looking for a good rd person actionadventure that you may not have played check out drakan the ancients gate
its a much much better game than this in every way possiblewhat happened
toejam and earl was an awesome series then this pos came out and totally shot the series to death with cheesey looking characters
the new female character is a stupid joke a true toejam and earl fan would wanna play lewanda or maybe sharla instead or heck even peabo would be awesome
this game should be banned from the xbox library it is seriously that bad
the game for one thing is totally pointless and the gameplay sucks and the graphics arent much better than n or playstation maybe worse
its a bad game that really taints an excellent and unique video game series and also a good systemthis socalled halokiller was sad in comparison
lame graphics pathetic story  characters no one cared about
worst game everthis game is ever so boring
it follows the general microsoft philosophy of features over everything else gameplay story mechanics enemy ai interesting characters and enemies locations and most importantly funid like to quickly liken this game to thanksgiving dinner
its like grandma micrsoft game studios worked really hard on the bread potatoes stuffing pie and apple cider or whatever but completely forgot to make the turkey
its not grandmas fault shes old
but she doesnt try to charge you fifty bucks to eat her dinner does she
if she does dont eat it many good chinese restaurants are open on thanksgiving
if youre not american you might be scratching your head wondering what thanksgiving is
thanksgiving means this game sucksto say this game pales in comparison to halo is an understatement
this game ignored everything it could have learned from halo
halo had a plot interesting characters fluid controls good weapons and addictive gameplay
brute force has none of thishalo was by no means a hard game but brute force barely even punishes you for dying
it hurts your score
you can just keep respawning until you beat the level every time
talk about taking any possible sense of satisfaction away that i could have gotten
to make things worse there is basically no enemy ai
at all
the basic gist of it is hide behind rock shoot hide shoot hide shoot die
to try to conceal this the levels were sprinkled with places where the enemy simply wouldnt appear until after i walked by them
i knew these places were coming but there simply was nothing i could do for the enemies didnt even exist until the instant they surrounded me
clever guys
real cleverfrom the very beginning of this game through the ending credits this game was the least entertaining game ive played since well uhh im sure i can think of a game worse than brute force hold on hmm maybe this is the worst game ever
that is quite an accomplishment
at the very beginning the game was terrible because i had used such rubbery controls very seldom in the past and certainly not since playstation one but by the time i got used to the controls about five minutes into the first level it thankfully allowed me to somewhat imitate my halo control setting i was already bored of the wishy washy combat and crappy missionsthe game has many features that ive craved ever since perfect dark like being able to track your kills and other stats but some of the most important features for any modern action game are missing here vehicles challenge plot and funbecause when it comes down to it the most important test of any game is whether or not its any fun and this game just isnt any funi cant beleive this game was so poor
the missions were lame
the multiplayer was so annoying
the weapons were poor
and lastly the graphics were so dark i couldnt see the buildings i kept running into
im not going to adjust the brightness setting on my tv
for one game
forget about trying to scope someone out or using any kind of skill to kill anyone
its pretty much fire your weapon at will and hope for the best
after playing the pc version online of this game xbox shouldnt have even bothered putting it out
i would say rent this and find out for yourself before you buy it considering the hypestop making medal of honor games
they have the same stupid ai and the same idiotic story
the gameplay just gets old really fast
please dont even rent this game spend your time just playing great games like halo or final fantasy x and star warsbattlefrontmaybe its a good game
but i never got it
it was never delivered and they have failed to work with me on a solutionpive played some godawful adventure games in my day but ive got to say that without a doubt this is perhaps the most unplayable ive ever attempted to endure
game of the year
best adventure game ever
im boggled by the reviews
im a worldclass cheapskate and ill finish any game just to say i got my moneys worth but this thing is just insufferablelets take a look at the blowbyblow but its got gorgeous graphics  ok the scenerys pretty
know what
so was the scenary in myst and that suckers a good  years older than tlj
and lets keep in mind that when people are raving about the graphics theyre referring to the scenery if it moves in the game ie
the characters then its blocky and clunky
ive seen better quality in full motion video games than the character models in this thing
the voice acting  yeah its good which indeed is a rarity these days
i must confess that i found the main character annoying after a while but the voice acting was certainly topnotch
but what good is voice acting when 
 they never shut up  thats right
never
never ever
and every time you meet a character youre going to find these enourmous dialogue trees with layers on layers of their childhood their sexual proclivities their hopes their dreams blahblahblahblahblahblah
and in true adventure game style you never know which little bit is going to yield that crucial bit of information that you need to progress the game
so you sit and you listen and you pray for death to come
the story is just lame  maybe i just have a chip on my shoulder but what kind of hippie new age gobbledygook is this
what was the writer smoking
im quite forgiving particularly in the realm of scifi and fantasy but this thing is just trite and uninspiring
my favorite thing about the game is that itll put some outlandish rule out there which normally id just accept without thinking but then they try and explain it and it makes no sense
for example crazy outlandish rule  so there needs to be a new guardian every  years
 me  gotcha
 years
new guardian
check expository character who cant stop rambling  oh but theres a good reason for the  year cap the soul cant be separated from the body for longer than that
 me  huh
its still all the annoyances of adventure gameplay  to top it all off youre still going to be bogged down in the apparently unbreakable rules of an adventure gamea if you know what you need but you cant find it examine every stinking thing in your inventory cause its probably hidden inside something elseb if you know you need to use something in a specific way but it just doesnt seem to work you probably simply havent placed the object in precisely the right spot to trigger the actionc when all else fails spend half and hour blindly trying to combine items in your inventory and waving inventory items across the screen
with any luck youll stumble across the completely unintuitive rubegoldbergian contraptiontechnique that the games designers decided was the only possible way to open a window
if youre less lucky it means you dont have the right item so go revisit every location and try to pick up everything you can
once youve got something new repeat blind inventory combining andor waving until youre allowed to proceed to the next  minute monologue on the balance and the disc and the key which is the disc which has been broken into four which are the keys of the disc for the balance
i hope so so that i can run out and enjoy that root canal ive been putting offinstead of being called the longest journey it should be called the longest install
this  disk program was the slowest to install game ive ever seen
it must have took  minutes to do a complete installonce i started playing i was shocked at the profanity
it seemed so out of place
the profanity didnt add anything to the gameplaythe third thing that i didnt like was the lesbian land lord at the main characters apartment
i didnt want to hear how fulfilled she was with her female loverthis game looks like just a nice adventure game but its pushing a hidden agendaive only played this game for about  minutes and it has already become obvious that this game is not appropriate for childrenits too bad that you cant even play a computer game without the  agenda being slipped indont buy nightfire
it is very boring
the missions are long and stupid
i hate all the bond games especialy the new one
the colors in the game are really bad
and the guns are stupid and not real in real life
theres a automatic gun with a scope and you cant look trough the scope
unless you love bond games dont buy this
the grafics suckdont be fooled this game sucks
i got it for my birthday last year and it doenst match up to  goldeneye one of the best games ever made so dont be foolednintendo has shafted me again first with a n that had no third party support
now the same thing has happened with my gamecube
i own all three new systems plus  older systems and i work for software etc
i know my business and our sales speak volumes
xbox sales have picked up while gamecube sales have dropped
well there is always the next system
for gamecube i had to buy memory cards a keyboard an ethernet adapter then i bought an xbox
unlimited memory and the only thing you might have to purchase is a dvd playback kitwhich is cheaper than a gamecube memory card
i own a real dvd player and im not stupid enough to use my console as a primary dvd player
gamecube doesnt even have this option
this is   of the world doesnt have to use their game console as a dvd player
i found that most of the games on gamecube are on xbox except on xbox they contain extras far better graphics sound and some even add online play
while online you can chat in every game no need for a keyboard
gamecube only offers  game with online playshame on themxbox has over  games available and over  for this year alone so games is not an issue
finally someone has built a better system then ps and gamecube
ps is good gamecube is better but the loading times muddy jaggy graphics no dolby digitaland now its losing all its exclusives to xbox
ps amp gamecube exclusives are getting fewer and the ones they have are seeking ways to get their games on other systems
gtavc for example rockstar is planning on releasing a side story to gta only for xbox so you can expect great graphics and much better gameplay on xbox
with games like halo  tao feng project gothom  dino crisis  ufc tapout  dead or alice chronos brute force rallisport  mech assaultunreal championship panzer draggon orta and many more exclusives the proof is there if you look developers are putting their best games on xbox and then dumping the left overs on ps and gamecube
the xbox exclusive games put anything the ps or gamecube has done to shame
halo was released over a year ago and there still has been nothing from ps or gamecube that even comes close to the graphics sound story and even the online play rocks even though its not offical through xbox live you have to play through gamespy
the new  pound gorilla is here and its name is xboxthe one i received was very clearly pirated as the moment you turn the system on you are prompted by their pirate call signs before it even shows the nintendo logowas not able to play it
it was my mistake i though it was for xbox  did not realize it was not my mistakei see a lot of  and  star reviews on this game
i dont know maybe there playing another game because from what i see from this game is not at all impressive
while the concept and graphics of the game is good the control of this game is where it falls way way short
controlling your characters is a task in itself and are too cumbersome simply walkingrunning in narrow areas can get frustrating i wont even going into aiming to kill birds that fly off the screen only to come back and attack you from the entirely other direction
i dont know if this was done intentially to make the game harder than it really is but it works
on top of that the characters seem slow to respond to your actions when your trying to pick something up you have to press the button and wait to see if it responds you press the shoot button and your characters just stand there while getting attacked when your attcked by something an get pushed to the previous screen you can still be attacked even though you cant see where it is so you can shoot it
top this off with barely enough ammo to kill the cheesy zombies that grab you and take  shots to kill with the pistol
im sure the controls take some getting used to but this game is just too boring to want to learn the controls
the game it self moves entirely too slow and it littered with too many useless and corny cut screens
cut screens when you pick up something cut screens when you walk up or down stairs cut screens when you climb a ladder cut screens when you open a door cut screen when you switch character controls
and if the game wasnt already slow enough text goes across the screen slooowly and there is no way to make it go faster
arethefaintsoundsoffootstepsthoseofsurvivors
is not something i want to sit through every single time i load a gameim so glad i didnt pay full price for this gameif this game had fewer cut screens was more faster paced and most importantly had controls like xboxs splinter cell then maybe this would be a very good game
but as it stands my second gamecube game is a waste of my time and money
i guess i was spoiled by my xboxs splinter cell and even my game cubes metroid prime
and to think i thought splinter cell was cumbersome when i first played it
ha
dont waste your money unless you absolutely love the resident evil serieslike the headline says but the fact that i have been playing this story for over  years now makes this a waste of time
i turned it off after an hour
enough said
buy resident evil  its the best one since the original
maybe the best of allxmen the next dimension for the xbox is a fighting game where you get to fight with your favorite xman character
the major ones included are cyclops jean wolverine night crawler storm and many more which can be unlocked when you beat the games
your characters can do basic punch kick combo moves anduse their special powers
you can play by yourself or with a friend in versus mode
i hated this game because the controls were sluggish the animation looked choppy and weird
the sound is the worst ever in a fighting game
the hits sound like tiny slap sounds
all of the combo attacks suck they feel very generic
im an xmen fan but this game is horrible
save your money and buy dead or alive the bombprosxmen charactersgood graphicsversus a friendconssluggish controlsterrible sound effectsgeneric musicchoppy animationsfighting techniques suckretarded aiafter renting this game to my dismay i found absolutley nothing new or different about this portthe graphics are the same as it was  years ago on the defunct sega dreamcastwhats worseno online option and you cant play your own souindtracks to replace the horrible jazz ecentric bgm during the battle stages
the music was much much better on capcoms previous efforts ie
marvel super heroes marvel vs capcom or evem xmen vs street fighter heh no wonder why i still have my sega saturn as well as my dcbut if the xbox is your only system then youre left with only one option buy it otherwise avoidbtw wheres the gamecube versionoh you mean there isnt one for the lamecube
oopspersonally i think this game isnt as good as it could be id suggest buying mortal kombat instead reallygthis game was one of the worst ive ever played
the graphics are decent but they just cant match the old contra from the nes
the day that they realize this and stop making stupid games like this one the bettergraphics dont make a game they merely add to the enjoyment of the game play and interaction
this game is ridiculous
the volleyball portion it basically a cpu controlled mess that involves more luck than strategy
whats fun about a game in which you have to constantly bribe girls to partner with you in matches you have a better chance of losing that winning
plus the real rules of volleyball arent even applied to this game
and whats up with the weird deuce rules when theres a tie score
but honestly this game isnt really about volleyball
its digital barbie dolls for guys
you earn cash to dress up the girls in outfits your girlfriend would never wear on the hottest day of the year in privatethe totallity of this game feels more like a collection of bad mini games rather than one cohesive one
the fact that this game is getting  stars from consumers saddens me because it proves that ta cgi or not is enough to get people to by something and enjoy it somewhat
i dont mind the digital skinid just need digital substance to go along with it
im glad i didnt actually buy this crapthis game is boring the volleyball is just way too weak to keep your attention for more than a few hoursthe girls are beautiful but they all speak japaneasewhich really gets annoying
its more of a game of dress up the ultra hot dolly than a volleyball gamethe most nudity in the game is the thong bikinis that you can make them wearthe casino is also quite boring youve got pokerblackjack and a host of similar slot machinesthe consensus between me and everyone i have let use or play this game is that the chicks are hot but how long can you look at a pixelated hottie before you realize the game has no substancethis game is only for hormoneraging  year old kids who cant get their hands on actuall pornography so its aimed towards their hormones
the game is actually not a good game
if one of your notassmart friends has the game you might want to try it but its not worth the money nor time to rent or buy
the only other reason to buy this game is if you are a die hard dead or alive collectors fandead or alive volleyball is a pretty weak game
it does has beautiful graphics the women wearing bikinis and sun bathing or playing volleyball
 the backdrops are beautiful as well with nice beaches and island spots
i also had a bit of fun with the casino mini games included
when you gamble and win at the casino games you earn money to buy gifts for your girlcharacters buy them a new swimsuit candy flowers
it tries to simulate interaction with a virtual girl but it is very limited
the volleyball game which is the whole purpose of the game lacks responsive controls and has very bad camera angles
the bad camera angles ruin the whole game because when you are playing volleyball either your character or ball will leave the play screen and then you end up losing points
terrible
the music and sound effects are generic but they can be turned downprosbeautiful womenbeautiful back dropscasino gamesconsjunk controlscamera angles sucksyou cannot adjust camera anglesgeneric musicweak sound effectsnot very excitingoverall this game is below average it tried to implement lots of good ideas and the casino games was a nice bonus but the negative points affect it badlyi would have bought this game what the hell up with the big giggle 
i am a girl i dont wont to look at that the dude who made this is a pervfirst offi want to say that i loved wild arms  and as such i was expecting to love wild arms what a dissapointmentone extremely annoying new feature was the random battle encounter gaugeunlike  where you would get a 
above your head so that you could run away from a random battlewa only lets you do this  timesthen you have to fightanother bad feature was the fact that everyone uses gunsyou can hit with your fistswhen your out of ammobut it does such lame damage that its not even worth tryingalso the personal skills system was changed for the worsehaving to equip an itemfight so many battles and then having the item dissapear after youve learned the skillthe characters and the story were also short of my expectations for the serieswhile janus  cobad guys were sometimes funny and sometimes despicablethey were nowhere near as great as say liz  ard from part the game also felt like it was trying to make a story just to give you a point to do thingswhereas the previous two installments had great stories to them which also just happened to be gamesthe only good thing about this game is the graphicsnot the ahh and ooo d typebut the fact that all of the characters looked like they were hand painted with water colorsand that was impressivethe only noticable music in the game was the traditonal wild arms opening thats heard during the train scene after you play all four character introsthe very start was sung in voices with a hymnlike effectvery niceeverything afterward is just hum drumaverage runofthemillall in all wild arms  is just another video game sequal that bombedwild arms  is a terribly mediocre rpg that simply never should have been madethe goodrelatively nice celshaded graphics
period
nothing elsethe badincredibly flat characters predictable and cliched storyline repetitive and stupid battle system lack of any good enemies you cant get any new guns music is very limited doesnt sound like the wild westconclusionwild arms  couldve been a good rpg worth  stars with some improvements unfortunately the developers obviously didnt try very hard
dont even bother with this game
not worth your time at all
try final fantasy x final fantasy x dark cloud  suikoden  or grandia  they are much better than this gamewell i am very disappointedveryhere are the bad things horrible graphics corny storyline no real voices same old battle systemwhat else
well for one the graphics repeat the music is very annoyingit just keeps playing over and over the same part and they dont even explain the complicated menusyou have to figure it out for yourself
the graphics are flat and more like cartoon charactersobviously the creaters tried to make it look cute and save some time and 
there is a reason its cheaper than the other gamesbecause it is cheap
it isnt worth the rent money eitheri love rpgs
the ps has produced some really excellent games for the genre including final fantasy x the shadow hearts series and disgea hour of darkness
wild arms  is not going to be joining this list of rpg awesomeness any time soon
its not even going to be joining my list of decent rpgs
this game is terrible and i just could not finish it
trust me i tried and there was a period of two weeks when i couldnt bring myself to even turn the game oni thought a westernthemed rpg would be something really unique but i was wrong
this has got to be one of the most cliched things ive ever seen
its the third in a series that appears to be rather popular
i did end up hating this game but strangely im not totally put off from playing a wild arms game ever again
maybe since this is the third game its just an unfortunate casuality of sequelitisthe goodthe musics pretty good
its appropriately whistlely and twangy like the fare youd find in most spagetti westerns and really sets the western tonefighting on horseback
this only unique from a visual point of view
the game still plays in exactly the same turnbased final fantasyesque way as if you were on foot but it looks really cool as you race across the desert fending off creepiessave anywhere
you can provided you have an item called a gimel coin but luckily those are easy to findthe badcliched plot
it starts out with promise
your four heroes meet up during a train robbery when some burly gunmen try to steal an artifact belonging to this indian shaman tribe called the baskars
classic western
then the adventurers called drifters team up and take an assignment from the baskars head shaman to awaken the four guardians of the planet filgaia so maybe the desertification of the planet will stop
its down hill from there
suddenly instead of a western game im playing a cliched find the four scared elemental crystalsdragonsbetamax vcrs quest but with firearms
soon our foursome discovers that this weird demon cult is out to infuse the planet with evil energy and transform it into a demon world or some other rot by using guardians and ancient artifacts
so they set out to discover why filgaia is dying and play followthebad guys
its almost like playing final fantasy vii over again and i never liked that game much in the first placecharacters that come right out of anime central casting
the characters are very archetypal and never try to break out of their mold
you have gallows a neerdowell shaman who learns some bland lesson on freedom heritage and selfactualization on the journey
brainy tough guy clive who might have been a better drawn character if his marital troubles were explored in more detail
jet enduro surly antisocial amnesiac and worst of the bunch virginia maxwell
for some reason they make her their leader even though she is the least expirenced of the bunch
shes naive gulliable and not all that smart trusting people she should know better than to trust and walking into obvious traps
shes one of those annoyingly perky types and her come on guys
lets do our best for justice truth and blah blah is more big bird than clint eastwood
shes also looking for the deadbeat dad she hasnt seen in  years
the anime feel is helped along by the video sequences complete with corny songs that sandwich the game when you begin and end it during each period of play
trust me
its frickkn annoying after youve seen them ten timessandcraft battles
during the game you get a sandcraft vehicle
if you run into a monster in this thing the way the battles plays out is very different than on foot or horseback
thats not good because they battles are so bloody slow that they can last for over five minutes eachthe uglyhealing items are hard to find
healing items are scarce so it becomes neccesary to ration stretigically
there are some sections of the game that are so hard that having a big cache of heal berries is the only way to stay alive
it adds challenge but since i didnt enjoy the game it just it that more annoyingsearch system
if you want to find something on the map you need to get directions first and move slowly across the map sending out some kind of sonar to make the ruin town or whatever appear
its time consuming and also makes the game extremely linearboring level design
youll send more of youre time trekking through the various ruins that litter the landscape
in the ruins you solve various puzzles ranging from easy to what am i supposed to do here
difficulty
a critic once said level design was key and wild arms  makes me see how right he was
all the ruins look exactly the same
i know im throwing a switch in the ruin in the north but i did the exact same thing in the ruin to the south which also had a box puzzle like the ruin in the west
get my point
it feels like im doing the same thing over and over again
im not traveling to a forest of doom or a cloud city of eternal happiness
its just ruins and towns and they all look the samei was hoping for a western adventure
this game let me down
i was hoping for a unique rpg but boy was i wrong
this game is boring
im glad i got it at a clearance price
i reget ever getting this game
i hope i can sell it  very soondont waste your moneythis is absolutley terrible what were they thinking
the graphics alone rank
i shouldnt even refer to them as graphics but rather quotcartoonquot graphics
the mission and storyline are bogus and lame
i dare anyone who says this is a great game to play eas two tower or return of the king then play this oneif you dont mind wasting your money then go for it and buy it but if you want great games that enhance the lotr book and movies go and buy eas two towers and return of the kingi hate this game
the only reason i have it is because when i bought a spyro game it was free
i played it probably  times before i found out its was boring and impossible to beat
i have never been a fan of lord of the ring but i thoght the game would be ok i was wrong
it was horrible
i have never played it in over  year
even if you are a big fan of lord of the rings i think your going to find this game boring and stupidplease tell me if my reveiw was helpful or noti made a terrible mistake and bought this game for  the day it came out
if i waited a month which i wished i did i couldve bought it for 
this has to be by far one of the worst games i ever played
needless to say i played it for about  minutes and quit i never played it again
i thought it was boring graphics and movement were terrible
honestly if someone gave me this game for free i wouldnt take it
i love the books all  movies were great this game shouldnt exist
i wasnt too impressed with the other lord of the rings games either but this one is definately the worst out of all
try to avoid this one at all costwow what a let down
heres the short version
horrible control
very awkward especially the camera
worst camera ive seen in a game like this in a long long long time
shortsmalllinear
laughably short
i beat this game in  hours
no cheats no hintsso short so easy just laughablego buyrent drakan the ancients gate
uses a similar engine the good parts done by surreal but just a much much much better game in every way imaginablei certainly wouldnt recommend buying this and i be hard pressed to even recommend renting it its not even worth the  bucks it cost to rentwhat a let down avoid at all costscommon sense to me in making a good video game sequalwould be sticking to what made the previous installments greatnope
that aint gonna happen in this age
for some reason game developers are almost sadisticaly compelled to add new stuff and completely throw away the tried and true elements that veterans of a series have come to know and lovesuikoden  is the fourth rpg that i have played for the ps which originated on an older systemand like the other threewild arms legend of legia  and final fantasy xit bites because they change way too muchalmost to the point of feeling like an entirely diffrent game instead of a sequali hate to say itbut i think the death of good rpgs is upon usfun and traditonal gameplay is being replaced with eye candy and foreign conceptsid rather play good ol dragon warrior on the bit nintendo than these peices of junki strongly advise lovers of the first two installments of suikoden to rent this game before buying itto sum this up quickly this is one of the most bland boring slow and inspirationless rpgs i have ever played in my life
the battles reach a new level of monotony and the extremely stiff animations bland backgrounds and a total lack of texture variety contribute to this
the hugely frequent random battles are a huge turnoff as youd think rpg designers all realized that random battles are not fun
the story is absolutely ridiculous and in the five or six chapters for all the characters that i trudged through nothing happened that was at all interesting
nothing
of the three main characters only hugo is worth playing since hes the only one that ever shows emotion or does anything worth watching
chris and that mercenary guy whose name i forget are complete jokes
theyre the most pointless character designs ive ever seen
their stories are absolutely no fun
dont even get me started on the secret chapters that you can unlock
toms for example is a quest across the same three towns where you recruit people
you dont know who you can recruit so you have to talk to everyone in every town and sometimes buy an item for them to convince them to join you
fun
as for the music and sound theyre just as subpar
sound effects are sparse and the music is as uninspired as it gets
i actually kept this game thinking it would get better considering the raving reviews and the awesome intro but its absolutely pathetic
a massive tarnish on the suikoden seriesdo not buy this game not like the original snes version
it is also way too hard
their is just way too much going on for such a small screen you cant help but get disoriented
this game should of never been made for game boy
on a big screen with a real controller yeah it would totally be coolwhatever happened to the shinobi plotlines in the old genesis games such as shadow dancer legend of shinobi and shinobi iii
what happened to joe mushasi and his faithful dog sidekick
what about the evil union lizard corp
none of that is in this
its just generic hokum and the ninja dude is the only one to save the daythe graphics are very cool and the soundtrack amiable enough but the gameplay is so boring and gets very old and tired even by the second stage
it was cool slicing the bad folks in half the first few times but when the game takes time out to show them spurting blood for the fiftymillionth time it seriously gets on your nervestheres no variance or longlasting appeal to this
it makes me long for the oldschool shinobi
sidescrolling beat em ups such as shadow dancer are still better than this
its very dull
it looks good but it plays poorlybeware
i watch all the reviews and thought it was a good game wrogggggggggg i played for two stages and that was it for melost all interest right away
so beware this is a waste of moneyim not going to waste writing more because it doesnt zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sorry i felt sleep i try to play it again zzzzzzzzzzzzif your looking for the old spyro you wont find it here
vivendi universal has totally trashed the spyro legacyanything that can be wrong with a game is in this one
looks like vivendi universal released this game before they even tested it because as far as im concerned this game is unplayable
long load times and frame rate problems are just a few of the problems
i played this game for  minutes and i could not play it anymore
dont waste your money
buy insomniacs new game ratchet amp clank
its  bucks cheaper and  times better
fyi  insomniac was the original developer of spyroi mean look spyro was good in his early days but now hes garbage
the spyro saga has took a turn for the worst
i mean this game grows boring reel fast and im glad i rented it
spyro was one of my favorite games now its one of the best games that can spell garbage
do not enven spend ur money  rent or spend ur time  borrow this is the game that tarnished the shining sagaits astonishing to see so many positive reviews for this game
i could only stand it for about  minutes before i quit
lousy controls terrible graphics especially on a big monitor awful pathfinding click somewhere and hope it doesnt take you somewhere you didnt expect like right by a guard
pretty boring to bootwho could possibly give this game five stars
im beginning to lose faith in amazons rating systemthe game dident play at allvery disapointedfeel lied to about conditionwaste of money so unhappy with thisive been waiting two years for this
this game is a jokethe graphics are nowhere near what the claims areit waslike steppin back into the seventies and playing defenderor something along those linesonly it wasnt that funif you want killer graphics get enclaveevery game shouldlook that goodthere is no excuse for grainy or childishgraphicsin this day and ageits just plain lazythis game is stupid its so incredbaly boring i played it for like  minutes than i couldnt stand how stupid it was
one of biggest disspointments of the yearmaybe rent but dont waste your money on it by buying itno wonder this game is bad its on xboxwell all the hype on the demo disks made me go out and buy this xbox live
it looks like a pretty good product but when i went to set it up nope couldnt connect
when i visited the xbox live website i was informed that it will not work with aol broadband
i thought since i could use my playstation network adapter that aol had also allowed xbox live
guess i assumed incorrectly
the headset is a little tricky to put together but everything seems nice
playing the demos included with the xbox live disk are fun but they are only demos
i do wish that for the cost of this you would have gotten a full version game with itunfortunately ill be taking this back or selling it since my pleas to aol to allow xbox live are answered with quotwere aware of this situation and are working on solutions to allow thisquotplease dont buy this game my husband played it twice and both times in different areas the game just locked up
we tried getting another disc and it did the same thing halfway through and in different missions the game once more locked up
rent it only that way you are saved from the locking up
i believe that ubi soft put alot of bad discs on the market and yet we havent found one that didnt lock up
rent dont buyworst game i have everplayed wasteoftime and of moneyi am thoroughly confused as to how this game rates so highlyi recently saw that it was up for game of the decade at one of my favorite gaming websites and was utterly flabbergastedstory  starsfor a gba game its a fine story
for a metroid game its awful
there is no sense of isolation a key factor of the franchise
samus is following nonsensical orders from a computer with zero effort to justify them
the entire game the player is told to slowly traverse seven various areas of a large space station each time allowing your enemies to further infiltrate the station
and why
for no reason
a quick boildown of the premise  there are parasites on board they are incredibly dangerous and cannot safely be interacted with
go run around with them reacting to their presence on the ship and helping them spread
uhoh
things arent going well
why how did that happen
the only reason this story gets a second star out of five is that were one to take the metroid logo off of it slap new names on the characters and pretend its a new franchise it would be slightly less intolerablegameplay  starsthe worst comment for a metroidstyle game it is unbelievably linear
the player has zero option as to how to proceed
doors are locked or unlocked for you and you cannot get around them until the very end of the game
whats worse you are forced to hold poorlywritten oneway conversations with the computer character between every action
enter a new area talk to the pc
find a powerup talk to the pc
see a boss off in the distance talk to the pc
i found this absolutely inexcusablesamus is simultaneously overpowered for some enemies and wholely defenseless against others
the vast majority of enemies and most bosses take two shots to kill and dont cause any damage when they hit you
several other bosses and a handfull of general enemies can kill samus with three or so hits and require all your missiles to kill
there seems to be no logic as to enemies difficulties and you will often find yourself frustrated by situations where you can only succeed if very luckythere are so many powerups as to make it completely unfulfilling to collect them
furthermore while most are lying in plain view and the player walks into them as a matter of course others are so meticulously hidden and require painstaking repeated effort to collect as to be intolerably frustrating and not worth the effort
the casual gamer will be bored and the completionist will be frustrated
its just awfulreplay  starsif you can actually bring yourself to pick this game up a second time youll find both the linearness and the forced conversations with the computer character even more mindnumbing
there are few things worse than a forced cutscene which you cannot skip slowly explaining something you already know
there is simply no point in replaying this gameoverall  starsits just a bad game
and its absolutely awful for a metroid game
i greatly regret this purchase and for the life of me cannot understand how it gets such good reviewsthis one i dont get
the developers of this game took the time to license the actual theme song of the sorely missed tv series got the actual actors jessica alba and michael weatherly to do the voices for the characters which lends a great degree of authenticityand managed to come up with a horrible horrible gametheres nothing wrong with the look of the game and the dark angel franchise fits the popular genre of stealthespionage games quite wellbut i noticed one thing amiss right off the bat  wheres the tutorial level
every game ive ever played which involves stealth like metal gear solid syphon filter and splinter cell  pandora tomorrow gives you a tutorial mission because in a stealth game not only do you have to know the controls you have to get familiarized with them within a gradual learning curve so that movement of your character becomes second nature in a stealth game no good player ever remembers the moves  he feels them
but dark angel has chosen to forego this step and the result is that the controls already not hugely responsive are all but alien to me
i figured out some things on my own  the manual is scanty and poorly written  but nothing can replace the allimportant tutorialtheres also no radar a must in a game of this type and looking around is laborious and risky
most of the time the camera prevents you from seeing what you need to see to sneak through the missions effectively
no maps either  and added to the fiddly mission layouts i spent so much time running around missions trying to find things that the gameplay just slowed to a crawl
to slow things down even more the loading times on this game are incredible
even the replay stage command when youre trying to stop your current mission and start from the top takes about a minute to load
awfuli dont like the proportions of this game  too much environment and not enough of the character
it makes moving around seem more sluggish than it should be and when youre fighting it really spoils much of the fun factor
id rather have had a characterscreen proportion closer to syphon filter or jet lis rise to honor
and whoever came up with the idea of using a matrixstyle bullet time while you fight obviously doesnt know how to design fighting games because it makes fighting a bore
you cant control when the slowmotion occurs so you end up having to wait before you can execute the next move
this feature basically takes your ingame control of your character away from you randomly  something that should never happen in an action gamei am tremendously disappointed because the tv series the wonderful character of max the settingeverything was just perfect for a videogame translation
and they had taken the effort to get alba and weatherly put james camerons name on the box and get so many of the stylistic touches right good oneliners in the dialogue that its a shame that the game is mechanically unplayable
seems like they spent all their money and time on aesthetics and forgot to test out the mechanicsno wonder this game is now widely available secondhand for less than six dollars less than a year after i first saw it available
i will probably sell mine soonthe developers of this game dropped the ball like a ton of bricks
dont get me wrong
the idea was cool four characters each with their own technique and weapons trying to rid the world of zombies and other possessed creatures
but believe me thats where the excitement endsfrom what i hear playing this with  friends is where the fun lies but if youre going alone the only reasonable character choice is duece
he is the strongest and has the most reach with his axe
youll find that he is the only one capable of handling the endless amount of enemies that appear out of nowhere which is one of the games biggest problemsthe enemies keep respawning
whats the point of killing tens of monsters if theyre only going to respawn seconds later
its repetative and pointless
theres almost nothing worse than fighting through an area only to find that the same people you killed a moment ago keep coming backanother huge problem with this game is the camera angles
you have zero control over it
all this game allows you is a zoom in feature which only serves to make your experience worse
countless times i found myself turning a blind corner and having to actually walk a few seconds before the camera allowed me to see down that path
thats the kind of thing that gets you needlessly killednext we have the bosses
okay so whos bright idea was it to make bosses so cheasy
the first boss i fought had a horde of monsters helping him kill me and none of them were moving slow enough for me to think too hard
the second one a teddy bear wouldnt stop chasing me
i had to literally run around in circles avoiding killer spirits while occasionally jumping to avoid teddy bear induced earth quakes and vomit all the while trying to get a shot with my special weapon
you literally only have seconds to get that one shot off
by the way if you run out of ammo for that special weapon just restart because you will not defeat that leader with anything else
sound like fun
i didnt think sothe next problem is the cycling of the weapons
during the game i found that it takes certain weapons to destroy certain creatures
for example the spirits and gargoyles cannot be killed with guns and the spiders and alligators cannot be killed with blunt strikes unless you want to die of course
ive tried and it resulted in either my death or a huge loss of energy
its a nice concept but youll find yourself running back and forth as you try to cycle from one weapon to another as you attempt to rid yourself of deadly spiders as the spirits are coming at you simultaneouslythe final problem is the need to reload your special weapon
okay i understand this concept but then ammo is not easy to come by
why couldnt they just make this like blood rayne and give you the chance to reload when you kill someone who has a gun
also why does the chainsaw have such a short limit
its not like it does any more damage than your regular weaponso basically the game sucksone more thing
the guy that does the voice for the mysterious dark creature that tells you why this happened sounds like the mayor of grant city in dead to rights
they sound exactly the same in fact only this character is overly melodramatici played hunter in role playing game and is really funny and awesome but this game sucks the game dont have a good gameplay the characters looks like a manga cheap kind the only bottom i use is the gun bottom because is the only thing you can made
the music is cheaper and the story is stupida friend purchased this game for me recently to try since he has been playing it for approximately two months
i played the game for about two weeks from about may th to th client stability and server availabilityin general the game engine is about as sophisticated as many three to four year old games  regarding graphics audio and general complexity
so it runs very well even on older hardwarethe servers are brought down fairly regularly
i didnt play every day but it seems as though the servers were down every day sometimes for several hours sometimes just for oneaudiovisualthis game looks and feels three or fours years old
its prosaic and unremarkable in this department
really nothing worth mentioninggame playeve online can be summarized as the greatest experience for hardcore long time mmo players
at the same time one can easily refer to it as the most boring time sink filled banal and repetitious computer gaming experience ever fabricated in mind or reality
unless youre a masochist this game is not for you
in my humble opinionsupport and serviceyour petitions for supportassistance are only handled during scheduled outages
even so it routinely takes ten or more hours for issues to be addressed and roughly half the time the issues are not resolved
once my character became locked that is the client would crash whenever i attempted to log into it
i was told two days after submitting my petition that this was due to a bug that required game master intervention and that they had corrected it
however all of my resources that i had spent a week collecting were missing
i politely requested assistance acquiring the lost items a typical and benign problem in all mmos
i was denied told that it was not in the eula odd that they would refer to the end user license agreement for software for this issue and  get this  actually told by support that i can feel free to cancel my subscription
heh
amazing customer service there
so i didconclusionold technology and graphics constant outages poor audio repetitious game play filled with outdated time sinks and extremely poor customer support
i recommend avoiding this gamei bought a nyko worm cam a while ago and i am really disappointed
it advertises that it takes great digital pictures but it really doesnt
it is very slow and hard to use and the color is always grainy and dull
if you try to print your pictures they always come out blurry if you print them any bigger than wallet size
it is also hard to aim your picture it doesnt have any sort of view finder or anything like that
and if you take pictures outside and its a cloudy day you still have to use that small easy to lose sun filter
i wish i hadnt wasted my money on this lousy piece of junk and i hope you dont eitheryears ago i asked for and got this nyko camera for my gba
taking pictures with it is fairly easy and it has a bunch of nice features and modes for it
picture quality is horrible though
even in the correct modes the best quality pics were not easy to even recognize what it was of
the pc uploading software is basic and worthless for two reasonsit wont work correctly on newer pcsas bad as the pictures are that it takes you wont even want to save them
youd be embarrassed to be seen saving themplease for your own sake if you want a gba camera save your money and buy a good onei expected this game to be a fitting sequel to dark cloud which was repetitive but fun overall but it isnt its just repetitive
the graphics look amazing but thats the only plus
it does use the same dungeon crawler style but the enemies are downright pathetic youre weilding a wrench as a weapon not a sword
you pretty much die the moment you get hit
i recently put it back into my ps because id decided i never really gave it too much of a chance but it was a big mistake
it made me hate myself even more for wasting all that money and time
youd be happier if you threw your money into an office shredder
a giant elephant and a big fat clown with dynamite strapped to his halfnaked body  its not the psychotic kind of clown you see  in horror movies either
is hardly worth  fighting if at all and the story is utterly ridiculous
by the time max actually saw the outside world i expected the problem and solution to be explained but all we get is a bad guy destroyed the world and we dont know why
they never even explain where the characters are going and whythe races in the last game though underdeveloped as characters were loads more interesting than anything i ever saw in this  poor excuse for a sequel
i played long enough to encounter the firbits
rip offs of the seven dwarves from snow white
they even have you keep an eye out for a woman who appeared in their forest one day made their lives better and mysteriously disappeared
nothing about this game keeps the player interested
you dont know why max does anything when the adventure starts or how monica supposedly came from the future when the first time we see her shes in a castle  fighting stupid looking monsters and the next time shes a boy  with an oversized shirt on who apparently has a knack for  transmitting telekinetic messages into maxs mindi got hours in and nothing makes sense
nothing
i think they  just drew the scenes and characters from a hat and patched them together at random
youd be better off buying a product called heart attack in a can
dont  buy thisi play alot of the atv games and this one just stunk
one thing camera angle bad
i bought this games for a  at a store brand new i understand why it was cheap because people kept on returnig it
so use your mouse and click on a differnt atv game because this one is badok the graphics for the game are killer
no doubt about it top notch pretty cool
heres the bad no health meters you cant punch anybody only pistol whip your charcter is arrested way too easyily
the controls of this game really suck
and you cant adjust them to make them the way you want themi really cant belive they made a game look so cool have such great feautures then make playing the actual game suck
there are movie sequences that you cant fast forward threw and they take litterly forever
i wish they had kept working on this game it had so much potential but it fell flat on its face
this game take forever to play
its extremly boring
lots of driving and stupid police chases that start for no reasonsorrry getaway but you no good vanna talks way too much most of it useless commentary even ai player voices are rediculous
loads very slow between rounds
many of the small failures of this game will make you not want to play it
they took a relativly simple game and made it slowpaced and annoying
i dont see how so many people gave this game a high rating
clearly they dont know anything about video games
just like the people who creating this onelookdid micro not learn anything from from the failure of those ridiculous expensive xbox bundles trying to make you buy about five games with the system
come oni like the xbox but i am not going to spend a lot on a controller that looks like it can a wheel block for a bull dozer
its also a lot bigger than the xbox too taking up so much space that i almost have to get a table to make it get used correctly
if the xbox is so powerful why dont they make a controller that is less expensive like say the force feed back controllers
i like mech games but micro has turned me off from this one
ill save my money for mech assaultwaste of time and money
i hought it had the original arcade game
not only did it not have the original game but it would not even boot in the xbox consolethe camera angles in this game absolutely stink
they remain fixed and do not follow you around as you move through the game
this method of gameplay worked pretty well in the hit series resident evil but plays out very poorly in this game
its difficult to maintain fighting sequences with bad guys and to see exactly what youre doing
the fighting sequences are very frustrating and the punch and kick combos look terrible batman kicks low to the shins
now thats low for the dark knightthe tools also stink
the batarangs and smoke bombs are awkward to use and pretty much unusuable during combati do have to give this game some props for the music track and style  both of which are very good
but the gameplay is awkward
this game is difficult and not in a good way
huge batman fans prepare to be disappointedbatman dark tomorrow is a study in poorly conceived aggravating gameplay and marks yet another failed caper for the caped crusader
even diehard fans will want to tie the disc to a batarang and hurl it out the window
just hope it doesnt come backis it possible to produce a good game based batman
i cant remember ever playing a good one going all the way back to the old quotbatman returnsquot on the sega genesis
and this game is even worse than that
it features the worst camera angles ive ever seen on a game while moving the camera suddenly shifts and you find yourself going in some other unintended direction
the graphics are subpar
the only good thing about this game is the cutscenes  theyre first class
but apparently the budget for the game was spent on this feature alone because the gameplay and graphics are awfulthis should give you an idea of how bad it is
i bought it yesterday and attempted to trade it in today
the guy at eb was so ashamed of how bad the game was he refunded me the full pricedefinately not worth buying if you consider read the reviews on here first
any reviews with one or two stars on this is correct
unfortunately all the negative reviews on here are correctits not every day that i advocate video games becoming more derivative but in the case of jeopardy
 ill make an exceptionive played a lot of videogame versions of jeopardy
 which has gotten easier to adapt as video game technology has improved
in the early s the sega genesis version was a nightmare to play as you had to spell out answers in their entirety with just a dpad and three easilyconfused buttons for select letter delete letter and accept
games took well over an hour to play and punished players who accidentally submitted incomplete responses by pushing the wrong button
worse there was no way for the cartridge to remember which questions had already been used so you always risked getting repeat questions which killed the fun and novelty of the gamethe cdi version of all things
in  was a breakthrough by substantially solving these problems
first it had a list of completions so after entering a few letters of your response you could see it matching an alphabetical list of possible answers and just arrow over and pick the completion
this dramatically sped up game play
the other fix was that the game could use the small kb
builtin memory of the cdi player to log which questions had already been used effectively eliminating repeat questions
with the copious cd storage it was also possible to read the questions aloud  while not necessary it was a nice touch
the only flaw was that the controller  had a clear and obvious advantage over controller  when ringing inthe playstation jeopardy
s polished the completion system of the cdi version and saved the question usage stats to the memory card
in other words it didnt fix what wasnt broken it just took jeopardy done right to a wide audience than would have seen the cdi versionand now the playstation  version arrives with this history of jeopardy
video game evolution behind it and promptly proceeds to ignore it
while it uses a sensible completion system for entering answers it makes the stunningly boneheaded move of not saving stats about question usage to the memory card allowing repeat questions to appear at potentially any time at least the genesis version allowed you to reject categories you knew youd already seen  ataris ps version isnt even that smart
what the heck were the atari engineers and producers thinking
apparently they were too focused on features nobody really needs like having cpu contestants answer with actual audio replies instead of onscreen text memo to atari nobody caresincreasingly powerful systems should allow jeopardy
to become more like the actual game show with each generation  eventually the game should be able to use a microphone and speech recognition technology to let players speak their answers aloud
but more important than the technology is a basic competence and awareness of gameplay issues of fun that this game screws up with the single avoidable mistake of not logging question usage to avoid repeat questionswhat were they thinking porting one of the greatest nes games of alltime kirbys adventure to the gba
the music is wrong the sounds are wrong the gameplay is wrong and the difficulty is easier
it coundnt have gotten worse than this
if your gonna make a port atleast leave the game as it was and try to get the name right or it will ruin the game for everyone
they shoud have came out with a totally new kirby game for the gba and brought this one to the gc in mayby something like a kirby collectors addition with games such as kirbys dreamland and  kirbys adventurekirby super star kirbthe crystal shards and more
now that is a great ideathis game is one of the shortest games ive played  for those of you who like to play a long game with a lot of worlds  this game is not for you at all
but for those of you who like a really short game  hunting for treasure chests  and some comedy that rolls through out the game  then this is probably for youthis game looks weird without mario
besides your doing what wario allways does
stealing treasure
i bet this will be hardi love history and i love rpgs so it goes without saying i was anticipating quotlionheartquot for a long time
the game has an interesting premise and it uses fallouts quotspecialquot system
i thought that reflexive and black isle could not possibly screw up this great combination
boy was i wrong
quotlionheartquot is poor in every category
this terrible game simply does not have one redeeming quality about itto start off with the year outdated graphics are mediocre creature and character animations stink and the artwork is nonexistent
every screen is covered endtoend in grey or black and has the visual appeal of an irs  form or a dirty ash tray
you can let your imagination run wild with how exotic and cool medieval europe could have looked after a great big cosmic magical rift
i say quotyouquot could because the designers for this game obviously didnt
where are the snowcapped mountains exotic palaces beautiful forests and lakes
theyre in quotdivine divinityquot thats where
quotlionheartquot looks more like wyoming after a great big forest fire
quotdivine divinityquot is but one game puts quotlionheartquot to shame in the graphics department and everything else as well
all of the recent dungeons and dragons games look better than this because of their exceptional artwork and creativity
even the flop scifi quotharbingerquot looked better than thisbut graphics dont really matter that much do they
i guess not  i could easily ignore them but the gameplay is terrible too
the way that the turnbased special system has been butchered in this game is inexcusable
a realtime game that uses a turnbased system can succeed if you can pause the game to issue orders
that is why realtime dungeons and dragons have been so successful
however this game has the mindbogglingly stupid feature of not letting you do this
you can pause the game but not to issue attack orders
there is no autopause feature that stops the game for you when someone rushes onto the screen
the tactical genius and elegance that made fallouts combat great is nonexistent
that leaves you with a realtime extremely low quality diablo clone complete with a red bulb for health and a blue bulb for mana
you leftclick to attack you use a hotkey to select your active spell and then rightclick to cast the spellhow groundbreakingquotdiablo clonequot would be a compliment for quotlionheartquot though because the combat engine is pitiful otherwise
enemies are unoriginal and poorly animated
you reveal the fog of war by exploring ugly areas and run into ugly repetitive enemies bitbybit
they simply yell out a quotraawwrrrquot and rush at you at light speed before you can cast more than one spell or fire an arrow from your useless bow
if you specialize in ranged combat or magic you literally will not survive the first area of this game no matter how many times you reload
this game is more unbalanced towards melee characters than quotarcanumquot wasthe games intrusive interface blocks your view of the world by taking up almost a third of the screen but it somehow still manages to be functionally inadequate
a dubious accomplishment
you only get  thats right  hotkeys for spells and other actions
compare that with games like neverwinter nights which made full use of the f keys for  total hotkeys
expect to find yourself casting the same few unimpressivelyanimated spells over and overneedless to say i did not finish this game so i cannot comment about the story from starttofinish
however i can say that the portion of the game that i played through offered no indication that it would be special
quoti am some sort of mysterious chosen one and some bad men want to kill me because of itquot is the basic premise
a cliche storyline is nothing new and some games are still great in spite of it but its not enough to make you want to toil through a game that is just plain badi wanted to love this game but i cant
i tried to like it but i failed
reflexive alienated hardcore rpg fans by screwing up the quotspecialquot system and then screwed up the mindless action so that quotdiabloquot fans could hate it too
i wish that i could say that its a simple hackandslash adventure but i canquott because the hackandslash aspects of the game stink
quotlionheartquot is by far the worst rpg that i have played since before baldurs gate and i am thinking it might be the worst i have ever played
a trashpile like this doesnt even deserve the bargain binits lowbrow humor at its easiest
dick jokes prostitutes dog sex  it pretty much runs the gamut
if youre fine with that sorta thing then definitely check bmx xxx out
the game itself is pretty bad though
not enjoyably bad unfortunately
it does a subpar job of ripping off the tony hawk games released around the same time and the graphics look several years out of date even for its release date in the early sif you took dave mirra bmx throw in some srtippers and the game sucked youd get bmx xxx
this game mearly uses cheap gimmicks as way to make up for the crummy gameplay most of the goals in the career mode are almost impossible to complete mostly because the game barely gives you enough information to figure out what your actually suppose to do
i admit the game does have its share of funny stuff but its not enough to keep me playing and the game videos arent even worth the effort if your only playing for the xrated content your better of with the internet
how the game manage to warrant m rating still puzzles menot worth spending time or money on
i would rather buy gi
joe game than this sorry rip off the originalall i get are crc errors when i try to install on my laptop a hp i purchased last year
the drivers are updated and i have directx  installed so there shouldnt be any problems
i tried contacting tech support several days ago but they still havent gotten back to me
i really want my money back but i know thats not going to happen
just avoid this game if you have a hp laptop because it will probably not workif you have no values in life other than yourself this game is for you
i got rid of it as i did not want my dog to get any ideas
cross the street and find a better gamei remember buying this game and thinking this is going to be another cool shooting game kinda like max payne
well i was completely wrong on both accounts
this game is terrible and it is nothing like max payne
the graphics are some of the worst i have ever seen in a video game even for the time period that this game came out in
the controls are also some of the worst i have ever encountered
the worst part of this game however is the plotgameplay
in short  there is no plot
this guy just runs around killing things while his stupid pet does dumb tricks that a real dog would never dothis game is a cheap knockoff of max payne and it performs poorly
i would recommend sticking your head in the toilet over buying this game
at least you can take a shower afterwardsi cant even describe how bad this game is compare it to the first one and you have a choclate poopy mud stain in your ps collection
gameplay is repititive and too easy
dante never talks and i liked him in the first and in the rd
if you want to get all devil may cry games do your self a favor and pick only  or  i have the game guide in may bath room  but not for readingwhat was capcom thinking when they said this would be a great idea
everyone must have been having a bad year to have created this monstrosity
we left the world of dante with high hopes for the next installment of the dmc devil may cry series
we knew there was going to be another game and we welcomed it with open arms
until we got it
this game is downright bad
though the first game had hokey dialogue just like this one it made up for it in the level of excitement and badassery that was dante
now we got a dante that has a slightly longer coat the ability to run on walls like in the matrix and a nonexistent level of cockinessdante as a playable character is not alone
we are forced to use a separate disc with this lucia woman to get the grand scheme of the story
each disc individually can be played through in about four hours eight total but the creators of the game expected you to switch back and forth between the two to understand what in the world was going on
i value my ps tray too much to be switching between the two like that so i played them separately and stitched together what i didnt know without a great stretch of my imagination
simply put the story was awful
why dante would even get involved with the young lucia and the ancient matier is reduced to the simple fact that demons are running amok
at the very least in the first game dante was interested in participating in trishs request because of her resemblance to his mother
there is only a promise of a story from matier
so i have to run around battling demon tanks buildings helicopters monkeys aquatic tendrils and a boss fight that is as easy as eating pumpkin pie on thanksgiving for a story
id rather waste my time watching paint dryif youre hellbent on playing it play the dante disc and just assume the storyline
theres no other reason to play this game except for a lingering sense of pride in the dmc seriesgood lord capcom what were you thinking when you released dmc
i cant believe how dumb someone could be
almost everything sucks dante isnt very hardcore anymore the levels are too openyou can use guns to beat the game seriously its too dang easy and its too dang stupid for its own good
capcom should be tortured for this
devil may cry  will be better than this
believe me im a big dmc freakwell i had beaten lotr the return of the king  which was incredibly fun and had a great setup
so i decided to work my way backward through the games starting with lotr the two towers
wow
it was horrible the graphics were much worse the lotr the return of the king i started and the intro where you learn how to fight was just sad
it was the same buttons as before but it took forever for it to explain them all and it was dull nowhere to go so you had to just sit there waiting for orcs
after what seemed like forever i moved onto the next scene
the fighting was horrible i could have taken the nine in lotr the return of the king but the combat in this game wasnt any good so the moves that happened so quickly before were slowed down to an agonizing rate
i finnaly decided that if its going to be that bad now why sit here and deal with the whole game
i thought it would be much better than it was and i advise you to exclude this from your shopping listthis a horrible game
theres more bad stuf in the game than goodfirst off i did think that being able grab people as hostages was greati also liked that he was alowed to say profane words
but if you ever notice most people face look the same in this game
also if you ever shoot at a window it doesnt break no sound nothing
the graphics are horrible they look like n graphics
and in some parts of the game u have to go jumping off edges and stuf com on thisis a shooting game not and adventure
also you cant really explore or go in another direction its just one way
everythings scripted and the peolpe know your here right away
like they know your supposed to go that way
the frame rate in the game is excelent cause the graphics are bad
and for a game that has great frame rate they should of atleast put a multiplayer like  cause its smoothe like this game
but they didnt
justsave your money its not worth itavoid this onei wondered about this game because i saw it cheap in a lot of shops
it looks like it could be interesting  fun
its just a bunch of chaos
pointless random chaos all around you is not fun
trust me
whatever the mission was at the time the fact all these mindless ai i use the term ai loosly here are running wild in seemingly infinite numbers ruins the point of gaming
i got rid of it  the folks at the store i took it back to were like i feel youi have owned this game for  days now and even though im told its a short game i cant get through it
i keep getting killed and instead of starting over from my own save spot like most other games in this i have to start the whole chapter over again
this sucks as some of these are long and take a while to get back to where you were killed
this is more then just an annoyance but should be outlawed in game making
this does nothing more then frustrate and make a gamer angry
and if the game is a good one its bad enough but this is a lousy game to begin with and just makes me much madder and much more frustated that i ever bought the stupid thing to begin with
the graphics are terrible the artwork is amateur the story lame and the sounds well terriblethis game is so forgettable and such a huge waste of time that i can only kick myself over and over for being stupid enough to buy it but i like many others was thinking that it would be a decent game like its predessorred faction the first was not a great gane but it was fun and worth playing
it was not even close to being a favorite or even worth playing again but the price was right and i felt like it was a fair deal
this one feels like i got completely ripped off
i was cheated and i have nobody to blame but me for not reading the reviews first
live and learn
just because the st game is good dont figure the nd one will be as wellyou would think the makers of this would have wanted to keep the buying customers happy and make sure the second one was a good one
they blew it
and now they have their new one coming out
the gorilla and i will be reading alot of reviews before plopping down my money again
dont buy this one and check the next one real goodi have written and rewritten this review and this is my final offer
any wouldbe buyers of this game please take this as a caveat i really want to convey just how lousy this game is
any comparison of this game to the rest of the series is ludicrous but anywayas i said before you play the game as the character ryu a government grunt
mankind has been forced to live under the earth due to reasons lost in antiquity and the citizens are placed into their positions via a rating system a ratio  the closer the ratio is to  the more potential a person has and thus the greater station this person is allowed to have
surprisingly the higher your ratio the closer to the surface you are allowed to live despite the conviction that the outside world is poisonous
anyway the purpose of the game is to climb out from the bowels of the earth in an attempt to reach the sky
this is the story
if you find it excellent well to each his own but personallyi dont think this tale stands up to the likes of xenosaga hackinfection suikoden iii ffx etchowever complicating matters is the dhunger gauge against which i have railed in the past
as you progress through the game this gauge constantly rises increasing about  of a percent every  seconds on its own
should your character transform into a dragon or use other special abilities the rate of increase rises dramatically
assuming you never use any of these abilities however you essentially have  seconds to finish your game or about  hours
failing at this it is game over
in fact you have to restart your game from the beginning
there is no carrying over of statistics what can be carried over are the weapons and armor you have equipped any items you have stored away the skills you have learned and party experience which can be used to boost your characters upon the replay
furthermore if you are considering beating the game on your first go around dont
it is physically impossible i know i tried it out
i have a lot of words to describe this atrocious system but realistic isnt the first to come to mindi believe in innovation when it makes a game more fun
however this is absurd
you want the trick to beat the game
simply play through as far as you go twice remembering to store all of your acquired items and never use party experience
that way on your third time through you can buff up your characters so much that they will destroy any enemy they come across yes i decided to go back and finish the game
hence an  hour game becomes a  hour game since every scene is seen three times
the fact that you cant save often is a blessing in disguise  saving doesnt really help you anyway the dhunger gauge isnt going anywhere
oh and for a more realistic gaming experience notice that you have a quit command
this command essentially allows you to save at a certain spot and then use you dragon abilities to try to acquire certain skills and items you might not otherwise be able to acquire
oh sure youll die but you can start over at the save spot with all of the abililities now in your repertoire
in fact the guide which may be the most useless instruction guide in all of gaming oftem times confusing me more than instructing me tells you to use this strategically
the realism is overwhelming
the moral is if you try to beat the game on one walkthrough forget it
instead the system rewards ineptitude over ingenuityif you are one of those sad to say many people who simply cannot stand the mainstream and would sooner gouge out their eyes than play a game everyone else is playing this might be for you
to be sure the system is innovative and i am sure it will never rear its ugly head again
however if you enjoy fun game or if you simply dont want to waste fifty bucks on a stinker stay the hell away from this abomination
play xenosaga another innovative game or hack or even final fantasy x for the nth time
this game reeksthe only thing good about this game was the staying power of nina and ryu
this game was awful from start to finishas a hardcore bof fan since the first game back in the s i can say this is by far the worst they have ever made and its no wonder this game was the ending of the series
they should have kept a good thing going while they had the chance
anyone who plays this game before any of the others will most likely never choose to play another bof game againi am a huge rpg fan and there arent many games that i havent played
i am also a quite a fan of boff but i was very disappointed
i had to restart from the beginning of the game  times because i couldnt find any save token for the last  of the game
i had to let the ps run for  days because i couldnt find any save tokens
it sucked
especially when your girlfriend tripped over a power cord and had to restart again
although capcom had newer battle tactics and different try out for this game you were limited with only  characters through out the game and you had to finish the game with a charcter who kept dying on every boss you faceif you are a truly huge fan of boff and have to play this game its an interesting game
however if you just want to try this game please dont buy it
just rent itdespite teasing players with potentially intricate themes such as political subterfuge rebellion and betrayal the story  lynchpin of any great rpg  of breath of fire dragon quarter never strays too far from its premise
where plots are generally uninteresting it is left to the characters to enrich the experience by allowing players to identify with them through the course of their development
unfortunately beyond the fact that ryu actually has a personality in this installment the characterization is as shallow as a wading pool
once each of the three characters has established their role and you guessed it there are only three the story drags towards an uninspired conclusionplayers will reach that ending in  hours or perhaps twice that amount depending on their tolerance for repetitive dungeon crawling and agonizing play mechanics
if innovation means taking traditional turnbased combat and throwing most of it out of a window including all of its good qualities then dragon quarter has accomplished just thatthe combat system is very limited
ryu can only do sword attacks none of which is anything spectacular horizontal vertical and diagonal slashes some enhanced by fancy effects comprise his entire repertoire
nina can only do magic the usual arsenal of fire ice and lightning spells
rin can only do gun attacks that with the exception of a few all look the same but have a variety of strategic effectsroaming bland dungeons and engaging in tedious battles comprises the whole of dragon quarters gameplay
still there a few details that need to be mentioned
one of the defining elements of the breath of fire series is ryus ability to transform into a dragon
it is also often the most exciting part
unfortunately consistent with the rest of dragon quarter that ability is watered down unimpressive and does very little to ease the players sufferingin terms of visuals the games objective seems to be adequacy but never to venture as far as to be aweinspiring
the character models are bland and the animation isnt even noteworthy
the backgrounds are either sterile corridors reminiscent of hospitals gritty metallic platforms or at their best lavish medievalstyle halls
this lack of diversity creates a feeling of insufferable redundancybreath of fire dragon quarter is one of the most boring trite unfulfilling gameplay experiences in recent memory
beware of a game that advertises healing potions on the back of the box it may just be that such a trivial element is actually a highlight next to the rest of the featuresi bought this game thinking it would bear a slight resemblance to the other games in this series which i loved
however i found this game to be frustrating to the extreme
i couldnt even get past the first mission due to the goofy save system which punished you every time you died
the only way to save is to use a save token which apparently appear randomly after defeating enemies
my brotherinlaw had also bought it and hated it for this reason and also because of the dragon meter feature
evidently there is the ability for your main character to transform into a powerful dragon
the only problem is every time you do so it adds to the dragon meter which once full changes your character into a dragon permanently and then game over
why even put that stupid thing in there
why do game designers have to make saving such a chore
i want to be able to save anywhere i please at any time
we arent popping quarters into a machine so whats the point
i really wanted to like this game and i believe it would have been really good if the save system were user friendly and if theyd left out that ridiculous dragon meter
i have never in my years of gaming about  been this frustrated with and rpg and thats my favorite game genreso in conclusion unless youre a serious masochist steer clear of this game
consider yourselves warnedjust hated it not anything more to say about then that 
why bother to
make such a bad game i dont know there was like a million resident evil games and which more are coming out
whats the concept
go around kill zombies takes forever and dont be goin over your friends house to watch him play this because youll fall asleep after your tenth heart attack after drinking soda
we were at my friends birthday party and all he did was sit there and play this until we flipped out on him and begged him to do something more socialridiculousyou can buy a playstation for  bucks and a re game for only  or  bucks at any store
this is a pathetic attempt to capitalize off of idiots
do not buy this
you can buy it for n for a very cheap price as well and the graphics are the same
as far as i know they didnt really change anything about this game
i just cannot believe they are chargine so much money for this re and code veronicax unbelievable
this is a great game if you buy it for psps or n
i would rather play it on ps anyway it has a more classic old school feel to it
anyway if you are dumb enough to actually dish out  bucks for this game be aware you are ripping yourself offfirst off the gamecube ports of re re and re code veronica are not meant for vets who played them already on playstation or dreamcast
these are for newcomers to the series gamecube owners who started off with the remake and re
ignorant vets will be disappointed at the lack of new contenti became an re fan in the spring of  when the first game in the series was new
i loved it and i couldnt wait for the sequel
when re was finally announced many fans were disappointed that it had two entirely new characters instead of reusing the characters from the first game
the director explained that every re game had to have new characters because the previous characters had already been through their share of horrors and were now hardened by them
i agreed with him 
so later when re was announced and jill from re was the main character that seeded my disdain for the game
it disappointed me that the creator didnt have the balls to stick to his guns because he was right
later i came to accept the rehashing of previous characters in re games but this was the first one to do it and it annoyed meeventually the game came out and i bought it
another irking detail niggled me right out the gate re has no normal difficulty setting which is what i always play my games on when given the choice
in this game you have to choose between easy or hard
easy is insultingly easy and hard is harder than i like
however re does have some great gameplay innovations such as the gunpowder based ammo creation system and the defensive dodge move which i really wished theyd put into all following games in the series
there are also several points where you have to choose between two possible actions and the choice you make does have an effect on what happens next
the puzzles are fairly standard for an re gamere does nothing to further the storyline
its a complete sidetrack
ive always personally considered code veronica to be the true sequel to re and re to be a gaiden sidestory
recently its come out that this is the official truth and the only reason code veronica wasnt given the title re was because of the business relationship or perhaps even actual contractual obligations between capcom and sony
in some cases i would argue that if the gameplay itself is good the story doesnt matter
but the fact is re set up umbrella as the ultimate evil jerks who needed to be taken out and re did precious little to bring us closer to that goal
by the end of re youre in exactly the same place re left you no closer to taking down the bad guys
code veronica on the other hand does indeed finally take the fight directly to umbrella
and while im on the subject i really have to question the wisdom of having re take place in a world where umbrella has already been taken out completely
thats one pleasure that definitely should have been given to the playerto sum up im an re vet of eight years and i dont recommend retao feng is a below average fighting game
its best feature is the limb damage and nice graphics but everything else in the game is a miss
the controls are sluggish
youll notice a slight delay when you press the buttons to the character on screen responding to it a second later
sound effects are weak and you can barlely hear the smacks
the novelty in this game is that when you block attack too much you can have limb damage in your arms or legs
youll see the characters limping and do less damage when they attack
but they can repair their injuries when they do combo moves on you which defeats the whole purpose of limb damage
the fighting techniques are uninspired and lack that extra oomph
the characters animation look a bit stiff and lack fluidity which other fighting games have
in addition to the stiffness the characters are very ugly looking
they look like platic action figures and have a bunch of tattoos on their bodies
there are only a few fighting arenas and they are mostly dark settings
there is only a few unlockables and they are not satifying
there are better fighting games outthere save your money for thoseprosnice graphicsgood sound effectslimb damageconsugly character designsuglier musicunresponsive controlscombos are hard to pull offdifficult to block attacksshort gameweak animationdark looking arenaslacks intensityfighting techniques look genericok i read many reviews and was shocked how much people like this one
i loved silent hill and even more love for silent hill  so the series was moving ahead full speed then this crap came out
the problem starts with the series changing to a female lead character
if you notice they only did it once and then when back to white males as the role
female as a lead just didnt work and an ugly as hell one at that
now that is for me which before the sex battle begins i loved resident evil  with jill it just doesnt work for silent hill series it didnt seem to bother some of the other reviewers
next problem is the religious crap they stuff down our mouth
it was present a little in the first but this was like  percent in this onethe storyline felt like left over ideas that werent good enough for the first  either way they atleast got back on track with silent hill  skip this oneconstorylinefemale leadboringmonsterseverything that made the first two not in this oneplusi think the goriest in the seriesvincent was a nice add character felt like he was a silent hill characterall in all i pawned this game
kept silent hill origins
silent hill  and remake arent any good either
but they are another story
high hopes for silent hill downpour
hope this helpsminimum system requirements state quicktime   but it doesnt tell you that a newer version of qt will make it impossible to play properly
on mine all the characters displayed as big white boxes
according to ubisoft support center this problem can occur if you have installed a newer version of apples quicktime software
unfortunately the only way to resolve this issue is to uninstall quicktime from your system and then reinstall the version of quicktime included on the game disk
i prefer not to downgrade my software just to play a game so i uninstalled this game
no doubt the newer versions of this game dont have this flaw at least id hope not
barbarawill rock came out at roughly the same time as serious sam originally did and fell into that same general category  a brainless shooter where hoards of enemies swarm you and you have to wipe out massive numbers of enemies
its not a special game but its quite a bit of fun to play
the storyline such as it is is that youre the avatar of an olympian god channeling that gods powers to battle against a variety of enemies who are trying to defeat that god
you become the avatar during the opening of the game and while youre in control you get special powers and abilities which come directly from mt
olympusthe enemies and scenarios are appropriate for that period of time
unlike serious sam the games lead character is reasonably serious but the enemies do tend to be more than slightly humorous in how they operate the roman soldier skeletons move in an amusing highstep for exampleall in all its a fun game
forgettable but fun and worth playingthe problem is  about half of the time even at the date of release and probably moreso today the game simply will not run
its wellknown that this program used the safedisk socalled copy protection scheme which of course never prevented a single pirate from ever making an illegal copy but did prevent many many legitimate users from being able to run the program
safedisk uses a blacklist as one of its elements and if you have any example of blacklisted hardware or software on your machine the program simply wont run at allwhat might be blacklisted
oh any optical drive capable of burning disks just for one example
or the program process explorer which allows you to see whats running on your machine at any time and acquired by microsoft and provided for free download on their tech website
or  well the list just goes on and on and oni have multiple machines and ive only ever owned one machine on which this program would even run
none of my contemporary ones will run the programits a shame because the program itself is a lot of fun
the developers did a fine job
but they made the mistake of going through the publishing house ubisoft a french company which is widely reknowned for using the most draconian and intrusive copy protection schemes out thereyoull notice i put copy protection in quotes
this is because these schemes have never not once actually prevented a pirate from stealing the application or installing it for free
however they have repeatedly prevented legitimate paying customers from being able to use software paid for  which is criminal on the part of ubisoft since they have never once offered to refund the purchase price of any item which was disabled by their socalled copy protection
id sure like to be able to run this
the reason im writing this review is that i recently did a minor upgrade to my machine and did a clean os reinstall as a result
im running xp pro sp bit
the only way i can get this program to run is to remove my twin bdburners and replace them with ancient nonwritable cddrives as well as to remove many many applications nero for example which i regularly usethis is not unique for ubisoft
they used an even worse copy protection scheme for the later assassins creed games which prevented legitimate purchasers from using their legallyboughtandpaidfor software and ubisoft has steadfastly refused to make good on their legal obligation to provide working product or to immediately provide a refund in fullubisoft is simply stated criminal
they are scum they are filth they dont deserve to remain in business and frankly their senior leadership ought to be prosecuted
and im not saying that out of emotion its actually a reasoned calmly stated opinionin the case of will rock they disabled a perfectly good lowend but fun game
the game is good and worth playing
but i strongly recommend you avoid buying it for the reasons stated above and i strongly recommend you avoid buying anything from ubisoft for that same reasonin general  ubisoft means will prove to be a hassle to run and will sooner or later become impossible to run even if you manage to get it working at first
every item i currently have which has a ubisoft label on the software today i have to run using a cracked version
im no pirate
but ive had no choice because every ubisoft item i own causes such severe problems that the only way to reliably run them is to strip out the publishers added on socalled copy protection and run the game as the original developer provided it to themremember  the developers write the software
the publishers package it and distribute it
ubisoft is not a developer they are a publisher
they took will rock a program and associated media content encrypted the exe with a copyprotection system not provided by the developers put it onto a disk put that into a box and shipped it to storesthus ubisoft has hurt both the endusers ie you and me and the people who did the actual work the developersi would recommend this game if it could be run
but the odds of you getting it to run are slim to none if you have a modern machine unless youre willing to do a lot of work to strip out every fragment of copy protection in the game and there are several tiers of that mind you
in short if you buy this think of it like a quickplay lottery ticket
the odds are you wont get a prize but if youre fortunate you may win something fairly inconsequential but still enjoyable enoughpeople here have compared will rock with the serious sam games
all i have to say is will rock has got nothin serious samwhile the spectacular kill fest in ss nail you to you seat ws has you yawning after an hour of tedious gameplaywhy
the games are similar in some respects but ss has that certain je nais cest quis that ws sorely lacksthe seller was franticgoat
i paid  bucks
it worked fine on my pc running windows xp home spits an older game and it shows
i couldnt tell what to do next
the story is weak
for me it was not funi would rather replay a game that i previously enjoyed than play this game for the first time
before you buy this one checkout some of the gameplay videos on youtubevisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsstay away from this game
it is poorly coded patches are worthless and the price tag is too much
its a perfect example of what ea games does
they buy good companies with good products and destroy everything they had good for profits that they should not be awarded
the game has continous serious errors which occur randomly and that is the worst experience ive ever had with any games
just that this one is a lot worsethis is  and i for one have completely had it with westwoods ridiculously bad ai
we took this kind of unit stupidity in  with dune  when the rts genre was new but when is westwood finally going to wake up smell the coffee and realize that they cant just keep putting new graphics on the same game give a minor gameplay tweak here and there ignore the ai and corresponding strategy elements and expect us to dutifully keep swallowing it and shelling out the buckswhat was the original campcs gameplay like
click click click click build build build build then click to attack or defend with your hundreds of units
repeat
and repeat
until someone edges out a win because they clicked slightly faster or the tiberium is done and a victory is squeaked in via attrition
now fast forward to  and campc generals
whats the gameplay like
click click click click build build build build then click to attack or defend with your hundreds of units
repeat
and repeat
etc ad nauseumthis isnt strategy
in fact the socalled quotrealtime strategyquot has never been about strategy at allits just a marketing term to give a very rote very brainnumbing kind of gameplay more of a cerebral spin
well a lot of us tolerated that lack of strategy and ai with the hope that as the genre matured westwood would have enough vision if not common sense to finally put in a worthy ai and make these games a truly fun strategic challenge to play
well they never did and with what were seeing it doesnt look like they ever willall they do is spend all of their resources  all of them  on graphics
the computer quotopponentsquot and units are all as stupid as ever and once you learn the units and the rote action gameplay is also just as comainducing
psave your money and your time
you havent just seen this before its practically all youve seen if youve followed westwood games and anyone expecting this game to finally start using the immense amount of potential computer intelligence available to us with modern pcs will be very disappointed indeed
quotcampc generalsquot
more like mindless clickfest   passfirst id like to say that bioware is a great company that has released a lot of good stuff and this problem is not their fault
the only thing they did wrong is to pick atari as their publisheryou see atari put copy protection on the cd by securom that pretty much either  locks up your computer after  min of play everytime or wont allow you to install the game
just go to nwns forums to see how many complaints there are about this  nwnbiowarecom i dont even understand why this is even on the cd since nwn is mainly an online game it already verifies your game keys when you go online
furthermore any pirate can bypass this with stuff like alcohol software
the only people this hurts are people like me who were stupid enough to buy this game
all the good reviews in the world wont help this game if you cant play it  all youll do is hurt your walletbottomline unless you want to play russian roulette with your time and money for some cdrom drives  it does work fine buy any other game at amazon  like warcraft iiis expansion instead their copy protection doesnt lock up your computer
trust me you dont want to pay money to be an unpaid tester of alpha quality softwareafter the game installed it wanted me to register it
at that point windows defender popped up and said it was known to be harmful so i closed the registration box
i was able to open the game and proceeded to play the tutorial
it seemed like a pretty fun game
after getting through it i closed the game only to find another window had popped up
this time it was my firewall saying it had blocked a transmission and did i want it to continue blocking
i did
at that point i just restored my computer to before the installationi hate it when you buy a game and then find out that it installs spyware or malware onto your computer
i dont have enough tech knowledge to know what sort of program is embedded with the game
if anyone has more info id certainly like to know about ita huge production budget couldnt save this abomination
for one thing the game feels cheap and there are very very few variations in gameplay
for all its vaunted separate campaign paths its still linear and moreover boringget deus ex or max paynewarning
even though youre a matrix fan and want more matrix actionjust watch the moviesdont get this gameits a total ripthe action is soooooooooooo boring and the car driving parts of the game is just lamevery lamebut theres a bright side to this gameand its the movie clipsshould you get this game
the best answer is yes and no
for a matrix fan this is a no brainer  your going to force yourself to put up with all of the games faults
not a die hard matrix fan
then your not going to miss much heresome things to consider this is a bad version of max paynei had a lot of difficulty adjusting to the gun fights the movement and aiming felt very jerky and unprecise
you also have to run everywhere for some reason this is quite the opposite of max payne it only took me a few minutes to become quite good with the gun fighting
the hand to hand fighting is done quite well but hard to incorporate into large battles
like when mobs of guards are in your way the game can be played from the point of view of both characters ghost and niobe
just dont expect a huge difference its just the same level from a different angle the driving sequences are well not my favorite
some people may find some joy to them but i found them rather boring and poorly doneoverall the action was put together pretty well im playing through the game since im a big matrix fan but i dont think ill do it a second timeok after finishing the game im going to give all you action fans a little advice out there  save your money
the videos are nice but not incorporated very well and they arewell the only reason i would see anyone forcing themselves to play this game
every department needs help in a major way
graphics have bluring and see through polygon problems the sound is not very well done in eax even with the new patch
i found myself driving and make huge turns at just the slightest movement taking huge jumps off small bumps and landing smack into a wallaggrivating
and this was supposed to be directed by the brothers
there is no real umph to the story you just run around and shoot guards most of the time watching parts of the movie you could have guessed happened if you had just watched it in the theatre and the animatrix alreadyto sum it up ive already uninstalled it and and reinstalled max payne so i could remember how a real game is madethe gameplay is the worst i have ever experienced
that is what totally ruins the game
i had to use the gamepad since there is no mouse control
and the reason why i purchased the game for the pc instead of the playstation was to use the mouse
anyway the control is terrible with the gamepad
the character does not point in the direction of the joystick movement making it a pain to navigate
i made the mistake of purchasing this game based on reviews
i played this game for about  minutes before calling it quitsthis game has got to be the dullest bore ive ever encountered
and believe me ive played a few
and this is supposed to be the premier the apex of the survivalhorror genre
oh my god
i was too busy yawning to be even the slightest scared
i finally got to and wandered around the prison for a while trying to find stuff and finally said enough is enough and deleted this lame piece of tedium from my computer
look if youre into traipsing around some town and its various structures in the fog and dark endlessly looking around for doors and hard to see items to add to your inventory and solving puzzles which i hate doing than this is the game for you
the dialogue is awful the story is pathetic the combat is lame and i get more scared opening the door to kiddies on halloween night for crying out loud
i was getting so weary with this thing i finally downloaded a walkthrough just to end my agony and i still said to heck with this
life is too short
i never felt so good freeing up space on my hard drive
after reading all the reviews about how scary this game is and after playing doom  fear and dead space which were scary i was really disappointed with this game
in fairness i must say i played the game on easy easy on puzzles and easy on combat
maybe its scarier on hard but im not going to hang around to find outhey really how many basketball football and baseball games are we going to have in the xbox format
if you havent found one you like yet try getting a real basketball and head down to the court for awhile
the electronic game industry really should get back to being innovative and lets explore some new venues
this stuff is really stale and im hard pressed to imagine who even buys itpurchasing gladius i was under the impression id be getting an rpg based on ancient rome dealing with building a gladiator school and the likesfirst off despite being called gladius and dealing with gladiators it was completely ahistorical with the brilliantly named empire of imperia apparently taking the place of rome and some generically naundark or whatever named barbarian kingdom perhaps taking the place of some germanic tribesaside from a ridiculously stupid storyline which takes liberally from every random generic magical fantasy story having to do with constellations of the bears womb the magic of the gods enchanted items and broad sweeping remarks by old people about prophecies and destiny and all that boring noise the sentiments of ursulas one of the main character brother mirrors much of the players sentiments as well more talk when are we going to get to some action
if you like pokemon games for gameboy youd likely love the battle system here
it consists of taking very slowtopass turns walking on paths which render the field into a grid with big squares and limited movement
attacks consist of selecting the enemy hitting strike then playing a mini variant of something like mario golf with trying to hit a little bar right when it lands on red for a critical strike or settling for the far larger part of the bar marked yellow
this goes back and forth until someone winsthis makes up the action combat of the game while the background economics are a complex sort of deal that is difficult to keep track of in itself
i had no idea i had only hired a gladiator for one battle and couldnt even check on her until i started a battle to select my fightersthis was a debacle of a game and absolutely no fun at all unless youre willing to pay for a d highly stylized version of pokemonbasically i think this game is really boring
yeah it has good graphics woopideedoo
that still doesnt make up for the flaws
the gameplay is ok but kind of confusing to learn at first
once you learn the controls you can beat up goofy looking robots oh boy
if you like that guess what you get to do it the whole first half of the game
then you can fight more goofylooking robots because thats pretty much all you do
so if you like beating up lots and lots of robots then this game is right for you otherwise i suggest you get as far away from this game as possiblehalf of the time your a stupid taxi driver  cars are really slow limitid weapons load times are slow a wery bad gamethis could be the worst baseball game i have ever played i couldnt even get through the first game
it is that bad
do yourself a favor and dont get this game
get all star baseball  instead
you will thank me for itfor starters this is my brothers game but i tried it out for like fifteen minutes before i got so bored i turned it off
this game is a pointless shoot em up where all you do is run around shooting this or sawing that
its entertaining for a little bit watching the zombies fall apart at the handsor blades of ashs chainsaw
but its only a matter of time before the gameplay becomes so redundant you have no will to continue playing because all you do is chop stuff upand whats with the strip clubs everywhere
there are spells that attempt to add some depth to the game but when the day is over youre left with the same shoot and slash garbage you started with when you turned the game on
anyone into these kind of games should check out the hunter games instead
they have better variation in weapons and you can play with a friend
i would not recommend this game to anyone unless theyre a die hard fan of the evil dead seriesim not an expert of homeworld series ive never played any of the games other than this one and i know nothing about the storyline
the intro video for homeworld  really told me nothing more than these people called hiigarans have found these things called cores which an evil man wants for himself and so he attacks and destroys many colonies of the hiigarans because they wont give them up
i wish i could tell more but that is literally all that the intro movie tells youleaving it to more homeworldliterate and informed reviewers to point out the flaws more indepth ill simply tell from my point of viewthe user interface is an utter mess of details and menus and submenus and obscurely shaped objects without labels that you have to figure out what they do by clicking them
its incredibly difficult to deal with and you have to figure out what the wireframes of each individual ship is otherwise youll never figure out what ships youve selected in space because they arent labeled unless you hover your mouse over themthe gameplay is terribly uninvolving
due to the clunky controls sight is a luxury not well spent on your own forces
scrolling tends to go either too far in or too far away
youre either watching the ships too closely or so far away you cant tell what theyre doing
another irritating feature is in cases of emergency when you have to rush your ships over to enemies is that you must click for them to attack the enemy as they zip past because if you miss your cursor will get stuck in a twodimensional movement circle which essentially forces you to move the ship somewhere on its same plane in only two dimensions
pressing escape resolves this but its still a severe deterrent in emergency situationsthe tutorial goes from babyeasy to completely batnuts insanely difficult as you go from one mission where you fight off a few enemy bombers pestering your mothership to fending off meager attacks on your transports to suddenly encountering a fleet of several frigates dozens and dozens and dozens of fighters and bombers and only seconds after youre supposed to destroy the enemy half the map away in a resource fieldas the final sampling the voice acting
aside from the female voice of the hiigaran leader it seems they only hired one man to do the voices for all the ships and characters
and he does all of them in the exact same voice lazy and monotone even when his characters are about to die sacrificing themselves to save youall in all i couldnt believe how intolerably flawed this game was
its just plain bad
ive never played any of the other homeworld games but i hope the first is better than this onethe graphics are improved the engine is improved the game play sucks
no longer are you thinking about what to build how to maneuver your formations and where to have them focus
this is bigger picture and i honestly think it takes most of the fun away from the old one
if they only improved the originals graphics and added a few more ships and another great story
this story is terrible and almost non existent
no book breaking down everything for you like the original had no feeling of discovery and none of the personal attachment or feeling of control you felt in the first one
formations have been replaced with types of doctrinalish tasks like frigate screen
instead of building your own formations out of whatever you liked and moving it how and where you liked now you build fleets you have little control over
not gratifying
you dont build individual units like you did in the first one except on the frigate and above level
now you build little wings of  or so that do your bidding
the worst thing they screwed up was the research
no longer do you research for you fleet in general now every ship must have a research facility installed on its actual superstructure read money invested in worthless technology you already own on another vessel to move on to the next stage
lots of money spent on the rd
nothing was simple about this game and sierra let us all down
great ideas like upgrades and disabling specific portions of enemy capital ships sound great in theory but fail to turn into fun once the gaming starts
if you never played the first one maybe this will be satisfying but i have my doubts
look elsewhere
if you enjoyed the first one dont bother with this one look elsewhere
or stick with the original
think of it like the nd and rd matrix movies that you wish never existedi was happy to see lorii was being made when it was first announced way back in   as soon as i heard the developers were going to defect to the rts craze i knew it was a lost cause
there has been more rts crap churned out than ever beforerts sucks because you dont have time to strategize
its the same old boring repetitive crap
yet developers keep making the same garbageloriii was supposed to be realized in christmas of  then spring  then winter  ugg i cant remember how many times it was delayed
you can tell the project must have been in total chaosword to the game developerstry making a game that actually requires thought and strategyi bought this game one month ago together with quotamerican conquest fight backquot if i liked the last one as top of the bunch lotr iii is bottomill try to sell my copy and desperately look for an used copy of the first versionthis is unbelievable
all the great things about the lords of the realm ii have been removed and nothing good has been added
gone is the management of the territory resources instead you simply assign a vassal to an area and they produce just one type of resources
to make matters worse you armies are produced automatically so you dont even get to choose your army types
the battles start automatically but you are not even taken to the battlefield automatically so you can ened up missing the battle if you dont go there right away
i read the other reviews but i thought the sencond one was such fun i should give this one a try
big mistake  save your moneyive been with this series since the beginning
the first one rocked the lands were huge you got to do so much stuff
the second one blew you played on itty bitty lands and it blew
so i figured that the rd would be a return to the first man was i wrong it was like the nd but more land but as a price taking care of your towns was gone you just threw servant down on a land and boom your done what the hell then to top it off when you attack ajacent lands you can basically destroy the crap out of it but you cant take control of it thats not coolthe only reason why i give it a star is because i like the graphics in the battle screens but other than that this game belongs in a bargain bin and the places that have it should pay you to pick it upits a trick get an axe
i just bought it
save yourself the heartache
sierra is obviously having some problems and this is not pretty
just say no
dont make me say i told you so
buy starcraft by the same company
buy lords of the realm i ii or the siege pack
try homeworld
they didnt finish this game and released it anyway
it is so bad youll just about cry
hint if it was  id give it a   and im not just writing for fans of first person shooters
oh those people will climb the walls
rts people wont like this eitherafter a long wait and much excitment lords of the realm iii did not live up to the hype
it has none of the personality that ii did and is a shabby game over all
it certainly doesnt compare to medieval total war
skip it completely save your money and buy a copy of medieval instead
much better gameas reflected in other reviews here sierra took out all the best parts of this series managing the economy delicate balancing of army and even basic interaction with your cities
they took out the castle choices and the cool little videos
even though the battle graphics were pretty basic in the prior games it was unquestionably more engaging than the d graphics but dull and incomprehensible battles in this game
in addition to the inability to control individual troops i have had fighters attacking the air and other clipping issuesthis game is simply not fun and made me want to fire up lords ii to remember what this series used to be aboutget stronghold or lords ii for a much better gamelotr was a classic game
lotr should have expanded on the things that made lotr good but strangely removes all the interesting bits in managing your lands and leaves you with kind of a weaker version of a quottotal warquot titleeverything happens in real time which means armies crawl across the global map far to slowly
this would have been better handled as a turn based element
not funindividual parcels of land dont seem to be anymore valuable than any other parecls of land
you dont seem to get invovled into that quotdamn i really need that minedepositwoodquot
no choke points on the maps either
not funactual battles are frenzied quick and extremely hard to control
calvary types can get arcoss the battle maps faster than i can even select my troops and get them into some sort of logical order
not funthere are many possible formations and stances for individual troops but no logical formations for groupings of more than one troop type
ie
if you select a troop of archers and a troop of pikemen for instance and tell them to march to a location they march off as if the others didnt exist
that means the faster moving archers arrive first and get wasted by melee types then the pikes arrive who engage the enemy melee types but get mowed down by the enemy archers
lightly armored ranged troops should fall in behind melee troops
other games have been doing this for years now
whats the problem
not funnot too much point trying flanking with calvary either
the lighter faster troops arrive first so you may as well just plough straight into them
my battle tactics have simply been to pause the game select all troops and direct them all to attack en mass at the center of the enemies ranks
mindless
not funattacking castles is painful
you cant seige them as in lotr you just attack with your current troops straight away
troops scale the walls etc but this combat seems buggy and confusing
units appear to get get trapped up on the walls and no quick capture the flag to end battles
lotr is much better in this aspectno skirmish mode
yep
no skirmish mode
not funid suggest looking around for quotkohan immortal sovereignsquot or a quottotal warquot game over this oneok i can say a little more
a lot more actually
where to start
i still consider lotr to be one of the best games ive ever played
the ai was dumb but it was a super fun game   stars all the way
ive patched and played this one now and would like to point out the following to anyone thinking this is going to be like lotr no documentation
the manual isnt even close to sufficient and onlineon cd adds nothing
this will be a recurring theme in my review heavy hardware required
im running an amd  clock rate mhz  ddr and a radeon  pro with latest drivers
i can watch the arrows move frame by frame during sieges with only  of their units fighting  of mine
recommended hardware is mhz and a radeon   liars to upgrade your castle you save money
my money keeps getting stolen after saving for  realworld minutes
they take almost all of it and i have no idea how or how to stop them documentation
 you can accidentally downgrade your castle since they present inferior designs as upgrade options yet still charging you money to do it
there are no descriptions in the game or in the manual describing what different castles are capable of
documentation
 hiring mercenaries is a guessing game since the ingame description simply tells you there title like siege engineer and says he does not serve you
no help in manualgetting tired of typing documentation i accidentally clicked on an allys territory with my army and was immediately at war despite being  territories away and changing back immediately
stupid you cant zoom in or out during battle which means its very hard to tell which troops you are facing
the graphics are not that good despite being so hardware intensive during a siege i decided to go around to the castles back wall since the defenders were all ammassed on the front walls
the defenders did not reposition themselves to meet me
even worse once i climbed the walls my guys just kind of milled about ocassionally doing something i ordered them tokinda
even worser new word once i was finally inside the courtyard i could not target the defenders
so i just sat there gaping while my guys stood right next to the defenders who had about  archers and killed all my guys
i tried this a few times with the same results you cant conquer outlying territories and annex them anymore
you can devastate them but you have to conquer the main castle at which time you get all of the territories
this took a huge element of the game away for me as previous reviewers noted all micromanagement is gone
you drop a merchant on to a piece of land and never come back
same with a peasant for food
no control no fun
maybe there are more options but there is no documentation
 attacking an army on the field is lame
if you set up two units to attack one unit from different angles both your units just beeline right for the center of the enemy unit anyway
not anything like the cool tricks you could play with the total war series
no usage of terrain or weather or anythingi work at a telco i understand what tough times mean to a company but this is ridiculous
sierra has fleeced me and im angryi preordered this game the day it was posted based on how much fun lords of the realm  was
unfortunately everything that made lotr fun wasnt in here
the territory values the farming the battle soundsall gone
the siege system is laughable and the ai for both your own unit movements and the enemy movements are terriblenow i know why the price was not worth itif i could have give it negative stars i would have
expecting an upgrade to lords of the realm ii what iwe got was a totally different game
its an rts pos
gone is all the fun of turn based micromanaging and playstyle
all that is left is what the siege pak of lotr ii gave us battle battle battle boring
theres lots better rts games out there heck you can get emires dawn of the modern world for less than  on ebay now and its x better than this game
no demo and i surely can see why nobody would have bought it except a few clicky babies maybe
im glad i had a seven day return policy i only needed one though
this isnt even worth bargain bin  to me
i have too many great rts games than to play this
heck mtw medieval total war is better
its  or less also on ebay and probably here at amazoncom also
this ones a dud
its so much of a dud they wont let you say anything bad about it over at the official website forums
if you think im kidding go tryi was looking forward to this game
i absolutely loved lords of the realm   i can pick it up and even play it today and enjoy it greatly
part  however is awful
all of the fun parts of  are gone
the battles are boring and the graphics are really dated
the game is full of bugs and is just not fun to play
playing the game once feels repetative
this game has no replay value at alli dont know why but ive gotten  of these things now both used and neither had the ability to hold onto a save file after the first  seconds of gameplay
im going to half to save my money and get a new copy for over  if i ever want to play itenough with the pokemon stuff already
its a fad that died out a few years ago yet nintendos making a sequel with some of the most dated graphics ive ever seen
the series hopes to get young kids into the rpg genre which is fine but for them to keep at it this long is abseloutely pathetic
they should have scrapped this project and focused on the new golden sun game an rpg series thats actualy good and requires deep thought
i doubt anyone over  is playing pokemon anymore
but those who are should try to expand their intrests
maybe try a t rated rpg and see how much more comlex and interesting it can bewhen ocarina of time for n came out people were blown awayso naturally when gamecube was released people expected another great zelda with realistic d graphics and to everyones shock and to somes horror nintendos next big zelda was announced to use cellshading technique which provides cartoonish graphics for video gamesi too was surprised to find this change but nonetheless bought a copy at full price because hey its zelda
soon my doubts cleared and i had a blast playing this masterpieceto people that played ocarina this game will bring back the memories as it features many of the same sounds music and controls that were used in the n version
and although the cellshaded graphics wasnt what people expected it fits perfectly well into the atmosphere of the game and once you get used to it youll love it so muchwhen wind waker first came out there were some critics that called this game childish and said it was a bad installment for the whole franchise
but time proved them wrong
the only childish thing about this game if at all is the difficulty which has been tuned down a lot compared to the n zelda
wind waker is such a good game that it has even become my new favorite zelda of all time and thats saying a lot since most of the zelda games are of grade ahowever everything will soon change at least i hope
the nowbeingdeveloped game of twilight princess has apparently made quite an impact on people that played it in e and now even the cellshading hater cant say nothing to zelda because it is gonna be as real as anything like the code name for the project indicates real zelda
yes links body is gonna be proportional again in the next installment yay
nintendo is really taking their time on twilight princessyears
it was supposed to come out in  but they decided to postpone it to make it even greater
so it will undoubtfully be another masterpiece
if its as good as wind waker you know ill buy it
but i have a feeling that i will again be surprised phhhh i try to keep my expectations at sane level but its getting harderi had loved the zelda series but was dismayed when i saw wind waker
the cartoonish graphics look childish and amateurish
i nonetheless decided to rent the game and give it a shot
however i gave up after a half hour or so
it just wasnt fun and wasnt worth my timei borrowed this game to try it out
i had never played a zelda game before and had heard that they were really good
but after i played it awhile i found myself incredibly bored
i got extremely tired of sitting there waiting for the characters to stop talking already
and although link the main character has a sword he rarely uses it
then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again
talk about barely any action
after that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that apparently lets him controll the wind
whats with that
i dont call this a quotpuzzlequot game
i call it a boring game
i suggest you buy a mario game which cleverly combines puzzle with actionugh that is the most dumbest game
i loved zelda ocarina of tim and majoras mask
they looked great for the n
but i was also baffled by the myster pick they showed in magazines
when this cartoon load came out i screamed and hid under my bed
link the real one was supposed to be in it
not some bobble head little thing
the graphics where good but i wanted resident evil looking link and ganondorf
oh ganondork looks like he is  years old not hip and  like the older ones
the king of red dragons mouth was dubbed badly it looked dumb
still no voice talent
i could understand why on the n they couldnt talk
but on the gcn look at the other games
they talk
why cant link
oh and dont forget that bobblehead cant say a sentencewhat happened to zelda
where did it go
what am i babbling about
well id love to explain to you all the problems i had with this game but unfortunately i can only use a certain number of words for this review so ill cover all the main problems i had with itfirst and most important is the ending
the ending was depressing for anyone whos ever played a zelda title
changing the ending alone would have been enough to make the game about  times better
i wont tell you what it was only that it was terriblesecondly the gameplay barely existed
i found that half the game was spent doing nothing
i just set up my sail and waited for five minutes while the game propelled me to my next destination
the other half of the game was spent fighting battles and solving puzzles that were so easy no fiveyearold would fail at themstorylinewise this game is a flop
it contains only one realisticallybehaving character ganon
the rest of the characters are the product of plot holes and are moved along by the story not the other way around
big problem in any game these daysthe graphics annoyed me but only because the character models were very ugly
and as for the music it just seemed incongrous very oftenplus none of the characters talk
on the gcn
thats laziness to the umteenth power from a gamedesign perspectivestill although i thought this game was a piece of garbage there are those who found it fun so i would be being unfair to say it is impossible to like this game despite all the huge gaping flaws and mindless tedium it showcases
to make everyone happy i reccomend that you rent this game once to see whether or not youll like it
dont make the mistake of buying it right off the bat like i didi dont mean to crash anyones party but this game sucked its nothing like the other zelda games i loved the origenal zelda the best and i liked all the others because they where based on the origanal but this one is a totally diffrent story it shouldnt have the opertunity to be have zelda in its title
if they would change the green outfit the only thing linking it to any of the other zelda games no one would even know it was sapposed to be a zelda gamelets see bad graphics check
music im not into check
too long and frustrating check
good luck trying to beat this kids game in the same week you get it because this is much harder than the first
 quadrillionzelda is the most over rated game series ever made
and wind waker is the worst zelda game made
first of all i will just start talking about how bad the graphics are
what we are looking at here are d pixel shaded graphics
i can possibly understand these graphics for a racing game or possibly a fighting game
but not an adventure game
yes ocarina of time was ok but not good enough to save this series
wind waker completly destroyed it
link looks and talks like a complete loser
but you may say graphics arent everything
i can agree with that sometimes but when they are as horrific as these i cant even play the game
now the story and gameplay
can u hit z and press the a button multiple times
well then you can beat zelda wind waker
the game is meant for kids no doubt about that
there is a talking ship ffs
what is going on here nintendo
i think you get my point on why windwaker sucks
the main things are that the graphics suck and the game is easy boring and just plain stupidi am pimp daddy king of all thats good and nastythis game sucked i barely see the point of this game
o u rescue your sister  whoop de freaken do
i wouldnt rescue my own sisterim just kidding about that i think the graphics are awful like construction paper
do not for the love of god try this gamefreelancer cant seem to figure out what kind of game it isthe marketing says it is a game directed by the way you play
in practice it has a very linear plot that you are railroaded into followingif you want to play as a trader or miner the marketing says it will support you
in practice combat is thrust upon you so freqeuntly that you have little choice but to get a ship built for warthe marketing says it has roleplaying elements
in reality it is an action game with cutscenes showing the plotit is too simple to be a great space combat sim but the combat is too hard for it to be an rpg
the choices are few and usually binary
i wanted morrowind in space
i got frustration and disappointmentthis was listed as a new product however i received it and it was not in factory packaging
it should have been listed as used and not new
i didnt want a like new product i wanted a factory sealed copykungfu chaos has you fighting in arenas where you can ring out or use objects like tables chairs and even people to toss at your opponent
up to four people can play simultaneously or you can play by yourself oneonone
you can also team up with bots to fight against the cpu
the game has very cartoonish looking graphics the sound effects and dialog are corny like an old kungfu movie
in fact you are playing inside a kungfu movie
youll hear the director telling you what to do and making snide remarks when you make a mistake
the whole game is silly and feels very childish
not my cup of tea
im shocked that it got lots of good reviews hereprosfunnyinstant replayup to four playersplay with botsokay for kidsconsunresponsive controlscheap sound effectsthinks its funnybots are stupidnobody ever dieslimited attack movesgets old faststupid musicretarded and pointless gameplaysmall fighting spacei feel sorry for the people that bought this gamefor themselves and lost money
i was smart enoughto just rent itits just a useles game disc but a nice frisbee
the game needs an xbox live gamer tag to play plus this game wont work on the  and if your aware there is no way to make a gamer tag on the original xbox so this game is obsolete
but you can get the gamecube version which is alive and strong
dont buy this from any seller
i found this out the hard way and its my own faulti wanted to like this game in a bad way
however the lack of checkpoints ingame saves and having no clue how to get out of the first level turned this game into a total headacheoh where to begin
this game is rotten to the core
everything that can possibly literally go wrong with a game is crammed into this messits nothing to do with robocop
nothing
this game seems like an abandoned wolfenstein or duke nukem game from  the dated horrible graphics indicate this right away that has had a tiny tiny bit of robocop pasted into it order to repackage it and get it out there are soon as possibleit should never have been allowed to get out there in the first place
the game is absolutely riddled with bugs
there are dozens of things that robocop needs to do but the programming wont accommodate
such as getting stuck in a location or walking up stairs or opening doors
the bad guys have no ai at all and end up firing at walls most of the time
they all look the same guy in shirt with gun and are really boring to shootrobocops gunfire sounds like a commodore  sound effect
and since when did robo say oh yeah
or bullseye when killing someone
and why oh why is a giant mutated rat in a supposed robocop gamethe gameplay is terrible
the targeting system is rubbish robo will automatically target energyammo pickups and bad guys at the same time
which is which
it happens too quick and it is useless too
i would have preferred the targeting system robo has in the movies but here we get rectangles highlighting the bad guys
it looks stupidthe music is trash too
i would play with the volume turned down
or not play it at all
this game should never have been allowed out
shame on titus and virgin interactive for producing such a travestynever got a chance to play it
i have been playing some xbox games on the xbox  but this one unfortunately did not want to play so i dont know if its a good game or noti just dont get it
gameboy is just trying to make a quick buck
i bet you that within the next year theres going to be a gameboy advance sp turbo or something
how long is it going to take for them to quit putting out new models that have all the same capabilities except for a light or the shape or something dumb like that and really sit down and take some time to try and put out a decent model with decent graphics
the sound is useless because you mostly just hear music which is the same  second tune played over and over
i have to admit the quality of the graphics have improved since gameboy color but barely improved since gameboy advance
there are nowhere near the amount of levels that you can play on ps or xbox or even gamecube
mostly not even half
in conclusion gameboy is not all its cracked up to be
im sorry if you dont agree but thats my honest opinion
so save a quick buck and buy a video game console instead
ps is the best then xbox then gamecube so in a nutshell if you have regular gameboy advance theres really no need to get gameboy advance sp platinumi just bought a gba a month ago
i figured when i bought it that i would be able to see the game i was playing
silly me
now i hear gba sp is coming out and it has a light
i cant return the gba i just got back to the store so im stuck with an inferior producti wanted a nice looking one in spite of it being used
i accidently ordered one that was acceptable rather than like new
recommend to someone who doesnt care how it looks just so it worksi admit im not really all that interested in first person shooter so i dont play medal of honor or any of those games but i was a huge fan of the original wolfenstein games that came out centuries ago and i am also a big fan of duke nukem games even golden eye on  etc so dont let my lack of interest in many first person shooters make you think i am just being nostalgicthis game didnt make me feel like i was returning to wolfenstein at all
sure the original was a bunch of pixels and mazes with nazis to kill and dogs coming at you but the feel of this game doesnt feel the same at all
i felt more like i was in some movie starring jason stathman as he is sent in to kill nazis and protect india jones as he looks for ancient treasure
the first thing i noticed the moment i started playing was the computer ai is horribly programmed
the first nazi i come by ran right up to me past me then ran behind me somewhere like he was looking for a good place to sit down to take aim and before he could he was shot dead
then i noticed things around the place that is there for no reason
i come across some motorbikes they make noises do they do anything
no can you ride them
no
can you blow them up
no
why are they there
at least in duke nukem games if a useless object is there say when i found the delorean from back to the future in time to kill or land of the babes
one of the two duke quotes biff tannen and says hello mcfly anyone home
 its pointless but none the less humorous
where activision trying to copy that by just adding random things trying to be funny
or did someone just say euhh theres too much wall put a bike infront of it
the second thing i really dont like about this game is the controls
they work ok for what they are but what they lack is any control over aiming where you want to shoot
a lock onto enemy button would have been nice or at least auto aim or something because i dont know how tired i got of coming down stairs and someone is shooting me and i have to look down in order to shoot them it sounds like something you could get used to but it feels like you are armed with a sling shot while a mouse is running frantically between your legs in circles as you try to look down and maneuver around in circles yourself trying to get a lock on them
thats another thing you only need to hit an enemy close enough to kill them dont worry about aiming for bodies or head shots just fart in their general direction and they will eventually smell itin the original wolfenstien there was a tonne of great array you could choose from
in this one there is barely a decent weapon to be found
most of them are hand guns sniper rifles and single shot pistols
there is only a couple of machine guns most of which are semiautomatics and from what i can tell only one decent rapid firing machine gun
however there is no big cool gun the original version of this game you had a cool minigun why wouldnt that be included in the sequel
maybe they wanted to go a bit more realistic as it is supposed to be set in the s or so but hey they had bazookas hand grenades molotov cocktails and what not back then too couldnt those have been integrated with the artillery of this game
god anything to just blow up a bunch of people at once would have been nice
maybe thats just dukes thing i dunno but this game needed more much morethe levels all seem too alike
do you really need  levels per episode or the same damn thing over and over and over again
your mission find something get out
dont get killed
next mission find something get out dont get killed
and so on and so on and so on and so on yawnnnnnnnnnnnnwhat else surprises me about this game is there is no cheats
none without a action replay device or something
now before you say something about real gamers dont need cheats let me remind you wolfenstein was pretty much the inventor of god mode
remember that name
whether you would use it or not why would you make a sequel like this and not include what made the original so damn popular in the first place
come on how many of you played the original and never once used god mode
or the all weapons cheat or even the all keys cheat
come on raise your hand
how could they forgot to include these things in this versioni only got through about  levels of this game before i packed it in out of boredom or having to do the same thing over and over and over again
i really dont care how the game ends
obviously statham and indy beat the bad guys the proof lies in history because the nazis where all taken out when luke skywalker blew up the death star iithe last thing is the sound or should i say sounds
the sound of weapons and everything is fine but the sounds of the nazis is what puts me off
they all speak perfect english
one of the coolest things of the original game was the sounds of the nazis saying things you had no idea what unless you spoke german but come on why do they all speak english and say there he is get him not even in a german accent
one last thing its not a biggie but remember the cute pitbulls in the original
i would have liked to see them return and come running after me for a bullet to the forehead unless they are somewhere later in the game they dont make a return
damn fcc and peta
cruelty to animals in the real world is wrong but in video games it should be ok its not like anyone who played mario bros went out and stomped on a turtle and kicked his shell into a sewer pipeoverallgameplay   story   grahpics   controls   sound   replay v   extras   total   this game is terrible
i rushed out and bought it on release day
if only i had a time machinei only played about  minutes of this game and turned it off
i got rid of it as fast as possible
the graphics are lame and the gameplay is not much better
the controls were confusing to say the least
what bothered me the most however was the glitches
i repeatedly witnessed enemies getting hung up on things in the game thus allowing me to wail on them while they could not chase me or attackoverall  terriblethe pc version of this game is much much much better and i highly recommend it especially compared to this pathetic attempt at gamingthe game was a complete disappointment
maybe i had my expectations set a bit too high
all the landscapes seem similar and like one of the other reviewers correctly pointed out the controls make your head spin
very difficult to figure out where you are on the map and where your partner is if you play the coop modeand the colors downright suckafter trying to play this game i now know why noone in the cast wanted to take part in the game eather through a likeness or voicethe game is garbbagedo not waste your time or money on it it is not worth itdont get me wrong this game is great
but the game could have used much more tech support before release
it wasnt that important for it to come out the same day as reloaded was ityou cant even beat the xbox version as a bug freezes the game right as you go through a vital door
the ps version freezes during loading and the gcn chase sequence at the end
i hope you dont run into the walls as youll get stuck in them  i guess the architect crashed the matrix cause this is uberrealistic to some of the stuff neo and crew go through in the moviesok that was wrong to say crackheads are too smart to buy this game
steal it if you want it but i bet youll be selling it on ebay a couple days later this game is so stupid just another way for the brothers to make a few extra bucks
buy a modchip and download it on kazaa or somethingi played this game hoping to see cool cut sequences and i did see cut sequences but nothing cool
i felt bad that i had paid  to view an ad for matrix  i felt that the gameplay was not only weak but also boring
it was exceptionally easythe only good thing about the game was that the cgi in the game matched the terrible cgi in the movie so i felt like i was actually playing the movieif you have to play this game to see what was not in the movie
dont waste your time or money if youre interested in gameplaythe first thing that i found annoying about this game were the controls
most games i play have the a and x buttons for punching and kicking
this had b and y also you must press the right joystick in any direction to toggle between first person mode
isnt it a waste of a joystick to use it as a toggle button
to look around in first person mode you must go back to the left joystick
also you cannot move your character in first person mode
i needed to move slightly sideways to get someone in the crosshairs but i had to go out of first person mode move then go back into first person modei also thought the fire button was not very intuitive
additionally when you are playing ghost in the driving mode you only have to worry about three controls
that being the case they still decided to change what you use as the fire button
why not keep it consistent with what was used in the nondriving modesi like games that help you escape into the world of the game
i dont like to feel like i am playing a monotonous arcade game
with enter the matrix i felt like i was playing an arcade game
at one point you couldnt drive through the wooden gate arms at a toll booth
instead the game told you to survive for  minutes then the gates would open
oh yeah i could see that happening in the movie
yeah righti did like the focus feature which allowed you to go into bullet timethis game is the worst game i have played since land of the dead road to fiddlers green
to start how can this game get a decent grade for controls
its terrible and broken
to aim downsight you must press the left stick
wtf
and not only that but you have to effin hold the thing
and since the control sensitivity is a default ultra light speed fast it is impossible to aim
jumping is left trigger yeah wtf
additionally to switch weapons you must hold the right stick in and open an inventory screen in which you freeze your character in place and leave him open to be attacked and most likely killed on top of that your guns are atrocious in aiming you will literally i mean literally shoot circles around the soviet soldiers
on the subject of soviet soldiers these motha flippins take sooooo many shots that not even the marvel super hero hulk could survive gotta calm down back to the controls
eventually you get to lead your rebellious new york soldiers so y tells them to go to one spot if you hold down y then the entire team goes to the spot while just tapping it sends ones soldier pressing b tells them to defend one spot and x tells them to regroup sounds easy right
well its not
i guarentee you will find yourself pressing x to reload but wind up calling your men back what is the reload button you ask
hahahah
there is none you actually reload if you dont shoot for a handful of seconds
very awkward if there is a break in an intense fire fight yanno
its like ratatatatatatatareload automatically while enemy is standing there shooting youlets talk about the ai and the bugs plauging this lackluster game
theres a serious chopping issue within freedom fighters where enemies can shoot through and run walls appear out of thin air or just never stop coming
ontop of that you can stand in front of an enemy for about  minutes yes i did time this before they go holy  thats an american soldier
and shoot at you with  accuracy
then comes your partner ai when it comes to shooting enemies they are okay but they do not listen to you
numerous times have i told a soldier to stand in one spot only to see him run off and get slaughtered
oh yes i forgot to mention a lot of the time your soldiers will run towards fences that are suppose to basically be a barrier for the end of the level or a barrier to make you find another way around and actually run right through it i swear to buddhai think the story and how they pieced together the missions were probably the only good part of this title
basically the russians beat the united states in building the first atom bomb nuked japan and forced its way into europe seizing control of the continent
from there they moved into cuba and then one day attacked manhatten ny
moving on each mission affects another one
for instance in one mission labeled the bridge you must use tnt to blow up a bridge but you must clear the stage then go back to the stage the hotel pick up the tnt while heading back to the bridge and then use the tnt on the bridge which will help the people from the firehouse stage to sweep through
i thought that was kind of cool but thats ita combination of horrendous controls disgusting music glitches bugs atrocious ai and punishing difficulty make freedom fighters one of the worst original xbox titles i have ever played
how in the name of zeus did this game get a 
i honestly do not see itim flabbergasted for two reasonsfirst how did activision manage to make a ps sequel to a ps game thats actually worse than the original
it defies logic
this game has the absolute worst camera angles of alltime
to top it off the character movement and combat is wooden at best
i have better games on my friggin cell phonesecond how in the ll cool j did so many amazon users give this a good review
arghyoud be better off playing ps tenchu stealth assassin again than wasting your time on this stinker
seriouslyaddedplaying wrath of heaven is like playing the unfinished testversion of stealth assasinwhen i first played the sims it was on the computer and i couldnt get enough of it
then the sims  came out and it was  times better
when i went back to play the st one it totally sucked compared to the nd one
then a i came upon the first sims for the gamecube and im like sure what the hell i will give it a shot
big mistake
it was so annoying
it took forever to fill up there needs
they were super slow
the graphics were bad
the story mode was the worst because the tasks were stupidly harddont waste your money on this terrible game
but the sims  or the sims  pets for the gamecube so much betteri have the pc version with all the expansions and i have no idea why anyone would want to payfor a console version which is usually worse than the pc version and which is more expensivepros awesome box artgraphics might be better than pc versioncons more expensive than pc versionharder controls than pc versionwont come out with any expansions unlike pc versionbottom line i give the pc version  stars so just get the pc versioni got what i order the way they said would come
no complaints will purchase from them again and recommend to others
keep up good workproduct description kinda over hypes game but was worth the money i spenti dont know how the game was because i never got it and nobody did anything about it market sellers rules do not buysave your money even if it goes on sale this is the worst game i have ever played
if you want to play a fun game play longest journey or syberia or dark fall post mortem is the most boring game ever and the music was lousy interaction was awful and the characters have no personality
the puzzles are almost nonexistant
sorry but i wasted my money so save yoursokay i just tried playing the demo of this game because someone advised this
i couldnt play it
it took like  minutes for him to close the door
why do they move so slowly
i couldnt stand it
its like watching a movie in slow motion
if the game is slow like this demo i will not buy thisthis is the second product i have purchased made my microids
the first product has and install problem from the nd disk
i tried on two different systems and both failed
contacted customer support and they told me to take it back to the store where i purchased it
duh
bought it new online a few months back and i didnt get around to playing it
so i was screwed on that game
product was still life
i researched the problem cyclic redundancy error and many message boards reported it is a flaw with microids producttried installing this game
on one computer i was disappointed in the video which ran so slow
frame by frame animation
blah
tried it on my other computer and the animation was okay but the audio was terrible
lip sink was way off and bad problem with voice over
every time one character talked the second one talked at the same time before the first was complete
again i purchased this new and didnt get around to it till now
its doubtful that ill play this game either as the voice over is too distractingcustomer service
wont waste my time
i am screwed again by this poor quality companynote  my system met and exceeded all the requirements all drivers are up to date
its just poor programing from an inferior companyi will never buy a product made by microids againall i have to say is dont waste your time and money to buy this game
this add on is horrible
the company tried to hard to make this game and they really need to fix this game up
these add ons are just plain boringif you want to try to make a better innovation pc game for the community then i suggest you to fix up this game now
stop ripping off people money and start fixing up this rollercoaster tycoon  wacky worlds expansion packif youve read my review over marvel vs capcom  then you know i have given it the title if possibly the best after playing this game i decided i had to review it that way i would have both ends of the fighting games world
amazon reviewers love this game so my ranking is going to take a hit but so be it someone has to state the obvious about this game
as said in the last sentence amazon reviewers just love this game reason is theyre inuyasha fans
dont get me wrong i love inuyasha and own a collection of the dvds im just not a blind leader of the hanyou i guess
for some reason the plot gets a lot of praise i for one have no idea why
shippou and kagome fight because kagome runs out of snacks yes folks the people at bandai really put their heads together for this plot
yeah youre collecting shards and yes they have a little explanation before you start fighting does that really count
thats all from the show and as soon as the little explanation to you collecting shards is over and you actually start fighting the plot disappears the story does not unfold at all
this is a fighting game however so bad plot is extremely forgivable
then there are the controls which are way too simple
people may list simple controls under the heading of good things about the game but me not if theyre this simple
ive played rpgs with more complex controls
characters seemed limited with a low number of moves and special moves that are way below spectacular extremely below
the difficulty of this game is just amazing buy this game and less than  minutes later its possible to already have beaten the game with at least one character maybe less than that
characters look horrible why wasnt there an inuyasha game for the ps to be brought to our shores
is this just a game to try and squeeze the psx for all its worth
the game does look thrown together
couldnt they have at least translated
the only good thing i can think of about this game is dream fairy tale and the fact that yes its inuyashathis game is like the worst game ever made
im a really huge fan of stealth games and other games that have a similar feel to this one
however this game did horriblethis is the sort of game where they tell you it all depends on stealth but in the end you can tell that level quotaquot requires stealth tactics to reach a goal but level quotbquot requires outright mayhem
often if you make a small mistake youre practically dead
sure you regenerate some health but it is painstakingly slow and in at least one level you have to do withoutthe stealth is also very clunky
you enter a sort of cutscene when you implement the move and whereas this looks cool the lack of control and longevity more often than not cause you to be seen by his buddythe actual quotoutright mayhemquot part of the game is extremely poor
though they try to implement a system of quotspecial movesquot the timing is hard to master and the chances to use them so few and far between that you often forgot the buttons you need to push ie
the controls are pretty crappy
not to mention the lack of a tutorial really hurt the game as it took me like  minutes to get out of the first room i died twice before i figured out how to kill the first goons and then it took another  minutes to figure out how to open the dooreverything in the game is a bit choppybut that doesnt mean that it isnt addictive
the game actually somehow still comes across as fun
i think you could actually overlook most of the faults if you had the ability to save anywhere
doing the same level over and over isnt my idea of a good gamemy recommendation is to rent itdont buy it not for any price above a rental price anywaybought this product on  from walmart and for the first week it worked great
it had over a hundred games preloaded in and i was able to add new codes to the game
unfortunately i assumed too much and assumed that it would work flawless so i threw away my receipt and the box and only kept the manual and gamehowever just today i loaded this unit and all my codes were erased
i did not do anything the machine just erased all my codes
what a piece of junki have to give this a one star rating in hopes that people will read this
i have a wii system and although this is advertised wii compatible it is not wii compatible
you might be okay if you have one of the first wiis that were produced and have never taken it online and have not played any new wii game
the updates for the system make it so you cannot use any cheat devices
it wont even work for playing gamecube games
if you want to cheat on a gamecube game use a gamecubei dont even have this product but i have sd media launcher for ngc and i know that the disc is a relabeled ar disc but it actually comes w an adapter and has some homebrew support unlike the new ar a list of ar codes appear on a background w the action replay logo using sd media launcher if an sd card isnt insertedif youre getting this new product for cheats go ahead you can cheat on homebrew andor the ar disc included w sd media launcher anyway it makes this product less than pointless but keep in mind that only sd media launcher can boot homebrew like dol files some used for legal backups and even bootable dol files for earlier versions of ar which arent avaliablediscontinued
unlike this
i have sdload gcos  ar  etc all in dol files homebrew and its all thanks to sd media launcher so either get sd media launcher andor ar  real disc however its discontinued  sd gecko for booting homebrew on your ngc consoleit was broken when i got it the disk wouldnt read
i am going to have to send it in to the companymy high expectations for this game were shattered after i played it
this game does not boast any positive aspects that i can think of therefore i will mention the cons
first off the car physics are atrocious
or better yet i should deduce that there are no car physics
it seems like the developers spent no time trying to make this feel realistic
taking corners doesnt have a solid or natural feel
the car usually turns too sharply
the fighting is equally lack luster and repetitive
when i say repetive people that are reading this and have played the game are nodding their heads in agreement because repetitive is the perfect word to describe the fighting
youll press a couple buttons maybe youll have a gun at times but it never induces a feeling of fun
i found myself randomly pressing buttons just waiting for the adversaries to die
when you want the game to end after a half hour of playing it means its time to hand the control to some unsuspecting victim and get away while you can
luckily i played this game at my friends house
and he was borrowing it from another friend so neither of us had any money deficits to complain about
dropping  on a game like this would be unfortunate
i truthfully cannot recommend this game to anyone
i would not even recommend it to my worst enemies because playing this game is too harsh of a punishment
if you want to see how bad it is you are free to rent it just be aware of how much fun you are not going to havethis game blows
buy quotxiiiquot it rocks
i diont even want to get into it but its the shortest game i have evr played and on top of that the game play is dullon the xbox or ps i could see where this game could be bearable
the pc version is quite a different story
there is no support for a game pad or joystick so the only options are keyboard and mouse
the huge map large assortment of cars and plot mean nothing if you cant control the character or his vehiclei have never seen controls in a game this lethargic
if you derive some kind of joy from knocking over trees street lights sign posts newspaper stands and parking meters this is the game for you
not to worry on a straightaway the sensitivity returns ensuring your course is as predictable as the lottery
the camera angles seem specifically design to ignore the subject of importance
sometimes while apprehending a suspect for no apparent reason the camera will relocate on the other side of a building
during the timed martial arts progression tests half the time is spent scrolling the lazy at full sensitivity camera to look at the target and align the character
its not a contest of skill but a struggle with technical ineptnessas for any bugs i have had multiple crashes from menus locking up to sound loops
my system is fully of capable of playing doom far cry and star wars galaxies so i can assure you it falls well within the basic hardware requirements as well as the latest drivers and directx
its a shame the game looks good has a bit of freedom to do side missions etc
if it was playable id be playing it
to sum it all up its a good game idea wrapped in technically flawed garbagethis game sounded awesome  hours after playing it and beating it i thanked god that it was my stepdads christmas present and not mine
the figting system is the worst ever the driving is like driving in a crappy arcade game and the shooting is way to easy
like i said if you cant beat this game in  hours you are an idiot
i havent played many games worse then this one save your money and like everyone else is saying buy a different game
go with the getaway if you want a better game like this that isnt gta at least the getaways story and gameplay where goodthis has got to be the worst game ever made
the missions are easy as hell
there are stupid multiple endings wich are not that important to me
kungfu
wow
at least gta had an actual criminal who can do st  big dealrap musicgta had true gangster music wich was scarface
true crimes blew big time
i rented it and beat it in  days wich wasnt that much time for me to do
over all it sucksif you want a true gaming masterpiece get grand theft autoor vice citythis game sucks there are no helicopters no motorcyles ectjust plain stealling cars
hey miday why dont you come up with something originali give it this game was simply a vice city in la there was nothing really special about it at all
i would not even recomend renting this gamegame froze every time i entered create mode
what can i say
im a creativity nut
this was even after i cleaned the disc
lets just say its no wonder that there were only  raw games and altogether  smackdown games from smackdown  on ps through smackdown vs raw  on ps
the smackdown series was always superiorthis game was listed to be star wars clone wars but they omitted the fact that it has the tetris game on the same disk which will not play on the xbo proscheap pricegood story lineconswill only play on the old xbox not on xbox i had to make sure i was reviewing the right silent hill because i cant believe how much people like this game
i did like the first silent hill on playstation years ago
then i tried silent hill  for pc and the camera system was so awful i just couldnt stand it
so i gave this one a try and its just boring
you walk around see some monsters kill them blah  shooting them isnt very fun
gee if i want to kill monsters why wouldnt i just go play doom 
its dark
its scary
it uses guns in a far better manner
so that means the only reason to play silent hill is to learn the story
then why not just go read a good book or watch a movie
or maybe walking around a town is fun but hey i can put on my sneakers and walk around towngot this because we two family members two friends and myself wanted a  player risk game without setting up all those freakin pieces on a board
the ps version only lets  human players and  computer players in on a game but we love it even though when were all together someone has to sit out
this version of the game is awful though
i spent a half hour trying to save all players names and colors only to finally say to myself ok the games a bit faulty as far as saving goes
thats a shame
it wouldnt just simply save any more than three names in a six player game
it would just replace one with a new name once a fourth was entered and saved
it even tends to say a player is already in this game when it is clearly not and wont let you put really anything in the player slot after this screw up
but it doesnt end there its confusing slow and downright lame
the only thing that saves it in some way is pressing select for help to figure out what button to press to do what
also in the ps version it will ask you if you are sure when you press a buttonmake a decision
this doesnt
you set your battalions and press the o button sorry your turn is over understood that when it becomes second nature you wont make those mistakes but what if a finger slips or a button is accidentally pressed when passing the controller
another thing that just sucks is the fact that you need a second controller when any more than one player is in the game
why though
the first controller does everything besides one thing defend ok so that means one controller is being passed to set battalions attack check cards free move ect but you have to pass another controller to the person youre attacking just so they can press x to pretty much say ok you can attack me
really
its not like the defender can say no i dont feel like being attacked
the only thing exclusive to the second controller you can do is choose the number of dice to defend with and nothing else awful maybe the second controller plays a different role in the other modes but by this time ive already decided not to play this unless the group wants to give it a whirl five minutes in theyll change their minds
i guarantee it boooooooooooooooofirst of all this game blows nuts and its not fun second who finds entertament by watching gay little soldiers kill each other
bottom line this game sucksits a fun game
wee woohoo yippee
you learn to fly the planes with the greatest of ease and zip through the storyline
the graphics are great
sometimes you have to replay a part  or  times to get past it
its challenging
but then you get to a part in the story called solohos challenges go on google it
that is where the game ends for most people
because suddenly your are required to have a skill level that is totally out of line with the rest of the game  sorta like catch this peanut catch this peanut stop these bullets with your teeth
after    tries you take the disk out of the xbox and throw it away
itll make you angry
you will never finish it
or if you do finish it youll never get that   hours of your life back  its explain why such a highly rated game ended up in the  and under bini loved it right up to the moment i hated it
and then i hated it enough to pitch out
im not sadistic enough to trade this piece of junk in if you must play it try to borrow it
most people who own it will say keep itive played rpg maker  for the ps and i thought it was pretty good especially for a first entry in a franchise
but when i bought rpg maker  i was extremely disappointed
yes the game is now in d there are now actual inbattle animations and the music and sound effects have drastically improved but none of this matters
why
because the interface is so clunky and userunfriendly that its impossible for a layman like me to even start creating something
tasks that you could accomplish in one screen in rpg maker  now requires two three even four separate steps to accomplish requiring that you save your work leave to the main menu then open another screen each time
the instruction manual is useless because its practically in another language and even buying the strategy guide didnt help
this is definitely not a pick upandplay gamei had in mind that this game was overly complex before i had bought it but i wanted to see for myself since i am little more patient i thought than the average person
i found out very quickly that i had made a mistake purchasing this game since it requires that you give up any sembalance of an actual life in order to devote time to it
i finally got frustrated and simply tossed it in my closet of no return where it will remain with a couple of failed novels and various other attempts at creativity
in simple words
this game bitesi dont even know why i got this game in the first place
i mean come on funamation knew this was a horrible attempt at a fighter video game
theres a good selection of characters but the game is easy to win simply stand far away and blast away with special energy attacks
also music and sounds are horrible
there was literally no voice translations only title translations
for dbz fans out there go buy a ps and get budokai   youll be spending about  more than if youve bought ub but youll surely be happyit not fair for me because i dont have an xbox and when my pc version plays it restarts my computer
come on atari make roller coaster tycoon  for  systems
pc xbox gamecube ps and ill even settle for gba if im that desperate
i only want this because my computer doesnt like me and never lets me play my gamesstay away from this game
i loved rct when it came out for the pc and was looking forward for the xbox version
this is a terrible port
the graphics are a joke three generations behind  approaching atari  playing the game with a thumbstick is also very difficultthis is a shame 
an awful shame so dissappointed
i cannot believe that this version of this game would actually be worse than the xbox version
the graphics are absolutely horrible worse than dead or alive worse than the other soul caliburs worse than the tekkens worse than the virtua fighters and worse than the bloody roargameplay is terrible
the characters have to move so slow in this versionnamco did make a good choice for the special guest star link and that is why this game is worth the one star
it dies not deserve anymore starsim not a huge fighting game fan but at first i thought this game was funwith multiplayer simply mashing buttons faster rather that any form of actual technique will always guarantee a winthe other issue is simply that there is no ai
at the beginning of the single player arcade style games the computer opponents just sit there until you knock them out which is about as exciting as staring at the wall
after beating a few dozen rounds the computer opponent improves a little but then immediately after a few improved rounds the computer opponents suddenly can move faster than you or anyone else can ever mash a buttonyou can actually watch legs weapons and entire bodies of your player model passing through the computer opponents as you strikeno damage is caused of course the same is not true of the computer opponent passing through the players character the computer opponent can block at all times even while striking the player can only strike or block not both and there is a transition time between them and the computer opponent can charge up all weapons in roughly one half the time the player can and surprise
the computer opponent does between xx the damage the player can even with the computer doing the lamest misfiring hits
it appears they favored static scripts with very simply conditions to make the computer opponent succeed or fail including outright cheating
sad
so unless youre playing other people youre wasting your time and moneyoh and i forgot to mention the single player weaponmaster mode called so because its certainly not story mode is so boring and contrived that i honestly can not believe its there
par for the coursefortunately i dont have to worry about accidentally buying another product from the company that made soul caliber they dont make anything elsesoul calibur ii is an excellent game but the xbox version i daresay is terrible
the special guest spawn is a horrible fighter
namco could have done better to pick a better guest star for the xboxthe graphics is way better then that off the virtua fighters the tekkens and the bloody roar series but that is the only good part and thats why it is worth one starthis game is fineexcept for it sucks
it takes no skill whatsoever
a no skill no talent moron could play this game and pretend their good at it
whoever plays this game and enjoys it is an absolute idiot
this game is nothing compared to hardcore fighters like tekken street fighter and even king of fighters
when it comes to any aspect of this game it sucks
i must admit the idea of weapons is alright but to make that the key aspect of the game you would think it would be a bit more complicated then just pressing buttons randomly
i swear anyone could win in that game by pressing random buttons
again a no talent no skill game
just another example of how much soul calibur sucksunless you want some fun for only a week avoid this disappointing sequel to the truly great game halomicrosoft has done it again create a great product and follow it up with no substance
there are  reasons that this game now stinks and you can find them all over the internetif you are good with halo halo  will be sure to disappoint you
if you have never played before either one will do but better players are migrating back to the originalthe first time i played it when it was called turok
i will never understand the obsession with first person shooters
they are all the same and halo is no different
ohhh you get to drive in a vehicle been there done that in the s and s
just like eminem its tired folks move onhalo  yep
the game everyone said would be the best
the game everyone said would revolutionize gaming
it revolutionized it all right
it made fpss everywhere feel ashamed that one game could be so dull
it is no and i mean no different from the first halo which also sucked
it has no point whatsoever
point a to b like someone on here had said
oh yeah fpss are supposed to be shooting fun i know but they need a point to them but not this game
shoot reload shoot some more
vehicles give it no touch at all
you want a first person shooter get starsiege tribes for pc
if your pc was mad in  or later your pc can take a game  times better the halohalo  is even worse than halo  halo  is more unrealistic than the first
the vehicles are mainly the same and the guns are a little different
if you didnt like the firt halo dont buy this because it is even stupider
they should have changed the name because it sounds like a game for girls
the grafics havent gotten better
if you like realistic shooting games get conflict veitnam
it is very realistic and theres  missions and over  weaponsim a huge fan of the first halo which i bought over a year ago for my computer and i still play online on a weekly basis
sure the story and structure of the campaign itself are lifted from the original half life but as picasso once said good artists borrow great artists steal
and while halos campaign was great the multiplayer was even betterso when halo  came out i willingly fell into microsofts monopoly trap and bought an xbox figuring the year it would take for it to come out on my computer would be unbearable
boy what a disappointment
heres whyreason  the curse of the vapid sequelhalo  campaign offers nothing new in terms of plot
just a rehash of the same battles with the covenant aliens and some flood zombies who seem a bit superfluous to the convoluted storyline
sure you can now hold two weapons instead of just one and you spend half the game as a covenant alien
but these are really superficial gimmicks
there was nothing substantially different or new to this gamereason   microhaftfirst off i had no idea microsoft would actually have the nerve to charge me  dollars a month in order to play online
there isnt one pc game that charges me to play online
why
because i already pay my cable company for that
so why would microsoft charge me for a service they dont even provide
have you read the papers
thats what microsoft is best at
charging you for whatever they want because if you dont like it and want to go somewhere else you cant
because they have so much capitol from previous monopolies they can buy out an entire company for just one single game and only release that game for their own consoles
which leads to my third disappointment with halo reason  microsoft mediocritybungie designed the interface of the first halo and its simple and intuitive
wanna play online
hit multiplayer and then hit search
boom
a list of games going on all over the world appear on your screen listed by server name game map game type capture the flag slayer etc number of players allowed number of player slots available and server ping speedin halo  designed by the counterintuitive geniuses at microsoft this time rather than bungie you cant choose your map you cant choose your server or even your specific game type
they choose for you
sound familiarand the final reason i am disappointed by halo  its trite but im passionate about it
whether i have a head set or not i am forced to listen to all the stupid racist sexist childish moronic comments the rest of the world decides to blurt from their addinflicted mouths through my speaker systemat least in halo  all the neonazi crap came in the form of text messaging which was easy to ignore as it was fast flying in the corner of your screen
but you cant block out voices without losing all your soundsorry guys some of you might love this new version of halo but im going back to play half life  again a sequel equal to the original
lets just hope microsoft doesnt buy out sierra anytime soondid not work with me as it is for a different region and i couldnt play with it to rate it properlyi dont have this game but my freind sed it was bad so i dont like itmaybe i just dont enjoy fpss like i used to
maybe i expected too much
perhaps games of yesterday that i grew up on diablo  mgs and rainbow six even spoiled me
or perhaps im the only brave soul to offer a counterpoint to the masses blinded eyesi really dislike halo come on admit it
if there was no media hype no one to talk with it about and you played it by yourself with an open mind you would wonder after an hour what youre doing too
if you played good games like the old ones i mentioned or burnout  mk deception and return to castle wolfenstein even reinventing an old school classic feller maybe youd see the light
halo is nothing more than another quake  another halflife  games that supposedly reinvented doom s formula and made games mass market items
ha
i laugh at all you for wasting your money on these games and ask you to pity me wasting fifty bucks on what was supposed to be the best game ever
never will i succumb to blinded critics again
never
you all probably watched titanic ten times too and drool over desperate housewives and extreme makeover home edition
not me buddy
i judge things how i see em not how the mass voice of media doesso for all you like me straight seers i recommend rethinking what games you buy
i realize this review will be assaulted by halo lovers but i only wish to offer a different view
my viewpeace outi am no pancake guru but i can make some really good pancakes from a mix
however with batter blasters vague and inacurate instructions you too can attempt  times to make a pancake and hilariously burn them every time
the instructions tell you just turn the can upsidedown shake and aim the nossel downward and make a pancake any size you want
the instructions tell you to set your heat to midhigh at  degrees
that seems to instantly burn pancakes within a minute of cooking one side
there is no instruction to use any kind of cooking oil or pam on the pan
with or without seems to give the same burnt result
so the next time i adjusted to a midlow temperature like the normal pancakes ive made and that seems to help but i still manage to burn the pancakes quickly when cooking pancakes from a mix ive never burnt one
once i finally made an edible pancake there were plenty of air pockets inside of it
it was pretty synthetic tasting
beware of your results
the instructions also dont say to flip the pancake so maybe youre not supposed toafter making a few pancakes im just left with a lot of questions and no answers
perhaps i am too dumb to make something this simplegreat game and i really enjoyed it when it first released but the graphics on the pc have aged terribly and i even have a brand new graphics card and drivers and it still looked pathetic vice city just doesnt do it for me anymore when there are better games out now that have move features and better graphicsgrand theft auto vice city is one of the greatest games of all time
but dont make the mistake i did
ive already owned the game on the ps so i made a dumb decision by buying it on the pc where i thought the game would have better graphics and controls
i was dead wrong
dont buy this game on the pc unless you have a good computer
i have a windows xp so i wont recommend you playing games on this computer
the graphics are even worse then in the ps version and the controls are terrible
what a waste of money
dont be a moron like me and dont buy this game if you have a bad computermidnight club  has decent graphics if you have the hardware but its a complete failure as a racing game
all of your computer opponents fly past you even on straight stretches with the throttle maxed
the damage to your car and others is completely unrealistic and theres no difference in the way any of these cars drive and handle
i was disappointed with the driving physics in eas nfs hot pursuit but this game makes it look like a racing simulation in comparison
its not even good enough to be considered an arcade racer as the keyboard controls are overly sensitive and theres no way to adjust the settingsthe ps version got a lot of positive reviews but something was lost in the translation to the pc
if youre looking for a racing game with good graphics and driving physics nfs porsche unleashed is the one to beat
this game doesnt come closeprio to buying i contacted rockstar through their website and customer service both told me this game would work for vista it wont
the disk wont even become recognized by vista
i am a computer programmer and very use to getting games to work with vista but this one just wont do itunless you have xp or a little earlier dont bother buying the game
it will just become a paper weightother than that i have read other reviews that at this day in age this game isnt worth your time or money anywaysi have tried installing this game on  different machines with  different graphical setups
no luck at all because im only cin black
i played the old ps game for days on end and if its anything like that it will be awesomebut i guess i will never knowthis game was produced by a japanese company which may tell you something about the style of graphics ie anime style
the graphics themselves are mediocrethis is a console game which was ported to the pcand it really shows
the controls are awkward they can be reconfigured but they are still awkwardthe first  minutes of the game was creditsthe next  minutes was talk and videothe game is difficult to see the colors are a dulldark greenthe start button is the tab button in case you get frustrated trying to figureout what button is startafter spending  minutes with the game and experiencing the controls and interface i knew it wouldnt be fun to playvisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsi had heard nothing but great things about the high heat series and though i read that the interface was poor i thought it wouldnt matter since i had never played before
well i was wrong
i played probably  games and gave up
this game is absolutely terrible and if do doesnt fix things for next year theyre going to be in a mess of trouble
this is just sadthis game is the most disappointing game that ive ever played
i have bought this game since  always refering it to the best baseball simulation game out there
but now i will refer to it as the worst baseball game ever
they have completely changed the game from how it was
for starters you can not and i will repeat not able to use a mouse to navagate throughout the game instead you use the arrow keys along with the insdelhomepg updnend and esc keys
after playing for  sec the only key you will want to hit is the delete key to deinstall it from your computer
i graphics are horrid for it being a  game
drafting takes hours
navigation and gme play makes you want to scream and in the end you just want to use the disc as a fisbee in the time that your not playing the  version
please dont buy this game i wouldnt ask my worst enemy to even touch the game
keep your  version or buy it instead
this is the worst game ever
watching my dog drool is more entertaining
if i could i would give it a negative rating
im sure other feel the same way i do about this sad sad game
if i had my way i would recall every  version of this game and then have a frisbee contest with them
do not buy this game
if your looking to buy a baseball game buy the  version of this game you will not regret buying that version trust me
just one more time all say it and then ill be donedo not buy high heat  i highlight   
thank you for allowing me to vent my frustration from this game
have a nice daypoor design
the world map play is dumb
if you attack and win the capitol you get all territories of that country no matter how big
the battles are the similar to the age of empires with a few new twistsi was not impressedokay so im supposed to build buildings and units
got it
wait im also supposed to walk around and discover rarities that merchants can harvest
got it
wait im also supposed to accumulate wood food amp gold
got it
wait im also supposed to study in the library and and this is the part that bugs me most in every other building
and
im also supposed to build an armynavy and deploy them in a micromanaging way
this game has some great parts  i am not denying that
however it is a horribly flawed nightmare
i loved to micromanage in turnbased strategies
it is next to impossible to accomplish this in a rts
i feel torn between wanting to research build gather and explore
i defy anyone finding an enjoyable balance
rise of nations would be far supperior if it were turnbased
as it is i constantly feel as though im neglecting one of my four desires
also it is ridiculous to be required to research advancements in multiple buildings
it sounds organized at first but it becomes a nightmare when trying to stay on top of technology advances
developers should make one research interface
second units should not build buildings
cities should build buildings
do not make me responsible for creating a citizen
this makes no sense
buildings a military unit makes tons of sense but not normal citizens
i am begging the developers to redesign the city interface to encompass these changes
these minor changes would make this game fanasticbeware this program like many other recent games will only run properly on an account that has administrator privileges on windows xp or  that means that in most common home settings school settings or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game
if you have configured your home pc for example so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them limited accounts a recommended best practice you should certainly be following your kids will not be able to play this game
similarly if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to userlevel access then only the administrators will be able to play the gamenote that although i agree with the general consensus that rise of nations is an excellent game my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box it is not and thus i cannot give this product more than a single star because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentationmore information on this issue is availablerise of the nations does not suck nor it is a superhitstartings ok but thenboringits just one of those stragety games which have gone bum after a few daysthe controller is pretty sluggishthe countries are almost the samethere is not even one part in the game where ohits so exiting comes to your mindwarcraft is much betterbeleive methe nintendo ds says that all gba games play with the ds
this game will not it only plays on the top screen which of course leaves you no way to play the game
hitting start or other buttons has no action
im quite disappointed as i wanted to play itdont wnat this to happen to anyone elsedont believe the crap that they try to sell you herethe reason that its getting so many stars is because theyre trying to sell it back and get rid of it and ill tell you whyfirst off the graphics are nothing special
the camera angle is just flat out piss pore
you have to fight the camera every step of the way throughout the game
youll know what i mean if you go and play it
the options menu doesnt help ether when you go to change the controls on your controller it just makes it harder if anythingthe level settings are also a complete failure youll die at least  times just to get to the second level while the setting is on easy
you can take my word on thatthroughout the game your in a constant state of fighting an uphill battle your constantly out numbered your usually almost dead at the end of every battleyou will say to yourself at times how can anyone play this game on a hard level and actually win
the level that i made it to was a boss on a horse that constantly had men showing up is just impossible to beet
after that i just quit the gamein a nutshellthe the fighting engine is awfulthe camera angles are a never ending struggleoption menu is uselessand the pressure just continues as you go on
the harder it gets the less you want to play itunless if you get joy out of yelling at your tv all the time
do not buy or even rent this game
this game is increasingly stressful and you will find no rest or fun in this game at alli was not pleased with this game
although i am a major fan of the both the original and remade battlestar galactica this game was very difficult to control and track the cylons right from mission   unless you are already an ace at working the controllers and have every buttons location memorized like your hand youll spend most of your time trying to even find a cylon even though they are all over you and the galactica
part two of mission  is almost impossible to beat and you have to start the game over from the very start every time
stick with just the tv showsas a long time fan of the xfilesi am sorry to saybut this game sucksthe storyline is just flat out dumbthe controls are crapthe voice acting is so badthat its laughable and its not even in the least bit scarythere was absolutley no effort put into this game at alland it showsyoure much better off buying one of the silent hillresident evil or fatal frame gamesthen thisguys are you serious
golden sun tla get  stars
why everyone rated this mediocre game so high is beyond mepositive i like the puzzleoriented dungeons and the dijn system some tunes are catchy at least better story then golden sun negative worst sound effect ever really disturb me the noise of a drill is a lot better to my  ears graphic in the word map is laughable the most deformed pile of pixel ever seen the other in game graphics are no good either
battle graphic is pixellated almost as the word map
the exploration graphics are really overrated repetitive and the color palette is too light story is very lacking childish generic cliche and predictable characters are not interesting at all a bunch of  stereotyped childs aside from the story this game is  identical to golden sun  arghh the worst thing about golden sun the atrocious script
i nerver seen most long stupid and boring dialogues like these
seems like the script is writed by moron  childs and for moron childs the yesno choices are totally useless and make the game dialogue even more stupidgraphic  music story characters gameplay sound effect originality dialogue this thing is a mess
my ps barely identifies it most of the timeand its a struggle to make it work
every time i plug it into the psand go to accessory settings to choose my input deviceit is not even listed as an option
 of the timeit may appearand i can chose it
and when that doesit works greathoweverfor  that is a reallyreally bad deal
you would be wiser to spend your money on the sony oneand avoid this shoddy work of material
maybe i got a dudi dont knowi just thought id warn youmy opinion avoid
avoid
avoidoki have to admit for awhile i was addicted to the sims i mean totally addicted
i had all sorts of crazy dyfunctional families living in the most bizarre houses and wearing the most bizarre clothes i could possibly find
all of my sims were at the top of their career ladders with tons of friends and lots of money
but then i realized something was definitely missing
the games just werent fun anymore
i even bought unleashed vacation and living large to add somethingthat missing ingredient
but i still havent found it
and the sims now sits on the shelf all aloneand i dont think i ever want to play it again
the little objects are quotamusingquot for awhile but then everything becomes too repitive
a game is supposed to take you far and away into a whole different world but the sims is almost exactly like normal day life with a few strange objects perfect weather and neveraging people
no matter how many new junk maxis piles into the expansion packs the game will never have a point
and please if you already got a lot of sims products you really need to stop buying these games
they become a large expense take up a ton of computer memory and get pretty boring in a short period of timethis is a polygonal beatemup game along the lines of fighting force and hidden invasion
and like those two its a horrible gamethe camera is sloppy
not as bad as hidden invasion but it can sometimes get stuck at inappropriate places i aint talkin in a good way either
 and you have no control over itthe gameplay is monotonous
you knock thugs around and then follow an arrow to where you beat more people up
at some point in the stage you press the a button to activate a switch or call another angelthe controls are awkward
once again the analog shoulder buttons are used at full disadvantage you have to press them all the way in until they click
on the default control setup you jump with b punch with y kick with x pick stuff up with a focus on an enemy with r switch targets with z and temporarily powerup with l this setting can be frustrating when trying to perform an arial attack
you can also switch the actions of b and x but that doesnt really make things easier
if you have to know the start button pauses the game and brings up a menu the control stick moves the angel and the crosspad and yellow cstick do nothing as far as i rememberthe music is soso with various technotunes and a louzy digital song at the start menuyou can access bonus features such as a teaser photos anduh i cant remember what else by collecting cds and memory sticks scattered around the areas
you can also watch each computergenerated fullmotion video piece as many times as you want after you get to that part in the gamethe character models might pass for okay on an earlier console but on todays systems i expect more polygons and better textures
the outfits arent too bad thoughi dont recommend buying this game or even playing it
if you have to satisfy your curiosity like i did try a rentalthis game is average to slightly hard level
spyros moves are ice breath super ice breath fire breath fire ball wind super windelectric breath glide and charge
his objective is to collect items and gems and trade them for hearts needed to complete the game
the game is relatively boring especially whenever your constantly going back and forth between two worlds to open chest or return items you youve found
there is almost no storyline as with most spyro gamesyeah you heard me right
before you go ballistic on me though let me say why this game has infuriated meessentially this game is the exact same as infection
you still run around computer generated dungeons trying to forward the story which does get a bit more interesting but not nearly enough to save this game
you still data drain and gate hack and fight big bosses with your evergrowing party all of the new characters incidentally have the most annoying voices and inane dialogue imaginable until you duke it out with a super boss at the end and save your data to load into the next gameof course this isnt enough to warrant  star indeed i played the first game and liked it despite being too easy and a bit short only  hours to beat the last boss
no where this game fails is the following you are actually penalized for purchasing and playing the first game
by playing infection you essentially remove half of the levels in mutation
thats right bandai in its infinite wisdom decided that they would put amny of the levels from infection into mutation i guess so that they could bring in some new saps
of course that means that theyve given the shaft to fans of the game figuring that were so stupidly addicted to their product that we will purchase the sequels no matter what they do
so there are no benefits to playing the first game except that you can keep you old emails and character name whoopee
i finished mutation in  hours
nine
ive already been burned but i hope i can give you an option
if you want to play  hours for fifty bucks buy the game
otherwise i suggest you wait for xenosaga episode  those folks know how to treat fansokay i was a beta tester for this game and over the course of the beta i liked it a bit at first
what an unfortunate occurence that they took what could have been a great game in its early stages and every single new patch that came out just kept ruining the game more and more
a new patch would come out and id have hopes theyd undo some of the lame changes they made and wouldnt you know it they only made the changes worsei would say the only positive elements to this game were being able to cue your upgradeshence the  star and making the undead a much better race
all in all your still limted to four races while a rts called rise of nations has  races 
yes my friends  races to choose from all with their own unique units
best of all your never limited to a specific build order and you have things like attrition damage and national boundaries
things like forts and towers actually do damage and dont fall instantly to fireafter playing some other games like rise of nations i realized that blizzard is making this more for thier youngest core gamers and players and well them youngins can have it
id say it aimed more for the  range than anything else
so you blizzard fanboys can have your frozen throne ill just keep playing rise of nations and have a blastolder more mature gamers who want a little more thought and a little less repetition should get rise of nationsits blizzard
so of course i did buy it just for the new world editor so i can undo blizzards changes and actually have a little fun with it
guess ill be stuck playing custom gamesthat is not a sign of a great game
a sign of a great game is being able to play any style multiplayer against the ai random people on battlenet or your friends
its just not worth it to only be able to play custom gamesid like to mention this game got a  out of  rating while rise of nations got a  out of  guess who got real time strategy right 
not blizzard 
i hope some from blizzard reads this review and maybe just maybe theyll take a look at rise of nations and figure out what to do right next time
they turned warcraft into rushcraft which is the element of change i didnt likebootcrashbootcrash its the painkiller polkathats what happened after i installed this mess
i knew that i was in trouble when the package contained  cds and there was a message on the box stating whoops we messed up use cd  to start the game not duh
uhoh
and of course after installing this game then downloading the patch already the developers have a patch
why doesnt dreamcatcher just finish testing the game before they start selling it
the darned thing still doesnt workworse yet its an exception that is not handled since there is no error message just boot then crashi know what you are thinking well you must have a bad system it works fine on my machine
first i have over  games loaded on my pc  from microsoft pinball to dead mans hand  and they all work
i have the latest version of directx loaded and my video card is an  mb ati  series my sound card is an audigy  and my computer has a gig of ram and it is a p  ghzbut that really isnt the point
i expect a complete game when i plunk down some serious  for one not some patchedup mess
i shouldnt have to rebuild my entire pc to run this game when over  others including games released in the same month as painkiller work perfectlythis is just a sloppily slappedtogether piece of code
dont waste your time on it until they fix all the bugsyou gotta be kidding me this is why i threw my doom game away
all this game is about mindless shooting
no plot to the game at all just run around and kill things
hey
i love fps but this is ridiculous
this is the first game ive bought in a long time that isnt worth the money
oh sure the graphics are ok even a bit spooky but geez gimme a break
it mustve been designed for mindless gamers without any other purpose other than to shoot things what a waste
you go from one level to the next mindlessly shooting creatures
over and over and over again dont waste your money
buy far cry
its by far the best game out so farok most of us expect some cliches when playing a fps
its part of the genre fair enough but there is no excuse for unispired level design creatures lame enemy ai
and boring game play
do the graphics look nice
sure
is the sound decent
its ok it wont scare the wits out of you like system shock  or doom but itll do
is it fun
absloutely not
most of the attacks can be avoided by side stepping strafing
the enemy is far from engaging and the levels have a rehashed boring been there done that feel to them i thought itd be fun to play an ultraviolent game for a change
it was fun for the first  minutes
after that the game gets a little old and makes you a little cranky
especially when you sit and wait for the next scenario to load
i think the developers did that on purpose to tickoff the gamer even more and make him even more violentthe graphics started out nice enough but i guess the guy doing the building interiors had the week off when they put this game togetheras far as a fulfilling experience the only thing this game teaches is how to get mad
most of us have figured that out alreadyfor all you gary coleman fans this game is a must
for everyone else you can find better use of your timeobviously intended to be irreverent superviolent and disturbing rating postal  on a politically correct moral or ethical basis would be ridiculous
so lets just rate it on quality of programming and enjoyment of gameplay shall wethe graphics not bad but certainly not on par with games like no one lives forever  and mafia
the game does utilize the unreal engine and has some nice textures here and there but the town has a very artificial and claustrophobic feel to it
the npc textures are ok as well but nowhere near those in return to castle wolfensteinthe sounds very soso
i found the weapon sounds in particular to be very unrealistic  especially the ar
it sounds like an airgun
in a game where gunplay is an essential part of the fun this is a glaring flawai
 not nearly good enough to be satisfying in the way the game claims to aspire to
to truly descend into the cellar of bad taste the npcs would have to behave in a believable manner with a certain complexity of interaction available
as it stands the npcs have a very limited range of behaviors
this combined with the soso graphics makes for a very artificial environmentgameplay obviously the creators did not have the funding nor programming talent to make postal  into a game with cuttingedge graphics and groundbreaking gameplay
even with these limitations however the developers could have made the game far more fun with just a little thought into what makes all of us want to go postal
getting stuck in traffic having to wait in long lines getting dissd by a rude employee  with a little creativity the programmers could have inserted these scenarios into the game to add fuel to our virtual postal tendencies
as it stands apart from the postal dudes general psychosis your player has no real motivation to go wacky  and the ai
just isnt good enough to make it fun when you do

game ran fine on highest resolution with only a few stutters here and there but i found loading times to be a bit excessive  especially considering the lesser graphic qualitydeveloper running with scissors was obviously trying to cash in on the popularity of rockstars quotgrand theft autoquot series and they failed miserably
the game is boring and pointlessthe plot is simple the player assumes the role of quotthe postal dudequot and each day sets off to complete a list of boring tasks like going to the store for milk
invariably each mundane task ends in disaster as various nutty groups in the game burst in and start shootingthe game plays up the quotchoicequot the player has whether to be passive or to quotgo postalquot with various weapons
theres no reason to play passive and the novelty of the overthetop violence gets old fast
characters spout inane dialog and the only high point of the game is when gary coleman yes gary coleman makes an appearance at a mall which of course ends in a gun battlealthough powered by the unreal engine postal  looks drab
out of the box the game has some serious bugs including ridiculously long load times between levels
this gets frustrating fast as there are so many level changes to get from point a to point b  a recent patch has fixed this issue but the game remains a pointless exercise in futilitysometimes the saving grace for a bad singleplayer game can be the multiplayer option
quotpostal quot does not have multiplayer
instead you have to actually purchase the multiplayer addon for 
running with scissors might have scored an extra star had it released the multiplayer part for free as was the case with the quotreturn to castle wolfensteinquot multiplayer expansion quotenemy territoryquot which started life as an expansion to rtcw and ended up being a free standalone productyoure better off spending the  on the vastly superior quotgrand theft auto iiiquot or for ten bucks more quotgrand theft auto vice cityquot  either choice is a better one than the terminally boring quotpostal quotthis game is a lame excuse for attention
the missions are meaningless and stupid
you go to the store to buy a gallon of milk theres one mission
the game says only as violent as you are but is intentionaly made for you to be as violent as possible or the missions wouldnt be so linear and stupid
cutting a young girls head off with a shovel blowing a police officers head off with a shotgun and kicking it around as a soccer ball pouring gasoline on someone and lighting them on fire and harmingbrutaly murdering helpless animals are some examples of the terrible and discusting violence included
obviously the people that make this need to be sent to an insane asylum because it is not funny at all
its the grossest game on the market and totaly uncalled for
if youre gonna make a game as graphicly violent as you can the least you could do is include some bad guys
but there are none at all except for yourself
the graphics arent good and everything else about the game is bad to an unbelievably high extent
im not one to complain about a violent video game but this is just sick
go buy gta or vice city if you want to go on a rampage because this game is sofa king dumb
avoid at any and all costs
if you find it on a shelf for  cents on clearence its still not worth it because its such a bad gameback in the day games were difficult and these are no exception
without some sort of guide to walk you through it you could spend hours racking your head against the wall because the game is so vague about things that you dont know where to go or what to do
not the best story eitherokay let me start by saying im the biggest ff fan in the world
no question
but this game was like all old and edited and stuff
nothing near the greatness that is final fantasy  the graphics are all terrible nothing like ffs
did they think us super fans wouldnt notice how terrible this was if they just put two terrible games in the package
shame on you square
i dont know how im ever going to forgive youthis game is pathetic
the gameplay is like any cutandpaste firstperson shooter and is therefore boring
the ghoul engine is a good idea but the way it was executed was pathetic
okay so youre telling me in real life if you take a slash at someones face with a pocket knife you will abruptly take out a inch by inch chunk of flesh and bone from their forehead for no apparent reason
and that if you fire at a guys chest with any weapon all you get is a dimensional hole with absolutely no d effect on it unlike the head and limbs and only if you shoot it perhaps five or six times with a shotgun it will be blown into a big red slab of what looks like meat that will disappear in six seconds
that you can shoot off a guys leg at the hip with a microuzi
that if you do blow a guys arm or leg off at the shoulder or hip the severed limb mysteriously disappears
please
other games didnt have this type of gore effect but thats what makes them superior to this at least they dont try and fail miserably
thats what is truly sad the developer striving to be revolutionary but just ending up with something that pisses you off at the unprofessionalism of itnot only that but the aiming device sucks
its a poor attempt at mimicking the tom clancy game dot and sight iccon that increase in diameter signifying the innacurateness of your weapon
but in this one its always crosshairs and if you stand still and shoot one round with your microuzi you can hit an enemy precisely in the head at any range if you aim for them
how frickin dumb
and also a highlytrained mercenary with experience like a green beret goes all john woostyle and uses two handguns at once or two microuzis at once
okay the military doesnt teach its troops to do that crap
realism my arseits a very long game but is very very boring
all the missons are the same go down a linear path getting more weapons shoot people blast them to pieces
even if there is a random scenario engine to create missions for you to do in different enviroments its still all the same only the maps changethe voice acting is terrible the poor and stereotypical plot twists were easily perceptible from miles away the plot itself was terrible everything about this game was downright retarded
now normally i dont care about graphics in the videogame but the gameplay and plot was so terrible i have the right to complain about them for once
simply put theyre horrible
the character models are blocky and generally lame to look at which makes you wonder why the heck it has such high system requirements the enviroments are completely bare and unrealitic the ghoul engine was poorly executed whoever designed that must have been on drugs so was whoever described it as being ultrarealistic
there is nothing good about this game
nothing at all
it wasnt fun it didnt impress me in the slightest it was the exact opposite of what they advertised it to be it isnt worth any amount of money greater than 
now if you have very very low standards go ahead and buy it and have fun blowing peoples heads off with a shotgun how original or blowing their limbs off or cutting their head arms and legs with a combat knife with a few weak swipes and try to mutilate their torso before it blinks into nonexistence but it gets old real fast and it makes you wonder why the developer ever gave permission to pass this off for being ultrarealisticand for yet another attempt at creating a halfwaydecent game the developers decided to put a little stealth meter so you can get the impression that you can sneak around and use some type of strategy
however if you crouch and sneak up on someone theyll hear you because of their supersensitive ears turn around and shoot at you but if you crawl on your stomach you can get right up to them bump into their legs stand up and slash the back of their heads without anyone noticing even if one of your enemies is standing three feet away with his back to you
what the heck is with this game and a lack of realismman i am so mad i paid  for this piece of crap
dont bother save your money and go buy a good fps like red faction unreal tournament even postal  as sad as it may be
a general rule if a game is going to have a crappy excuse for a plot then just exclude the plot altogether
thats what makes postal  superior to this even though it is a secondstring gamelet me start off by saying what everyone else is generally saying about this game the graphics are bad
the graphics are about as good as the old playstation  the characters and environments look blocky and lack any detail
the graphics are so bad they even make the game difficult  its hard to tell which direction youre going because everything starts to look the samethe gameplay is mediocre
running seems slow and awkward rather than speedy and fluid
the gunfire is interesting  the weapons really kick so aiming is more realistic
otherwise sof plays just about like any other first person shooterthis game is touted for its realistic weapons damage
hitting different parts of enemies bodies results in different body parts being blown off
call me crazy but i dont think sadistic violence can make up for a poorly designed and executed game
at any rate you have to be really close to even notice so its not a big deal
overall this game is so bad i regret spending the five bucks just to rent itthis game is an absolute insult to the gaming capabilities of the xboxgraphics  on par with a second grade ps one gameambience  repetitive sounds and lack of sound control crouching produces as much footnoise as walking destroy any hopes of creating any element of suspenseai  rather read as as for artificial stupiditycontrols  they work well hence the single staroverall i recommend that if you are looking for a fps save your money and wait for the releases of ghost recon island thunder or medal of honor rising sunthis is another pc ported game that is a complete miss
like some pc ports that end up on the xboxthey are better than the pc version but not with soldier of fortune  this game looks bad graphically and plays terrible with lousy ai
there is no excuse the xbox is far capilable of more and this is unexcusable gamei thought the pc verison soldier of fortune  was bad but this port is worse
however the ported game does get rid of the annoying fog issue like the stupid pc titleso that is one positive
bottom linenot even worth a rentalbut as far as buying save up for quality gameshalodoaninja gaidensoul calibur halo mid doa tbaill tell anyone with an ear what i think about this game or  eyes to read my review
it is absolutely awful
not only does it attempt to throw mud on everything that was great and original about ffx but the scariest part is it almost succeedsfor those who seem to love this game preteens and anime geeks i imagine lets break it down the same way you all did only this is strictly for those who like quality game play quality characters and above all no japanese pop songs or pop princessesplot like being trapped in the worst anime and having to play as the characters in one excruciating scenario after another
yuna rikku most annoying character from the previous game makes a new appearance
yay
 and emo girl paine are now singing sensations in spira
nefarious villains seem to dislike your newfound pop success and in a pointless quest for mundane spheres cackle and plot in such overdramatic form it would make the wicked witch of the west melt in embarrassmentcharacters the aforementioned yuna and rikku have all their most annoying traits laid bare in this game
while you could forgive the sometimes weak dialog and annoying vocal talents of them in ffx they dont have such sweet characters as auron or lulu to balance them
emo girl paine is hardly a good enough replacement
oh im sulky and beautiful and the world doesnt understand me
im going to funnel my angst into my songs
gameplay the biggest difference between ffx and its sequel is the reintroduction of classes a muchbeloved ability that allows characters to assume the roles of mages gunslingers swordsmen and other useful roles
not so in this game
you switch between them in battle meaning you dont stick with one class for longer than a few monsters meaning you never associate any character with any one class meaning they become frivolous fast
and who the hell wants to be a singer in the middle of a battle
oh right preteens and anime geeksmusic gagoverall the darkest hour in final fantasy history was when this game was released
its a discredit to other games such as the masterful ffviii that are given the same rating on amazon as this one
if you buy it i very much hope you are only buying it to melt it into unrecognizable plastic so it can be recycled
otherwise you are encouraging this scatterbrained drivel to be reproduced in the futureim going to make this simple if your a traditional final fantasy fan who enjoyed cecil bartz cloud zidane and all those great guys then skip on this game its titled final fantasy but it completely strays from the path the only positive is the graphics but the story and game play are awfulwow i thought that final fantasy series would be the best series ever well i was wrong ive played ff from  to  except for the  that never reached the states well this games simply sucks it looks great great sound the interesting clothes changing in the middle of the battle the excelent battle system wow at first you look at the game as the thing that youve been expecting for so long but then you see the reality chapters one chance to do some things and the incredibly torturing percentage system
to speak more clearly there are some things that you can do only once if you fail on doing it you have to reset and retry it there are people that you can speak with to advance in the percentage and there are people that you should avoid to advance in the percentage if you speak to somebody you shouldnt in the chapter youll miss the percentage needed to see what you came looking in this game then if you miss something you cannot do it again if youre in a different chapterits confusing the fact that you cannot do everything when you see the people or get the mission because youve to do some thing in the  chapter to get  but you can do the same thing in chapter  but youll get to really enjoy the game you need a gameguide to be reading all the game along the official one wont serve you by the way you need something done to get all the percentage the game has five endings but only one ending that you want to see the  ending because the others just suckin conclusion the traditional talking to people and nice walking around the world is jeopardized by the fact that youre going to screw it talking to somebody you shouldnt until chapter  or  causing it to give you less percentage or not giving you percentage at all
those people you saw with bad eyes because they constantly use game guides to beat the games well youll become one of them with this gametrue ff fans avoid it at all costs this game sucks big time just stick to the story of the x and you will remain happy with yuna and his friendspeople of square hironobu sakaguchi what where you thinking when you created the percentage system
i can see now why namco is gaining ground on the rpg gamesi was skeptical of this game from the start but i bought it anyway because games with female lead characters amuse me
lets see what was good about this gamenothing
a game where all you do is run around and play dress up
wow
that will appeal to masses  if your a  year old girl 
any rpg fanatic like me has nothing but respect for squaresoft and the final fantasy series but my respect level has gone down a few points
im sure squaresoft will be more careful in the future after the horrible reviews this game has received  i was surprised to see there were actually some high reviews on this game here at amazon 
but no one who knows what good rpgs are all about will give this game a good review
talking about this game makes me lose my temper so im going to quit nowwhere to start
sigh just thinking about this game gets my blood boiling
i cant for the life of me understand why some people are giving this  stars
well first off just let me say that i am female
it should be glaringly obvious that this game is targeted towards a female audience or so squareenix may believe
unfortuneately i was sickened by this game
well lets start with something goodgraphics  not bad at all
im not too picky about graphics and i can honestly say that these are pretty good
bright shiny nice for a ps gamemusic  honestly this is a matter of opinion but i didnt like the mix of jazz techno and pop that made up this soundtrack
the final fantasy series is known for its beautiful classicalstyle music and this game is a huge departure from that
the airship music made me want to turn off the sound and put a previous games soundtrack into my cd player
the only song i really liked was a thousand wordscharacters  this section may even deserve a negative rating
its like squareenix decided to make a game just for the women out thereexcept they chose the top  of the female populous that were the most stupid shallow and airheaded people they could find for advice on what to put in this game
this game gives real women a bad image
yuna a mature intelligent character i love from ff has been kidnapped and replaced with a body double who has the intellect of a cardboard box covered in glitter
i mourned the loss of the real yuna
ff yuna grappled with such deep and complex issues as selfsacrifice and questioning her faith ff yuna likes playing dressup and uses words like dissasteriffic
honestly the other two characters are no better they are just as shallow and stupid
i was actually excited about the allfemale cast i was expecting the intelligencelevel of the female characters from ffnot to be found herestory  wow
this story is vapid
it starts out promisingly enoughyuna views a sphere of someone who looks like tidus and sets out to find out if the impossible task of ressurecting him can be accomplished
the rest of the story falls apart from there
the vast majority of this story is made up of minigames and sidequests
now i like sidquests and minigames as much as the next person but theres a reason they have the words side and mini in them
they are supposed to take a backburner to the main story
in this game its the other way around the main game is composed of one dull uninteresting sidequestminigame after another while the main storyline takes forever to emergedevelop
by the time the main story finally got around to being focused on i no longer caredbattle system  i had no real qualms with the actual battle mechanic
the system is a variation of turn based that is rather fast  battles move quickly and your characters move around the field helping you break out of the lets all line up and attack feel of previous games which i actually didnt mind at all
i must say that the dresssphere system itself is actually a rehashed version of the job system from ffv
except in ffv it felt serious and maturehere it feels like youre playing barbie dressup
also unlike ffv you usually need to switch outfits in midbattle which slows battle down in an irritating fashion
another complaint that brings down the score in this section is the irritating phrases of your characters in battle
just listening to rikku sqeal out another irritating inane phrase makes me cringegameplay  if the rest of my review isnt enough for you heres the final nail in the coffin
i was excited when i heard this game would be nonlinear
i thought it would be like chrono cross where there was a story that you moved through but certain key decisions ie
choose to rescue a character vs not doing so made along the way would affect future plot points
not so here it is a mission based system with almost no direction
the only real effect skipping half the inane crap does is to keep you from getting the perfect ending
things as small and pointless as forgetting to talk to one random npc in chapter  could make you miss  a point which would prevent you from getting that perfect ending
the effect of this is that you must follow a guide to the nearest letter thus ruining any feeling of nonlinearity
oh and all those fun sidequests youll be doing arent fun at alloverall score  note that this is not an average its my subjective feel of what this game deserves
as for whether you should rent or buy this i suggest neither
in fact if youre a fan of the original ff i suggest you forget this game ever happenedevery jappanese game i have played has nerdy  irritateting dialog
it is so bad that they realy need to add an option on these games that let you skip all story line and dialog and just play the game
since the dialog in the first final fantasy was so annoying you would have to be a nerd to shell out money for the the second editioni think most rpg gamers expected something decent out of this game
beinga hardcore gamer myself and someone who loved its prequel ff  i was jumping to buy first off let me say that this is the only final fantasy game i ever returned
thats right i keep all my games even the average ones
this one however i had to return due to its piece of junknessff  revolves around a trio of girls  of which were characters in the previous ff  game
they go off on their adventures doing this doing that and in general you dont really know quite what they are doing
unlike regular rpgs where you have a story and a plot this game sorta starts with you in your little flying ship able to go everywhere
its like gigantic minigame
the places you go to dont really have any story you just land at place a fight monsters get some item and your done
saying this there are some awesome minigames in ff  which was surprising since most recent final fantasy games have failed with minigamesnow onto the irritating part
you get to play  girls as characters
 annoying teeniebop girls
girls who are what late teens
except they act like they are  they run about saying oh poo and other similiar phrases
plus they take baths in skimpy underwear and massage other girls and walk about in thongs and skin tight outfits
mmm as a  year old gamer i immensely enjoyed it not
the game looks like it programmed by experienced japanese gamers but created by their  year old daughters and designed by their  year old horny sons
to gain abilities and powers you have to change into outfits
thats right you change your girls clothes to gain abilities
and each outfit is tighter and more revealing than the lastthe game looks beautiful definitely as great or better graphics as ff  but thats all the game excels at graphics
no plot no story very very bad dialogue and character development unless you count bras and thongs as development
there are some very good minigames and of course the grapics look stunning did i say that already
but if you arent a  year old kid you will hate this game
i couldnt even push my way through the dumb parts i got disgusted with the game half way through and had to return it for something decentwhat is this game
i have no idea
final fantasy x was very good
this is supposed to be its sequel
this is hardly a sequel if even a squaresoft game at all
what were they thinking
i feel ashamed that it has inherited the final fantasy name and i think it was somewhat disgraced it
lets look at some of the quotnewquot things
first off people complained that ffx was too movie like and there wasnt enough choice in the sequence of events til the very end
so what they have decided to do is take out all boundaries whatsoever and give you almost total free reign on the world
instead of guided free reign such as most final fantasys you can go pretty much wherever you want and could beat the game without having really even skimed the surface of the other playable features
from the moment you start you are given access to a flying ship
it seems as if they didnt write enough story for the game so they simply used the worlds they had already created for ffx for you to roam around in with new minigames
next whats with the changing of the victory theme
the famous victory theme from almost the beginning of final fantasys has been changed for the sake of this game
how could nobuo uematsu let them do that
you can really tell who this game was aimed at
i mean no secret characters and you change your abilities by changing clothes
final fantasy fans please raise your hand if this appeals to you
i cant say it wasnt entertaining somewhat thus the one star but mostly that was from laughing at it
when you look at how other final fantasies evolve story wise there are always major events that happen that change your story or plot is a big way towards the middle of the game
not here
the only big things that happen are at the end
the old lesson with movies applies here as well
sequels arent usually as good as the originals
here it is so to a much greater degree
ffx kicks the pants of this game no contest
for those who liked ffx this isnt ffx and doesnt compare at alllet me sum this up quickly this game sucked and it sucked hard and im only talking about the twentyfive hours i could bear playing it
i am absolutely stupified at how multiple videogame magazines put out nearly perfect reviews on this game
square must have paid them off or something because this game was not imaginative fun or even have a storyline worth thinking aboutstorywise its so non linear you just want to cry
most moments are spent wondering quotwhere do i go now
no really where do i go
i because no one seems to be saying anything useful about where i should goquot  sure we like nonlinear stories for the purpose of making the individual gaming experience unique for every player but did you have to go as far as quotokay no hints just bumble alongquot  its so nonlinear you can actually miss nearly half the game actually i finished chapter  with i think  percent complete
  its so nonlinear even having the strategy guide wont help you make sense of the gamegameplay exploration is a pain since youre not sure if youre even on the right part of the planet most of the time
the battles are even worse since you have to spend half the time switching outfits to get the status bounuses on each dress map thingcharacters i know yuna deserves to have some fun after saving the world but i mourned for yuna because she seems to have died and was replaced by some ditz i want to hit with a blitzball
i want to know what square was on when the thought of the lenne thing because i dont get it and i dont think i want to get itthe premise was sooo promising and to stealparaphrase part of a line from red dwarf quota word has yet to be invented to describle how this game is but you can be sure this game is utterly and totally soquot  its not a flattering word indeedthis game was so disappointing
i mean yuna was a smart all together character in ffx and in this game they make her into a ditsy gun toating diva
not to mention the fact that there are no weapons to equip and i wont even get started on the silly dresspheres
like other reviews have stated i agree i have no idea who this game was supposed to appeal to and it makes me worry about the upcoming final fantasy gamesi read a lot of reviews on ff x and though i love ff games well lets say x sucked and bad and i am a female and i though this game is not interesting
i gave the game back to game stop
ff x is a great game but i dont know what happened in ff xthere are a lot of stupid side quest which i could not stand
it drove me nutsthe game characters looked really weird in my opinioni didnt think the graphics were all the great ok i guess and the story line sucked
i did not enjoy the battle systemi would highly recommend renting ff x before you buy this gamethis isnt a proper final fantasy this is final fantasy with crappy dance sequences
ok this game starts of with a dance sequence with someone if youve played ffx who was up tight and a selfless hero in this shes one of the spice girls literally its like three spice girls painscary spice buch and acts like a man only shes whiterikkubabybloody irratating the worst game character everand yunagingershe doesnt no her place and the new yuna in this game detracts as much as sofia coppola does in godfather part three the fighting style gets put down by dress spheres look i love final fantasy every single one except this this game belongs in hell with hitlerimagine if they made romeo and juliet  and they had romeo and juliet come back to life and live happily ever after
now you know what final fantasy x is all aboutnow that i know how ffx turns out i dont have need to keep my original ffx copy that i always thought of as a classic treasure
ffx had a definite ending and realistically it was about one thing a tragic romance
when ffx was announced i think it was obvious how it would turn out and it does turn out that way
i was a bit surprised that the developers of the game where this predictable
i kept telling myself something else has to happen it cant turn out like a disney fairytale but deep down inside i think i knew itanyway as far as im concerned i just needed confirmation that this was true so that i wouldnt waste my time playing the game
i dont think ill ever play another final fantasy game again
the final fantasy train stops herei mean ive seen bad games but this is a new low for what was a great rpg
leave it as is plus its much more frustratingas the title says this is the worst game of the year
there are some major flaws in the game that give it the 
first of all the gameplay
terrible absolutely terrible
you run around using difficult controls bad camera angles and even worse fighting sequences
come on if your gonna battle then battle
you have to stand there and get hit just like all of the other ffs then when you finally choose the attack you want to do youve already lost alot of life
next the voice acting
the worst ive ever seen well besides sonic adventure  battle that is
and whats with the charlies angels theme
three girls battling evil
uh square enix thats already taken but nice try
trust me do not go for this title
it is a waste of your money
instead of meaninglessly spending money on this title purchase kingdom hearts
its less expensive and alot betteryeah thats what isaid back in  when it first came out
now when i bought it again hoping for a nice little trip down memory lane i was like quothow much did i pay for this
quot yeah not good
there isnt even a multiplayer mode on it
and the chao system isnt even half as advanced as the one in sabattle
the framerate is worse than it was back on dreamcast
i gave it a  but i wish i could have gone lower
its outdated poo
but hey if you actually want to play through all the boring challenges and stuff you can unlockdrum roll please
game gear games
oh yeah and they are really aweful as well
so yeah the only thing that i think this game has going for it is its pretty box art
other than thatstay away please
if you wanna spend  on a sonic game pick up the mega collection
those games a funthis game could have been a great game had bethesda finished it
i am sure that they were pressed for time but to release a defective product there is no excuse
they should have recalled the game
insted all they did was issue an email to stores to expect returns
and even if you follow the step by step instructions from the bethesda site on how to keep the game from freezing or reseting it does not work believe me i tried many times
the game is rather fun when its not malfunctioning however it becomes quiet irritating when you have been at sea for an hour sinking ships only to see your game freeze
arggghhh
so i could not take it any more and returned the game back to the store for a full refund
do not buy this game all of them are defective
shame on you bethesda softworksnba baller for the xbox is such a poorly executed game
it has excellent graphics fluid animation good music and lots of player customization
you can create name your character the way he looks and what clothes he wears
then you can set his attribute skills like how well he dribbles the ball shoots slam dunks speed and so forth
the main problem with nba baller is that the game cheats
you dribble the ball away from the cpu player go near the basket shoot the ball and score points
then you have to play defense and try to prevent the cpu player from scoring but you will see the ai
always catchup and surpass your score
it is so fake
another problem with this game is that it is played  one  basketball there are no teams very few rules and no strategy in the game
this results in a boring experience
there are so many better basketball games out there that you shouldnt bother with this junkprosexcellent graphicsexcellent controlsgood musiccharacter customizationset character attributesconscpu catches upcpu cheatssuper long load timeshalf court gameplayno teams or team matesone on one gameplaygets old really fastneeds more game modesno adjustable camerareally do they really expect us to pay  for a game thats not worth 
its one on one for god sakes
who wants to pay the maximum amount of money for a game for a basketball game when you cant even play real basketball
and who in the name of anyone came up with the idea to ball for cars and items
thats totally lame
sure it would be cool if it was real basketball with the extra one on one feature
but when its just one on one without the real basketball feature ouch this isnt going to do very wellok to start out this review i will try to be nice by saying that the idea for this game was really excellentstart as an average baller in the streets and work your way up to be the best balla ever
along with fame comes money friends cribs cars bling and new moves
excellent idea for a game right
well the only problem about this is that this game sucks bad
just the first competition is extremely hard and the controls are beyond methey have the weirdest moves in the weirdest places
plus right when you start it just jumps you right into a tournament with no prior training expirience or well any basic knowledge of the game
what i thought would help me here was stat building right
wrong
you see i made it so that my  pointer gage was as high as you can make it in the game yet i made  out of the   pointers i shot in the dang tournament
thanks for tricking me into thinking stats actually effesct how good you are
plus the createaplayer is really sucky
trust me this is not the game you want to be buying it deserves the fireplace and nowhere elseexcept maybe the sewer please listen to me and dont waste your money and time as i did mine
trust me the further you stay from this game the better off you will bedisappointing game
saw this in a video store once and ever since then was searching for it
amazon just happened to have a copy so i purchased it
played it and the characters are quite amateurish  when they talk mouths do not move movement is quite cumbersome etc
you drive an wheeler semi through the contryside in an attempt to gain favor with your mother who owns the trucking business
you can crash into buildings cars cop cars motorcycle gangs
you do battle with these elements as well
vehicle upgrades are available but the money that it takes to upgrade is incredible  the money you make on a delivery is soon gone just to buy gas
you can borrow money from a loan shark but the interest they want is also incredible so anythingeverything you earn is quickly gone
anyway amazon was the only place that had this game and i gave it a try
disappointing gamewhat a joke
this is just as bad as the fellowship of the ring game
i really dont see how this game is rated above  star
if you want to play a real lotr game get eas two towers and return of the king
vivendi just doesnt know when to stop
another useless game that will find its way into the discount binshey its your money i just like buying games that are worth the money i spent
fair warning rent the fellowship of the ring and the hobbit first before buyingi really dont know how hard it is to make a battling engine fun
the creators installed bad camera angles
they also made the fighting bland
these  things combine to make the game a lessthanaverage expierience
the camera can affect you during platform jumps
if you want a platform game get quotprince of persia the sands of timequot
if you want a fighting game get tekken  if you want a great game simply avoid quotthe hobbitquotyou need to be a magician or a computer geek just to download this game into your computer
i bought this game  two months ago and havent the foggiest idea on how to get it to run and i have a top of the line computer with lots of powerthe first warning i got that perhaps rhem was not going to set any records for standards was on installation
quotyou will need quicktime quot it informed me
quothere is the website to get itquot a quick search confirmed it they require quicktime an older version at that but dont supply it
you have to go to the apple website and download it yourself
is that impossibly hard does it mean the game is useless and mean
no but its a flashing red light all the same the game is not going to be helpful
you want a shortcut something on the start menu access to the game in any fashion
go get it yourselfrhem feels and plays like a  attempt to be myst with the bad graphics cheap memorystingy movement and dull storyline that weve come to associate with the era
the scenery is machines machines machines
i lost patience with it in record time and hope i never get bored enough to go back to itif you played the original myst and havent used your computer for anything but spreadsheets since then you might find rhem mildly diverting
otherwise dont botherdo not i repeat do not buy this game for your pc
it is marked down for a reason
this game is causing all kinds of problems on many systems go to ubisoftcom and read the pc forums
you will find many people are in the same boat
if you have a cdrw drive the game will not even install properly
even when i did get it to work it was beautiful by the way it froze my entire system and my computer is not even a year old
i have a geforce  card with updated drivers and it still crashed
save yourself the headache and get it for a gaming platform like xbox you spend a few extra bucks but it is worth it
i couldnt return my copy so i sold it to some kid
you have been warnedubisoft incorporated the copy protection software knows as tages into xiii
this is singlehandedly the worst copy protection known to man
its so bad that if you have a cdrw or dvdrw drive in your computer the installation of the game will most likely purposely defect itself towhere the game wont run
if you have cd or dvd burning software or anything even related or any virtual drives the same will most likely happen defective installation
the games quotminimum requirementsquot are a lie since theyre so low and you need brandnew uptodate drivers for all your hardware
not only all that but the game straight out doesnt like some cddvdrom drives and thus wont install properly or even at all
ubisoft support does nothingafter all this youd think they were protecting a really nice game
but no
the game is riddled with bugs and crashes
major bugs are commonplace and the official forum is thriving with hundreds of user requests for bugcrash help
the game also spans  cds for no apparent reason  the game is very short that seemingly randomly need to be changed more copy protection
this leads to scratched discs you cant duplicate thus you must buy the entire game againthe game is beautiful and mildly entertaining albeit short buggy and contains terrible voice acting and a horrid saving scheme
thats if you can even get it to install
what a waste of moneybewaremy computer freezes when i try and play this game which is completely and totally amazing to mei just got done playing doom  which is far more of a resource hog
so i can only guess how good this game is
i even went online and got the update
so my advice is dont waste your money
it is a dogupdate  ok i did some research which i should have done first there is pretty much no way to play this if you have a cd burner the game thinks that if you have the software to burn cds youll try and make illegal copies of the disk
instead of burning copies i think ill just burn the original
or perhaps drive over it with my car
and then burn it
or perhaps stupid ubisoftgame is a total joke and a waste of money
storyline just jumps from one topic to another its hard to keep up with whats going on
the save system really ruins the game with is making you start at the beginning of level or two levels in a cheap attempt to make the game seem longer
ai is worthless and almost comical at times as they get stuck in between walls and fail to sound alarms when they spot youfor all those reviewers who couldnt make this game work with their video cards dont feel bad about it just get your refund and thank your lucky stars that you didnt try to play the wretched thingid really like to have a word with the idiot who designed the user interface
there are several adhoc standards for interaction and motion and uru uses none of them
the involuntary switch between first and thirdperson viewpoints is clunky and confusing
try schizm ii for a good example of how to do it ladsthere is no conventional save and restore mechanism the game remembers your latest position and restores you to the start of that level when you restart the game
infuriatingalthough several of the puzzles involve moving objects the only way the system allows you to do this is by nudging them with your feet
what was the designer thinking aboutnow that ive got further into the game my initial impression of the graphics has improved although much of the interiors are that muddy greybrown typified by games like morrowind there are a few nicelyrendered scenes
backgound music is sparse and the samples are too short  after the third or fourth iteration even a pleasant tune becomes irritatingquite frankly the game looks like an attempt to capitalize on the myst branding by a bunch of moneygrubbing hacks who wouldnt recognize a playable adventure game if one jumped out from behind a bush and bit their leg offbiggest disappointment of the  gaming season id sayrunning with amd athlon xp  radeon  and a gig of ram so no technical or performance problemsthe game itself is the problem
the user interface is terrible
character movement is clumsy and imprecisethe game itself seems pointless an aglomeration of nothing in particular for no discernible reason
as many have remarked probably the base uru was originally intended as a small set of training levels for online play which at the present does not look like it is ever going to happenrunning around the desert at the beginning for no reason at all with nothing much to do or see was the most fun i had with the game and that was not much fun
it was all downhill from there
there is no coherence to the game experience that i could discern
the puzzles are just stuck in they do not feel like part of the story
indeed the story is really just a shell of a building without an interior again the story itself was something that would be expected to develop in the online playoverall i found the atmosphere the music the ambience and the art to be rather depressing
i would like to say that there are some good moments that make up for it all but if there are i never encountered themreviews tend to be either love it or hate it when it comes to uru
i would highly recommend trying the demo first before buying the gamedespite the rave reviews by ubisoft employees posing as customers athena sword like raven shield is substandard and buggyubisoft has a tendency to buy companies with hit titles and then have their own development teams produce lower quality sequels hoping to make sales on the strength of the original games reputations
ever since ubisoft bought red storm entertainment and started producing the rainbow six games themselves the gameplay has changed for the worse the story lines have become increasingly contrived and obviously written with more concern for political correctness than realism and the bugs have been out of controlthere have been over a dozen patches released for rainbow six  raven shield since its release and athena sword has even more bugs
i have never owned a game which required so many patchesthe online play is nowhere near as good as rogue spear although better than counter strike if you prefer realistic tactical shooters to the runandgun arcade style games and the single player campaigns arent challenging enough to provide more than a few hours of entertainmentif youve already bought raven shield and are considering buying athena sword my suggestion would be to wait until the price drops which is closer to its actual worth
in the meanwhile there are plenty of better designed usermade levels for single player and multiplayer play available for free download all over the internet if youre looking for more content for raven shieldhere are a couple of the problems and bugs found so farwhile prone with the mg heavy machine gun there is no animation of the belt being fed through the receiverwhile using an athena sword weapon the hand and arm models in first person view have holes in the geometrythe sm cqb machine gun points around a  angle upall of the athena sword weapons have the same firing sound with small tweeking and not the awesome new sounds ubi promisedthe ga and the gka appear to be identical to the player except for colorthere are areas where textures which are supposed to be flagged as false backdrop are not and the skybox does not show through like it is supposed toi feel totally ripped off by this pathetic excuse for an expansion
ubi you wont be in business much longer if you dont get your act togethersay goodbye to this once loyal customer you lost methe company i got this from sent a gamecube controller instead
i did own this product before tho and it was a lot fun being able to play game boy games on a bigger screen
if you can find one with a disc to play it buy iti buy most every game that comes out
i have a  rating in aoc and hovered just below k in aom when i played
i also play most of the other mmorpgs with the exception of daoc just not my speedi have never ever seen a game that has this many catastrophic flaws and bugs
the server has been down at one point or another nearly every single day since it opened and that is nothinga multitude of people have had everything they owned deleted out of the blue most people have had some significant items deleted at one time or another
it is very hard to move to any new area of town without someone mentioning out loud that they just signed in and suchandsuch is now gonecreatures magically disappear when you fight them usually just before they die so you get no credit for fighting them
they also teleport in clear view on top of you because the servers are apparently vicsthere were a plethora of exploits known in the beta that they chose to ignore and let the people paying to support the game which is still much less reliable than eves beta was or ees beta for that matter which actually was buggy use to advance to endgame levels that now have been made unapproachable for months to most
they embraced the exploit early exploit often principle mostly because a number of them play the game onlineand also post on the website trashing anyone who has a problem with anything they do under their player names which doesnt denote that they are monetarily connected the game to anyone who hasnt happened to get to know them ingame and delete totally legitimate posts i have never had one deleted but many of the ones that get deleted are just being deleted to promote a fraudulent image of the state of the game which is terribleworst of all there are untold numbers of bugs that were known in the beta that made the game completely unplayable but they chose to ignore so that they could release the game and force the fans of star wars to pay to support it for them please keep in mind i play most mmorpgs this is so far out of the realm of the minute amount other games have done that it makes shaqfu look like viable productthere was  days playing time promised on the box
out of the  days there was a grand total of  that i was able to play without having a fatal error on their end make it unplayable
having their faulty code damage stats as if armor was on  or  times over when no armor was on making some stats negative p and insuring anything that touched you would kill you in  hit until the next day or longer sometimes when they would finally shake it off your character
crashing for no reason and killing your character in the process world comes back up an hour or day or  later and your character has huge wounds that force you to sit around in a hospitol for up to an hourwheeeee
deleting all your equipment and your money so you run around with starter gear trying to get money is real fun then
having havesters dissapear with a weeks worth of gathering in them
having entire suits of top grade armor regularly disappear when they are bought
all these things and thousands more were known before release and are acceptable to them call their reps online and ask about the  days the box promises they openely say could care less about any promises made and they will make no attempt to make ammends for charging you to play while their servers are completely unavailable
they released it anyway to make star wars fans figuring they are loyal and could thus be exploited pay for what is supposed to be prerelease troubleshooting and quality controlit is a shame and i am frankly stunned that sony would allow this travesty to be enacted under their name trueibnfreyplease save yourselves the frustration lost time and effort
eve online runs fantastically and is so well taken care of that it may well be the next longterm mmorpg to make it truly huge ac has finally begun to listen to the gaming community and has been quietly building up a hardearned fan base a couple my buds play blizzard always comes through and there are other mmorpgs on the horizon i cant wait for city of heroes 
edit for the fanboys trying to blame the systems of people who are playing this game and honestly trying to warn other people from getting robbed here are my specs hyperthreaded  g ram gb hard drive with nothing but  games on it geforce fx  this game does not workon any system
every person who has any experience with mmorpgs knows the truth that is the most poorly supported and designed game ever released it is a total disgrace eve and ac get back to you within small hours often within  average time on tickets is about  days long time to go without playing and still being expected to pay for it and that is on tickets they dont accidentally delete which has been right about half of them in my experience which means queing up another  days wait of not playingthere was a hint of brillence in the first ape escape that you could really admire
the game tested you in many catagories and in the end you were a better gamer than before
but that was five years ago and it seems that gamming standards have fallen greatlyi think the biggest creative mistake the developers made was waiting so long to create a true sequal to the debute title
i mean think about it
the first game was made almost  years ago now meaning the audience it was aimed for at the time is older now
if they had raised the e rating to t it would have given the game a lot more potential for a more exciting and creative plot
its safe to say that the original fans of ape escape were pretty shocked when they played this game
you can really tell which of the reviewers on the cite played the first game and which ones didnt
this game pretty much alienates its former fans with childlish dialog and way too easy gameplayas for the characters you cant really be satified with any of them
with stereotypes of your everday afterschool anime shows this game really disapoints you
and no matter what some reviewers say this quotjimmyquot is ash from pokemon
whoever said it wasnt is beeing mistaken by the replacement voice over that the pokemon series used in later seasons
but that aside its really annoying and i liked the original characters moreeven with all the flaws that this game so readily displays there is one fact that you cannot ignore
the graphics have without a doubt gotten much better
but obviously that wasnt enough to cancel out the rest of this games problemseven tho stories dont really matter in games like this this story pretty much annoys you to the core
sure it was sorta cute at first to see specter in the opening scene but if it werent for that the story would be flat out lamewell as you can tell from my point of view this game wash incredibly dissapointing
i dont think ill ever think about ape escape the same again
it went from the coolest game ever to the coolest game ever with the stupidest sequal
its just amazing how many flaws this game had campared to how awesome the first game was
after you beat the first game you truly feel like youve accomplished something by beating such a difficult game
but when you beat the sequal you feel as if youve finally completed some tedious neverending choreyes many things went terribly wrong in the creation of this sequal but you can never destroy the classics and that is a relief
but if you wont take my word and the word of all the other original fans play this game and wittness the horror yourselfi only got this game becasse it was so cheap
i was munibulated by its cheapness
dont get this game if you are like mejust why videogame designers love amnesiac main characters i have no idea
maybe they can never dream up more creative ways of generating suspense and mystery other than the ol who am i
xiiis main character is so devoid of colour so boringly voiced and humourless that even if the game itself were fun the very fact that you have to play as an utter nerd for a main character just cripples the experiencebut this game isnt fun either
half of this game is an example of just how horribly wrong a stealth game can be when the elements arent rightas a shooter this game fares somewhat better but not much more
enemies strafe even faster than you and reloading takes forever and their shots are so accurate that taking cover doesnt really help
this game is also extremely stingy about giving you ammo an average enemy drops maybe two shotgun shells and  bullets
frustrating but at least theres action
the stealth part on the other hand is plain garbage for a couple of reasons who came up with the idea of helmets
i cant remember another single stealth game where a headshot doesnt kill an enemy
in fact the very concept of stealth games is impossible without headshot kills  unless you have alternate methods of distracting or killing the enemy metal gear solids chokeneckbreak and noise distractions for example i dont know where main character number xiii learned how to shoot because even unhelmeted enemies seldom die with a headshot
ive tested this by activating an invincibility cheat code walking straight up to an enemy and blasting him in the face
nope still alive and kicking no radar
the sixth sense in this game which is supposed to replace this basic function is useless because it tells you where enemies are by means of the tap tap of approaching footsteps
which means you wont be able to spot an enemy whos a foot to your right just offscreen when special events occur they use a windowinwindow technique which is interesting visually a comicbook device but unhelpful to the player
you dont know where these events take place in relation to your current location
and sometimes you hear an important conversation thats somewhere in your vicinity but the game doesnt tell you where its coming fromgive me no one lives forever anyday if firstperson stealthaction shooters are your thing
cate archer can kick number xiiis butt any day and say more interesting things along the way
i bought xiii from the bargain bin and wish id gotten myself a nice dinner instead
worth maybe five dollars no more and even then id sell it the minute i finish iti used atom man as an example because if you have no idea who this guy is you realize he added nothing to the comic book world
the game xiii adds nothing to the video game world
the concept of comic book style with a video game is interesting though not a first
im sure im not the only one that wonders to myselfquothey i bought an xbox to play ultra realistic high graphic powered games
whats up with cell shadesquot  well my friend i have the answer david duchovny
they needed to pay this quothigh talentquot actor so much money to make this game that they ran out of funds to produce a graphic masterpiece
and let us also ponder how much talking does good ole dave actually do
it makes you wonder how much they paid eve or mary j blige or missy elliot or whoever plays the girl who is no jennifer lopez when it comes to acting
thats not a compliment to either
anyway the concept of cell shading was different but not great and yes i know that it fits with the comic book style
the story was terrible and i found myself just wanting to get to the end just to bring it back to the video store
im done with this one
rent it if you can short games  dollars each
now  games would have been fine
 games is a joke
the creators are obviously trying to mooch all the money they can
the first game got repetitive
they have taken it to a whole new levelyou still do the exact same things
if you find a great sword you cant use it but you can give it to the person who wants it
if you get to the bottom theres a boss and a cutscene
later you go into another dungeon that looks exactly the same as the last onethe game fails to prove its own worth
now if they only made  long games as i have said that would have been fine
get a new engine guys or a new concept
it doesnt work  times in a rownot with a bang but with a whimper
thats exactly how i felt after finishing this final chapter of hack
a series that began full of promise has done little except disappoint meyou all know about the series so ill forego the plot summary
a lot of people have played apologist for this series answering the valid complaint of why are all the games the same
with a variety of sophistries but the fact is this game has little invention in iti was disappointed in part two because of the ridiculous length of the game it took me about nine hours
part three answered this problem and also had some nice bonuses such as searching for ghosts of the series characters and finding items for trading and i was eagerly anticipating part fourso whats the problem here
not length this game may be the longest of the bunch although it still only clocked in at about  hours i like a little more meat on my rpgs
the gameplay is the same but hey thats what weve come to expect
no the problem here is story in that this game has little
most of the questions you might have asked most of the theories you might have postulated concerning the world wont be answered here
the end of the game which though i thought about it i will not spoil here is quite unsatisfactory  hohum is the best word i can use to describe it and in the end this whole series which if you purchased new will run you around two hundred bucks left me feeling like i was cheated out of one hundred and fifty dollars
yeah i confess there is enough material here for one game maybe one and a half but bandai has cheated us out of a lot of money in my honest opinion
still i can look forward to xenosaga this is the exact same game as the other games
theres a few new items but nothing to celebrate
sure its a conclusion but you just spent  bucks on  games that are all  hoursmaximum long
way to gowell i was so excited when i heard that buffy was getting yet another chance to kick some demon butt in the famous sunnydale lot and to my surprise faith my favorite slayer of all time was to be in it
so i of course got the game like the first day it was out and i played it and well here are the procons to the game and trust me there is more cons then pros right nowcons
the camera is horrible
very jerky and dizzy at times
it doesnt go around  like the other one
the controls are tricky
in the first game you could use the whole joy stick in this one its very strick in that its up or down and side to side no slightly up to the left side nope you just go straight up
so that is highly annoying because you get cornered very fast and cant use the camera to use it to swing around fast enough as well well i do miss the inventory screen very much
i mean i learned how to use the quick screen in the first game but i think it was wrong to take it out
trust me once i beat the game im writing a long long list of problems this had compared to the first one
to many buttons for combos and highly frustrating
they really dont give you a chance to figure out moves and spells in my opinion
they talk to you while fighting how to do it and that is annoying
saves
who ever the freaking genuies was to not have hardly any in the game needs to be in my eyes shot and never allowed to play again
i was playing faith and the game got stuck at the end guy so guess what i had to start all over again
ugh
plus the boss who you face at the end of this takes far to long to beat
i mean he should be an end guy its so stupid
there are engery balls you have to blast three of them i sat there counting that i hit one of them  times and it still wasnt down and this is only one
that is way to much time to spend in my opinionthe list can go on and on and on and on the only good part is that you get some multiplayer action going on and well um the other games as well seem very cool
but other wise this isnt any where near the league that it was before and if i could demand my money back i would give it up it back
even if faith is in iti am a huge buffy fan from back when the tv show first started
i own all the box sets that are released and i own the first btvs game for xbox
i bought this game yesterday at gamespot for  without tax
my husband played it for  minutes we looked at each other and agreed this game blows
it is nothing like the first btvs game on xbox
the graphics are like a ps game most of the time your characters look like they are floating in thin air
the voice acting of the characters is way off including the cast that is actually in the tv series
they seem like their hearts are not in it
plus there is no alyson to voice willow
some girl voice actor they hired is doing our favorite witchexcept she is majorly annoying her voice is nothing like season  willow and she really doesnt know how to act at allall in all this game is a real huge disappointment
do yourself a favor dont run out and blow your money buying it like i did
rent it and see if you like itthen if you do fork over the dough
i promise you if you are a fan of the first xbox buffy game you will want to kill the people who made chaos bleeds for ruining a great gamei hate that it wasnt good
i hate that it did not meet my expectationshated it so much i took it back today traded it in for  dollars way under what i paid and bought star wars knights of the old republic insteadthe only thing i liked about this game was that you could beat up little kids which is fun admit it
i was dissapointed being a huge fan of the showi read some where that this is the simpsons version of grand theftouto
yeah right
this horrible game is nothing like grand theftouto
first off you dont get to kill anyone
all you can do is kick them and they just roll on the ground
the police thing is horrible to
in grand theftouto you get a chance to fight the police and even get there guns but in this if the just come close to you they take your money and the game keeps going
oh and instead of throwing people out of the car and taking the car like in grand theftouto you friendly ask the person for a ride and they drive you were you want to go
the missions can not be compared at all with grand theftouto
in grand theftouto your missions are to kill somone but in this one of your missions is to give lisa her homework before the princable gets to school
if you love grand theftouto and is thinking of getting this it is nothing like grand theftoutoinfact i would not recamend this game to anyonea friend lent me his copy of this game  acof to evaluate on my machine just to save me from the possibility of paying full price for a game that wont work well on my machine
i had by then become a devotee of the next newer version  fs
while acof obviously surpasses fs on a framebyframe basis comparitive framerate more than evened things out for the older game
i knew that the minimum system requirements were conservative but nothing prepared me for how conservative they were
despite only quotrequiringquot a mhzclass cpu  mb of ram acof ran like a slideshow on my  ghz pentium  w  mb of ram with geforce graphics acceleration  and that was with options sliders set to  or near it
apparently software manufacturers like ms believe that theyre past the days of having to set the minimum sysreq at half the optimum  now we have to multiply by five to get an honest idea of whats really needed
though a better graphics accelerator and more ram would improve things personally im happy enough with fs and that program looks to have a more permanent place on my pcthe program gets lost in the tutorials and cant correct itself
if you cant do exactly what the program says to do when the program says to do it the only way out is to crash the plane and restart the flight
thus one is unable to make any progressit looked so great toojak ii is suposed to be cool but it isnt
its a babyish game that was supposed to be cool
i have no idea why its reated t it should be e or lower
it is almost the exact same thing as jak and daxter
dont buy it even if you liked jak and daxterjak  is one of the worst games ive played in years
with unfair levels difficult situations like ie
you agaist and amry with one gun with only  bulletsand frustrating mini games  like keep up with the old lady you have  second per symbol
i spend more time yelling than enjoying the game
i sugest if your a fan of theof jak  dont getthis game
jak acts more like a criminal than a hero
all i can say is that this game is not worth the money
dont get jak jak  has got to be the worst game i have ever played it has horrible gameplay storyline graphics and it just is crappy
i hope you dont waster your money on itthe games not hard
the developers just disabled the right thumb stick which makes it a fustrating game but not hard at all
and its not the first time ive ever played a game where the developers disabled the right thumb stick ninja gaiden black metro prime thereby not allowing me to control the camera so that i could adequately play the game
the other platform game sly cooper allowed me to move the right thumb stick up and down so that i can effectively make jumps
jak  however doesnt allow me to move the camera up and down and this resulted in me making a lot of blind jumps which sent me back to the beginning of every mission
the game also could have benifited from having a camara system that didnt get stuck a lot and follows the movements of jak faster weapons with lock on features and the ability for the player to strafe around an enemy like in the zelda series
the fights in the zelda series were balanced enough in a fair but challenging way that made fighting all the monsters in that game fun
in jak  however it was more of a chore to move through the game and not all that much funok now let me put the brakes on the bitching for a moment
jak  is not a terrible game
there are some fun and funny moments to be had in the game
the open world enviorments are great the music is cool the pretty much nonexistant load times are fantastic character graphics are good the story is decent and amist the many chaotic scenes in the game that involves you fighting in various places and moving through the city theres no slow down
and most importantly since i only paid  for this game i dont really have too many complaints
so the game does have a lot of good points about iteven though i beat both jak    hooray for me and everyone else in the world that did beat them
i have jak  and im going to play that one soon my only wish was that the developers had allowed me the abiliity to move the right thumb stick up and down
games are supposed to be first and foremost fun
they can be challenging annoying difficult and enemies can be redicilously powerful or whatever
i really dont mind being taken down by an enemy or a boss in a game
however i feel that i should have a fair chance of fighting against any enemy in any game
disabeling the camera stick in any way that makes it annoying for me to see what im supposed to be fighting in the game is not fair and this is what makes jak  waayyyy more fustrating to play than funso in order for me to lift my review past  star and recomending any jak  daxter game to anyone if any of the creators of the game is reading this review i want to see you play all of the missions in jak  without dying once on any one of them
 since i died on them all and had to replay them all you have to survive them all without replaying them
show me how its expertly and professionally supposed to be done
if i see you do this then i will lift my review to  stars buy all the other jak  daxter games youll have my utmost respect as competent game programers and designers my sincere and deepest apology for bashing your game a bit and ill buy you all a cookiejak and dexter was a darn good platform game
it was encompassing awe inspiring it had varied levels it was pretty nonlinear the levels were lengthy yet doable
it was basically a fun all around game
so jak  comes out and they made a lot of changes all for the worsefirst off i guess the marketing folks told the developers to emulate grand theft auto   let me tell you this does not work
gta had a livingbreathing city that fit into the environment
what does jak  have
it was a nondescript closed off city with hardly anything in it
the worst is the movement throughout the city
to go to a different a different part of the city you need take this horrible hover vehicle that apparently cant hover beyond up or down
the movements of this vehicle are sluggish slow and uncontrollable and the vehicle itself doesnt possess any subtlety
couple this with the fact that all the missions are clear cross the city and the alleyways are small and youve got one boring annoying game
i passed maybe  levels and most of my time was spent hovering between those levelssecondly in gta fashion they decided to make it gritty
oh geez give me a break
who was begging for a cartoon platformer to be gritty
why does jak need to cuss
i dont mind it but it serves no other purpose other than to alienate a chunk of potential gamers
the gritty factor might have been an excuse as to why they could not reproduce the lush varied environments that really made the first game
every level i played looked the same either an indoor level or an outdoor levelokay so the environment and movement is no good what about the missions you say
well these missions are tedious missions and designed to be repeated over and over again
some of the missions are easy but you basically go through the same jumps and enemies over and over again
many are difficult made so that you have to die a few times repeat what you just accomplished just to die a little bit later
while not hard but if the missions were any fun it wouldnt be so badfinally the first game required you to reach a certain number of spheres for you to pass
whatever way you wanted to get them you could
this meant that if a mission was boring not fun or out of the way you could skip and try something else
this game pretty much is linear
its sort of deevolution of video gaming right hereso in short what was once an original fun lush platform game now spawned a sequel which is no more than a badly designed conglomeration or random gaming ideasprosuhmm i cant think of anyconspretty much linearcity is mundaneenvironments unvaried stalerepetitive tedious levelsadult for no reasonhover system is mind boggling baddifficulty mediumfrustration level highhours to complete my estimate  hoursoh lord do i hate this video game
it completely changes the jak and daxter theme its dark and painful in the beginning i hate baron praxis and there are way too many objectives to do in this game
this sequel does a terrible job living up to its predecessor
why couldnt they have made this a banjotooie kind of sequel villains rising back from the dead wanting revenge on the heroes heroes need to stop them again
that would have been a lot more interestingwell sony has done it again they have made a completely horrific game and i dont mean horrificly good i mean horrificly bad
playstation  is too choppy and the framerate is too slow to run a halfdecent game
they release socom ii and xbox releases rainbow six  and i know what youre gonna say quotrainbow six  is on all  systemsquot well its only actually good on the xbox
no matter what sony tries microsoft will always be two steps in front of themno wonder they keep delaying this piece of crapi loved all the other games so i am disappointed big time
its so bad i didnt even try to finish out the level which is rare
want a rocking game
try quotxiiiquot i loved iti thought i wasted my time writing a review on this crap but apparently not
i played it for about an hour and wanted to get rid of it the same day
syphon filter used to be a sure thing but now its up the creak without a paddle
the controls suck the mission objectives are unclear and the map is hard to read
id swear the developers that made the previous syphon filter editions enjoyable retired and passed on the torch to the makers of no one lives forever
that game is as fun as having your your legs broken twice a year every year for  years straight
id give this game  star if it were possiblewhen this game arrived at my house i put it into the computer and a screen came up that said play options and something else
i did not say install and it was supposed to
i called up echnical support went online nadda nothing
the worst  i ever spent
avoid this problem by avoiding this product
dont let it happen to you
i recommend you get city of heroes instead
now theres a fun gamelike a lot of other deceptions this game is not for windows xp
baldurs gate couldnt be programed by official company or fansiteas with ultima to run on xp
it is not possible
the same could be said for ultima collecton which stated it was for windows  right on the box and doesnt run on that os
please put the correct os for this gamedeception   this game only contains what bg saga contained baldurs gate
it is not an ultimate collection so dont expect bg ii or tob
it is just another name for the same thingand for bux bottom line if you have bg stick with it and play it on your old windows  system that your so fortunate to own dont mess with this
if you dont have bgby now then your too young to appreciate iti just bought this game the reviews here made it sound great
i am a huge never winter nights fan and after playing that game for a very long time i just couldnt get past the graphics
they are awful
i am sorry but if you are used the graphics of todays games then this game isnt for you
i cant tell you if the game itself is fun to play i havent played it
i just couldnt get past the graphics
sorry bad review from mewhat the company did here is paid big bucks to get the movie name and rights to the characters then no follow through
not trusting the company is the reason for a demo
more demos please
recall the game the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring
is was a beta for this game
now they have better rendering on the characters but they forgot to put color on the ground and walls
everything is black
super annoying
one player
how do i get up there
if you hate jumping games youll hate jumping games more that they dont finish making
keyboard  extra long jump leftctrl keydirection keyjump keyyou cant see because they didnt render the ground or the walls in act its black
major design flaw act with invisible barriers  if you push the butter churn to the fence near the hay stacks standing on it to jump over you cant jump back
you can physcially jump higher than the fence but they never thought youd do that and were using an invisible vertical barrier so you couldnt get there in the first place
if you liked the book dont purchase this game or youll even find the book frustratingive been playing rts games since dune  came out this is by far the worst example of an rts ive ever played
it has the most tedious interface of any game any program ive ever used
the entire challenge of this game is trying to control your units when the simplest commands are unavailable
select all units
no you cant you simply cannot do it
amazing
after  hours of playing this i threw it in the garbagethis game has a great effects trailer but when you play theres no fun modes you dont know what to do and the graphics are crap and piece of s worthy a  letdownand in fact i dont think it is for anyone
for those of you who have played games from the saga series saga frontier saga frontier  etc
 and didnt enjoy the experience well you should stay far away from this
however even those of you who did like those games will probably want to steer clear of this as welli understand those of you who want to like this game since you sunk fifty bucks into it
i dont blame you i was right with you
however i feel rather duped
you see i purchased this game at a certain electronics store which shall remain nameless
i received about a hundred emails from squareenix hyping this game and indeed the art of the game box did not suggest static gameplay and water colors
furthermore the store would not allow me to look at the instruction book which is a better indicator of what the game will be like
in the end a game which was hyped like ff and made to look like ff turns out to play like a very difficult version of monopoly
in all honesty this game stinks
and the music
well if i wanted beautiful classical music i could purchase mozart at about a fifth of the price
shame on you squarebut dont blame this on enix
yeah grandia x wasnt so good but grandia was ok and dragon warrior is still spectaculardont bother to know what it is
i bought it at around 
worst than the final fantasys series
worst than the dark cloud series
worst than the star oceans series
quotsomethingquot that should have never seen the light
not even worth  star but is required to put at least the developer of this game must wake up on the wrong side of his bed
i had no fun playing this game but frustration
it is uninspired and not motivating at all
once i start playing this game i turn off the system after about five minutes
i just cannot stand itunlimited saga is a terrible rpg in almost every way
the graphics are horrid both in the cutscenes and in the game
the music is subpar and cliche
the game system is completely unintuitive both on the world map and in combat scenes
the voice acting is disgustingly bad
the city menu is limited and almost useless
if you are a fan of rpgs you may get a few scraps of fleeting amusement out of this game otherwise you are in trouble
avoid this game at all costssquare dropped the ball with this title
a waste of time on so many many levels
an uninspired journey into boredomthe combat system is not bad
interesting
different yes
if the gameplay were even remotely interesting the combat system would push this into the highest echelon of rpgsthing is the gameplay is horrible
boring boring boring
theres no animations worth dealing with everything is  dimensional flat cutout images in a pseudo dimensional world
exploration is boring
interaction is boring
everything in fact aside from the battle system is boringthe battlecombat system alone isnt enough to save this game
terrible
dont waste your time or your moneyi ordered this game for my collection
the ad was very accurate
the game was shipped quickly  safely
i would purchase from them again
the only negative thing i have to say is about the game itself
square enix who up till now i held in high esteem for their rpg games
i am afraid they published a stinker of a gamei bought this game a while ago when it was at list price played it after playing several other rpgs and was stunned but not in a good way
i gave up after about  hours of play and decided i wasnt getting it
i tried again a month later and lasted  hours still thought that there might be something that i didnt understand
my last try was about  hours and i can state unequivocally that there is nothing to get
this is not a good game not even a mediocre one for that matterperhaps the single most glaring flaw is the nonexistent animation
outside of some cut scenes and soso battle action this is in what square enix calls quotsketch motionquot which means  no motion at all
so help me one characters sketch appears with a balloon of text then another then  throw in a barebones mapping facility that does the travel and you have the entire art effort
this isnt a game its a prototype for onethe battle system is almost as bad
you have to set up all your characters moves ahead of time one painstaking button press at a time
then when the action actually starts you have to hit a button while a battle wheel spins
most of your opponents actually die of boredomthe story line is doled out in bitesized bits but what ive seen is pretty run of the mill
playing unlimited saga is actually painful as you follow a set of meaningless actions using a game structure that was out of style in   the best i can say about is that square enix must have cancelled the game before the animation and has published it to try to recoup their investmentunless you collect total failures pass this one bybought this game very cheap as it is from a publisher i normally love and trusthailed as being an extreme rpg i thought a little challenge could be fun just got done played a series of fun but easy games
plus it was cheapthis rpg game is only extreme in how bad it is  the difficulty in this game comes from a completely random roulette wheel battle style and the fact that every challenge in the game require level  skills to overcome when youre at level   seriously you will encounter a barrel a door or a treasure chest and not be able to do anything right at the beginning of the game
you later find out it takes a level  skill to break or open anythingso you walk around what is basically a board game playing field moving a stationary character drawing one space at a time while random pictures flash in the background
occasionally you get in a random battle which is where the roulette attack wheel comes in
all your skills are put on a fast spinning wheel and what you land on is what you door you encounter a trap
if this happens you use the same wheel to try and avoid it which it early levels is something like a  oddsthe battles present another huge problem
you have your standard hp and you have lp
lp is your life points and if a character is attacked while in ko after hp reaches  typically you lose an lp and when lp is gone youre dead for real
you get shocking little lp like  or  at most which wouldnt be too much of a problem except tiny monsters in random battles do lp damage while you still have full hp
so at full hp a  hit kill monster can hit you for an unavoidable  lp possibly killing a character
this makes hp completely uselessi never found an item that could cure lp eitherthere are multiple characters you can play with different storylines
a good feature but the stories played out through a very few still pictureword sequences were bland and confused and none of them sparked my interest enough to possibly warrent played through such an unfun wreck of a gamenot even worth the incredibly cheap price and shipping
stay awayif you want an extreme or challenging rpg with great story great gameplay try the shin megami tensei nocturne or digital devil saga seriesuh i cant believe the ever popular squaresoft the makers of the world loved final fantasy series made a huge dud
im probably one of the most diehard rpg fans out there but unlimited saga
this game is a disgrace
i ordered it off amazon and thankfully it did not ship properly
so i played it at my friends housei would first like to point out the graphics
the anime style animation is a good idea but not here
as soon as you start up the game you will have a hard time looking at it
the graphics are all cartoonmoving around is another problem
you dont move
you point in what direction you want to go and the screen changes
to me that is a whole chunk of rpg that is gone
and to move around in towns you press x on the house you want to enter and your therethe battles
oh geez the battles
interesting yet boring
you can choose up to  attacks to use on one turn using all your characters
you can also pick a small number of abilities
then you are done and this spinning reel thing shows up
you stop it and attack either kicking punching or throwingthats about it
oh and the enemy attacksnext is sound
thsi category isnt that bad
the sounds and music are wonderful
the music being very original and colorful
the voice acting is very poorly done however
there might be  characters on the screen and suddenly a voice pops up
you cant really tell who it is mostly because its a cartoon and their lips dont moveim always bummed to see very bad rpgs
they are a waste of money and you dont really have fun with them
unlimited saga could have been great
spice up the graphics add a new battle system and hire the ffx voice people and this game is golden
sorry square but youve built a boat with no paddletake my word for it and dont buy this game
its not like square to make a rpg like this
im just hoping square will split up with enix so they make something worth buying
dont buy this its not worth the  but if you happen to buy it the only thing worth seeing is the preview for ffxi love final fantasy
i really do
the world is square baby
ffi referencei wasted a perfectly good giftcard on this puddle of cow vomit because of the fact i saw square on the cover
i envision at squareenix headquarters there is a little room in the basement where the company meets its hire the handicapped quota
they spake unto them and said hark
i speaketh to thee and bade theemaketh an rpg
and the retards made an rpg and square saw that it was crapand that it was bad
then square spoke and said oh ye of little mental aptitudei thanketh thee for thine effortshowever now i must smother thou with a pillow
and square smothered the handicapped with a pillowbut not until a few escaped into the battle mechanics room of the final fantasy seriesthe graphics are vile the characters twodimensional and the combat is something right out of one of those little aa games in the plastic armor hanging on a pegboard shelf in kmart
a rusty tin man whos had his joints welded together and eyes riveted shut could move with more fluidity than the sprites in this piece of crap
also the game leaves you with a realization of what a storyline is since youre so busy looking and waiting for one to develop within this gamei viewed this game as a metophorical giant loog wad of yakspit right in my suckhole
seriouslysquarefor shame
this game is the equivalent of my ps powering on and then nippletwisting me until i bleed and finishing up with a swift kick to the crotchi hate this game more than i hate getting an eyelash stuck in my eyeballmore than when you sit down on a dark leather or vinyl seat in the summer and the nuclear heat sears the skin on the small of your back and back of your kneesi hate this game more than when you go on a water ride at a theme park and your underwear chafe your taint the area between the crotch and buttseriously i had a colonoscopy about four years ago and i had to drink this oily lemonlime stuff that made me squirt clear liquid and wasnt allowed to eat anything for  hours so that it felt like my stomach was eating itself and i wanted to die
wellthis game wasnt quite that bad but at least with the colonoscopy i knew it was going to be a horrible experience
this is a video game
dance all happy and free while you put it in the system thinking another awesome rpg from squaresoft
and then suddenly youre doing the video game equivalent of gagging down a gallon of quaker state with lime and squirting clear liquid from your oringyou think im kidding
do you know where this game disk of mine is right now
a landfill
landfill
know why
because i threw it away
i was moving and consolidating some boxes and there it was on the bottom of a boxstaring at me
i looked aroundthought about itand tossed that piece of twicetossed monkey dung right in the freaking trash
did i want the  credit from the gamestore
nope
i refused to subject any other human being decent or indecent to the vile putridity of this shiny circular turd
i feel guilty that i didnt snap the disk in half first for fear some homeless kid living outside the dump and stealing electricity from a storage sheds power outlet might find this game and try itif you love rpgs especially final fantasy avoid this festering wart on the arsecheek of the sony playstation this game is a very rushed feel to it the game seems incomplete and has many good ideas but many things are done in this game with little or no good reason
the map is set up in the format of a board game you must explore
in doing so you can lose the game simply because the board decides to take and scatter your characters dividing them and making it hard to complete simple tasks like killing enemies
your weapons and gear take damage in this game and over time break
broken gear is worthless you also have hps and life points and if you take to much damage to your life points from taking to much damage from your hps you end up with game over
this game lacked a lot of polish
and i honestly have to say its darn close to unplayable
i would also have to say its one of the worse games ever made by squre enix and considering i own most of there games thats saying a lotthere is no defense in the game and you dont really feel like your skill can do anything to help on defense
you cant control dbs well so its better to just let the computer do it and they can be picked a part by any human with a little experience with maddenoffense is all about who has the fastest players and getting it to them which is easy because every qb in the game has the ability to make throws that shouldnt be possibethis game will stink like the rest of emmadden makes the worst football games everif you want a fast paced football game go for the k seriesif you want the best graphics get nfl fever  instead of thiswhy do people like the boring games that ea sports dishes outi know this is xbox rather than xbox  gamebut i still bought it because i thought it is a great game so microsoft would offer the update version so i can play in my xbox  you know that right
lots of games can be player in  even if they are just xboxi was wrongsomething bad happened during playtesting for this title
to be precise it seems like nobody was playtesting it
a rd person camera flicks maddeningly from one bad location to another constantly leaving your enemies offcamera making dodging and aiming not to mention crate jumping puzzles
 a complete and utter joke
no surprise the original dino crisis development team had nothing to do with this visually beautiful yet disastrous title yes the spaceship is beautifulto say the gameplay is bad would be doing a disservice it just doesnt worka big wt
for capcom on this unfinished bowwowman if you buy this wack game something is wrong with you mentally
i want to write capcom a hate letter for this game
i dont know what they were thinking makin this crapthis game is a disgrace to the mega man name
its horrible plain and simple
ugly too hard stupid idea overall
forget this and get x for ps
much betterthis game makes you think it will be good over the first few minutes of cool cut scenes and cool action
then you move inside the game  for the rest of the game it seems
then the game loses all coolness
somewhere around the fifth room you realize you have to do the exact same thing in every roombottom line  is it fun
if you like bad action and the same thing over and over again
will you keep it
no way
is it for kids
you blow up robots againa and again and again and again and again and  you get the idea
if that is bad for kids well there you goi heard good reviews about this game and decided to buy it
at first i thought it was pretty fun but after the third boss or so i became tired of it
i dont know what it was that finally made me realized that this game sucks but it did it well
here is what i think it might have beenthe fighting became tritespecial effects werent goodstory line clichedvoices horrendously inanegraphics nice but the comicbook drawings were kind of dumbmethinks that what i hate about the game is excatly what people love about it
i lost the game so i didnt try finishing it which doesnt really bother me
i suggest renting the game before buying
that will save you moneyor it would have for me anywayrunaway is a starforce game
those of you not familiar with starforce should read the prince of persia the two thrones pc game user reviews here at amazoni own and installed runaway
its an amicable enough point and click adventure game
there are certainly worsehowever most games dont runaway with your computerafter i installed runaway and unfortunately for me two other starforce laden adventure games i began to suffer the varied problems that starforce is reported to causei had to replace my hard drive on a computer new enough to be under warrantystarforce authors and the developers that use it claim it to be a safe effective means of copy protection
they have also claimed that starforce detractors are angry gamers that cant copy their gamesive never used pirated software nor have i ever engaged in commiting the crime
yet because i like to play pc games i have to suffer the consequences of pirating  without beinginformedstarforce installs hidden drivers on your computer that cannot be removed easilyif at all
the company has provided a removal tool for these hidden drivers but many posts have filtered in that either pieces or even all the software refuses to leave after its usetrisynergy did not ask me if they could install hidden drivers on my hard drive that are very difficult and stubborn to removethat interfere with my own computers driverswhile i can not prove that starforce games caused the damage to my computer i have no evidence that it did not
the excuses and procalamations i recieved from another starforce using company included and blamed my hardware configurationafter i informed them i had a  toshiba desktop replacement notebook with a p at ghz and  gb ram
it would be hard for even me to wreck the hardware configuration of my notebookthe choice is yours to makemjhwhy did i let myself spend  on this game
argh
ive been playing for  weeks now and there is downtime aplenty bugs no maps and item disappearance galore
they even have an item replacement policy on the homepage it happens so much
i am so completely disgusted with this game
star wars galaxies had problems but there was something to do
there are acres of noncontent and server lag will have your characters and mobs rubberbanding all over and i have a fast cable modem
further when trying to engage mobs you have to chase the thing for  feet before you finally attack usually in the middle of a camp
you never have any idea where you are there are no maps no locate quotlocquot coordinate system no quotwherequot to find npcs i hate this game
gimme my money backi downloaded the seven day free trial for this game and it made me put in my credit number
thats the most idiotic thing ever and the very first time that i saw a free downloadable trial of a game that made you put in your credit card
they probably make you put it in so they wont tell you when your seven day trial is over but instead charge you after its over without notice
im giving it one star just for this reason it shows that the company is greedy and like to give a lot of bsplayed early beta was fun
then they opened it up too many people
too much lag
this game still  sucks save your money for world of warcraftok im one of these guys who is basing his review on the demothe demo i played is no way to get people to buy a game
my characters were killed so fast it was pathetic
every time i rested to heal even for  day i would be surrounded by rats thugs or snakes
there was no way to heal my guys because i was taking hits from enemies every time i tried to heal someonealso just about every attack i made was a miss while the enemies nailed me almost every time
even spells were misses on a regular basisthis is definately not recommendedi played heroes on xbox and had way more funill get straight to the point stay away from this gamei have played the icewwind dale series baldurs gate    and the excellent planescape torment several time over
they are all great gameswhen it was announced a pc version of temple of elemental evil i was very excited
i remember the the thrill playing and then dming the pnp version of the game some  years agoand this is what they come up with
crap
bugs
after installing the three official patches the game is still bugridden clicking on a character brings up the inv
of another spells dont work desktop crashing numerous clipping issues which is very rare in d game an interface that seem to do the exact opposite of what you want it to do
etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc
tedious
the d  d  rules does not translate into a computer game
at all
it is that simple
in the baldurs gate series the game play was fast intuitive
exciting
in toee its a big yawnthe homlet quest are with two exceptions dumb boring and errand boyish tell x to bring me a turnip get a hammer for the blacksmith tell x that y really likes her play cards with some bum at the inn
you get the ideacombatwise it is none the better i spent som  minutes chooping up  frogs just to get inside the moathousehad the  minutes been exciting i wouldnt mind but its just a series of going through motions linear clicking on options on each characters unwieldy radial menuaccurate representation of combat
maybefun which in the end is why we all play computer games
if your idea of fun is sticking needles in your eyes this game is a blast
visuals  audiothe voice acting is in the top  worst games ever
a good example is the character elmo whom you meet at the begining
after the encounter i was left wondering if this was a joke on the gamers by the makers of this gamethe visuals are an anachronism
great in  maybe
today you get better visuals on highend mobile phones
the bugs incredibly crummy gameplay dd  rules bad visuals and audio coupled with a thoroughly uninspired story makes this a game you should steer clear ofadvice if you havent played the baldurs gate or icewind dale serie yet get thoseif you have play them againanything but toee even if it is in the bargain bin for  buckswhat a frustration
there must be a patch out there i cant find
this game suffers from such slow game play it is a wonder it was ever released
did any of the developers actually bother to play there finished product
maybe so but it was too late to do anything about it by then
you will spend  of your time waiting in combat for your turn
good luck with ithail flaviusbought this game and returned it the next day
what kind of game doesnt start after you install it
i have a new system and have never had this problem with any other game
save yourself some grief and buy something elsei played pnp dampd for years
if i wanted an exact copy of it on pc id still be ticked off about wasting  on this pice of garbage
i wanted a bit more quotpc gamequot out of this pc game
this game delivers when it comes to its adherence to the  rule set and formulae but as a video game it is a piece of junk
dampd fans would be better served by investing in the latest books and playing the traditional waythe graphics are godawful
the background environment in the entire game is d
this game may have been on par in  with the then current level of graphic complexity but it came out at the end of  when neverwinter nights had already been on the market for some time
nwn graphics were and are far superior
in fact baldurs gate ii graphics arewere far superior
i dare say i believe bg one had better graphicsbuggy
this game put a whole new meaning to the term quotbuggyquot
it crashes
and it crashes
and it crashes some more
despite the garbage gui it still slows to a grinding halt even on my uptodate pc
even with the patch i have yet to be able to complete this gamesupport
you wont get any from the producers of this crapfest
in the words of the head honcho quoti like to put the completed games behind me and move on to the next projectquot  ive been keeping track
a second patch which is supposed to fix the problems the first patch either missed or created anew has been promised for over a year
release dates are promised then the developers just disappear for a time
no i dont ever suspect ill ever be ableto finish this gamelinear
probably the most linear rpg created in the past  years
you get no opportunity to explore the worldmainly because it doesnt exist
despite the games strict adherance to the dampd  rules it doesnt even give you remotely the same experience as toee gave when played on pnp
the side quests are a joke
they are the worst example of fedex i can think of
quotgo tell him i said ok  ill wait herequot  quothe said okquot quottell him i said i like ok ill wait herequot  quothe said he likes okquot  quotgood
tell him to come here
ill wait herequot  etc etc etc
this is just an example of the hours upon hours of useless quotmissionsquot youll perform
and you have to perform them as they unlock certain key mission areas
so in a sense they arent side quests at all
you are stuck doing them in the exact fashion and orderlinear
no you cannot wander off into the woods to exploreif you like dampdbuy the  rule books and go play the old fashion way
youll have a much better time
if you want a dampd based game for your pc go get neverwinter nights and both expansions
besides theres thousands of mods out there to keep it interesting for years
nwn has the potential to stay around for as long as elder scrolls hasive read many of the reviews of this game and notice that everyone keeps saying its buggy
well i wouldnt know about that as i cant get through the tutorial without getting a massive headache
why you ask
the font is too small
i do not know why but this seems to be a problem that not many reviewers have picked up oneven in  x  mode on a  inch monitor you have to sit about one foot away from the screen to read the text clearly
this does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience
unfortunately there seems to be a trend toward using barely ledgible font in many new pc gamesi must defer any other commentary about the games bugginess to the other reviewers
i salute them for being able to play it even for a little while
nevertheless i think that a word of warning should go out to any gamers who dont like the idea of ducttaping their heads to the monitorbefore the game even installs it gives this error something about mathdll
i have tried everywhere and everything to try to get it to work
from copying the cds to my hd then installing to installing the install fix to even install it in the first place
nothing workssomehow i was able to play this game to the end
the game had a habit of freezing up on me
it was pretty cool but the story was weak however theres a twist at the end which leaves possibility for a sequel
after a while i felt like i was just going through the motions of going from one level to the next
its good to play only once if the bugs dont get you firstcrap game doesnt work on xp vista or windows seven  it wont even allow you to download the game just gives a error message about the memory
apparently this is an ongoing issue which has no support to fix it because the company went belly upif youre looking for something mtg flavored you should quite frankly look somewhere else
this is a poorlyexecuted attempt at changing a deep strategy game into a fastpaced game of counters and tactics
it fails
miserably sotactics in this game roughly amount to whether you send your mtgequivalent of rock scissors or paper against your opponents selection
theres no more depth to it than that
to make things even more frustrating the game requires you mash buttons as quickly and almost indiscriminately as possible in order to match up with the computers spellcaster
thus your choice of rock or scissors is largely decided by luck rather than any true strategy
and once you figure out what an opposing spellcasters bag of tricks contains theres nothing more to beating him than always countering his attack and attacking his weakness for every opponent you face is a one trick ponynothing to see here folks move alongworst joystick i have owned
constantly loses calibration pia to re calibrate the logitech software is a pos
the button assignments will work for a few days then stop
ended up taking this joystick and throwing it in the trashi have bought this so i could play hawx game and its just not cutting it i have a xbox  controller and its better than this random firing of missiles for no reason will be sending it back asapthis game is not worth the money
i finished it in about  hours compared with about  hours for farcryi was actually looking forward to playing terminator  on the ps and had high expectations for it just like i had had with the enter the matrix game earlier this year
and once again just like with enter the matrix i should have known better
everything about this game is bad real bad
the entire game just seems so poorly pieced together that it comes off as a hack job
the graphics are bland with chunky polygons the controls are clunky the missions are boring and repetitive and the game all together is too easy
there are extras to unlock such as cg segments and actual scenes deleted from the film but nothing here is worth laying down hard earned money for whether its purchase or a rental
the mediocre terminator dawn of fate was better than this dud
all in all terminator fans should stay far away from this game which is yet another licensed dudthis is the most boring game i have ever played for game cube
the techniques are extremely difficult for example if you dont hit a certain button at the right time its an automatic screw up
the game looks nice though ill give it that
the game just feels slow and repetitive
im so glad that i rented it and didnt buy it
but this is just my opinion
if you like golf this might be a great game for you
i think i just disliked this game because i think golf is just boringmario golf is an awful gameonly  secret characters booshadow mariopirrahea piranhaand baby bowserthe game was so limited there was barely anything to do besides for golfing
stars characters seems pretty damn stupidthe game was very boring and not one bit funthis was an okay game
not one of the best racing games i played but it was alright
the graphics and scenry was cool though
but i wouldnt buy itthis game was no fun when i flew through it
sure i beat it i patiently went to the end of the game so i have a right to write this review and i still hated the game
i dont mind the story still i dont care graphics are not that great efcets are average i seen better and more of all my pc has trouble running texture of land inside buildings more than  aliens my computer goes dead slow
i dont know how i got through last parts with those yellow things
in games like utk graphics are pretier i never lagg or suffer slow frame rate and i did npot even patch it yeton the other hand later i played xbox version much better so fluid and actionyi cant think much more of things to say beside i hate this game and those  i spend where not worth it
i should have bought far cry or something
i will burn this copy you shouldi have heard quite a bit of hype about halo this and halo that
so i got it
and much like several other reviewers on this board i had graphics difficulty from minute one
my system is pretty good ms xp ghz p  gb ram mb radeon  i run doom  at pretty decent levels as well as call of duty and other fairly new games
so there just isnt any excuse for the ridiculously slow graphic performance i got
i dont know if the problem is the games engineering or what but i am disappointedi was hearing soooooooooo much of this game from my friends its the best blah blah blah blah
so i bought it
first of all my system is an athlon xp  with nvidia fx  mb and mb ram i know it isnt a beast but it can play most games at x with medium gfx
anyway i set this game at what i usually have games set at
and it was studder city
i noticed many other people have had this problem also
so in other words it was very poorly put together
after messing around with the video settings i got it to run decent
then i felt my efforts were wasted after playing the game
it is soooooooo highly overrated
ive played many other better fpss than this
all you really do is wonder aimlessly and blast away everything you see
thats about it
no varity
and the mutiplayer really sucks
this game is like many other microsoft games good gfx and poor gameplay
i believe the only reason it did any good on xbox is because it was the only good game for xbox when it first came out infact xbox still barly has any good games  i would reccomend call of duty or medal of honor if you really want a good gamei loved halo on the xbox
truly the first or second best shooter on any platform
quothalf life on the pc is the other contenderquot
on my multimedia super killer dell wide screen notebook with the new pentium m processor nvidia fx  go video with  mb video ram and  gig of main memory halo performance is abysmali figured the others who said this may have been a bit over the top
they werent
for microsoft to have released this piece of drek is irresponsible in the extreme
it is the full halo game and if you set to the higher resolutions the scenery is gorgeous but but butunfortunately even with virtually all the pretty video features turned off and resolution set down to an abysmal x the massive frame rate and motion update slowing to as bad as less than  frame per second that takes place whenever major scene motion occurs especially in the middle of gunfights and always during in battle reloading
make the game practically unplayable
i completed halo on the xbox in normal and heroic mode
but the pc version in standard mode is going to be a real challenge because the frame rate and sluggish mouse update are so bad
really really badthere were things that could have been done to fix these issues before release but lets face it with halo looming microsoft had to dump it out here now to have any chance of selling it at all
half life works on the pc and has a truly excellent interface
they do use lower resolution figures and scenery but the whole thing works together
halo on the pc is on the other end of that spectrumdo not buy this game it is awful
go out and buy an xbox and get halo for it
xbox halo alone is worth buying an xbox for
the only thing of value in the pc version is the box it comes inbut releasing it so late for the pc makes it an unworthy competitor to todays top fps games like utunreal  americas army operations the upcoming aa special forces and other fps gameshalo multiplayer is also extremely flawed
in blood gulch good banshee pilots will simply start spawn killing and the opposing team wont be able to get a foothold in the battle ctfor worse you have team killers who also ruin the funthe banshee and warthog interface isnt what i expectedif they used the descent engine for the banshee and rallisport challenge for the warthog then itd be one heck of a gameoverall its not worth the money to buy this game since its already  years old
save your money for something up to date and more funthis is a horrible game average graphics bad controlsand unrealistic
ex
when you sniper someone it leaves a white trail on bullet i thought snipering was being covert not on this game
overall a bad st person shooteri can honestly say that i loved halo on the xbox
yes the levels were repetitive but the combat was revolutionary
for those of you that dont know  the xbox joystick has among other buttons  thumbsticks one for each thumb
halo was the first fps for the xbox  so the bungie programmers had to decide what these two joysticks controlled
they chose so well that countless other programmers have copied them and those that didnt  wish they had
one thumbstick controls the motion of your character based upon the direction he is looking
the other joystick controls which direction the character looks
did i mention that the xbox jostick has triggers for both of your index fingers
within  minutes of playing halo on the xbox  i was pretty good
within  hours  i was one lethal trashtalking marine
i have two problems with the pc version
first let me prefix this by stating that i am running halo on a p hyperthreadedmhz fsbmbxp pronvidia geforcefx  ultra mb
suffice it to say that i should be able to play everything expect for doom  at the highest detail level while having processing power to spare
guess what
when playing halo for the pc and there are more than  aliens on the screen  my system begins to crawl under the strain
this is in the very beginning  imagine what will happen when i reach the flood hundreds of aliens at a time
this is unacceptable
but it is a shame that somebody messedup halo pc because there will be gamers that will never know how awesome the game really is
my second problem is actually more of a realization
i now realize that halo was so revolutionary because of the twothumbsticktrigger controller
it is extremely intuitive to control movement with one thumb while looking with the other thumb while firing your weapons with actual triggers
the keyboard cannot begin to compete
i read a review on a reputable gaming website that basically stated the exact opposite  he loved halo on the keyboard
to each his own  i guess
make up your own mind but i suggest each of you just try it on the xbox for  minutes to see quotwhat all the fuss is aboutquothalo is a fun game no doubt
the graphics are pretty the gameplay is challenging and the storyline is fantastic
everyone knows the singleplayer game is phenomenal the singleplayer game in this pc version is identical to the xbox versionwhat this pc version adds to the halo experience is true online multiplayer
and its terribleoh the new weapons flamethrower fuel rod cannon and vehicles banshee various warthogs are neat
the maps are okay
its the lame players that drives halo multiplay into the ground
at the time of this writing multiplayer halo is filled with dweebs who enjoy nothing more than killing their own teammates while swearing in all capsthis is not funworse cooperative play through the singleplayer storylineeasily halos best featureis simply absent
inexplicably there is no way to play through the game alongside a pal
other pc games serious sam tom clancy games have featured cooperative gameplay
halo pc supports over a dozen simultaneous players
halo xbox had cooperative play
so why is this feature absent
it makes no sense and it makes the game much less appealingstay away from this game until a patch implements such standard multiplayer controls as banning voting and autokicking for excessive tksalright i understand companies need to make money but they should not have put halo on pc
should have stayed on xbox where it belongs
after two years of the game being out any one who really wanted it would have bought an xbox and played it there
the graphics are not quotsouped up for pcquot
they are shakey and choppy because  a the game was ported and sloppily
plays infinetly smoother on xbox  b meant to be played with a controller not a mouse so it jerks all over the place if you move to quicklyhalo  will be on xbox first and then the same thing will happen they will put it on pc to earn some quick cash
thats it
you want halo
buy an xbox
blahyou knowi am an absolute halo fanfor xbox anyway
i played at my friends housewe had  xboxs hooked up with  peeps on each
i swearthat was the epitomy of all gaming
itwas almost a religious experiance for me
i cannot possibly describe how much fun it wasalas i do not own an xbox nor do i ever plan to own one
i do not buy an expensive console system for the only game worth playing on it
sowhen the pc version was coming out i was overly thrilled
i wanted to be able to play the main gameexperiance the storyline i heard so much aboutplay in large multiplayer games that didnt take months of planning to get  xboxs in one housei read up on it in magazines and in newspapers
reviewers hit it hard for its graphics and lack of coop main game play
this didnt phase me
i could live with that
i think every game is infinitely better with coop mode and multiplayer but for halo i could do without coop
i could also live with reduced graphics
so i went about getting the gamewhen it comes out my computer crashes so i have to wait
finally i get a brand new computer
halo is one of the first things i get because i simply cant wait
i read the min requirements before i buy itwhich is absolutely deceivingfirst row will be the system requirement for the game second row will be what i have hmz processer     ghz gb hard drive space     gb free mb video card   mb geforce ii mb ram     mbso i get it and install it on my computer
theoretically this game should fly on its best settings
especially because i see the graphics and i have larger games with better graphics that run perfectly smooth
but what happens
i get into the game and i think its paused because i try to move and nothing happens
 seconds later im suddenly in a new spot
serious serious lag timedissapointed that the game isnt running on highest graphics settings i decide to put it on lowest and progress higher until i find a comfortable medium
wellthe game doesnt even run on minimum settings
it runs better but not at any playable speeds
clocked at about  frame   secondsi figure there may have been some coding error in the game so i connect and download a patch from microsoft
i was almost correct
the game runs now at frames per second
so im a lot closer to playable than i used to be but its still unplayable
wasted moneyi try multiplayer thinking that perhaps it is just the campaign mode thats bad
but it isnt
multiplayer is just as bad though thankfully not worse
youll be happy to know though that once you get killed and your carcass is falling to the ground there is no lag at all
that runs perfectly smoothly
however i played a  minute game ol and never got to leave my base
there were  snipers around the base in an  vs  game
and i had a bullet through my head as soon as i respawned
lag wouldnt kick in for about  seconds so i tried to run but alas cheap cowardly idiots had me and  others of my team constantly deadwith progressively longer respawn times of course
interesting how i never got to leave my respawn point or even my base area
im told this is par for halo so even the multiplayer i wanted to partake in was flawed
the servers are chocked full of cheap snipersdont get me wrong
snipers are fine if youre defending your flag or a strategic point for your team or whatnot
butwhen you kill the enemy within their own base as they respawnthats going overboard
there should be a system where if you snipekill a person within  seconds of them respawning you get killed and have to sit out for  minutes
because newsflash those people are there so they can play not die where they spawn and watch the clock tick away how long they have until they can rejoini know i sound crazy but the only possible way a smaller game with horrid graphics can run that badly is deliberate sabatoge of the code
microsoft im sure did this to prevent too many purchases of the pc version and help out its xbox by keeping its only good title more afloat
so for now i search ol to find someone whos hacked the code and made it playablei see a man selling bootleg microsoft software every day on my way to work
i never respected him for what he does
the day after i got halo i walked up to him shook his hand and donated  to his cause
told him quotgood jobquot and caught my busthis game just isnt worth the web space to trash talk iti bought the game based on all the hype about h and h for vista
it was ok but frankly hl a game of the same era was more interesting
maybe i am just jaded by the current generation of games such as hl ep or bioshock
in any case ok for an older game just dont pay much for it at this point in its existancefor the most part i enjoyed this game
i gave it a rating of  star to get your attention and to point out that this is only half a game
it offers both single player and online multiplayif you love multiplayer games and have a broadband connectionthis game is awesome
warning  most of the halo multiplayer servers groups and games i played were filled with immature  year olds that curse  letter words at you and accuse you of cheating all the time because they cant shoot straight
i prefer more mature surroundingsif you are looking for a great single player experienceforget itfirst of all the graphics are prettybut dated
look at ut  on a high end vid card and compare it to halo
halo is bland the levels are redundant
the outside levels are pretty but nothing impressiveeven on the hardest settings this game is way too scripted the enemy ai is pathetic and predictable
it is not intelligent ai
all the programmers did was setup scripted actions and triggers to generate hoardes and hoardes of enemies to come at you at set intervals as you proceed through a levelwant to beat them easily
say your in a level exploringjust walk slowly until you trigger some enemies to appear back track a bit for protection and keep your back to a wall
kill the enemies as they approach then step back to where you triggered the enemies see if you can trigger more and repeat these instructions until you are clear
proceed and investigate further until you trigger more enemies
repeat this strategy throughout the level and the rest of the gameif you get into a heated heavy battle just use coverpop out shot some aliens and duck again
they almost never pursue you
only the weird mutants chase you
just shotgun them
nice and simplethere are some tiny little parasite style aliens that are more annoying than dangerous
dont waste your ammo on them just let them crash into your shield let your shield recharge and proceed
piece of cake
i walked through this game on the hardest settings without breaking a sweat the ai is disappointing
not horrible but very predictableonline multiplay is where this game shinesthe weapons are sosobut having vehicles to drive around is a blastif you are thinking of buying this titlei would wait
february rd  is the release of unreal tournament 
 unreal tournament  it has vehicles awesome weapons a huge online following and bot ai that will bring you to your knees
i have sampled the beta versions of it and all i can say is wowcon un nuevo set multijugador solo para esta version halo para pc se abre paso entre los jugadores amantes no solo de la plataforma si no tambien de su version original para la consola xbox
lamentablemente halo para pc sufrio mucho x ser publicado algunos antildeos  tarde kel original topandose con mejores fps tanto en calidad grafica como de tramatwo observations that are outside of the game
first do not trust anyone who only writes reviews with  star ratings
these people are either idiots or work for the company
second do not trust anyone who reviews a product before they have seen or played the product all the way through
again such people are either idiots or work for the companynow onto dark alliance
i have played the original baldurs gate on the pc
and have played the first video game version of baldurs gate on both the playstation and the xbox
all of these games i found very enjoyable and would give them between  starsbaldurs gate dark alliance deserves one star
while the graphics are good they are not as good as the first game and the makers have an annoying habit of making you fight in the dark to  make gameplay more difficult pretty hard to fight when you cant see and  to mask the fact that the graphics are mostly reused from the first gamelittle effort went into originality on this game
the story is incredibly week
you play an entirely different character from the first game
your character has some secret or mystery that must be completed that differentiates him or her from the other characters
once you find out your secret or solve your mystery you will be disappointed because of the anticlimactic reaction of your character and your inability to use the information you gainednot all monsters including bosses give good or any treasuresall monsters are incredibly easy to beat you only need to press one button over and over again to beat  of the monsters with one exception
toward the end of the game you will need to reach the two baddest bad guys
right before you meet them you ascend a stair case directly into a room filled with monsters who kill you immediately
this part of the game was insanely difficult unless you have stealthoverall a disappointing game with few if any highlights
save your money for a worthy game such as legacy of cain iiiplayers are not different enough cause you only get tigeri dislike how putting is donetoo many arcade elements for a quotsimquot gamecpu ai is not worth playing againstoh no
there goes all the excitementid rather go back to playing nhlit actually has more options than this game is terribleeven though ive only played it for  minutesi already knowthe game play is really slowthey took away alot of fun featuresthe deflected shot the back to back passing bill clementdo i care who sings the songs
get rid of that stupid boxthere is no more stat keeper for your self and your friendsdont buy thistheres only disappointmentrushhour is crucial to the satisfactory play of simcity  the game was released as the game then this rushhour expansion  then the combination called sc deluxe
since the deluxe version is available in several forms which include rushhour it is just crazy to pay this kind of money for the expansion alone
i dont normally rate things based on cost but in this case a downgrade is warranted
this rating is for this expansion offeryou may want to check out the cd versionsimcity  deluxe edition the downloadable versionsimcity  deluxe edition download also available on steam and though most mac users run it on windows emulators the aspyr versionsim city  deluxe mac
it also is included along with several other games in the box setthe simcity boxit makes no sense to buy this version at this ish pricei was a ctually waiting in anticpation of this game when i heard of it but once i got it it was frustrating
icouldnt even install it and that was even after i traded with three different copies my system is a p ghz with a geforce  so it shouldve worked but didnt
avoid it save your moneyive been an avid medal of honor allied assault fan since the original
i have played every single mission and beat them with flying colors
the original was the greatest
it had everything from sneaking into a german facility wearing an ss unform to the invasion of omaha beach
mohaa was original yet very realisticspearhead sort of strayed from this when it had you an american paratrooper with the st airborne division jump into normandy and find yourself fighting alongside british soldiers and then a short time after that in berlin with the russians
you had a chance to use the new weapons of these countries but it seemed too staged to be realbreakthrough completely broke through my longtime respect for the medal of honor legacy
you did the same old thing you did in spearhead but in italy
realism took a turn for worse as the developers tried to make you feel surrounded
but what happens is enemy troops will literally appear out of nowhere
another problem i found was that they never give you enough ammoand dont say i waste because ive never ran into this problem before
also not to mention the idiotic mission plots and objectives
the third or so mission requires you to liberate a fullyfunctional and guarded german pow camp in italy
not so bad eh
it requires you to do so all by yourself
and furthermore by the time i reached it i had no ammo left
this wasnt any fluke either
its happened to me many times in breakthroughi think the best advice i can give to you is quotdont waste your moneyquot this is not the medal of honor you know and love
it is an attempt to prolong the medal of honor series that as you know is fading away
this is just the same old stuff folks nothing newi have been a huge fan of medal of honor since i bought allied assault and even after spearheads shortfalls but this is just terrible
this expansion pack should have been awesome yet it failed terribly
the missions have potential but are horrible
the african campaign where you had to defend the braindead minesweeping tanks was sheer agony
you have to stay ahead of the tanks to protect them but if you take the time you need to kill the germans who threaten you and the tanks youll likely be run over by the tanks youre protecting
its very difficult to keep an eye on your tanks keep moving up and shooting every german all at once
after a few minutes it gets very tiringin the italian campaign you fire one round all the italians will know exactly where you are and youll be surrounded in seconds
being shot from every angle where each shot throws off your aim while using your garand can be difficult especially since there will be no health for you until much later
later on you will have to fight off hordes of italian tanks with mortars as if those mortars could scratch a tank
youre in a house with a small wall around it you have to use these cumbersome mortars to destroy these tanks from two different directions and if one touches the wall you fail your mission
even if you destroy it a split second after it touches the wall
even though the enemy is destroyed the enemy still has broken throughone very annoying thing is the lack of ammunition
you have to conserve ammo like mad
about one in every  soldiers drops some ammo if youre lucky
in most situations i had to fight a group of germans at close range with nothing more than my sniper rifle and pistol at least the italian pistol is decent only to rewarded with no ammunition
its very frustratingthe single player mode ended twice as soon as it should have and i was left with the feeling of thats it
like spearhead the shortfalls in singleplayer were somewhat made up for with improvements in the multiplayer
however the improvements were nothing spectacular
new modes weapons and maps were nice when i could play it
apparently breakthrough has a problem where when you try to connect to a multiplayer game it says your cd key is already in use
natrually i thought someone was using a pirated copy with my cd key
that is until i went to their website and found out thats not the case at all
apparently its some bug where they screwed up and you have to pay
the explanation on how to fix the problem is of epic proportions you have to delete the game in a special way and reinstall it in a special way and i just felt cheated
they screwed up so you have to compensate to use the product you paid forthis is only everything i feel like writing about right now that i can remember i gave up on this expansion months ago
just stick with mohaa or spearhead if you already have it
if you really want to try this out dont spend over  for itedit since i wrote this review i reinstalled breakthrough out of curiosity and the multiplayer works fine this time
i dont know how common the problem i mentioned issave your money and do not buy this junkthe stick is poorly designed and hard to holdget a real gaming systemreview update  so i had the two towers game for gamecube back when it first came out in  and i loved it and played the ass out of it
but by the time this one came out i had either lost interest or couldnt be bothered to spend money on buying itwhere the previous game was smooth streamlined and somewhat tempered in its hacking n slashing so that hacking and slashing half a dozen opponents was overwhelming yet rewarding in a way that some hack n slashes do with half a hundred opponents in the same time
it had the original voice actors playing themselves even unlockable interviews with them talking about it and their recording
it even had incentives to replay levels using each character over againnine years later i returned to the games and played this oneeverything about the previous game that was good seems to be completely and thoroughly wasted or rendered useless in this gamethe graphics are somewhat improved for the characters but the drab color scheme a questionable decision given that this game covers more areas and different characters and stunningly awful enemy designs mean that while you could easily discern orcs from goblins from urukhai including the big orcs who were like urukhai and the incredibly annoying urukhai with no shirt who would always knock you down with his onehanded sword in this game you can almost never tell the difference if there even is any between the various types of orcadding to the monotony of the color is perhaps the most mindnumbingly awful methods of ramping up gameplay difficulty from the previous game
virtually every bad game design decision that could be implemented here was implemented the camera positioning is hideous and you frequently end up being unable to see your own character for long periods of time or running headlong against the side of the screen only to be suddenly attacked at the last moment by a horde of enemies you were apparently charging straight into blindlysome specific examples include the wall battle of minas tirith a pretty blatant copy of the wall battle of helms deep from the previous game only this time with you as gandalf and with constant annoying little secondary objectives that give the enemy far too much time to swarm the wall such as rushing to catapults to fire on enemy siege towers despite them already having teams of men at the catapults fully capable of pulling the switch to fire
the camera angling is so terrible that you can never actually see the staircase youre supposed to walk up to find the catapults
the game never even hints how you get to them and it was literally only dumb luck that i found the camera shifted when i reached a certain blind spot showing me these stairsanother horrendous example comes when aragorn legolas and gimli arrive on pelennor fields and must go through a gauntlet of taking out oliphaunts one at a time
aside from the aforementioned facepalming stupidity exercise that this is the game constantly goes to cut scene to show you the arrival of each and every single new oliphaunt as well as the witchking arriving thus leaving your character frozen in place while random uruks and eastern men swarm your position if you had virtually no health and you almost certainly will you pretty much instantly die as soon as the cutscene is done
and the way the cutscene is shot makes it difficult to tell which side of a massive canyon you should be on in order to shoot at the oliphaunt ridiculous difficulty levels involving health and damage
at the very least for this game you can purchase combo and weapon upgrades that apply to all characters rather than you own with a discount to offer incentive toward this while having a need to keep upping your best characters to meet future challenges
despite this difficulty isnt raised by having smarter opponents or tougher battles but simply by lowering your health drastically and lowering your weapon damage drastically then by doubling the amount of enemies thrown at youwhereas the previous games health bar was well balanced with its green for good yellow for mildly damaged orange for seriously damaged and red for neardeath and a good player almost always managing to keep yellow or better no amount of skill will keep players from spending more than half the time in red health bordering on dying
this wouldnt be so frustrating if not for the fact that the game seemingly doesnt expect this and thus has the health bar constantly flashing at the bottom of the screen when youre in redthis is exacerbated by incredibly bad combos
despite using some of the same button sequences as the previous game combos here are poorly executed with some of the most important ones being so slow in execution that they only work against an opponent one on one if there is a second opponent he need only shove you roughly to completely break the combo and send you staggering back
this means combos are as likely to fail as they are to work properly and even worse dont do enough damage to kill most of the time when theres few if any combos that allow for sweeping attacks or splash damage knocking one opponent down for a second before moving on to another is just as much a waste of time as simply mashing a repeatedly with the exact same results achievedat the very least you can block attacks with your attack instead of having to press b constantly though this works best
and even worse is being knocked down unlike the previous game when youre knocked down by anything be it a gargantuan orc champion a troll or a dogsized spider you stay down for  full seconds unmoving and take another  seconds just getting up
in the midst of fasthacknslash gameplay particularly in the pelennor fields where  seconds is long enough to miss your chance to kill the oliphaunt and spook the witch king away from merry and eowyn this is deadly not to mention a colossal waste of time with regards to action
i cannot even imagine how this decision to make rising such a sluggish action was considered and implemented unless theres a future upgrade to speed up rising time though about  of the way into the game its not anywhere to be seen longwinded missions with multiple subobjectives and poorly spaced out checkpointsthis section alone topples the entire game in my opinion
it is absolutely gamebreaking and the true definition of an exercise in facepalming stupiditythe two towers missions were typically lengthy with frequent checkpoints and clearcut objectives like kill  urukhai run this way to protect frodo kill  urukhai kill uruk boss it was mostly about rushing through mazelike levels killing doing stuff killing and boss fightshere they implement so many sections that in some cases bring the gameplay to a screeching halt so you can try and fail over and over to figure out their completely pointless little puzzle section or try and fail over and over as they throw complicated objectives on top of being swarmed by hundreds of opponentssome of the absolute worst examples includesamwise in shelobs lair
there are little sections that serve absolutely no purpose except to waste time in which sam has to pick up a conveniently placed torch and throw it in the middle of a pile of little spiders in order to clear them from his path
rather than just using it once or twice to teach us to use the z button for interactions they implement it as a primary level feature and theres literally one section where you have to do it three times in a row to reach a locked door only to realize you have to do it all over again going back where you started in order to climb up past another series of spiders and torchesthe big three in the ghost lair
more than once youre forced to buttonmash the z button to turn a wheel that lowers a bridge while ghostly archers shoot at you balancing between deflecting their arrows and working on the bridge
not only is this so easy that you could just stand there as half the arrows simply glitch past you due to pisspoor collision detection but sometimes a cutscene showing the bridge lowering wastes several secondsother times the game simply demands ridiculously over the top objectives and gives you literally nothing to work with
in these circumstances even lowering the difficulty does nothing to change the impenetrable grind in some of these levels
the design is not one of any sort of challenge or skill or talent but literally facepalming stupidity and repetition until you finally overcome the odds by sheer statistics
its the very action of the saying the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and expecting different results
and unlike the previous game your allies are completely and utterly useless they will never ever successfully kill more than one enemy in the time youve taken out five or six or more and moved on
sometimes they wont even attack but just stand still in front of an enemy until that enemy decides to ignore them and attack yousome of the worst offenders include the aforementioned level in the ghost cave where you inexplicably have to fight some ghosts
random rocks will burst out of the ground blocking your progress until you defeat a bunch of ghosts somehow
as well if you get too close to the ghosts they can pretty much instakill you sending you right the hell back to the start of the level or the start of the checkpoint
theres literally nothing you can do to avoid this but try again and do the exact same thing over againsimilarly the aforementioned pelennor fields gauntlet of i have to do everything because everyone else is too effing stupid tasks in which to start you have to kill  east men but not orcs
i specifically say not orcs because they dont count towards the  and because theres as many of them on the field as there are east men
why east men only instead of orcs no effing idea why since the overall objective means you could be fighting wild deer or gremlins or inanimate objects and the result as well as the task would be exactly the same killing these  eastermen doesnt matter at all the respawn infinitesimally and after you finish this pointless objective you move on to the real missionand this warm up isnt even vital to the actual mission you could literally just run past the field and set up camp on the cliffs overlooking the canyon where the oliphaunts spawn but the combination of pointless objective and incredibly awful camera angling means youre literally lost in the fray and have no idea where to even go once youve finished the objectiveand the sheer number of orcs and east men spawned and thrown at you in this phase makes it so difficult that it should be in some way relevant ive died and had to restart so often in this spot i could have finished entire levels of this same longwinded game in the amount of time i spent dealing with flimsy combos which left me wide open to attack by the  other enemies surrounding me being knocked over long enough for another  to trample me and spending so much time with red blinking health on the brink of death while mashing b to block  blades all attacking me that i could reach perfect mode two times over just from the blocks and have no avenue open to even attack anyone
all of those events aside from the obvious number exaggeration happened to me in this one effing level
and the punchline is this isnt the first time youre put in such a situation
an earlier level has the exact same setup you randomly thrown into a random spot of battlefield with endless swarms of orcs spawning on you and half an hour spent blocking and killing them by the score with no end in sight and no mission objective in sight
unlike the pelennor fields one where you at least saw it would end after killing  east men this level forgot which had no such objective and no clue or insight into what you were supposed to be doingif you survived long enough the mission would end up failing anyway because apparently you were supposed to go and rescue someone while fighting through the orcs
this would have made sense if the orcs were actually in between you and the thing youre supposed to reach
instead theyre literally on the exact opposite side so the way to complete this objective is not to fight your way through the orcs but to completely ignore them and run away
and you only learn this after being killed half a dozen times or having the mission abruptly fail with absolutely no explanation as to whyback to the pelennor fields level another layer of insanitystupidity comes with the witch king he randomly appears to fly over eowyn and merry and apparently do nothing
they take damage but the witch king neither attacks them nor shoots arrows or spears or magic at them
youre supposed to shoot arrows at him to make him fly away
not only does this occur while the oliphaunts still come and taking them down is a tedium all in itself but if the oliphaunts make it to eowyn and merry you instantly fail the mission and the amount of time it takes to move from different locations and fire off arrows means that there are some cases where it is genuinely not possible to win the mission because you missed out by a second or less getting up after being knocked down and either the witch king or an oliphaunt kills merry and eowynand making it even more catastrophically infuriating is that orcs and east men keep spawning this whole time and they keep rushing at you to attack you
so sometimes you dont even need to be just a bit too slow you could be distracted by them rushing you wasting your time while the oliphaunt trudges closer or the witch king kills off eowyn and merryand this literally happens to me every time when i try to target the witch king to shoot arrows at him one enemy soldier spots me and rushes at me and my bows targetting targets him instead of the witch king and thus far ive found absolutely nothing short of completely putting the bow away and killing him that will serve to take the bows aim off the goddamn bat and on the goddamn witch kingat this rate it seems impossible for the game to present anything that could lift it out of this mad mess of pointless wallbanging repetition and stupidity
its become for me the goto guide on how not to make an action game
despite the playable gameplay elements for hacking and slashing unless you want to move past stage  youre soldont even rent mario kart double dash
it is really boring
all the mario karts are the same
im sick of mario
he should die already
dont buy itthis game is not what i had expected
for one the graphics suck and to complete pokemon leaf green fire red pokedex you have to beat this game which isnt an easy takt to be done
all in all i dont reccomend this gamei preordered this game and took it back a week after i got it
the story is contrived and the gameplay is unfriendly
my friends swore it was better when you played with others but i found myself just as bored
i especially didnt like using the gameboy advance with it the gamecube controller is much more comfortable
on the plusside the sound and graphics are decent but that doesnt make a game howevermy bias is that from a final fantasy fan
final fantasy crystal chronicles is not a final fantasy game
it doesnt even come close to the legend of zelda in terms of actionadventure
it is a waste of time space energy and money
all togetheri made the regretful mistake of putting this product on my amazon wish list when it first came out
after testing it at stores and reading about it i quickly realized the game was cheese
i forgot however to remove it from my wish list
my brother and sister bought it for me for my birthday one year
aye yie yieso because of the  they scrounged together in my honor i figured id give the game a thorough shoti couldnt take it anymore by the time i got to the second level
it was atrocious
i felt sorry for the final fantasy name and for my relatives for dropping the cashenough of the emotional banter
let me try to give an analytical review of this gamefirst of all it does not meet the definition of a classic roleplaying game
within the last couple of years however i have noticed rpg taking on a new meaning
now it means simply playing as someone else
grand theft auto for example is now classified as an rpg
but with todays loose definition of rpg you can call it that i guess
but i grew up with real rpgs like dragon warrior the final fantasy titles lufia breath of fire etc
these were all turnbased rpgs
second ffcc does not develop your characters sanely
sorry but whoever programmed this atrocity embarrassed the genre of actionadventurethird i recommend you boycott any gamecube title that requires the use of the game boy advance to play multiplayer
it is asinine to expect peoplekids to pay money for such an inconvenient expensive and improper method to simply play with your friendslastly this game is best suited for gamers who do not like real rpgs but prefer an action game with unique challenges in gameplay
yes ffcc is an actionadventure but unlike most others the gamer will simply have to learn this somewhat different style it is more hack  slash than anything  the multiplayer functionality should have saved this game from a bad review but it was disappointing at best
but other than that the game will offer essentially zero to true rpg gamers especially those who love the final fantasy series
stay away from this game if you love final fantasy titlesthe gameis too boring for me
you do the same crap over and over again
and i hate repetitiveness
especially in games
this was the first final fantasy game i was expecting a grand adventure where i save the world but the only thing my character was worry about is protecting her village from the stupid poisonous misama
and hate that i have to stay in a little bubble so my health doesnt be effectedhere i am beating these monsters up for years in the game and there no progress im going in circles because i cant go to the same place twice after i beat it i have to wait until a couple years pass in the game
i was getting so pissed that i gave up and threw away the game in my closet to collect dust
then a few years pass and i looked at a video of the game and i found out theres a freakin final boss
which was hard for me to believe since the game doesnt make it obvious or conspicuous that there was one
the fighting gameplay even a five year old can do it because all you do is press athis game is lame
it should be called final fantasy the crystal losers chronicles
all the final fantasy fans expected a big game and because square enix begins again making games for nintendo got all of the final fantasy fans excited
the game is totally lame has a serious lack of story
seriously
you get to pick the name of your town your character gender etc and then your on your own you meet other caravansbut nothing big and you fight monstersspoilersand when you fight the final boss you discover that its all based on memoriesend of spoilersand the end is a big piece of crapthe multiplayer version its the same but you can play with your friends and its almost impossible to play cause every player needs a nintendo advance to play and to do the spells is very hard
i just hope that the sequel isnt as lame as this onethis game is terrible
well for one player anyway
to be honest if you dont have at least  people its not going to be goodif you have one person that moogle can carry your lamp for you
if you have  people one the  people has to carry that stupid lamp around
in other words you have one person fighting and one person running away from enemies because they have that stupid lamp in their handsso with  at least only  out of the three has to carry the stupid lamp aroundbut it doesnt help that the game isnt that fun
it has very bad play control it takes your guy like a whole  seconds to attack after pressing the buttonthe graphics are pretty but not astoundingreplay
hahahaha
i didnt play it all the way though the first time
who wouldso yeah get another game instead
suikoden iv and growlanser generations are out on ps and they are way betteri loved the original for the playstation but this onestory   the story is about as deep as a wading pool
i thought from the start it wouldnt be great but i didnt expect it to be so bland and vapid
the story opens on a schoolyard snowball fight between the munchkins of a small public school and a clever tutorial instructs you how to play the game throughout the snow fight
then three of the loser kids including the protagonist go to a house read a book then wish they werent losers and were in that fantasy world
then while they sleep the world changes and then the main guy ask the other two to help him get the world back to normal but they dont want to because theyre not losers there then you go on a million missions and the story dies with your motivation to playgameplay   the battle system is pretty much the same as the first except you have to learn skills and magic by equipting weapons that have that skill on them
this wouldnt bother me except that you often have to equip very weak weapons to learn skills you may have missed or havent gotten to yet
the battles feel slower then its big brother and they just arent as fungraphics   i guess theyre good for a gba game but the first has much better visuals
the animations and attacks and spells almost put me to sleep they are very simple and boring
overall the graphics just plain lack style or any zest at all
oh and the character clothing is outrageously bizzare
they look incredible weird even for a ff game in short i dont like itoverall   it is at best an ok game
at least its better than final fantasy chrystal chronicals    shuttersi never thought id have to post a bad review of a game in the final fantasy franchise but here goesi dont know what the game designers were thinking with this
the plot is virtually nonexistant
the game is basically a series of battles
there are no puzzles nothing in particular to unlock except new battles and very little sense of progress
theres virtually nil npc interaction and nothing to figure out
if i wanted a game that was nothing but combat i wouldnt be playing ff id break out my old copy of the pc dosbased dungeon hack which is exactly what it sounds likethe laws are arbitrary
restrictions on what kind of combat youre allowed to engage in should make a game interesting they at least keep you from overspecializing in say warriors or wizards
but when the game arbitrarily and randomly decides you cant use weapons in this battle or you cant use magic in this battle with no real rationale you just start to get annoyed with it
a much better way of preventing over specialization is to throw the player up against a wider variety of monsters so that they must have multiple classes to be able to play to all the enemys strengths and weaknessesi also really dislike the idea of gaining skills by equiping certain items instead of oh you know using the skills in question
the result is that you end up equipping really weak and generally useless items for longer than you conceivably would in any other game or you end up lacking very basic skills
both are artificially limitingoverall i think the game just lacks a lot of what makes the final fantasy franchise such a popular one and thats a shame especially consider how good the original tactics is supposed to be
this is the first time ive ever not finished an ff game that i bought
not because it was difficult but because it was mindnumbingalot of problembs with this game
the storyline battlestyle movement charachters and play is very confusing
i seriously loved fftactics but this this is justno
you dont call this ff and let it go unnoticed
i used to be a dedicated ff fan they all got booring though
please for everyones sake dont get hooked on the final fantasy series
you just waste your money and time
i suggest onimusha metal gear solid or the tenchu series
they all have very good storylines and alot of inyourface action
anyways fftas graphics and music are the only things i liked about it
otherwise i just plain disliked itthis game sucked basically hold a and prey it was dumb played for  seconds and had to shut it off why did i waste my i hated this game
i mean its just pinball my least favorite arcade game if you dont like pin ball even a little bitthis game is really not for youive already reviewed super mario bros  elsewhere with both the bit nes version and the super mario allstars version
i dont want to spend a lot of time and space on super mario bros  specifically but instead focus on this port which is based on the super mario allstars version
we all know super mario bros  is a classic title
so lets dispense with the cursory introduction of super mario bros 
basically this is just a copy and paste job from a short blurb i wrote in my  review of super mario allstars
super mario brothers  the best selling game ever released independently smb greatly expanded the mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies bowsers children who was the mother i wonder
godzillas ex
 and introduced cool new suites for mario to wear
the game play was more expansive than ever with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds
this game laid the foundation for so many other platformers especially super mario world
while smb felt like a weird detour smb took mario back to the atmosphere or the original game taking it a thousand different directions and coming up with one of the best games ever developed
although there were a few tweaks for the all stars release some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets like the other games this is tremendously faithful to the original nes release
that alone makes this essential playingto further elaborate there are a few cosmetic changes but this is largely the allstars port of super mario bros  that we all know and adore
ok we all love smb
its an eternal classic etc etc
best game on the nes
yada yada
everyone on the same page
goodnow lets get to the problems of super mario advance  and yes there are problems
well one problem anyway
and its a big problem
its a little selling point called ereader compatibility
whats so great about ereader cards you ask
well im glad you askedereader cards features new content than can be added to preexisting games
in the case of super mario bros  there were three specific types powerups which uploads specific items into mario or luigis inventory list and can be used an unlimited amount of times demo cards which showed mario speedrunning collecting enough coins to unlock a blue toad house or doing infinite up tricks  essentially the hint videos of new super mario bros wii six years before and wait for it 
new levelsyes you read right
new levels
yes nintendo made new levels to super mario bros  and a whole new world called appropriately enough worlde
note these are not the  inaccesible levels embedded in the original nes super mario bros  code
nintendo released ten levels in japan the pal reigion and america with two different series
fantastic eh
awesomeno not really
in fact as a mario can you just feel cheated
why
well for one although japan frequently gets exclusive content nintendo released a full twenty two additional new levels in japan only because again wait for it 
nintendo discontinued the ecard readerso whats frustrating here
mainly nintendo made thirty three new levels which to put in perspective is over a third of the original game as super mario bros  has  levels total plus five remade levels in super mario bros  style of super mario bros
these were levels     and   also in homage to super mario world there are five new coloured switches which effect gameplay in different ways but again only were released in japanalthough many think boomerang mario first appeared in super mario d land actually he first appeared in these oneoff levels on the ecards but with only one exception slidin the slopes where you can use a boomerang on that one level only just like goombas shoe on  no one outside of japan got to play as boomerang mario
s of the ecards appeared only in japananother problem with the ecards
in worlde there are three mushroom houses each featuring three specific minigames
to unlock these mushroom houses you must get advance coins found in the new levels a precursor to the star coins of the new super mario bros series
but heres the kicker
outside of japan theres only enough coins to access one of these three minigames because theres not enough currency in the ten levels that nintendo actually did release to unlock the other twoin europe the gamers got screwed even worst than the americans with the ecard functionality completely disabled inaccessible through normal gameplayfor mario fans this is beyond disappointing
nintendo put so much effort into new content and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels
the ereader was also a failure so the cards werent available for very long anyway
had all this new content been released in the game proper super mario advance  would be the definitive port of super mario bros  as it stands there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new contentthese are the true lost levels in the mario universe still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately
note that the original super mario bros had  levels
these lost levels are  in number along with three bonus levels and five remade levelsin the nes days that would be a fulllength mario title
why oh why nintendo
released levels outside of japan  wild ride in the sky included with the game japanese sky athletics

smb remake classic world smb remake classic world smb remake classic world smb remake classic world one of the most frustrating episodes in marios storied historythis game is terrible did nintendo hire george lopez to make a flying mario game but he was drunk do not get this extermly horrible gamewhat was capcom thinking when they tried to make a mega man x game d
the thing i always liked about the mega man x series was it always kept the quottraditionalquot side scrolling theme
i always liked that they were the only ones who knew it was about game play and not d graphics
i put the emphasiz on quotwerequot
this is horrible i cant believe they made it into d graphics
not only is it not as appealing but it also makes it hard to see enemies that are coming your way
thats what i loved about mega man x it was still the traditional real side scroller
i cant believe they broke this quottraditionquotthis is the worst d megaman game ive ever played
the camera angles suck
it is very difficult to see things
the control sucked as well
i regret buying this gamei know they called the game mega man x but they put too much emphasis on x  those special weapons that you acquire get wasted quick and are not effective when they are the boss weakness
i love the armors that x has throughout the series but i have to say the armor in this game looks like the one from the first one with minor changes for looks and the abilities suck
zero and axl can go through the levels but going through the bosses are going to make you pull your hair out if you have any
then the voice acting is horrible that you wish you didnt play the game
overall if youre a fan its going to make you go wtf
capcom got lazy and didnt think about their loyal fansan onion being a maverick
what happened to the boss selection screens we used to see where there were bosses we were scared to face first because they looked bad
none of these bosses looked threatening and the weakest looking are actually the hardestthe kangaroo boss
capcom shouldve kept it d and axel has no purpose
the ability to switch between characters takes away from the challenge and megaman sounds like doug funnie
avoidjust stop with these games theyve sucked forever this one is just too hard and cheesy
die mega man or x or zero or whatever the main character is nowever since i was about  years old megaman has been my favorite videogame
i started wih megaman  and was instantly hooked
as the series went on it was nearing its peek
meg man x was insanely good great powerups and o so much mroe to collect as was x and especially the ultra rare  dollar x
the trnslation to the next gen consoles is usually the ultimate down fall of great side scrolling old school shooter and this is no exception
megaman had some undoubtedly rough spots what with megaman legends and megaman  things were really looking down
then capcom graced us with megaman x good ol side scrolling fun and megaman was good again for a brief shining moment
then again the quality began to slip with x and  and x is definately the low pointthe problem with this game is that megaman was never meant to be a d expierience it just doesnt work
the game has terrible controls average graphics and infuriates you past the point of caring anymore
megaman should frusterate you but before it fueled you to do better now it just pisses you off and causes a lot of broken controllers
the megaman anniversery edition just came out and is an excellent old school finger numbing smash
it features behind the scenes videos sketches and even the original tv commercials for megaman  through  which are available for play plus  japan only boss rush modes try that instead you wont regret itwhere to begin on this review of one of my top  worst mega man games of all time
okay for those who know nothing about the series its a sub series in the mega man franchise
the subseries began on the super nintendo or super famicom in japan which is considered not only one of the best mega man games of all time but also one of the best games on the system
 more came out along with mega man  and mega man soccer which is not part of the x series and then eventually went on to the  bit era sony playstation and sega saturn as capcom didnt care for nintendos n console and released x
the graphics were redone but were still in d and along with that were cinemas and voice acting
of course we can forget about voice acting as it was still very bad
later in  x came out and the gameplay was the same but a few different things were added
x came out a year later and this was the final x game to come out for the psone segas saturn had only x due to being a failure
people were displeased with x and x due to unupdated gameplay and difficulty level
then this this game came out
when i first played it i was excited to play a new x game because the x games were actually my favorite games of all time
i played through this disaster and my heart was shattered into a million tiny pieces
first of all you cant play as x hold on a second you cant play as x
i later found out why capcom did this and it was because it was part of the story as x didnt want to fight anymore so you play as zero and axl why did they make this character
he sucks
the gameplay was way too weird for my tastes and the boss battles were just terrible
go on youtube and look up the gameplay and boss battles for more info
i only played this game once but playing it just once told me to never ever play this disgrace again
hear me out avoid at all costsi cant give this game much credit with the exception of the audio
the game is very short
six hours on an fps is laughable
half of that prblem is the ai
i dont know about you but when i need to reload i try to take cover
instead quottheyquot go to an open area stop then start reloading
that isnt ai at all
the walking fungus in mario was smarterthe weapon selection is a bit on the short side
i know it took place in wwii
i also know there was more than five guns a fire extinguisher doesnt count
yeah i can mount guns
they look a little different but feel the same
sorryi might be too critical of this game because of anticipation or maybe the game was overhyped
i gave it a chance and i was let downps
there is always xiiithe medal of honor series has been popular for a long time
after all who doesnt like playing the same event world war   timesanyway though rising sun is an example of how a company can get away with making trash and still have it get decent reviews and have it sell well
rising sun is a horrid game and is considered a letdown even to most medal of honor fans
rising sun does absolutely nothing new with a series that had already been around for years upon years
at the point of rising sun medal of honor was already considered an established series for sonyanyway when it comes down to it medal of honors rising sun game is a disappointment on all levels
the gameplay is linear and is often totally ridiculous and the story is wellnothing new eitheronly pick up rising sun if you want yet another horrid first person shooter with nothing special in itthis game is awful
very bad graphics by a first person shooter
ugly bland enviroments with bad atmosphere
seems they went bachward from the first one
they now added a multiplayer mode witch is essential to a good fps tobady is sucks
i never understood what was going on and it is easy to get lost in the jugle witch all looks the same to me
get red faction  instead
didt live up to the standard as the first one and is a huge disappointmentstinks
buy quotxiiiquot and you wont be disappointed
thats all the advice i can givequotxiiiquot is most quotunderquot rated game of yeari am so disgusted with this game that i refuse to even see it to the endwhat a waste of 
if you have this game do yourself a favor and trade it in asap
get yourself a real game
i will not even bother commenting on the game play cuz i think most of the guys here did a great job of describing it
just do yourself a favour and let that godforsaken game collect dust on the shelf
the creators of this game should be ashamed of themselvesmedal of honor rising sun was a huge disappointment
first of all the graphics are horrible for a fps of its time
the graphics are actually worse than frontlines
not only do the graphics suck but so does the ai and the gameplaythe game was extremely linear
you are confined to only one direct approach for every mission run down the only and most obvious path and frag every mentallychallenged jap in your way
think of this game as playing the first mario bros except mario is replaced by a gi with a gun
and goombas are japs
this game is for singleminded people who enjoy playing games which have no depth whatsoeverthe ai of this game is horrible
for example one time i left gunny behind and he crossed paths with a japanese soldier while trying to catch up with me
the japanese soldier stabbed him with a bayonet about  times but gunny didnt care because he was so intent on getting to where i was
he just kept trying to run throught the jap while he was getting stabbed
gunny never died eitheranother thing that irkes me is that ea made every single enemy have the same death animation
the guy that you clubbed with your pistol dies in the exact same fashion as the guy who recieved a direct hit from a bazooka or hand grenadei could go on an on about how bad this game is but that would take a year at least
first person shooters are getting quite advanced these days and rising sun just does not live up to the standards of other fps like halo or even the first halflifeto sum it up rising sun is a low budget linear boring game with no replay value
i feel bad for my uncle for going out and spending his time and money to get me this game for christmas
any person with an iq of  could beat this game within a dayweek upon week i traveled up to the local video store hoping  to get the new moh and onee day its there so i put it in the ps and its kind of like the terminator kill kill sometimes have a hard mission the ai sucks the japs do nothing there accuracy is horrible even on the hard difficulty level the extremely anticlimactic ending
way to easy i beat it in  day and took it back no replayability
back to its to easy way to easy soooo many surgical packs and medicine cantines even a  year oild could beat this gametake my advice dont even rent this gamefind a friend who has it and borrow it i dont think theyll care its so badi bought this when it was first released for the ps
i had high expectations due to its predecessor medal of honor frontline
this game was a huge disappointment to say the least
you start out sleeping in a bunk below deck on a naval ship in pearl harbor
the japanese attack and you need to get to the top of the ship and fight them off while you escape
so the beginning of this game is not too bad and i was mildly interested in the gameplay
then things went downhill
i can sum it up with one sentence  before i knew what was happening i was done with the game
yes that is right  this game is so short it is not even worth the  price tag
i beat it in about  hours and that includes taking bathroom breaks and eating mealssummary out of graphics controls story  gameplay overall  if you want a good military shooter try return to castle wolfenstein or medal of honor frontline
medal of honor rising sun is not worth the time it takes to get the shrinkwrap offthis game is terribly pure and simple
first the graphics are poor the players looked distorted with overally large heads and feet
second the game play and controls are poor with the game handling nothing like real college basketball and poor button placements
finally reality
they cant even get stadiums correct on the inside
they dont look anything like what they are supposed to be
save your money if you really want a good college basketball game get espn college hoops you wont be dissappointedi hate this game
it drives me nuts
i bought the first  bond games and i was very surprised with all the gadgets and the good graphics
but now they changed over to third person
this is the worst thing they could ever do
i hate this game
the multiplayer has something messed up with it and the lock on target thing sucks
cuz u could be like a mile away and ur gun could just automatically lock on to the player
its very unrealistic
so never buy this game it is horriblemy god its amazing how overrated some games can besupposedly the best bond game and i love bond i love fps action games surely i would love this game right
wrongthings start off looking fun oh a nice little tutorial to teach you cool moves
cool weapons
but things immediately reveal themselves to be terrible
you repel down a wall  then you have about  guys shooting at you from all sides
but uh oh their bullets are apparently much stronger than yours
and theres no health to be found anywhere
wait youre telling me bond packed all these incredible technological tools in his backpack and he doesnt bring any med kits
jesus christ you must be joking
that wouldnt be a problem if surviving wasnt nearly impossible
and remember this is just the first part
you have more parts to complete after this while trying to stay aliveok so lets say youre a wonderful gamer and you do survive
so what
the shooting action is boring boring boring boring boring boring boring
press a button to auto aim your enemy
pull the trigger
thats it
no aiming at all
just pushing a button
wow
this is what games have become
give me a break
ive played great fps games on pc like call of duty and halflife  and this doesnt cut it at all
besides who decided that bond is supposed to be some superman with a pistol anyway
isnt he supposed to be more of a spy than ramboi know for a fact that i check pc when i went on amazon to track my purchase there i see that the game is a playstation no pci havent played this game but i know from experience i have  that this probably sucks
let me take a guess and say that yao ming and lebron james arent even in the game
as far as the dynasty mode goes you realize that the averages per  minutes are completly out of whack such as when i played tyson chandler for  minutes a game and he still had only  rebounds a game when simulatingthe same average for when he played  minutes a game
he should be averaging at least   the rookies provide stats that are less than encouraging nen had  points and  boards per game in  minutes
also where are the foreign players to be found in the rookie draft they make up practically half of the first round
for the gameplay the only exciting teams would be sacramento and dallas yet the knicks offensive scheme is strictly runandgunthis game sucks
u can not score at all
if u try to go inside alls u get is a charge or a miss besides the new dunk button sucks u can never dunk it even if your  inchins away from the basket
wat im trying to say is  get espni was scratching my head last year why ea changed the sprint control from the triangle to the r and then i played winning eleven  and it hit me
electronic arts have been playing catch up since konami came out with the proevolutionwinning eleven series
what amazes me is that there are still people giving good reviews to the fifa series
just a word of advice pick up a baseball bat and stop kidding yourselves
whats wrong with  you ask
everything
this is not futbol futebol soccer calcio or anything remotely near it
i learned my lesson after buying fifa  without even playing it first
this year i rented  and i returned it the same day
the fifa series is a bad cancer for futbol
it alters the perception of the public of what the game is truly about just so it can be marketable in the us
just like when fifa tried to incorporate the timeout just so they can fit in those  minute commercial spots
can you even imagine they experimented with it in brazil
well im through experimenting with the fifa series form ea
i just hope somebody from ea reads this review and comments it on their next creative meeting
where did we go wrong
they would ask themselves
simple you never listened to your customerswhat they produce its not soccer
 i bought fifa  just for the online play another disappointment the online gameplay but just like others fifas games a complete dissapoint
its seems like your game its a merge of soccer and nfl not soccer at all
everyone who played real soccer at least once in its life could tell you that fifa series its not soccer or its what ea team think soccer its or should be but not way of play
fifa have good grafics but you dont feel the emotion of the soccer seen graphics soccer its passion not graphics and tactics of nfl games
i wont purchase any fifa game ever
see what winning eleven  or  does or word tour soccer  does whith the gameplaybeing a huge fan of xsn golf for xbox i decided to try tiger woods game because of all the rave reviews ive heard
i was so disappointed
the controls are rather difficult and hard to master
tiger woods pga tour  is not that much different from last years tiger
the analog swing is unchanged letting you control the power and direction of your shot with a backandforward motion on the analog stickone of the big new additions to tiger woods  is the quotgame facequot feature that allows you to create your own pro golfer with a rather painstaking level of detail
this player creation mode lets you define virtually every aspect of your players appearance
for some idea as to how extensive it is there are  different attributes that can be modified in terms of facial structure alone not including facial hair eye color skin tone and what your golfers teeth might look like
truly the level of character customization offered by the game face feature is unparalleledthe only nagging issue with the tiger woods games that ea has yet to address seriously is the games soundtrack
for the past two years ea has been assembling seemingly random collections of contemporary licensed songs and calling them soundtracksobviously released prematurely for xmas this game has more bugs and glitches than any game ive ever even heard of
the patch does nothing to fix any problems and when asked the developers on the eidos website give answers that are borderline rude
a definite slap in the face to all gamers
it breaks my heart to think about how many kids unwrapped this xmas morning to find that their game doesnt work because the eidos quarterly report might have suffered had they put a few more weeks into this pseudo softwareas a storyteller i was eager to play this game for the wide possinilities of scenarios
as a game i was very disappointed
first of all i wasnt able to move the pointer to select anyoptions
only in game play was i able to move my character
secondly instead of just collecting ammo i was forced to pick up the same weapon multiple times which used up the space of my tool belt
if one gun ran out of ammo then every gun was out of ammo
that was just a waste of space
i also felt limited by the small selection of tools
not even the cheat codes would entirely work
for example the unlimited ammo only gave me a few extra clips
the guns themselves were not even very good
the sniper rifle didnt snipe
the clips were very small in the ammo capacity and the shots were very weak
i should have bought halo when i had the chanceif you think youve got a nice relatively new computer therefore you should be able to play deus ex
be careful and read the video card support list very carefully
i have a dell dimension  ghz machine with a geforce mx video card
deus ex will not play on this video card
your card must have pixel shader  capability to run
i bought the game and it will not work on my machine
i fell into this trap because i didnt know what the exact video card in my machine was
i assumed that because it was relatively new and not bottom of the line it would run pretty much any game out there
live and learn
dont make the same mistake as i didim rather discusted with the deus ex creators
ive been eagerly waiting for this game and now i cant play it
they didnt even give me the option of defeating pixel shading
so what if it wouldnt look as nice at least i would be able to play itoh well the reviews i have read say it was a real disappointment anyway
im just glad i didnt run out and buy it for  when it was first released
i only got stuck for i guess this game will sit on my shelf until i upgrade my system in a few years
hopefully it will be compatable with the system i buy thenthe graphics in this game arent all that much of an improvement but the game is incredibly choppy
did eidos use the ut enging
i doubt it
im saving up to buy the geforce fx  ultra so deus ex  had better not be choppy at all
ive got a fast pc with a gig of pc ram so when i buy and install the  ultra id better see  fps or more or there is something seriously wrong with this games enginei really liked the first deus ex game and so it hurts me to have this say this but deus ex invisible war is one of the worst games ive played and one of the biggest computer game disapointments ever
it almost seems that the designers intentionally removed all of the good stuff from the first gamefirst there is the way the game looks
i am not talking here about performance issues
i have a new computer with a xt graphics card and  gb ram and the game runs smoothly on my machine
the problem is that it just does not look very good
when you consider some of the amazing graphics that have been done in computer games in the last couple of years splinter cell for example or even in budget titles like devastation it is hard for me to understand why this game looks so bad
maybe part of it is the the artwork and design the character animations look like weird cartoon figures
also the game areas are too small
forget about the big sprawling environments in dx
here you will be constantly waiting for the next little area to loadforget about the muchhyped physics dead bodies flop around in a ridiculous way and bumping into objects sends them spinning through space like babe ruth hitting one out of the parkthe skill system which made dx and its predecessor system shock so awesome are gone
why
the ability to customize your character and evolve through the course of the game was one of the most satisfying parts
youve probably already heard about the universal ammo thing another serious design mistake imo
the game is also quite short and seems much shorter than the original
also without the various skill paths through the game there is little replayabilitybasically this is a textbook case of how to ruin a game sequelthis is a warning to people who have not bought this gameit does not support any of the nvidia mx vidio cardsthis game is terrible in every way possible
the graphics actually take a step backward from the first deus ex
the rpg element that was so great in the first game was hacked into pieces for this game making it nearly unplayable
the plot is perhaps one of the worst i have ever encountered
the maps are small which means very little exploringoverall this game is not worth the box it comes in
i am very disappointed that eidos would slap together a game like this and unleash it on the public
shame on you eidos
we know you are capable of so much moredeus ex invisible war  terrible  buy deus ex game of the year editionthis game was made for the console only all the great things about the first one have been taken out from the skill sets ammo reloading the inventory
everything has been super simplified so now its a fps not an action rpg
also your looking about around  hours of gameplay
the most revolutionary thing they did in this game was put in the console market nowing it it is going to sell well becuase it has a great name
forgot to mention a very weak ai and no head shots or body specific damage like the first one
they should of named it diet deus exi bought this game like day or or  after the fay it came out and i was all exited when i was installing it had this little game of some sort to entertain you will it installs the  discs but when i was done installing it it said failed to find directx c compatible graphics adapters in this system
please make sure you have directx c compatible graphics adapter and have installed the latest drivers by the manufacturer
the application will now terminate
i was shocked because i was waiting a long time to play this game and i have not played it on my computer because of this errori suggest that you do not buy this game unless you have a new computer or all upgraded things on your computer for this lame boring annoying game
i hope no one is dumb enough to pay that price
the sims  is just as boring stupid pointless and annoying as the first one
lets simulate going to work raising a family eating using the bathroom wow what a game
i play games to get away from reality for a few hours not to simulate itmy god go and cook your dinner pay your bills go to work and have some kidsyou just played sims
lamethis game does not work despite the patches and tech support
it will always crash at random times during game play
also if you do get it to work it is so slow that you decide that you dont really want to play anymore
id give it a higher rating if it actually workedi am going to keep it simple i am crying right nowthis game is too short
do not waste you it took me and my roommate  hrs to beat
 my money wastedim sorry for saying this but this game is not worth a second lookme and my father love the moh series but we beat it in  hours
it is very unchallenging and a waist of money
now that you can buy this game for  dollars i think its worth it
if your spending anything over  dollars dont consider buying this game
a complete putdown to moh loverthe graphics are no good and its bugged
it takes  sniper rounds to kill  enemy rediculous
also u can shoot the enemy in the head and he will flinch pi know cause im acually done beating iti dont recommend this game to anythis game would take about about an hour to play if the controls and weapons were at all responsive
some of the environments look pretty put the enemy fighters are straight out of a windows  first person shooterpeople complain about suppossed racism in the gta series but our group of racially mixed gamers found the asian enemies in rising sun to be offensive stereotypes beyond anything in vice city
unlike vice city which is violent with an obvious tongue in cheek sarcasm this game wraps its racial violence with themes of patriotism making rising sun truly disturbingjames bond  everything or nothing is one of the worst games i ever played
the third person is really annoying because you lock on to the targets you dont want to
some of the missions are pointless like the one where you jump off a building and you have to dodge things while you fall
you cant even shoot anything in that mission
dont buy this gameis it just me or is that the  games have just been getting worse and worse since goldeneye
in fact with the latest addition to the bond franchise everything or nothing you could actually say that everything about it is nothing
this game is just plain dumb
i thought when i just had herd about this game oh great
a thirdperson bond game
i was highly mistaken
this game has terrible gameplay terrible controls and terrible cutscenes
bond fans gamers or not will be highly dissappointed with this game because it has nothing compared to agent under fire and goldeneye
this games predecessor nightfire sucked equilly as much and if they make another bond game after this it will flop so badly that the entire franchise will go out the window
people tell me that its my opinion but theyrre wrong
this is the opinion
this game is a waste of time and money
do not buy itthis is the worst bond game ever and possibly the worst game ever
it is not a game its a movie
here are the reasons it sucksea went with the trend and went rd person
this disallows for any entertaining gameplay at all because you cannot sidestepthe cooperative multiplayer is a completely different story than the single player and all of the characters you start with are generic pplthe cooperative mode is unbelievably hard
it is like trying to shove a rhino in a soda can
it is not entertaining and is the most frustrating thing ive ever playedyou must beat the first level which consists of about  cansecutive levels of cooperative to unlock arena modei have repeatedly completed every goal to get a platinum medal on one mission but the game refuses to award it to methe only good things about this game are the driving levels but they soon become repetitive and boringpierce brosnans scrip is worse than that of dyanasty warriors  after having a discussion with q about metal q suggests he leave
bond says platinum idea q lets test diavolos mettle
the line bond james bond is repeated at least  times and it is not dilivered welli know its a little sexist but the girls are ugly as hellthe game is basically a remixed retextured enter the matrix only with worse handtohand combat and no focus abilitythe only reasons to play this game are to see john cleese as q and willem dafoe as diavolo  letters away from the spanish word for devili know i havent played the game yet but if it is like its prequel and other extreme sports games like tony hawk and dave mirra this game will be rubbishspawn armageddon is hack and slash game played in the third person perspective
similar to devil may cry you use combo moves and slash at demonic creatures with your swordshield
you can also collect and purchase weapons like guns and magic spells
when you kill demonic creatures you can collect their souls and add to your magic or energy level
the main problem with this game are the bland level designs repetitious action and bad camera anglesprosgood attack comboslots of abilitiesgood controlsconsboring level designbad camera anglescheap graphicsrepetativeweak sound fxjunk heavy metal musicgame has a generic feelthis game is not worth buying because it just looks and feels so cheap and generici really like corvettes because not only is it cool that chevy the typically cheapest part of gm makes the best sports car but their valuedriven performance low repair costs and respectable fuel economy make them a great buy
and of course the corvette is an american iconso when i saw this game i was excited
fifty years of corvettes
sweeti was so wrongyes this game contains  years of corvettes
thats about all it delivered
if you can deal with the laggy framerate and middlin graphics youll notice that the cars in the game have about a  second delay in responding to your controller inputs and when they do respond they do so in a floaty and generic manner that is the same for almost all the cars in the game regardless of generation or yearadd some decent tracks that dont particularly add much to the game the fact that there is no car damage no police chases to speak of which most arcadestyle driving games have and some completely irrelevant upgrades and youve got a recipe for a really lousy game whose fun level is on par with oral surgerydont waste your money with this shameful attempt to cash in on the corvette name
buy a decent racing simulator gran turismo or arcade game nfs that at least contains a few corvettes and doesnt utterly suckthis game is truly awful
it is without a doubt the worst racing game i have ever played
racing games i played on my old sega genesis were better than this boring stupid game
the cars look ok but theyre not half as good as the ones in quotgran turismo quot
theyre just not fun to race
you can only race certain cars on certain tracks and that just plain stinks
even the opening movie is boring
two vettes endlessly racing down the highway for what seems an eternitytake my advice and stay clear of this game
there are better racing titles out there like quotburnoutquot quotneed for speed undergroundquot quotmidnight club quot quotgran turismo quot and even quotford racing quot
try one of them but forget this game
it is terrible
george bauchid like to give this game a good review but unless you read the fine print you may be as dissapointed as i was to discover that it doesnt work on lcd televisions
it also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television setsspawn armageddons storyline goes like this a group of renegade angels have launched a massive weapon straight into the depths of hell in an attempt to destroy it
unfortunately the side effect of this weapon strike is that hells minions now have an easy exit to the earths surface
in addition to that is an escaped experimental supersoldier developed by spawns primary earthly adversary jason wynnnow that you know what the game is about you can know how bad it isfirst off you have an extremely lackluster fighting system
press punch once and youll swing spawns axe
press it twice and it does a different one swing attack
press it three times and you get  combo
so basically it goes  uppercut slash  a forward flip attack and  a jumping axe slam attack
how exciting is that
theres also a one swoop jump attack but you will only need this in special cases and even then it becomes repetativesecond the guns are pretty useless when it comes down to it
im curious why no one in the production team thought to ask why have guns if you cant find enough ammo to use them adequatelyif the game has any saving grace i would have to say it lies in both your chain attacks and the special moves as they are fairly interesting
the chain attacks are by far the best thing this game has going for it
you can either use them to simply pummel your foes back to the underworld or you can send them there in pieces literally splitting them to the four windsthe special moves are called quothell attacksquot and there is a meter to regulate how much you can abuse it because lets face it you will
most of them are various projectile attacks but the most useful ones would be the timedilation effect and the furies from hellthe timedialtion basically gives you the ability to move faster than everyone else or slow everyone down depending on how you look at itas for the furies spawn has the ability to summon a group of spirits from hell to attack an intented victim
a very satisfying move indeedthe absolute worst part of this game are the jump puzzles
who puts jump puzzles in a superhero game
it defies all reason
you will need to use your cape and chain power to pull off these ridiculous yet necessary excersizesdont expect good music either
this game has the most dreariest hum tones ive ever heard
theres simply no life to itfinally if you want a repetative poor excuse for a superhero game or are just a diehard spawn fan then this is the game for youyou cant even do  the  or west coast with rey mysterio
you do angleslam off the turnbuckle
what is revenge mode with throwing police officers around and without any wrestling
here comes the pain is awsome
it even has a first blood match and elimination chamber
raw  is better then wreslemania
at least raw  has a real season mode and not a stupid revenge mode
so wreslemania is the worst wrestling game everrevenge mode prevents wwe wrestlemainia xix from being a great gameif you own a gamecube get this to play as u wait for day of reckoningthis game was terrible the worst game i ever played
the graphics was bootleg the storymode was garbage the character design was ugh
this was a bad game bad meaning it was garbage they did a number on this game this game was a pieace of trashany dbz product is bound to get a lot of attention
i could place a dbz sticker on a pile of crapliterally and sell it for  bucks
the dbz audience is primarily younger kids though so they are bound to review this game with  stars no matter whatthe graphics are choppy
characters leave fuzzy trails which will hurt your eyes
every character has the same moves
of course everyone will give this game  stars because their favorite character is in it
the problem though is that all the characters are the same
it is unrealistic when brolly cant take down cell
as for the fighting it is all the same
they have special moves but they take  hours to pull off
it hurts my hands
on top of that basically i could memorize the dictionary before i memorize gokus kamehamehaof course the game will get  stars
its dbz so it is bound to get top scores from  year olds
the truth is that this game is bad
it is a terrible game and a waste of money
dont let these  year olds tell you differently because the game contains their favorite character
it is badwith the exception of budokai dragon ball z games often fare poorly
dbz taiketsu sadly joins their dismal ranks
if nothing else taiketsu succeeds somewhat in capturing the simple visual charm of the show
the large characters look clear and visible on the tiny gba screen but overall they cant compete with the superior graphics of gba champions mkda and street fighter and taiketsus herkyjerky animation is also particularly distracting
to save battery juice go ahead and mute the muffled background music and scratchy sound effectssince the game lacks character voices you wont miss anything important
taiketsus buttonmashing gameplay is shallow and simplistic even for a kids fighting title
there are  characters total including favorites from both the series like cell and goku and the movies including the popular brolly
aside from the occasional supermove each character boasts only a meager handful of attacks and combos
worse theres very little difference between the various fighters
players can also occasionally take to the skies during combat but that gimmick burns out quickly
on the plus side the game thoughtfully includes several play modes like tournament and endurance to help extend the replay value unfortunately none of the game types are interesting or particularly enjoyable
another nice touch is the soul caliburesque secret system which allows players to earn z points to unlock bonus modes settings and pictures
overall unless youre an eightyearold dbz fanatic youll find that this saiyan is hardly superwhen i first saw dis game i thought it would be cool but this game sucksgraphics are terrible fighting stylesvery lame and weapons dissapear after u strike ur apponent with itif i hit an enemy with a bati sure as hell wouldnt want it to dissapeari know some people love it but i really dontfirst off any game with  levels has got to be some kind of joke
how can such a thing be possible without becoming a mindnumbing repetitive grind
answer it cannotnot that you have to get that high but my point is if you think that many levels is some kind of good thing you and i have nothing in common and you might as well stop reading right nowthis is actually one of the very few games ive ever traded in
i just couldnt see myself ever inserting the disc again after the first few days
the gameplay is silly the story is silly the voice acting is  well its actually decent
but i dont buy games for the voice acting alonethe innovative liftandthrow feature is interesting the first couple of times but once you learn how to exploit it all the time it becomes more of a chore like something youre being forced to do instead of something fun
same with the ludicrous geocolornonsense
yes you can kill everything on the screen with it but how is that engaging or immersive
to me it just makes everything ridiculously simple and it gets old fastand the bit about leveling up items
ugh
seriously i cannot be bothered
not funif you like rpgs that have a good story punctuated with truly strategic battles that actually make you think if you are looking for a challenge and accept that you might actually lose a tough battle or if you care at all about rules that make some kind of realistic sense do not buy this gameif on the other hand you like to powerlevel your dudes and easily pwn everything on the map in every fight with the same repetitive set of strategies and if you think unsubtle sexual innuendo and jokes about bodily functions are the height of humor this game is totally for youworst ps game typething ever
first of all the games that they supply which is all that u can get are the biggest load of crud that i have ever seen
also the resolution and gameplay of it is the worst than i have seen
quotlets go play watch the rock erode in the riverquot is like new years in madison square garden compared to thisplease dont buy this for the sanity and sacredness of mankindi ended up returning the headset because the earpiece did not work
we used the headset with the karaoke revolution game and the microphone worked but no sound came out of the earpiece
after contacting the company i found out that you would only be able to hear your own voice through the earpiece without the music so instead of exchanging it i purchased another hand held microphonei bout this to talk to people rightso i wouldnt have to type everythingbut i had this product for about a month and it doesnt work anymore i can hear people but they cant hear me so i took it apart and the wires are the thinest ive ever seen in my life and just moving the mic peice around pretty much makes them break ive been through  of these and they both stoped working the same waydont buy this headseti am so disappointed not only on virtua fighter  but now even on this piece of waste
the graphics have improved alot but tekken  still has graphics far beyond better than thos gamewhy does it take time to get off the ground
the game should have fast gameplay to get right off the groundit as a mistake to make this game
i think now virtua fighter  will be even worse because sega may be running out of ideas
with everything sega used to make this game they should have saved for virtua fighter graphics are above average but this game didnt grab my attention like gilty gear x
it seems so normal and the fighting is just awful compared to gilty gear x
get that instead
i hate fighting games with no weapons and this is no different
after playing it i wondered why it got such great reviews
it just bad
the fighting seams robotic and slowyou play as a voodoo doll named quotvoodoo vincequot your mission is to rescue the vodoo priestess who got kidnapped she is your owner
as a voodoo doll you have power to inflict injury to your enemies by first causing injury to yourself of course
you can perform special voodoo attacks when you collect enough magic orbs from defeated enemies
its just a standard platformer game once you get past the novelty
you can do your basic spin attack jumps grabbing onto ledges and floating
the graphics are nice and have a deformed look to it adding to the wacky atmosphere of the game
the sound effects and music were good but very repetative
the controls were okay
the game gets difficult fast and will give younger players a hard time
since younger players are the target audience i think it was a mistake to make the game this hard
the game is also very short and very linearprosgood graphicsgood controlsvoodoo doll powersfunnyconsvery difficult gameplayweak sound effectsrepetative musicvery short gamelinear gameplaydifficult puzzlesnothing innovatingdark looking levelsawkward camerathere are lots of better platformer games out there
voodoo vince is not one of themthis game is terrible
the game doesnt give you any idea of where the ball is going which results inhaving no idea where serves are going to gonever knowing whether or not the ball will be outhaving no idea where to go when the player lobs itthis was the most frustrating unfun videogame i have ever played in my life
stay away from it completelywost game i have ever played for xbox by far
lucky for me i didnt drop  bucks on this game i rented it
dont even bother doing that
the game play is awful the graphics suck the sound is annoying and the playbook is 
avoid this game if you must play online get the espn game much betteri must say that this is one of the worst games i have played since outpost
the manual is utterly useless
it has hardly any solid information about the controls or flow of the game
the controls are nonintuitive and sluggish
the game play is very poor and kluggy
this game is so bad i thought there must be a patch for it
but i was wrong
i am playing this on a p ht with a gb of ram and a gforce video card
unless you enjoy disappointment avoid this game at all costwant a game so bad it will give you nightmares
so bad your eyes will bleed
so bad youll swear your gba is possessed by a demon
well this is that game
now listen i like yu yu hakusho i think its a great story and a spectacular tv series
but this game stinks
lets begin by talking about the graphics
the people look like they escaped from an old atari  game
the enviroments look decent at first then you realize that all the places look exactly the same
i must have gone by this couch twenty times
and then theres the audio
the music is painful to say the least
but the music isnt nearly as bad as the actual gameplay
youre basically fighting or playing stupid minigames like finding someones homework
most minigames will just involve following your compass from location to location
then you get to the fighting
this is the stupidest part of the game
first of all everyone wants to get you
demons school children old ladies everyone
and they arent exactly geniuses either
the fighting isnt deep or involving
basically just mash the b button and youll be fine
so the game isnt fun at all
if your a die hard yu yu hakusho fan you probably already have a copy
as for everyone else you might want to play a game that doesnt suck so muchsince it is a game based off of a popular anime i thought it would have been a pretty good game
but i was wrong
this is probably one of the worst games i have ever played if the the worst ever
i returned the game to gamestop as soon as i was able toas i bought this case for some reason i thought it would be able to hold my gba sp safely and maybe a game or two extra
yes it holds the gba sp but nothing else
getting a game out of the miniscule pouch is an exercise in pure masochism
a much better idea is to buy a small case for the older gba and then use that
the extra space intended for the older system will allow you to put in more games and your sp
buying this is like putting your gba in a tight pocket in your jeans
you know its there and safe but god help you if you can get it out of gamers will only see the first  of this game for there is a respawning never ending battle level that simply cannot be won im not kidding
i am a relatively advanced gamer and i have to say that this battle system is amongst the worst i have ever tried to play
it results in an unplayable game that will stop you  of the way through it
what a rip off
no kidding no cheats nothing you can do but try and try again ultimately failing
i even brought in other advanced games who all looked at me like i was crazy for suggesting they try to beat this battle it is so ill conceived
simply the worst game out there masking under the veil of nice graphics  too bad since they are gorgous from what i saw of them
when are these game developers going to realize that  of gamers out there wont deal with quality this poor
i cannot beleive anyone has ever gotten past this level its that hard and rediculously stacked in the favor of the game
dont waste your time unless you want to play  of a game only to hit a massive brick wall
shame on ubisoft for allowing this garbage out on store shelvesi hate this fricking game
time and time again i screamed obscenities at the screen throwing my controller down
the game is just series of jumping off ledges falling and trying again
the battles feel like your running through mollasses
the most annoying game ive ever played
just fancy graphics on top of a game you get free on your cellphonethere are somethings ill never understand
basic geometry how michael bolton became successfuland how a great and iconic character like batman can never have a decent video game
the first batgame for playstation  vengence had its moments
though it wasnt great it at least felt like a batman game
batman dark tomorrow was an outright disaster
and now it looks like batman rise of sin tzu continues the downward slide for the dark knightrise of sin tzus biggest downfall is its gameplay
where as vengence attempted to be more of an adventure oriented game rise of sin tzu takes an entirely different approach
its pretty much a straight forward beat em up game
but unfortunatley it doesnt know how to keep you interested in it to make you keep wanting to play
the game descends into punching and kicking your way past various nondescript bad guys and the occassional gas bomb lobbed in to the fray by the villain the scarecrow
two players can play in a cooperative mode simultaneously but it does little to change the gameplay
the game is interesting for about ten minutes then boredom quickley sets in
after the first few levels i could see that there was pretty much nothing else this game had to offerthe graphics on this game are decent
batman robin batgirl and nightwing all move with convincing ease and fluidity
but the environments are rather plain and sterile
they look like they could be just about any street anywhere
there was nothing to indicate that this was gotham city
it could have been cleveland for i knew
the sound was also very generic
sure batman and company uttered some pretty good one liners but it got old fastthe controls are very easy to manage
they are however wasted on a game like this
the time it will take you to become accustomed to the controls is maybe about five to ten minutesthis game managed to let me down on just about every level
im not even sure if a hardcore batfan would even enjoy it
ubi soft has shamelessly squandered the potential for this licence
at this point the only thing that i think would inject new life into the franchise is if the game license changed hands and went to a company like activision electronic arts eidos or anyone else
if you can track down a copy of batman vengence you would be better served playing that
though not perfect its the better of the two batman gamesi am  hours into this game and was very close to finishing
i enjoyed it a lot up to this point
but i cannot recommend this game to anyone and i can only hope to steer clear any that try and buy this
after completing the slaughterhouse i went back to iris hq
funny thing is i was able to walk through double hh which i thought was odd because he was usually in the way
well thats the last i saw of him
he never appeared again so i cant finish the gamewhatever you do do not buy this game
the elevator battle towards the end of the game is the most poorly designed aspect in recent memory
after more than  tries i just couldnt beat it
whenever that happens you know that a game is fatally flawedlets break it down shall we
you encounter this elevator battle about  into the game and youre stuck in it with farah trying to slay hordes of monsters
you not only have to stay alive yourself but you also have to make sure that farah doesnt die an impossible feat
if you dont die she does and if she doesnt die you eventually do
its a loselose situation especially within the confines of such small a spacethere are fountains on either side of the raised area within the elevator but do you think you can use them to restore your life during the battle
no
thats flaw number one
number two  the camera angles are awful
every single time at some points in the battle the camera would move behind a curtain thereby obstructing your view and leaving you open to needless attack
three  this game has horrible jumping mechanics
where you want the prince to jump he jumps the other way
performing precise wallrun attacks during this battle is near impossible to execute on point each time
then vaulting over enemies doesnt work all the time either
because of these facts this game is poorly designed and fatally flaweddo not buythis is horrible
horrible horrible horrible
the controls are tedious
the camera could not be worse
the game is touchy
i could not say stay away enough
i know many found this game fun but i have been video gaming for over  years now and i say this is one of the worstthis game is way over rated
camera problems fighting control problems and hyped up way too much
after reading reviews i expected the best game ever and now i feel robbed
honestly i had more fun actually way more fun on the gameboy advance version
with this title hope for the best  expect the worstbeing a starsky and hutch fan since i was a kid i was looking forward to playing this
the graphics are quotcartoonquot horrible and the need for quotvrquot points becomes annoying after awhile
the bad guys are like something from a chinese kung fu movie you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill themand thats with playing with a ps gun i cant imagine shooting with a controller which makes you lose the mission because you are down on quotvrquot points
the dialog gets annoying too and you cant skip hearing it eitherthis game is just bad all aroundbad gameplaybad graphicsbad storylinebad voice actingjust bad
it really does suck
hands downthe worst ps game i have ever playedthis is the worst game anybody could play
the games graphics were horriblemight as well give em to psgeez
the gameplay was crap so fun driving an old car that goes like  mph just to drop somebody off
the thing that really pisses me off is that the cover of it makes it look to good
really i mean you wanana have a good shootingmafia time but you cant when your driving your grandmas car the whole time i reccomend you not renting or buying this game its just not worth your timeunless your new at games and yer italian then wellwhatevri would give this a  rating but i cant cuz amazon wont let me lolpigs cows and women oh mythis game is really bad and hard
you start as a rancher but making money is very hard you have to marry raise kids like in real life but its not as it sounds its boringcause you have to do everything all the time
bottom line dont buy it if you havent played the other onesthis product didnt work at all
this is the third one i bought
dont buy used
i am not mad
its just that it doesnt workgame doesnt work
light scratches my butt
so yeah sucks for me i guess
at least i can use the game as a coasteronly die hard yugioh fans could possibly find a slim bit of enjoyment in this gameit amazes me it is listed as third over all in amazons top seller list cause that tells me many are flocking in like sheep to waste their money on this gamethere are at least  games i would want to own before i even considered this titleheck id rather dust off the old n or even super nes and play some of those games before i put any time into this onethe graphics are very last generation would only call the graphics quotokquot even if it was on the playstatin  the game is not very funnot much depth herenot much styleif it wasnt a yugioh title and had made up characters and the same gameplayeveryone would be trading this one in at a used game store fasti guess there are a few people out there who think its a cool game cause they say quotwow i know that character and that one to from yugiohquot thats about the only thing positive youll get out of the gamerecognizing the charactersend of positive things to say about the gameif my opinion isnt enoughmake sure you check out ign and gamepro reviews on this game before you go throwing away your money on this game for some kids birthday or christmas giftmost kids will be let down and having other titles in mind they wish you had gotten them instead if they open this as a christmas giftprince of persiabeyond good and evilsphynx and the mummymetal armsglitch in the systemand mario kart are just a few examples of games that should be under your tree this year for your kids way before you ever consider this poor attempt at a yugioh gameif you are stubborn and want to take a chance on this game at least rent it first so you dont foolishly throw away your money without seeing for yourself how lacking in fun this title isthis game just clings on to the title of yugiohit is like pokemon stadium only with an actual storylinego pick up the uncut ygo dvds import the dvds or play one of the ygo gba rpgs but avoid this gamelets face it  twin snakes blows
anyone who says its good is totally lying to themselves or has not played the original mgs for psa majority of the cutscenes were unnecessary and really stupid
snake does some superhuman moves that just ridiculous  this isnt the matrix or some steven seagal moviei purchased mgs for gamecube and wish i hadnt
if you removed the laboriously long cut scenes theres actually very little game here
i get the impression hideo wanted to make a film but could only get a job directing a video game and decided to make a film anywaythe controls and camera are very cumbersome and the bad guys always see you before you can see them
the weapons are very standard  no imagination there
i would have given the game three stars if not for two ridiculous features ive found that totally spoil it
i think hideo has a crappy sense of humorfirst theres a spot early in the game where one of the characters tells you to use a radio frequency on the back of the package
i went through the whole game again trying to find the package he was refering to
it turns out hes refering to the package the game came in
talk about less than total immersionsecond was one of the bosses who can only be hurt if you use controller three
what the  it this one star and im being generous
if i ever see hideos name on another video game im going to run a milethe first time i ordered this i didnt get the greatest hits version and the game played horriblyby horrible i mean it would get stuck on load times and the loading icon would turn red as a sign that basically it wasnt gonna load no matter how long i waited
i thought this was a problem with my playstation  but to my surprise this has happened to many people with the first version of the game
i did not enjoy this and ended up buying a second copy but the greatest hits kind off of ebay
this copy worked fine and i havent had a problem since
do not buy the regular version of this game buy the greatest hits version which is red at the top and says greatest hitsaside from the discthis game for playstation  has amazing graphics and a really wide selection of cars
its pretty awesome and also cool using a driving wheel
id recommend this gamei was so looking forward to this game and now that i finally got to play it it is a huge disapointment
sure there are some minor improvements over gt but they certainly arent worthy of all the development time that went into this gamethose minor improvments are  better graphics improved physics engine so they claim more race tracks slightly better car selection a few more american cars now but still none of the top racing brands and way too many obscure japanese cars that no body cares to use anyway
sure there are  cars but most of them are just cheap filler like  versions of the same car
most of the added features are just cheap gimmicks like taking pictures of your cars who cares
the biggest thing thats missing is online play
what happened
they promised online play for gt and its not here
with out this major feature there really isnt much reason to buy this game
now well all just have to wait and hope that forza motorsport for xbox which will have online play will be able to deliver on what gt didnt
save yourself  hard earned dollars and spend  on gt instead and if you already own gt dont waste  on this minor updatejust as a disclaimer my standards are very low when it comes to racing games
so when i say this game sucks i mean most normal gamers will think this game sucksi loved gt so i thought this would be an improvement
but i was wrong
this game sucks in every possible way interface sucks the graphics are worse than gt and the events are the same as gt
the license tests are embarrassing to the franchisei was hesitant to buy the game in the first place but after i saw the positive reviews on amazon  stars and  stars i thought that many people cant be wrong but i was sooo wrong
those people were either paid off to make good reviews or the sellers of the game made fake reviews to con us into buying it
either way they were wrongplease do not waste your money on this gameit is the worst driving game i ever played the cars turn on there own i tried everything to stop them from turning even when u are on a straight road they turn on there own it sucks do not buy and the license sucksmario party  is the worst out of all of them
the super duel mode is poor because the cars are slow the capsules was a dumb idea because your never sure what your going to get and they dont do anything good at all
most of the mini games are boaring and the levels are boaring also
they lost their touch
i asked my dad for it on christmas because i thought it would be better then all the other ones i played
major disappointment
if you have a gamecube get mario party  thats just my opinion thoughthis game is really bad if you like party games get pac man fever or warioware inc its boring mario party     are ok but common they are all the same exept they took out the good games for the bad ones
dont buy itits true
first of all its not as fun as mario party or  this is not good at all
youll probably want mario party amp a person would probably fell disappointed if they bought mario party  or even this
i think they will make a mario party  they dident did do a very good job with this or even mario party  or even this
they however did a good job with mario party amp ok now if this game was the very first mario party game ever then i would like it
but come on
there r already  mario party games
and they r all exactly the same
o sure there might be a few different mini games and crap but its the same exact concept
ahhhhh
im gonnna die
the only reason you should buy this game is if you have never ever played a mario party game before or if u dont have any mario party games
it would just be wasting your money if u collected all these games
and if youve never played a mario party game but wanna buy one i would say u should probably buy an older one becuase the older ones r alot cheaper and still exactly the same
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhits just another mario party game
there arent any high expectations for it
all i expect from this is a mediocre virtual board game with lousy graphics and boring sound
and thats just what mario party  is
i rate this game im not very fond of this game for manymany reasonshere are some of themstupid couseslack of modeslack of minigameslack of characterseasy compettitonthose arent even one third of my complantsi can get as far as installing it
then whenever i try to start it i get directx d errors
dont get the pc version if you have a laptop and even with a desktop make sure all your audiovideo card drivers are up to date or this game is essentially a  coaster
ive uninstalled it and am waiting for vivendi to release a patchif they ever will that is
my brother has a gamecube so i bought that version of the game and it was good
but i never could get this one to work on my laptopi dont often review games but i had to write in on this one
this game was pretty bad
soem major plot flaws
some horrible control cant control the camera on foot missions and just plain stupid elelments like quotsonic weaponsquot in space
when i came across that i just turned the game off
fortunately i rented this because i wasnt sure i like it
i loved rogue  and its one of my favorite games
i liked the idea of flying some missions with a friend but the single player version is dumb dumb dumbpeople who like this game probably also like jarjarthis disaster is the worst looking xbox title out there the game looks like a  year old pc
game
i basicly threw away  bucks on this pile
i should have read the reviews for this game as i see lots of other people think the same thing
beware of this steaming heapif your looking for a good star wars game get knights of the old republic if your looking for a action game get prince of persia
this game is not good in any way shape or formplease do not buy this game
thankyou
ok seriously onto the review
i rented this game because i was thinking about buying it so i picked my character which you could choose a boy girl alien then i am off on my adventure
immediately i noticed that the graphic are no up to par with standard x box games and that the movement was quirky
i have played games with these kind of problems if they were fun but this game also has bugs
on the first stage i went to chop down the tree and the guy would not run across the log another time i got stuck in the log and yet another time i through my sword and it didnt come back
i dont like the fact that if you stand next to a friendly character that you can kill them simply by having your light saber within touching distance of them
overall i would have to say this game could have been great but it was clearly rushed for the holiday season i hate when publishers do that thanks lucasartsthis game went wrong in a lot of ways
warlords iii reign of heroes and dark lords rising were awesome games nearly perfect in their execution
warlords battlecry ii was also in itself an incredible gamealong comes warlords iv which tries to mix the two games and fails miserably
most of the cool features from warlords iii are gone apparently in the name of simplification
while a lot of the animations and sound effects from battlecry ii are ripped off the original game and presented here in a very strippeddown wayi wanted to like this game but it is just such a departure in a bad way from the two games that it is based off of
i have no problem with gaming innovation but this isnt innovation
this is just plain bad programmingas another reviewer stated it really seems like the developers of this game ran into some budget problems and just threw it out there so to speak
the new warlord system just really stinks
and the heroes which were so cool and played such an important part in both wl and battlecry  are conspicuously weak in this game
they are all wimps
i dont know why they are even included in the game because the moment you put them in a battle they are guaranteed to die right off the batand the vectoring system which was so useful in wl is now absent
the units actually have to travel on screen from where they are produced
this is more realistic perhaps but it certainly calls for some micromanagement to make sure your units out wandering alone dont get slaughtered while you arent lookingthe only good thing i could say about this game is that the graphics are somewhat improved from wl
even so most of the animations are still just ripped directly off of battlecry ii so were not seeing anything innovative here
in fact the graphics in battlecry ii beat this mishmashed hodgepodge of a game by a long shotbesides graphics alone does not a good game make
warlords  while having graphics that are now showing their age is a far superior game to this one
and i still highly recommend it for turnbased strategy game lovers
wl is an excellent game indeed
this game was really disappointing
it shows a lot of potential with the ideas used but the execution was horrible to say the least
unfortunately i cannot recommend itive never had so much trouble getting a game to play
my pc more than meets the recommended requirements and it seems like its full of bugsthe cars are way too hard to drive
you have to use keys to turns left or right they arent mouse controlled
for petes sake let gamers quicksave whenever they want
i hate hate hate not being able to save
who wants to get so far only to get killed and have to backtrack through gameplaynot fun
its also a major ordeal getting cheatcodes that work
some do most dont
huge disapointment
ive had it with pc games like this
never againnot worth the time or the moneyi bought this after playing far cry iii and it was a mistake
fciii is a great game but this one does nothing worth talking abouti cant believe i paid money for this
this is the only game i intend to throw away once i pass it
im only still playing it because im trying to get my moneys worth
first thegraphics are not the best quality and yes i do have a current video card with all of its uodates
whenever i shoot someone in the far distance i get blood pixelating before my eyes blocking my view
the game freezes every few minutes
i cant adjust the sound so i have to turn up my speaksers just to hear the gun shots and the voice overs are drowned out by the background noises
what little dialogue ive heard was horrible voice overs
the story is stupid
im a professional storyteller so im picky about good quality stories
i cant wait to get this game over with
this game wasnt worth the gas money i spent to buy itthis game is over due for the bone yard it will not load in the latest  bit operating systems
ill let this copy go cheapthis review is most certainly going to warrant the unhelpful from the most avid politicallycorrect reviewers as they will most certainly see that this is not a review of far cry and i of all people do not especially enjoy spotting those reviewers who have never even touched the games in which they are so unhappily ranting however the games today are asking for an allout lawsuit in blatant misrepresentation
fortunately for them the least they will get are our reviews bringing the magic tricks into the lightit seems as if the game developers in amidst a chaos of illegal downloading and cd copying have sent a huge unnoticed cluster bomb in the way of those who are actually supporting their economic ventures  and is the unavailability to play their games the thanks we get
absolutelyi am very disappointed in the games that have been released throughout the last few years  not for the lack of creativity or poor design  but for the lack of a better guide for those who actually care about the quick buck of our beloved game makers
remember that silly little nvidiatag commercial that jumps into action right before you enter the game
it has that cheesy motto spread like butter right over the monitor screen  it says the way its meant to be played
as much as i dont appreciate the trendiness this  motto implies as a lackluster commercial for the games we have already bought into  it does make an interesting point referring to games in general  this fin game is actually meant to be played
shocking is it not
who would have thoughtwell apparently not to the millions of people who bought into the game only to realize the game makers have withheld crucial information and they have thwarted the very people who they are attempting to sell the game towhat in sin am i talking about
misrepresentationyou dont sell an electric saw that malfunctions in a basic electric outlet without warning the audience in bright bold letters do you not
you will be sued for negligencefar cry must be the exception in the eyes of the publishersgame makers
for instance far cry will not work on cdrcdrwdvdrdvdrw at all
this is a far crying shame not because i cant play the game but because i should have been warned before i tipped my dollar hand
why cant we have a nice big sparkly label on the front of the box which clearly states that we cant play the game if we have the basic outlets
game developers are starting to get the hang of not letting us in on their dirty little secrets  so they can make bank and we get nothing in return except for a couple discs that will not install
and i know these are good games but we must be warned about deviations for the basic hardware that our computers have rightfar cry is far from being the only one on this train wreck
myst iv has the same problem as far cry but for the dvd rewritable drives
i didnt run into that problem but certainly there was no specific label that could be found
is this the way we are supposed to treat our consumersthief  and deus ex invisible war will not run on computers with the nvidia graphics card
this is not an average problem that many will commonly run into due to the fact most people have a nvidia graphics card
these games dont need to include the nvidia cards but they certainly need to include their audience in this decision  right
i want to see the nice gold label on the front of the box that says wont work with nvidia cards
save us the trouble right
and then halflife   the only single player game to come out with the required use of an internet nearest you
yes i see that ten font sentence on the bottom of the box now  but wouldnt it have been that much easier to warn everyone in advance
even the magazine gamers that have played this game didnt happen to mention this  i expected much better
how the hell did they even play the game without noticing this
unless the publishers didnt mention that to them  but thats doubtful
well ive canceled my pc gamer subscription  amazon reviewers arent as likely to pass up such details we dont get paid for playing games or paid if our games do not work properly
sure theyll get away with it because this information was included at the bottom of the box but surely there was someone up in the big office warning everyone not to let this fart out into the open  and they should be ashamedthese sloppy misrepresentations have alienated me as a gamer  and i for one will not buy a recently released game until i have looked into at least fifty of the reviews  because it is obvious the developers will continue to use this dont tell policy
i suggest you consider doing the same thing  because refunds are hard to come by in the gaming world
enjoy far cry  i have yet to play itdecided to give far cry a chance now that i bought a new computer  read the conflicting reports on compatibility  even went to ubi software to see the issues with the game  best i could tell if you have virtual copying software the game wont run  wrong  i contacted customer support and was told far cry will not run on cdrw or dvdrw drives  i will need to install a basic cd drive  wasted  and now im wondering if splinter cell pandoras tomorrow will run  im not jumping through video game company hoops to play their games  ill buy another fpsrpgrts that works on my system as it is  yes a basic cd drive is cheap but im physically disabled and not going to pay someone  to install a  part to play one gameone game companys product that cost  i never pay   i wait till the hype is overthis game has some kind of program that causes sudden drops in framerate freezes and untimely loading actions although the graphics are excellent this game was poorly programed
i would like to know the people that programed this mess to see if they are mentally retarded
this game does not have the looks or feel of ubisoft
this game isnt anything like silent hunter  i have never given such a bad review as this but i felt that i must  inorder to warn other gamers
there are a lot of first person shooters out there that is a lot better
the reviewer that stated something about having a crappy computer let me tell you something bozo i have a gateway gr pentium   gig processor with ht over a gig of ddr overclocking memory  gig hard drive ati radeon pci express  meg graphics card with all the bells and whistles
i have a top of the line computer but i still have problems
this game needs a patch asap
as for the reviewer that stated that he has played it once and now he is going to play it twice he probably have the farcry cheats
i have the farcry cheats and have finished the game alsowith all the settings set to very highand ultra high
you see at the very end of the game after you kill the last scientist on the volcano you rescue the fine lady jump on a ship and give her the serum that keeps her from becoming a mutant the end
my reviiew will stay the same the water doesnt look as good as the water in blackhawk down doesnt even come close to the water in silent hunter or pirates of the caribean thank you ps
go to cheaters heavens you will find a zip file download this file to your desktop then extract all to the farcry folderand have yourself some funim shocked so many people like this game
i found it to be bad all around even for its time
unreal is much much better in my opinion
the aiming is off  it seems a bit confused as to what its trying to be
lackluster experience all around herejust a friendly warning to all cdrcdrwdvdrdvdrw drive owners
ubi soft as a feature on their pc software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity
why they feel that will slow down a game cracker and why they dont mind blowing off an entire segment of the market is entirely beyond me but thats not the point here
call ubi soft tech support before buying this or any other pc game from them and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install
software such as chessmaster  to grab a random ubi product as an example doesnt come with a warning on the box in some cases they claim  i havent found a single box that does nor is there a warning on the amazon product pages short of reviews like this
one could speculate that theyre perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some wont be able to install it but ill leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imaginationubi softs tech support has said that this feature extends to all of their pc titles
so fair warning particularly to folks with laptops where dvdcdrw drives came standard ask before you buy
perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy ubi will smarten up
flawed because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isnt going to slow a determined game crackerpirate down its only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game
worse they dont find out until theyve opened the package and tried to install which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the sellerim certain this game deserves more than  star and suspect it will see some good reviews from people who are able to install but i cant give it more than a single
thats a commentary on ubi soft and their feature not about the game itselfhow in the world can a game like this be released
it is unexceptable
you can not control your man
what may be cursor key straight ahead in one camera shot will be left in the nextthough you are still hitting the forwad cursor
your man never stands straight hes always at an angle and you are guessing which cursor key to hitoops pick the wrong one and youre off the cliff
it is this insanity throughout
it is absolutley impossible to control your man and the camera angle
decent rdperson roleplaying games are like star wars jedi outcast or tomb raider the angel of darkness
the camera should station behind your character so that you can move your mouse and cursor keys accordinglyhello
game developers
every play one of these games before making one and putting it out on the market and charging  bucks
moronsthe graphics are ugly and resemble a cartoon
the worst part though is the stupid phrases that come out of the turtles mouthtalk about annoying
a game that little kids would enjoy not adultsthe seller was smartgamer
i paid  bucks
it worked fine on my pc running windows xp home spthere is no story
just a shoot em up
i thought it was boringnot funi would rather replay a game that i previously enjoyed than play this game for the first time
before you buy this one checkout some of the gameplay videos on youtubevisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsi want zoo tycoon complete collection made by microsoft game studios in the usbut i think most of these games are from ubisoft a european company
if it is from ubisoft the game can be installed in english dutch german and a couple other languages
if you have the necessary system requirements the game will probably work on your computerright off the bat this game does almost everything wrong the combat is dumbed down from the original butokai forcing an unnecessary and tedious rpg element
the difficulty is horribly scaled and no preset difficulty option exists
the game strays as far as it can from the story without straying far enough to make the game a unique and enjoyable experience
i get what they where trying to do with changing the game from a linear story to a board game but the execution was just awful
the original budokai had a better story and tournament mode and also more of a character selection with each character having better and time appropriate movepools when you fight frieza the first time you will have access to the spirit bomb
the more modern butokai tenkaichi  has the series best combat and this game just is not worth your money when both its predecessor and successor are vastly superior
in this case talent definitely skipped a generation
i am so tired of fighting colored saibamenok if your a die hard fan of dbzthen go ahead buy u may like it like this other fool did but beaware this game sucks there are no good points remember the old one had a story mode which was like living out the cartoon this one doest have that this one suck all the wayyyyyyysorry to bust ualls bubblei suppose this rating isnt quite fair as i havent given them a chance to address the problems
i have installed it on three systems windows  xp and   it installs without a hitch and then starts erratically usually locking up and mostly requiring a reboot to get out
im running bit defender and although i suspect thats where the problem bid defender never reports any problem and the installation completes as successfulafter berating the game makers for being over five months late in releasing this game and then belittling them for dropping the price to a bargainbin amount of  bucks even before it hit the shelves my prereview for this game concluded by sayingbeing such a hardcore adventure game fanatic if and when it finally does come out ill gladly play it
like the saying goes theres no such thing as bad chocolate
but at this point im not holding my breath for some godivalike quality with this one
well the game did finally arrive and after playing it for a couple of hours last night i can honestly say that this game is actually like the product mocklate in the friends episode where monica is hired to cheerfully promote the fauxproduct
it looks just like chocolate but it leaves a really bad taste in your mouthmy wife and i really love to play adventure games it is the only game genre we play
if youve seen some of our other game reviews you will know this is true
while the initial episode of crystal key was inexplicably a strong seller the game itself was not exactly earthshattering
weve played a lot of adventure games and the crystal key ranks well down on our list of favorites but by all means not at the bottom
it was just a good solid average adventure game
when they announced a sequel we figured that they probably learned from the competition grown along with the technology of gaming and created a new chapter of the story that matches or exceeds the originalboy could that not be further from the truth
this game is truly awful
with the delays and pricechopping factored in we had set our expectations exceedingly low
but some how they managed to sink even well below that level
the prereleased screen shots and trailer for the game cannot prepare you for how bad the actual gameplay really is
here are just a few of the cons to the game there are no prosthe graphics are even worse than the original game which is almost five years old now
like the first game they are prerendered  degree panning shots that you are forced to navigate from point to point
however the textures and details of these graphics are far worse than in game one
every scene looks washed out and out of focus
plus the cylindrical views actually jumped and popped as we turned which got exceedingly annoying after a whilethe music soundtrack i am not kidding sounds like it was dubbed from a porno movie
i think they meant to give the game a hipper beat but oh my i dont think they intended to make that associationthe characters of the game are immovable pixilated addins that show absolutely no emotion
the voiceover acting is adequate but the dialog is sophomoric at bestthis drivel looks like it was created by a twelveyearold indy game developer using an old  computer
unfortunately the list of credits for this game includes many members of a professional creative team
i would have been much more lenient with my review had it actually been an independent creationdont you just love a game that has technical problems right off the bat
i installed this game without any difficulties and the game would not launch
so i uninstalled the game disabled my antivirus and reinstalled the game
still would not launch
so  completely wasted because i cannot even start the game
i wrote technical support for the adventure company  well see if they even bother to respond
they didnt the last time i wrote them about a completely different problem with another one of their gamesi ended up having to get a new video card in order to play this game
although im sure it will come in handy for future games it was a complete waste of money regarding this gamei hated this game and i admit that i could not even finish it
the graphics were absolutely terrible bad enough that it made gaming more difficult since i often couldnt make out what i was looking at
i attempted to play this game right after playing syberia ii
i dont expect every game to look as beautiful and detailed as the syberias but this game looks like something that could have been produced  years agothe other thing that drove me crazy was the music
for some reason the game had a jazzlike soundtrack
that would be fine if the game took place in new orleans or chicago instead of some planet elsewhere in the galaxyi do my best to finish games after all who wants to waste the money no matter how bad they are
i just couldnt do it with this onei just installed this game and played it for  minutes and i literally want to  throw up
the graphics are awesome and the game looks like it would be really fun if it werent for the st person navigation system
this full  degree viewing is totally gross
its like you are inside a sphere and when you move the mouse the sphere rolls the screen around so every single thing you want to look at requires the entire screen to move at a disgusting rate
i slowed the mouse movement down as far as it would go but it was still like i was on a rollercoaster
have you ever seen clockwork orange
you know how they forcefeed the guy images to cure him and he freaks out well thats how i felt after  seconds of game play
 minutes later now and i still have motion sickness
give me still images pleasei have not been able to play this game yet
it would have been nice to know that you need a video card that supports tnl before i bought it
costing i found around  bucks
so now i have to wait till i can afford it
the company should have written somewhere that you need this because i read the box and the requirements before hand and it said nothing about needing this video card
now i am stuck with a game i cant play right awaythanks alotregarding the puzzles in this game apparently the publisher didnt learn
this is a set of impossibly hard arbitrary puzzles masquerading as an adventure game
basically read the lowest rated reviews here for the earlier game schizm and youll see what this game is likean old ross perot quote pretty much sums up this game quotyoure going to hear a giant sucking noisequot as you play this game
whoo baby does this game stink
i thought that the crystal key ii another recent dreamcatcheradventure company game was pretty awful but i did not know there was a whole other level of bad below that
holy cow how does dreck like this manage to get published with such flashy and professional packaging and marketingjeez where to start
how about with the incredibly bad interface
the game is a standard pointandclick adventure game where you navigate from point to point and then pan around in  degree views
panning requires you to hold down the left mouse button while dragging the mouse in the direction you want to pan
what is so awful about this interface is that when you have dragged your mouse the entire width of your mousepad you have only panned about one quarter of way around the view
you then have to lift and reposition your mouse to drag it some more in the direction you are panning
most games have an option to correct this by letting you set the mouse sensitivity to a speed that you and your video card are comfortable with
is that option available here
no
can you pan with your keyboard instead
no
as a matter of fact there are absolutely no games options whatsoever
you are stuck with one panning rate one music volume one dialog volume a real shame since the dialog is putrid andyou get the picturegetting an item into your inventory is pretty easy just click on it but getting it out is absolutely painful
you first have to click on a screen icon to pull up your inventory list click on an item to see a larger view of it in the middle of your screen click on that large image to change your cursor into a representation of that item and then click on the exit button of the inventory screen
finally you then have to click on the game spot where you think the item might be useful
unfortunately you typically have no clue as to what might work at a specific hot spot so you end up trying everything in your inventory to see if something works and there is a lot of junk in there sometimesthe puzzles of the game are a joke
as a matter of fact the very first two puzzles you encounter are pretty much the same thing try to find the correct sequence of clicks to get all the way through the puzzle if you guess wrong start over
they dont get much more imaginative beyond that
my game came with a quotlimited editionquot game strategy guide included free
im guessing that all of them will come with this guide because otherwise nobody will be able to nor want to finish this embarrassmentas a final insult the developers thought they would try to spice up their incoherent game by adding a lot of humor
done well humor can add a very entertaining aspect to an adventure game
the classic zork games are excellent examples
when done badly as in this case it just becomes irritating to the point of distraction
most of it is just not funny okay maybe to a six year old and does not quotfitquot in the atmosphere of this game
jive talking jungle natives
pleaseagain like crystal key ii this looks like the work of an independent game developer who has spent years putting together a workable game using quotknives and bearskinsquot
if so i would have admired the work and enjoyed the game for what it was
unfortunately this game was again developed by what looks to be a large team hexagon
games like these give the game genre which i love the most a huge black eye and are probably the reason why so many people get turned off by adventure games
what a shame because there are some really good ones out there
unfortunately you have to dig through a lot of dung like this to find it
avoid this gamethe adventure company has a knack for taking high concepts and making them into terrible games
take for example the mystery of the mummy a sherlock holmes mystery game that made the worlds most famous detective seem insipid
as lousy as some of their attempts have been in the past high concepts keep players coming back to the adventure company
jack the ripper has a concept so ideal it seems impossible to ruin and yet the game is phenomenally atrociousthe game is set in new york city in   a couple of povertystricken showgirls have been murdered in a fashion similar to the jack the ripper killings of   jimmy palmer a nave young reporter is assigned by his editor to write a series of newspaper articles on the killings
as jimmy looks into the murders he discovers that the same serial killer might be responsible for both the  and  murders
theres the high concept
the game play is from the firstperson perspective of jimmy from beginning to end
it consists of returning to the same locations and talking to the same people repeatedly using dialogue options that arent really all that optional
occasionally jimmy can collect items such as keys and money to appease stubborn suspects
there are only one or two actual puzzles in the entire gamethe game parades many characters based loosely on actual suspects in the reallife jack the ripper murders but jimmy never seems to come any closer to solving the mystery
a game called jack the ripper should at least guarantee a creepy ambience and the game seems to succeed in that area initially but it soon becomes apparent that ambience isnt enough
menacing footsteps when no one is following you whispered dialogue that is unintelligible and unimportant to the storyline and shady characters that cant be interacted with and dont contribute anything to the plot become annoying after a short while
in one room a hushed secretive whisper resembling i can sell you the most beautiful radishes can be heard repeatedly
dark bloodstained alleys lose their creepiness after a while
the score is beautiful and unnerving but it only adds to the misleading feeling that something frightening is going to happen and it hardly ever does
there are also several moments in the game where jimmy appears to have a psychic connection with a raven leading to trippy graphic sequence with no payoffmany critics have noted the series of irish folk tunes performed by one of the games characters as a bright spot
the songs themselves are beautiful and haunting like the games score but the animated performances that accompany them are less varied and more mechanical than a floorshow at chuck e cheeses
also be warned that there isnt a twist ending just an anticlimactic one
maybe someday still the adventure company will redeem itself
in the meantime avoid this gamei played no one lives forever  that was a great game
funny clever and involvedi finished this game on the nd hardest setting in  hours
angry and feeling ripped off i set the game to the hardest setting and tried again  i got through it in  hours  only  hours 
pathetic
contract jack is a sad attempt to cash in on that successthe weapons are limited and boringthe enemy ai is easy to figure out and beat even on the hardest settingsthe missions are lack luster
you keep waiting for something cleverit never comesthis is an absolute rip off
i would only recommend this game if it cost  or lessdont think this is going to be fun or like no one lives forever if you have not played nolfspend your money on that instead
ltpimagine the skimpiestest possible setup for this games weak premise a guy wakes up is told to killkillkill and he obeys with out question a braindead plot bad graphics repetitive gameplay stale level design and truely mindless gore and youve got manhunt
bad dumb boring
gta gtavc max payne theyve all got gore aplenty but theyve also got fisrt rate plots gameplay and design
stay far far away from this waste of timewhy the violence
oh yeah its the only way it will sell this game crossed that line and deserves to be banned
besides it just plain sux and is way over rated  if this is what the video game industry is going to be about then im gonna retire my controller and this junky hardware called playstation all you do is hide and killone of the dumbest games out there if not stupidi have more fun sleeping than playing this garbage gamerockstar is going down hill if you ask menot even worth forty nine dollarslousy excuse for a gamei actually have used mine as a coffee saucerfirst word of advice game sucked really bad
why the hell would you want to play some guy that kills people with gay little hoodscmon the storyline totally suxs
ummmwhat was up with the static clips the whole time i mean i know the camera is kinda well yeah filming but this is a game not an old camera and if it is then that is more of a reson not to buy this game
everything sucked camera angles guns were ok but still doesnt really make you want to kick sum ass and well the worst thing that happened to me was that i was on the last level and i needed some help to figure out what i was suppossed to do i guess it was the special moves and i started a new game knowing that my original save would still be there and guess what happened
all my manhunt saves were deletedwow
fun game
if you like this to give it  stars you havent played a real video gamemaybe this game was  controversial when released
i guess that was part of  the attractionbut the game  play is rather dull
for a great deal of the game you walk around with a club
clubbing people to death just doesnt do it for my  like the flash of a gun muzzleyou have to sneak up on people to kill them or you get mauled
stealth is fun to a point but its tedious after three or four levels
after two levels of nothing but clubs and  bricks i was like enough already
bring on the guns
just plain boringbefore purchasing this product do a quick web search on riven to read about all the compatibility problems that people have had with this game
i followed the recommendations on the ubisoft web page including changing the compatibility mode of the game uninstalling quicktime  and installing an earlier version and downloading the riven patch which was released before the game itself and was never able to get this game to work at all
very disappointingwhy are there so many  star ratings for this game
come on people lets give some honest and unbiased reviews about this game because other people besides ddr fanatics will be reading these reviews
this game is  stars for fun because the first  times you play the game its fun to make fun of such a ridiculous game
do not buy this unless you are one of the above ddr fanatics
gets boring in less than  minutes of playing unless you are drinking and in that case you have better things to do then play ddr and there is no replay value whatsoever
unless you are incredibly gifted the steps and the beats are way too hard to get down anyways
do not buy this for your own goodignore this game at all costs if you value winning
i cannot win any match on this stupid game
and how embrassing is it to be beat by someone named quothillbilly jimquotto the fanboys of this game you are all in denial because you people dont know what a great wrestling is game this one is not it because the ai in season mode is very cheap and i had play this game on the easiet setting and still lossed i picked triple hhh kevin nash john cena goldberg the undertaker brock lesnar and still didnot win in season mode the intro is the worst intro of any wrestling game ever the legends in this game donot have any music at all the black and purple undertaker doesnt lod dont hillbilly jim doesnt the million dollar man ted dibiase dont either and to me that is just very stupid and it doesnot make any sense what so ever their are much better wrestling games out there than this overrated piece of garbage wcw nwo revenge wcw vs nwo world tour wrestlemania  wwf no mercy smackdown shut your mouth smackdown  and  smackdown vs raw  and  wwf royal rumble genesis snes wwf raw genesis snes wrestlemania the arcade game genesis playstation sega saturn are all alot better than smackdown here comes the pain anyday of the weekthis is the saddest excuse for a game i have ever seen
i did not want to spend any of my hard earned money watching fat men in tights hug eachother
sorry but i just dont flow that way
nevertheless for all the people who do i still do not recommend this game for these key reasons
the game lacks in storyline and shouldnt be set to standard with any other fighting game in the history of the gaming revolution
the graphics and playline engine are near nonexistent and makes you feel like your playing pong
the game is way to pricey for its real value
the fact of the matter is is that this game costs nothing whatsoever but even if i had the chance to get the game again for free i wouldnt
thats how much it sucksyeah so i bought this game because i saw sean o haire was in this game and i always thought of him as an excellent wrestler
i loved him and the other natural born thrillers in wcw and its a shame wwe didnt do more with his devils advocate character
also ultimo dragon was in this game which i remember seeing online that he was coming to wwe
as far as i knew those two were never in any other wwe gamesand the main reason i bought this game isthis game is from pretty much the exact time right before i gave up on watching professional wrestling
i watched from like  to some of  and and it just wasnt the same at all
i feel sad saying that
like im now discussing a past romantic relationship that ended very horribly with feelings being deeply hurt
but there i said it
so yeah i got a burst of nostalgia looking at the roster and thought for the price a used copy goes for why notwelllet me tell you why not to buy this game as another reviewer said i think he was more generous and gave the game  stars this game is so unbalanced
so yeah im shawn o haire and roddy pipper is my tag team partner
we have one match and then win the tag team titles
i am fine playing against the guerreos
but then the game keeps putting me against kurt angle and chris benoityou know those guys who have like  points higher than i do on all my stats
so yeah no matter how good i was i couldnt block a lot of their attacks
also their momentum to gain a finisher builds up faster and their finishers do more damage than mine do
so i went to raw and the game threw me against steve austin the rock and goldbergsame thing happened
couldnt beat any of these guys but other opponents with stats similar to mine i could have a good match withi fought the rock in the gym area and after like  to  finishers he wouldnt stay down long enough for me to pin him
then the rock gives me repeat  rock bottom and i get pinned
very fair
did they even test this
wrestlemania  had a better career mode
enuff saidso many animations
there are a lot of times the game will go into a mini movie to show someone pulling off a move
let me play the game
 the referee will never count a pin if someone is in the ring wrong place to be realistic in game but he will always get in the way when you are trying to strike which then leads to your opponent getting a second to recover and attack youthe tag matches
the ai opponents outside the ring gain momentum and gain finishers
so you can be schooling your opponent and they make the tag
then their partner comes in and does a finisher on you and bam total the match is over and you have lostthe controls feel very loose and are horrible
i cant tell you how many times i meant to climb the turnbuckle and my character starts running
then when you start running there is no way to stop running unless you attack your opponent or the air damage
when you take extreme damage
your opponent gets up and holds themselves
giving your opponent a complete opportunity to beat you down story mode is dumb
my main gripe is story mode is glitchy
ive seen the same person scheduled the match before mine and then hes in the next match with mehas this ever happened in real life
also the game showed the rock talking to me about our match that night but then goldberg was in the match
you can move but a lot of times there is no one to talk to in the outside arenas
i thought when i bought this game i could choose which superstars on the roster i wanted to interact with
in reality you can watch and react to a bunch of spontaneous little cutscenesthat give you superstar points which then let you challenge for different belts
but if you arent a main guy you will probably get beaten a lot and not get very farlike i did i think graphics look horrible
i think the day of reckoning graphics which was released like a year later actually looked good
this looks like garabage create a player is dumb
seriously you cant pick entrance music for your star
wwf attitude did this better and it was released how long ago
you would think you could turn out a better product than the old designers came up with right
 superstars songs just trail off
yeah wwf attitude again how old is that
 let you actually listen to the whole song in create a player
here i listen to my characters music after he wins and it just stops mid way in the songlame legends dont even come out to their music
why
 omg so much button mashing
seriously my wrists still hurt
there is just so much button mashing
button mashing was invented by lazy game developers
instead of putting in real ways to get out of holds
tap any button as hard as possible
so yeah eventually you get carpral tunnel syndrome
thanks guys
 taunting does nothing
remember in the n games where at least your attitude meter went up
not here
nothing
yeah so i think thats about it
i was just totally let down by this game in nearly every sense and i seriously feel i got ripped off for the  i paid for this used
everything was just so lame and seemed broken almost
to put it mildy tna impact is a better game than thisand way more fun too
i thought i was going to get a sense of nostalgia from when i used to love wrestling but this only helped confirm what i already knew wwe was getting lame and stupid around then
thanks for help ruin the few good memories from back then with this atrocity of a game guys
the pros
i got to be in a relationship with sable for a bit without being brock lesnar
so that was cool
and since i bought this used vince and co didnt get financial gain from my purchase
take that pg wrestling company
bottom line no mercy  or any n wrestling game made by aki like virtual pro wrestling and virtual pro wrestling  is still the best wrestling game ever made
if you want a newer wrestling game that isnt ugly and is actual fun to play once you get the controls down go with day of reckoning for the gc
the nd day of reckoning is pretty good too
but stay away from raw and raw  for the xbox
those last  were complete garbage except for the stars that were on the roster in that game
thanks for reading and do not buy this game everthe game is not cool it is not callngin like the odd parnts game bay thati dont really like this game because all you do is fighthow can this be a  star game
no way
its stupid
ive had it for  days and im already getting bored of it
the movies are ok but the game play is boring and most of the jokes are really corny
spend your money on a different game seriouslyi just got the xbox  and i didnt know that many xbox games dont play on the xbox 
well this is one of them
now i know for the future that when buying xbox games to read all the one star reviews to make sure they can play on xbox  first
i have most of these games on playstation   now i know to hold onto my playstation  for all of these old gamesthis game reezeed a lot
and it is vary hard to playthis is a big dissapontmitthe thing isdisney and nickelodeon suck at making videogamestheyre perfect at cartoons and moviesbut absolutley suck at video games
its an abomination to video games
just trying to be dramatic
and this is probably the worst of them all
whatever you dostay away from disney and nickeodeon games
sincerlykennyi waited with baited breath for this game
lucasarts and planet moon studios who gave us the wonderfully original and funny giants citizen kabuto working together
it should be great right
well in essence no
the best part of the game are the hilarious cut scenes that introduce the characters
these are very well written and laugh out loud funny
the game play is uninspired
sure you get to use the infamous land shark gun and the quotcorkscrewquot weapon to literally turn the world upside down but you get to use these power ups few and far in between
most of the time you will be using your trusted machine gun to mow down endless waves of mooks
the game is extremely uninspired and gets repetitive within  minutes
i would rather buy a dvd with the cut scenes from the game than pay  for this game
sorry but it just falls well shortalthough i am not a fan of doas virtua fighters tekkens and other modern fighting games play mechanics i was actually considering buying this game
im glad i rented it insteadthis was supposed to be a remake of both dead or alive  and  with upgrades
instead dead or alive ultimate ends up as just another port
sure it has extra outfits and stages and online play for those who can afford the excruciating monthly broaband fees but it fixes none of the information problems in training mode the characters are hard to control and the optional english language dialogue that was in doa  hardcore for the playstation  has been stripped from the xbox versionas for the dead or alive series in general if i want confusing combo moves ill play one of those stupid dancing games
i hope this isnt the future of fighting games and that street fighter gameplay will come back againive played all of the dead or alive games and found that they lack everything but boobs and girls
sure there are guy ninjas like the awsome hybusha but thats really the only reason i kept the game
sure i like girls but come on i buy a fighting game to play a fighting game
oh about the fighting physics they suck
you can about counter every freakin move
i used hybusha for a few days and i beat a super rank gamer on doa online how pathetic
the graphics are all that seemed to please the eyes except for bfactor
anyways when it comes down to it matrial art fighting is way better than this to me this is  horrible tekken clone that diserves to be put down for good doa  a clone of this game with more characters whooo who cares
anyways if your looking for a awsome fighting game pick up the best soul caliber ii or if you like tekken buy tekken  but please save yourself the money and dignity skip this onedoes anyone besides me see a problem here
i am a huge ddr fan and have been for years
i was so excited when i heard karaoke revolution was coming out
after all how could it be bad with all that cool bemani music
well i was wrong about a few things there
first of all none of the music is bemani which means no more cool ddr music
i had assumed that ddrinspired songs might be included or at least some cool jrockjpopeuropop
maybe even the smiledk songs that have been constantly excluded from the american ddr games could have been included
that was the second thing wrong with this game
all it is is terrible american popular music and that disappointed me highly
i personally cant stand michelle branch or any of those whiny untalented american pop artists
this game is marketed to the american masses not the true ddr fan
im sure the gameplay itself is a lot of fun if you ignore the songlist
if you love ddr dont buy this game
if you love popular american radio music be my guesti saw this game and thought it might be fun as i enjoy games like ghost recon however i was very disappointed
there is not much you can do with this game unless you have x box live
the single player missions are pretty boring and you will get tired of them within the first  minutes or so
i dont have x box live so i can not comment on the game play onlinepros  none that i could see
there are better first person  shooters out therecons  lack of game play offline
graphics were not the best and the ia was not very intelligentoverall  try ghost recon rainbow six or some of the other tom clancy st person shootersthis version the controls are akward and hard too use
worst graphics ever seen on xbox they should have left this alone and on the pc only nice attempt but falls short of the originaldont buy this  buggy  you spend more time loading the game and crashing it than completing a level soo many buggy pc games out therecheers good luck
if you buy itthis game which claims to be the quotspiritual sucessor to xcomquot disgraces the entire genre of squadbased strategy games
why
the interface is arkward and counterintuitive
the player has to plot quotwaypointsquot in order for team members to move
why
do you plot waypoints before you movethe game sacrafices plot for graphics
xcom ufo defense which arguably had lame graphics by todays standards was thouroughly engaging plotwise
you wanted to win the missons even if for nothing else to see what would happen next on the techtree
also there was a certain uniqueness to each member of your squad that made you kind of quotattatchedquot
here you are expected to be so awestruck by the flashy graphics and d acceleration that you can overlook the substance of the storyline and characters
in fact the storyline is quite boring compared to the original xcomstill for me one reason stands out among the rest
the font
what is wrong with computer game programmers nowadays
do they think that people want to play computer games with magnifying glasses
i had to sit one foot away from my screen to go the tutorial
the game is guaranteed to cause migraines
i have noticed that this has become a trend with modern pc games although i really dont know why
sure i know it sounds knitpicky but the overall effect is that it makes the unenjoyable games even less enjoyablei have never been able to get this controller to work with any game i have
it wont work with ducktales remastered it wont work with dust it wont work with gta san andreas and i was really hoping i could use it for the flying parts it wont work with star raiders
it was a complete and utter waste of moneyread the other reviews and youll notice a trend
my controller lasted about one month before the right analog stick got uncallibrated
it makes my one game mvp baseball  pointless since my players just dive around the field all day longwhats sad is that this problem has been occurring in these controllers for over  years and they still keep on selling them
too bad i didnt read the reviews first
knowingly selling a defective product should be illegal
shame on you logitech
shame on youi want to make this review rather short
first its an easy to install gamepad and looks very promising
you have the easy ps feel dualanalog control pads and a comfortable fit
you can install the drivers or not
it doesnt really make a difference because windows will recognize itthe problem with this gamepad is that it is not very durable
i bought and tested this controller with mvp baseball   need for speed underground  what happened is i had to take the controller back  times to have it replaced because the analog sticks would give out or get stuck in a certain postion
now in mvp baseball for example you need the right stick to diveslide with
well the analog stick stuck to the right in  of them i tried so that ends up leaving you to have automatic fielding because you cant get to the ball when the player is diving for no reason
with need for speed i found that the  controller where the left analog stick went out the cars were just out of controlthere are many reviews online as i have found that confirm that logitech never addressed this controllers issues
even tech
support kept telling me i had just bought a bad controller when i called them on each onebe aware once the analog stick goes whether it is  days or  months you cant calibrate it
the gamepad is useless
i would suggest you go with nykos airflo gamepad instead
ive had no problems with that onethis gamepad is great  if it workedjust like all of the other reviewers have described my left analog stick is no longer functioning properly
it will not respond when moving it to the right
i have only had the controller for about  weeks and i am far from a heavy gamepad userthese controllers should obviously be recalledupdate  i have been able to recalibrate the controller by unplugging it from the usb connector on my pc
i have to do this daily
not goodupdate  i bought a new controller and returned the old one and so far after about  weeks no more calibration problems
maybe they got the problem fixed
if the calibration problem stays away i would give this  starsmy bf who worked at a gamestop bought me one of these pads on his discount
we went to his place and tried it out on his computer
it started out looking like a decent replacement for my saitek it had the keymapping menu and very customizable
but i spent a good hour trying to make a profile for it to fit my snes emulator
after getting that done i finally tried it out with a game i knew had diagonal in it secret of manathe overly recessed dpad sucked big time
when i wanted to go diagonal it wanted to go up down left or right
saitek ps have some of the same problem but not as badly
i like logitech and saiteks layouts and programmability but jeeeze you guys gotta learn to make better dpads
either go with whats tried and true snes cross or make a flat touch sensitive pad triaxs turbo touch and ive heard about those adapters that allow ps and super nintendo pads to be run on usb
my roomate says that can actually tear up pads because they dont recieve the correct voltage
i shouldnt have to do something like that
companies should make better more durable dpads
the majority of people buying your pads are emugeeks looking for a way to play sega emulators without having to use their keyboardsthis game is not what you think it is
i thought this game would be like socom but sadlyits not
its more of a strategy click and drag you sit back and watch all the action type of game
so many control issues and it has a slight learning curve you need to adapt to but by then your dead
graphics are okwell i must say that i am extremely disappointed with fsw in many respects
for one the graphics are not exactly anything to rave about
they are ok but thats about it
and after all the hype this game received and the advertising it put out it seems they should have saved some money for the developing
basically the actuall gameplay is at a  year old level
click here move there
thats all you do
and i cant stand the cheesey jargon used in the voiceovers
horrible
i am an infantryman in the us army and i can tell you no one i know talks like this or uses the goofy lingo the throw around in this game
alsothere is no open ended gameplay you can only move to certain areas on the map
the enemy ai and the weapons physics are ridiculous
you can have your team fire at an enemy out in the open and he wont move wont throw a frag wont call in support etc
if you want a real war simulation buy operation flashpoint
its dated but still the best squadfpscommand game ever made
after all the patches and upgrades and addons and its truly open ended gameplay  ofp will probably be the only game that will permanently stay on my hard drive
fsw nice try no cigarbad graphics bad sound not in anyway fun
to hard
this game is stressful just like real life and i dont want to sit down and waste my time at this
you cant keep yourself happy and do all the other things in the short amount of time you get
in the games time it takes him an hour and a half to eat half hour to go to the bathroom he needs to sleep for at least nine hours and need to be happy clean likes the house is relaxed and is social staduis is good
in the later levels you have to on top of that help run a gym and help people and stuffthis game isnt any better than the sims i own both games and the only thing thats differnt from the sims and the sims busten out is the story line and that you watch you drive your vehicle i men how gay is thati mean i dont know why they called this game sims bustin out i mean i dont even know why they wasted there time makeing this onei sugest if you want to start with sims wait and get the sims the sims bustin out is a really really boring game
it is the same thing as every other sims game but you are in different places
all you do is control someones life
dont buy it
it is a waste of monneywhat a bad game
it stinks
the create a sims is half way decentbut it still stinks
controls stink furniture stinks graphics are decentif you want fun buy sims  for the pci didnt realize this old x box game wouldnt work on the  so i sold to a local video game storeim a standardheavy kid that plays in arcades well alot of my cousins and friends have these pads and they are totally screwed up
i was playing and i was changing my level to make it on heavypress down twice and it made it to light mode instead of heavy
i suggest you buy stiff pads by the redoctane company where they use stiff pads
and also with these pads it is hard to use for an arcade player because the down arrow is farther down than the matal pads on the arcade versions
and maybe if you are a freestylist trickmaster try puttion something behind the pad so you have a balance bar and something to do tricks withthen i did healing vision which i can get a aa on and i got a d
i found a site where you can make a homemade metal pad but i forgot the site and it costs  for the materials
for a ddr freak all this stuff is worth itremember play in bemanai arcades and other places with arcade ddr for good luck console versions might be messed up by weird song sets horrible pads and those annoying characters dancing in the backround
note ddr max  and  are very good the rest arent especially ddr extremethe pad slides when you start doing the standard levels and need to move your feet fasterthese buttons seem to loose their sensitivity after awhile
grrmy boyfriend has big feet and hes always pressing multiple buttons at once on accidentwhat is it with game designers
you come up with a good concept which in this case has spawned an impressive game dynasty whose first three games were absolute classics and then you screw it upthis game luckily doesnt try to be a stperson shooter i havent found a single good stperson shooter on the game boy advance and am convinced that the gba simply doesnt have the response and accuracy of controls necessary for games like halflife counterstrike no one lives foreveror medal of honor
it retains the excellent michael giacchino score which had distinguished this game series from the pack
and the world war ii locations and weapons remain accurate
so whats the problem
the level design for one thing
it made precious little sense to me why they would have two fairly playerfriendly missions of low difficulty allowing you to feel out the game and then launch you into a multitier mission where you have to kill about  enemies back to back without being able to save
difficulty is a necessary part of any game but this is just ridiculous  so you survived an onslaught of  enemies
how about we take away any ammo replenishments and send four bombers your way that can attack you behind barriers and kill on contact
this game also has a hyperannoying map system where you could take one step into an area and the game seals off your escape route so that you may find yourself suddenly cornered
it makes no sense realistically speaking and it certain does nothing except to frustrate your gameplaythe weapon aiming system is very poor
why would they veer your shots to the right
to be more realistic because your soldier is righthanded
this makes diagonal shots very difficult
also your shots dont go straight  they spray sideways maybe in an emulation of gun recoil but thats like saying to the player  you can aim but not really
your enemies dont mind  they have unlimited ammo and they come in groups
having to charge towards your enemy a step just to shift your aim is already annoying but this righthand bias is just dumb
and the minute an enemy shot hits you you bounce back and lose control of your characterbut you remain vulnerable to attack and so can lose your entire life from just one bullet hit
ridiculoussomehow no electronic arts game ive played on the gba has been without fundamental annoyances like these and its getting just tiresome
i was going to give this game two stars but after having played one level  times with the same result of being killed by flights of bombers i simply said  this
ill bet the  game developers had a wonderful time devising ways to kill off the player with hordes of enemies
well this is the last electronic arts game i guy and this game is going straight to a secondhand storethis game was insanely hard i couldnt even beat the first level
its the only game i own that i havnt beatonthe previous versions of this game were a lot more exciting
this one almost put me to sleep
the music isnt anything great and wheres the action
not in here
sorry but they could have made a far better game than this
congratulations i say to the gaming developersyou finally made a sequel to a game that sucksthe only thing that relates this rotten game to quotthe secret of manaquot is the name
everything else is just a rotten imitation of that fine game
the graphics are well drawn but poorly animated
the music is lame
the story is weak and worst of all the play controls are horrendousthe ring menu system from quotthe secret of manaquot was a thing of beauty that let you quickly use items and equip your characters
quotsword of manaquot has ring menus as well but theyre sluggish and they flash for no apparent reason
also it seems like it takes forever for the guy to swing his sword after you have pressed the button
if you play it with the gamecube gameboy player youll even notice a bit of flickeranother minor irritation is that no matter what kind of creature you kill it leaves behind something that looks like a bull skeleton
i could understand that in  but its 
surely rom is cheap enough by now for the cartridge to hold an assortment of remainsi doubt that the original mana team even worked on this thing
in the opening it mentions brown amp browne which makes me suspect that square is just a publisher for this game not a developer
they pulled the same dirty trick with quotbreath of firequot which was an okay game developed by capcom but it was not as good as a square gameif they couldnt be bothered to do it right they shouldnt have done it at alltheres one specifc reason i dont like this game
once you get to the final dungeon the game is kind of like the legend of zelda it locks you out and you can never go back
if theres ever a game without any replay value no matter how good i would never get itthats why im always cautious when buying my games unless of course its a puzzle game etc
not being able to play those again would be like locking you away from the game
the last thing i have to say about this game is i got my hopes up that it would be like paper mario the thousand year door read my review but instead it doesent save at all once youre done beating the game
youre still in that damn final dungeon
sadly i might give this game a good rating if it had replay valueget this game if you dont care about replay value well its not secret of mana
its not even children of mana
its a totally different beast of a game
i tried on two separate occasions to get into this game but one single thing turned me off  time actually passes during the dayremember the legend of zelda majoras mask
remember how time passed during the day and people might or might not be where theyre supposed to be since they could be away from their house at that time
yeah i hate that
and since sword of mana revolves around the same time based system i hate this game tooso in reality i cant give you a true game review
i can only tell you that i couldnt even play it due to being utterly frustrated at having to walk back and forth through areas to wait for the time of day to change to get something done
if you can handle that however this may be the game for younot recommended for anyone
epic failit wasnt what i expected
i thought i could be the sim and not just look down on the city
shouldve known since so cheapsmhmy game came without the product code required for activation
apparently this is a wellknown problem
i suggest you avoid this game until the problem is fixed or pruchase it at a retail location where you can open the box to confirm that an activation code is presenthorrible game
not anything like the originals
ea has horrible service
thank you amazon for the refund
i hope ea goes out ofbusiness for ruining another great franchisei found the art work the inability to get in close and the intensity of graphics which eventually crashed my xp home edition computer not anywhere near as appealing as simcity  i would never bother to buy a good video card just for this gamethis game is terrible
i love the old sim city games especially  they obviously put a lot of effort into the graphics on this one and they are very good but the game is a train wreck
they should have stuck to the old engine but beefed up the amount of things you can do
they should have just added more and more detail more buildings more control over city functions control over climate global location when building terrains more detail in running a city and then some better graphics
being able to build cities in arctic surroundings or deserts would be neat
but no they have to make it so convoluted that just getting started makes you want to scream
some of the things they added are ok ideas but its such a bad game that none of that matters
i found building starting terrains to be an extremely long process in this one
i could have definitely done without the driving around saving the day and using helicopters to fight crime
that whole aspect really seems to belong in some other game
i know that some people may like it but i think they should have focused on what has made the series what it is
its only my opinion but this game gives me a headache just thinking about it and compared to its predecessors its a joke
its like they tried to jazz it up way too much
isnt part of the reason these games have sold in the past been because people like to just build away
it doesnt need to be slowly morphed into grand theft auto in order to improve it
definitely the worst of the series that ive ever played
the old dos version beats this one hands downi remember playing this game when it first came out
i loved it
for some reason i cant seem to get this version goingits just not as easy as i remember
dont like this version at all
very disappointingwe bought this game for our son who has an affinity for these types of hackandslash games only to discover that the game wont run
this is a brand new computer with more than plenty of hard drive space amp ram to spare with a mb graphics card
unfortunately there are only two graphics cards that this game will recognize
you can have the most powerful card in the world and if it isnt nvidia or ati radeon you are out of luckdo we want to blow  installing a new graphics card all for the sake of one lousy game especially one that has gotten the mixed reviews that this game has
i really dont think so
we have never had any problems with any other programs we have installed on this system
the idea that i need to drag a brand new computer back in for an upgrade just strikes me as ridiculous
this games designers need to be more flexible when configuring the system requirementsour son never got to play this game but i know that he would have been driven crazy by the lack of a quicksave feature
once again the games designers display a profound lack of flexibility
they must live in some fantasy world where people have all day to kill slogging through an entire level before being able to save the game
get real folkswe have a couple of other ea games and i have generally been lukewarm about what are obviously console games that have been reconfigured for a pc in a sometimes slapdash manner
this most recent very disappointing experience leaves me extremely reluctant to purchase any ea products in the futurei wont get into a battle with words here
let me kep it simplepc gamer magazine gave this game a rating of  out of 
that is bad
let me quote some lines from their review in the january  issue
frustrating camera controls not enough diversity in character play styles disappointing failure stupidly difficultneed anyone say anything more
dont listen to the reviews that gave this high marks
they are lotr extremists  the same guys that go to star trek conventions all dressed up like kirk or picard
first of all most of the guys that gave this game  stars wrote reviews before the game was even released
second most of them admit they have not even played the game
they just love lotr
okso do i but dont go suckering some people into blowing their hard earned dollarsare the graphics good in this gameyes
they are truly outstanding and unbelievable
that is all the nice things i have to say about this gamethe game play is terrible
you have to fight in  degrees which means that the enemies are between you and your guy
you cannot even see what your doing
oh by the way you cannot quick save
you can only save at the end of the level
generally this is fine by me but since this game is so hard and camera angles constantly make your life miserableyou absolutely need to be able to quick save
the absolute worst thing of all  the cutscenes
electronic arts force you to watch all the cutscenes
no skipping them
and some of them are over  minutes longhere is how the game starts  you have to go through all the production credits from ea games among othersget through the horrible thx ear blowing intro and about  other stupid introsthen the first cut scene happens  this one alone is about  minutes of scenes from the last movie
then you get dumped into the game in the ehat of battle
talk about confusing as all heckguess whatif you screw up the game or just want to start overyou have to sit through the credits and all of the games cut scenes all over again
no choice
thanks a lot ea games
you milked the moh franchise to death and ruined what could have been great and now you are just out to milk money from the lotr sagai played this game through all the way
i normally would want to play a game all over again
not this time
borrow a copy from a friend or at the very least download them demo and try it out before you buy
hey if you dont believe meread the comments in some of the lotr game forums out there
many many other people that own this game will agree with me 
send eagames  a message send them some email and tell them to allow skipping past cut scenes send them a message and skip this gametrust me your money is better spent else whereget halo gtavice city medal of honor or bloodrayne which is a blast and sells for lessif you like to fool around with boring games this is for you
the game sucks
it has horrible graphics and it is too hard to drive the slow goofy looking cars
it is a horrible game and it is not worth a pennyage of mythology the original is a great game
the campaign is fun
the random map games are greatthe animation is stunning
the monsters and units are well thought out
i would definitely suggest the original
however i feel this expansion pack was not worth the money at all
i played with it installed for about a half hour and used cheat codes to investigate all the new things and then promply uninstalled and sold it
the only fun part about it was actually getting the titans but the atlantians are pitiful in the sense of buildings and units
i was very disappointed in itif you feel like trying it go ahead
but i would not suggest buying iti did not follow everyone else advice and went ahead and bought it
dont do it
its boring slow and not very exciting
it takes a long time to even get playing and is very difficult to figure the game out
also the camera angels although they do allow you to rotate now are still not very helpfulthis game is boring enough to fall asleep and never turn it back on
i found it very monotonousafter all the hype about how great the game was the reality was such a disappointment
the graphics were fine but the colors were very drab and not crisp enough to convey anything unique
the hardest thing was that i actually found myself bored halfway through the gameyou have to waste your time going back and forth to places with no reason to be there just to get information to get further in the game
the characters were boring there were tons of unuseable items that were a distraction
and after all the time you waste the ending is the biggest let down
they should have just wrote on the final screen quotthanks for your money suckerquot
just like with movies that have really bad endings i have even less appreciation and respect for games like this that stink due to the fact that you have to work harder to get to the endunless you have the time to waste on this sleeper i would save your moneythis game has a protection called starforce
starforce can cause your computer to mess up and also
by the lawsuit that is hanging in cort right now damage to your computer system and cddvd driveok for all the retards that think you can add a nos and turbo and all the other stuff you can quotaddquot to your car into a neon or a skyline and have them race with similar speed youre really retarded
this game has two things going for it tight gameplay slick graphics
once you get to the last few races the expert races youll notice that youre extremely fast car can do extremely fast flips when it hits the slightest environment article
for example you can slice your car through some stop signs and trees and then later in the game youll be going  and then wham straight to zero because you hit the wrong road cone or tree
even better the computer racers can glance off cars and not miss a beat whilst you graze a car and you flip uncontrollably into other invisibly cemented objects
this game is very frustrating ive destroyed a handful of controllers in the attempt to beat the whole thing
all in all this game is not as challenging as a gran turismo game but its easy playability is stomped to death by a plague of problems that makes playing it much less fun than harnessing a true nfs game like the beautiful hot pursuit  game
but sorry kiddies in nfs hot pursuit  you cant put crap all over your stupid civic and make it beat a skylineremember that movie the fast and the furiouswell think of that movie fused into a game and just as idiotic
this game is the lamest excuse for a racing game ever
i am the biggest nfs fan but this hits the all time low
it is surprising electronic arts could have ever thought up something this stupid
i was excited when the game first came out until realizing that it was nothing more then a cheap offshoot of lame racing films
the customizablity takes over the concept of the real racing and destroys the purpose of buying the game
hey how about you buy a  game so you can customize cars all dayif i ever wanted to do that i would go work in a garage
nevertheless i must give props to the graphics
though nothing compared to gran truismo it hit the low time standards of ps racers
but if you are planing to buy a great racing game with customizable features and fun racing time dont buy this game cause thats not what your going to get
instead settle for a d nintendo racer cause this game really is all cut out for playing materialwhat a fun game this may have been if it actually was able to play sadly this was a dud  would not play so i got issued a refund  tossed the disc
i would not order from seller againit is an exact copy of medal of honor allied assault and the expansion packs that followed
dont waste your moneythey didnt even try to make it orginial
it is just the same old scripted mission action repackagedi enjoyed the game
i liked itbut i did not think it was worth my moneythere are some new things that are nicebut that list is so short it is still not worth  or 
donquott believe the hypegtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtdownload the demo or borrow a copy from a friend and test drive it first peopleif you like itthen buy it but dont rush out because of the overhyped  star votes in hereworst game ever it ignore me every time i try to run thre game it just appear the loading screen and then it dissipear i try it again but it wont work
u like wwii games go buy medal of honor allied assault it has better graphics fun way better then this stragity game
but if u like stragity game go buy starcraft best stragity game i ever playi must say i hate the controller s  it is way too small and the button layout is confusing
it feels cheap and fragile as well
i played on one in a video store and i could barely play the game
i will never buy one of these controllers i will keep my original controllers
if i ever need replacement xbox controllers i will just go to ebay and get the first ones that came out with the xboxthis game is just race and get new cars
one of the most boring games ever
flashy cars great graphics but no interesting features what so ever
i have project gotham  and  i got bored of them after  days
take my advice theres better games out there
latermy only experience with this product was after i opened it and started to play a dvd in my xbox when i tried to pause it it didnt work and it had brand new batteries
i found after much frustration that if i smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about  minutes
i took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit but it was sold out so i just got my money back
you can buy a dvd player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costswent and bought this for xmas
worked fine then the next week disc read error
wth
even though i read about this from other owners i decided to take a chance
never again
people poke fun at the older sytems but my playstation  has never ever failed me and i almost traded it in for this crap
my other older systems such as the snes genesis and n have performed well without any problems
i took this back and will stick with the ol skool systems
but then again i guess im not a real gamer until i own an xbox or ps right
as for the reviewer who told the guy to get a brain because he said playstation  was better why dont you get a life
people have their own preferences in what they likeps has got to be the worst game system out of gamecube and xbox
xbox is number  if you want a game system get a xbox
here are some reasons
an xbox has a gigantic hardriveps you need to buy a expensive memory card
the graphics are so much better on the xbox
xbox dvd is so much better than ps
you need to wait so long for ps games to loadits so much faster with xbox
when ever xbox comes out with a great game ps tries to make it for its consoli could go on forever with this list so get an xbox becuase its worth the moneythis system is a piece of junk
it freezes a lot
also the memory on mine corrupted after only  year
thats nothing
you have to also buy a memory card unlike xbox
oh yeah and i forgotloadingloadingloadingloadingloadingstill loadingyou get my point
i played soul calibur on ps and on xbox
their both the same by the way heihachi sucks and ps took three times longer to load
arrrrrrrgggggggggghhhhhhhhhps console it loads the games to slow will not play allof my ps games hard too ship back i like too play my games that i can play would not tell any one too buy from them nor would i tellnot too buyboo
ps sucks so bad its not even funny
i cant bielive you people would even look at one wowxboxfablehalohalo mech assultburnout gcubefinal fantasy the crysatal chronicalsmetroid primemetriod prime viewtiful joeviewtiful joe it all good except psyou like games take my word for it all of sony is junkbuy a x box or gamecubehey guys if you are even considering the ps dont do it
dont even think about it
the ps sucks so bad its not even funny
it would be great if it were portable but its supposed to be a home console
here ill give you a list of things that a home console should have but the ps doesnt it should have really fun gamesgood multiplayer capabilitiesgreat graphicscheap acessoriesthe ps does none of these
and heres something else  dvd incompatibility
i looked it up and it seems there are about  popular dvds that the ps for some reason wont play at all
and heres the killer   that wont work on xbox
only thirty
and that problem with the stupid thing overheating
one person claimed that he was even able to play for a whole hour without out it heating up
ooh a whole hour
well guess what i played halo on xbox with my friends for an all nighter  hours straight without turning it off and when we did decide to call it quits i felt the xbox and it wasnt even warmbeat that you stupid posthanks for knocking the ever so creative sega dreamcast out of the water sony
you could have at least given us something good and not a clunky black box with dvd playback
you could have at least offered an online service like xbox
you could have at least produced an outstanding library like on gamecube
but no
you just have to scare dreamcast away crush gamecube and fight with xbox
i have no idea how you do that with such an ugly mess that groans and never works
i hate you sonybottom line is game cube and xbox are better
 xbox may not come with a dvd player but i have a tip for all you xbox lovers
go to the internet type in xbox mod chip
you can either get the mod chip and put it in yourself or get it already put in
the mod chip gives you an automatic dvd player using xbox controllerallows you to play copied games copy games with whats called a dvd rewritable cd there just a bunch of special blank cds you usegives you a whole new menuis a complete step closer to being a cpuyour start up screen will be blue not green so dont be alarmeddo not drop xbox with mod chip in
will knock out of slot slightly and screw upno worries we have  ppl in our family   kids
me my sis and my little monster bro jk and our xbox is still in one pieceplug in xbox and look through side
if you see a green light it means all systems are ago
if its red its either busted which never happens   or its not quite onshould come with instructionsyou can find it cheap on ebaywell i hope my tip gives you some insight or saves you a couple  hundered bucks hehehehthe screen is half the size of my game boy advance sp
its a smaller screen than a cheap palm device
yet the unit itself needs about twice as much pocket space as a gbasp so forget about slipping it in a shirt pocket its bigger than any phone on the market
the large size odd shape and brightly colored buttons pretty much guarantee that youll look a complete tool if you try to use it as a phoneas if that wasnt bad enough the interface is complicated and confusing dont expect to be able to pick it up and use it without reading the manualfor the price of an ngage you could get a refurb ipod a ti and a gbasp
sure three devices but three devices that together take up about the same amount of space while being much more suited to their respective tasks than this jackofalltradesthe nokia ngage is a product that should not have been released
first of all it tries to be everything to everyone but fails in the end
the games are mediocre forgotten playstation  ports and the phone capabilities are subpar at best
i would also mention that the screen is oddly shaped for gaming and you have to literally take apart the entire back of the system battery and all to change games and then wait  minutes for it to boot upin a nutshell save your  and get a gameboy advance
it is tailored more towards gaming with a much greater library and everything from the system design to screen size is what a portable gamer needsthe system is flawed
this review is for the actual game system get this
do not buy the system for one huge problem changing games
it is pretty complicatedyou have to like remove the batteries then insert something for sometime then remove then pretend to do something then you scale a mountain finally after a few key holds and such you will win the nobel peace prize and discover the start screen for your gamehonestly nokia there is something called the game boy advance out
there is a really cool looking and pretty small game boy sp which everyone is happy with
then there are  dollar phones that are twice as good as the ngage
so lets bottom line itphone bucksgameboy sp bucksdepending on where you get it trade in your original gba and sometimes you can get rebates and such i found a deal to get a new game boy advance sp for  bucks basicallythat is like  bucks mabye compared to the ngage which is  dollarsi feel sorry for nokia though they dont realize that noone is really intrested in their product
an awkward expensive and overall lowgrade device is not worth so much money
if this phone was worth  bucks
yea tons of people would probably have it
it isnt thoughsorry nokia better luck next timeim starting to think this is the most laughable excuse for a video game system yet
the game gear was pretty shoddy the jaguar was downright detestable
but heres this for only a couple of cnotes you get this amazing system thats like a broken swiss army knife that has hundreds of different tools but seems to randomly burst open at inopportune times in your hand causing severe injury
yeah it plays mps but buying this brings you already twothirds of the way to the best mp player on the market
yeah its a cellphone but theres so many more elegantly designed units that dont require you using a headjack to not look like a moron
yeah erm it plays games
erm some games
aa few
ok theyre ports of firstgen playstation titles for the most part and while that isnt wrong in itself  of the gbas library is made of snes ports or adaptations its all in the execution and with poor control and the lousy aspect ratio its already gone belly up not to mention these blocky d graphics are so much more painful on the eyes than something like say the nice smooth sprites of an advance wars
and there are about  games in total out of which only  or  are any good and even then the fatal system flaws lead to them being well nigh unplayable
multiplayer is wireless and adequately implemented but thats about the only plus and theres only a couple of titles taking advantage of that too
after such a stupendous release as the gba sp perfection in design if there ever was any such horrible design is inexcusable
i know this is practically flogging a dead horse but the message must be made loud and clear lest a huge number of children become disappointed come christmas
please just say no
buy a gba sp for half the price and get your kid a cellphone to accompany it with the remaining money see theres two of the functions the ngage has already
its time that companies like this taking advantage of heedless customers with shoddy merchandise be stopped
disengage the ngageoh brotherafter eagerly awaiting to see what the ngage will be like i get my hands on one and find it to be a tremendous disappointment
let me put it to you this way everything negative youve read about in all those videogame magazines is true
this is a device that should be marketed to the cell phone crowd not the videogamers
essentially it comes across as a nokia phone wrapped around a fancy new package right down to the obvious quotcell phonequot screenit does several things but unfortunately does none of them well
the games look great in presentation but they are presented on a vertical 
phonestyle screen which is simply too small and produces too many headaches from eyestrain
the cartridge position is ridiculous i hated having to perform surgery on the silly thing just to play a game
a strange idea especially when you read nokias official explanation as to why the cartridge is quotburiedquot inside the device which makes no sense
the menus and builtin management were both a mess
talking on it is an issue all by itself not only is it terrible to hear in public areas but its downright embarrassing holding this electronic taco up to your ear
and who wants to splurge on a handset when the option to use it as a normal phone could have been made so much betterfew games are available for it but thats common
thats not my beef
the problem is that the system itself is simply filled with too many design flaws
if nokia obviously a phone company really wants to create a game machine and then market it as a game machine they should have gotten together with an outfit like nintendo to help them design it for gamers in mind
its pretty obvious that they had no idea what they were doing
i seriously believe this thing was rushed out the door for christmas but the fact the nokia refused to listen to early consumer complaints about it at showings doesnt support that theorylet me put it to you this way i have a beautiful cell phone i adore a panasonic gu a minidisc player and a gba
id rather have those three than this any day since i get far better performance and usage out of them as opposed to this thing
i took mind back and got a refundthe ngage is unfortunately a victim of its own design
part phone part videogame part mp player part radio etc it really doesnt fit or perform well in any of those categoriesin addition the the previous writers comments about the game system i would like to add that the system also has to be held at an extraordinarily strange angle while using the actual phone
the quotgamepadquot design makes the buttons counterintuitive to use as a phone and impractical to use as a gaming system
the screen is far too narrow for games to be displayed with any degree of useful information about surroundings and given the numerous addon costs involving in making the system any more than a deficient gaming device you could see from miles off that this piece of plasticfantastic casualglance garbage isnt worth your moneyill keep my  and my game boy advance thankyou very much nokia
if youre going to treat phone users with this amount of contempt in all future products when the time comes to trade up i might buy an ericsson or motorolawish i hadnt wasted the moneyfirst glitch health and mana viels could not be used
reloaded and started the game at least ten times before finally deciding to try and venture on without
of course it made for difficult and time consuming gameplayrunning around circles during boss battles until my health replenisheddiehard that i am i still managed to put hours into this shotty game and survived until reaching level two
thats when i found the second glitch which made continuation impossibleupon killing the big spider boss i decided to head back to unload my loot before entering the doors to level two
once done and saved i returned to the doors only to discover they were now closed and i was unable to move forward without starting the entire game over againafter  hours of struggling to work around the games many unresolved errors problems and glitches the ohsoboring hack and slash gameplay was hardly worth the time or the money i spentwhen i first heard about sim city  on the gba i thought dang that should be pretty sweet
then i realized that in actuality the game would probably be pretty lousy due to the small screen and limits of the gba
still i decided to pick up a copy anyways but it wasnt worth the as some have said yes the game can be fun for a short period of time but then youll most likely never get the urge to play it again
doing some simple tasks in the game proves to be a bigger chore than in other versions and the cities you create feel empty and lifeless
however if youve got lots of time on your hands and dont mind some of the neater additions of the pc versions missing along with some slowdown when disasters occur then you will probably enjoy this gameif it says it will work in xp on the box then it should be patched to work in xp whether you can play it or not
if it says in the manual that four out of the five games are win  only it should say that on the box
i do not have this i would never buy it but know for a fact that ns porshe unleashed and ns iv do not work in xp
i do have those original titlesi followed the instructions by the book when i first purchased this product on installation and use
everything seemed to be functioning normally but when i start the game there was no effect whatsoever
i went to the codejunkies website read all the faqs on troubleshootingnothing helped
so i exchanged this product for a new one thinking it was defective
same symptoms occurred
so i contacted both uk and us support
neither side could help
they just kept repeating the instructions mentioned in the instruction booklet wasting my time
eventually i threw a question at them that seemed to have boggled their minds
i asked them if early ps consoles produced in  dont work with their product
both sides say they cannot be certain but there is a possibility since they did design the product based on a later produced ps console
the funny thing is uk support asked me to contact scea to see if there was any hardware changes made in the ps production over the years
why waste my time
i just returned this product
my recommendation is to purchase this product at a store that guarantees returns so you can test it on your console and return it without any hassle if it doesnt work
i purchased my ps back in early  and ar max doesnt work on it
whether its because ar max isnt compatible with early pss or ar max is a terrible product i cannot say for sure with the facts ive collected
purchase at your own riskthen this will not work on your consolebut if you have the huge old ps console then this will work on you consoleif you do have the slim console then you should get a game sharkthis game is an example of what not to do
the graphics are poor the environments are almost as blocky amp pixilated as super mario brothers
all of the natural foliage is totally devoid of detail
the ai
is subpar at best as the enemies react to shooting only part of the time
hit detection is also poor as one shot in the mid section can bring enemies down while others miss their mark completely
weapon selection is severely limited as you can only pick from two primary weapons and either have a hand gun or grenades
to offset the poor weapon selection ubisoft made all of the weapons fire at a full auto rate even the m
the full auto weapons will really tick a lot of people off especially the people who actually know what the real life counter parts are capable of and what they are not capable of
with all of the great shooters out game designers really need to make the games look and feel real to compete and this one just does not have what it takes
the missions could have been great but the poor environment detail and overall reality just cannot be overlooked
i had this game on preorder and wish that i had waited to purchase it until after all of the reviews came out
while people will compare it to socom ii that simply is not fair to ghost recon
ghost recon is merely an idea or concept of what a great shooter should be
if ubisoft plans to compete in the very tough market of shooters they need to take a long hard look at the other titles and take plenty of notes
overall rating poor
i would advise renting first if you are a die hard fani usually enjoy majesco games
i like bloodrayne and advent rising because they were both pretty cool games
but majesco has a habit of releasing games a little too early leaving them a bit undercooked around the edges
however when it comes to drake this game feels like it wasnt even put in an oven
this game is a terrible glitchy mess that will make you want to throw your controller at the tv screen
this game is so bad it doesnt even deserve to be in the bargain bin instead its like you grabbed a game from satans game librarywhat the game is a terrible thirdperson shooter
an artifact has been stolen from the temple of the  dragons and drakes master has been killed
so he must go out get the artifact and kill all who stand in his way
the story is so poorly told within the game you will never be able to take it seriously evergraphics ive always loved the comic book look in games
like the awesome fps xiii ps xbox gc
this game has a nice look but why the f dont the lips move when they talk dammit
the level designs and enemy designs are okay but seriously what the hell happened when designing the protagonist drake
he looks like the offspring of frankenstein and a zombie because he looks like a walking corpsemusic this music is awful it has no purpose in even existingsounds whenever this tool opens his mouth he cant more than two seconds without sounding like a complete jackass
theres shooting crappy voiceacting why does a guy who looks like a yakuza mobster sound like he came from alabama
 and the sounds of your character dying that wasnt even your faultgameplay death is only the beginning as one of the talking statues in the world you go when you die says to you
apparently shes warning you that this game not only has a problem of constant cheap deaths that await you but it has some of the most godawful challenges ever put in a shooter and that you have wasted your money
the shooting mechanics wouldnt have been passable a decade ago and beyond that
there is no reticle onscreen so all you can do is try and guess where your shots go and shoot uncontrollably with a total disregard for tactics
climbing up walls is a terrible mess and it doesnt work all that well
this game also steals the slowmo shooting feature from the great thirdperson shooter max payne and does an awful job of implementing it here
and for just about every stage youre timed on them
your health depletes quickly as well and i cant tell you how many times i went from high health points to death in about five seconds or less
this game provides no fun challenges of any kind for you and cheap deaths and a wish to break the disc is all that you get
other instances of cheap i recall were things like pursuit missions in which i got hit by several vehicles that randomly appeared on the street and another time was when i entered a room and got mauled to death several times because of the strange creatures and the fact that if you absorb a bad soul your health is lost and the room was full of them
oh and if you die you have to redo the entire stage
dammmmmmmmmit
overall this is one of the worst games ever made for the xbox
terrible shooting mechanics no fun challenges awful music terrible save system and numerous cheap deathsthe good good comic bookstyle graphics controls work somewhat in the beginningthe bad controls dont work the rest of the time crappy challenges awful music the worst protagonist ever put in a game terrible save system and so many cheap deathsthe idea for this game first appealed but then when i started playing it everthing just fell apart
the camera angles and the gun control that drake has is just terrible
once again the idea for this game was one that sadly didnt turn even half as good as i thought as thought it would be
one of the bigest disappointment ever
graphics  gameplay  control  story didi mention that the story line is one one of the worst ive ever witnessed
  overall  two words can describe this garbageit sucksi wont even go to detail all i will say is not only is the gameplay glitched up and horrible to do especially how to controll drake but the story is just plain stupid
gamer no how doesnt know what hes talking aboutgameplay is just plain awfulmusicim not even gonna go therethe controls is just plain awfuli have to give it a  out of hell i wish i could give it  stars but i cantwhat ever you do do not buy this gamei have heard for yearsabout how terrible this game wasnever trying iti thought to myselfheyit really cant be that bad
well let me tell you something folksit is
as a matter of factits so bad that you will wanna toss it in the trash
oh my godi dont even know where to begin with this piece of junk
the controlsgameplaygraphicssound and storystink to high heaven
therethat should be enough for you to not wanna waste a single cent on this dud
save your moneywhy a a the game is devoid of funb you move about as fast as a crippled snail even when runningc the npcs talk after you have concluded your textbased talkingd the graphics may have been good about  years ago but they are just muddy and dull nowe the game is open ended but as a result there is nothing really to do and the land is so barren that you just get incredibly bored very fasti now know why there is no demo for this game if there were no one would buy itbtw some have argued that the slowness factor is a graphicsystem problem but it is not
your character simply is exceedingly slow there is little jaggies or system level slowness
if you have played something like everquest or wow think of it like this running in morrowind is at the speed of walking in those games and walking in morrowind is about half that speedalso the since of wonder at seeing stars is old been done everywhere and doesnt impress
walking down a road and seeing a door stuck in the side of a mountain means dungeon in morrowindthere is no since of wander the dungeons are doors in the side of a mountainfinally if you want to buy this thing go ahead clearly it appeals to some people
i rate it as one of the worst games ive ever spent money on and furthers my belief that if a game doesnt  over a demo then there is some reason they are hiding it until after you make the purchasethis is one of the worse games i have ever had the displeasure of buying and wasting money on
i personally will never buy another game from bethesda again
after all of the hype about the game me and my spouse bought it
after  minutes of play we found that this game required too much camera angling two hands to use a mouse and keyboard
the hot keys even customized required way too much time to even enjoy the game
this game in my opinion is for people who enjoy complex playing and not medium to simple playi am sure the game is great but until a version comes along where i dont have to use one hand on the keyboard and the other on the mouse pass this one byyou know i bought this game think i could play it but you know what i booted this game into my xbox and it didnt work
took me a while to figure out that it was a pc game so i got it installed and it ran well but you see i was born with one hand and could not manage to play this with one hand
i mean what the hell a mouse and a keyboard are required to play last bethesda game i buyi am a huge fan of the rpg genre and have played just about every one for the pc
morrowind is the most boring one i have ever played
i turned it off after two evenings of slowly walking around having stupid repetitive conversations with npcs and lamely fighting rats
the interface is terrible
you are very limited in what you can carry so after you kill a monster you cant even carry your treasure back to town
this game was all work with no fun
do not buyi loved quotmax paynequot
from the day i bought it i was hooked
i finished it and anxiously awaited the sequel
when it cam out i played it over at a friends house
i still have not bought it
i was just disappointed with how they took the storyline
in the game theres no mention as your playing of the first gameunless you play the quotpreviouslyquot video in the game
secondly max looks nothing like he did in the original
i can understand that times change and i read how super looking max now is compared to the original but his looks didnt strike me as great
medicore i would say
and last but not least if you dont have high specs for this game dont even bother wasting your money or downloading the demoespecially if your a dial up user
its just not worth it
ill stick with the original instead this game in my opinion blows goatsif youre fortunate to have one of the cd drives this game supports its decent however theres no way for you to know ahead of time
their tech support is near worthless with my request for help having them tell me that i need a second computer to test it on yes to get support you apparently have to have a computer lab to verify on
the game worked on my old cd drive the only difference is a new dvd drive
my other dvd drive in this computer wont work either
theyve had this long wout patching their cruddy protection
they arent going to if they havent by now
avoid this like the plague unless you feel safe downloading a no cd crack or need an expensive beer coasterthe game picks up shortly after the first max payne game
you have bullet time again but this time youre able to move at normal speed so any illusion of it just being enhanced perception is removed
you are not a man but inexplicably a super hero
you also get to play as mona sax who was supposedly killed in the first game but for some reason has the same powers you do
there are some levels where you switch between the two one defending the other or completing different tasks
there are some pretty cool levels where you end up in a gang war with computer characters blasting away at each other and there are some improvements like not dying in dream sequences but the story falls short of the first gamethe game is to clickthat is it requires to many steps per event and thats very distractingthe program does not work when trying to raid other merchantsjust allows pirates to defeat youbefore you have a chance to respondold tech graphics poor programing in all areas of the gameim very disappointed with this game and disposed of it promptlyi found this game for cheap and it still wasnt worth it
not at all scary or suspenseful
you know if youre entering a room somethings going to pop up at you
again
and again
there are countless dead ends and single rooms that lead no whereyou fight through five gouls only to get some health to recover what you lost fighing the gouls
the monsters are unoriginal and for the most part indistinguishable from each other
you have to lead your family to safety which means back tracking to the beginning of the game leading ai challenged characters who are easily left behindto top it all off all of it is timed so theres little time for exploration or examination of your surroundings
this was probably done on purpose so you wouldnt notice the complete lack of creativity or detailoh another treatif you accidentally hit quotreloadquot on your revolver it reloads iteven if it has a full cylinderand dumps the unsed bullets on the ground using up your ammo
brilliantive played the game once didnt finish it and probably wont play it againim sorry to say that this is the worst final fantasy to date
i played for a month and the whole thing was basically just about running around and leveling up
not really any kind of storyline to follow very hard to get into since the instructions dont give you any clue as to where to go and how to get started
not to mention you have to pay  a month to play such a boring game
i recommend you spend your money on final fantasy x insteadi love mmorpgs but i have limited time so that makes joining groups rare for me
with this kind of game it pretty much requires you to group
also when you buy this game dont plan on playing it the same day
it took over  hours to install register and download all the updates
this is on an athlon  with  gigs of ram and a cable modem
the whole playstation interface is just horrible for a computer game and the constant loading of areas really kills the feel of this game
also the need to load each different area has caused me to die several times because the game has a tendancy to load you right next to monsters
also there is no real exploring of this game unless you are at least the level of surrounding monsters
anything with a higher level than you have will kill you unfortuntely doing anyhting as simple as checking the level of the monster you are fighting requres several clicks of the mouse
oh forgot to mention that there seem to be about  monsters per area and they go from extremely weak to extremely powerfull
you cant tell how powerfull a monster is going to be untill it kills youoverall this game was just horrible
i spent about a month playing it every chance i had and in the end i felt cheated of my time and money
it was more frustrating than fun but i kept thinking if i get to the next level it wil be more fun
well it never got funbesides ff this ff is just the worst of the series
its also a terrible mmorpg
if you want real mmorpg check out ultima online
it is actually reasonable on the quests
as with ff you have to level up to extreme levels just to ride chocobos etc
the quests are boring and tedius
this is not for mmorpg its not even really for hardcore ff fans
ff is better single player and i suggest starting at ff known as ff on snes and work you way upthis game doesnt compare to world of warcraft
final fantasy should never have gone online because it ruins the whole series
ffx was bad enoughbe a sport and switch over to wow and see what a mmorpg is really made ofthis review has nothing to do with the actual gameplay of the game
because of bad business practices and incompentence on playonlines part i havent been able to play the game at allok to start off i have owned this game for only twelve hours and am already completely frustrated
for the twelve hours that i have owned this game the servers have been down for six
the registration server went down right after i gave them my credit card information pretty convenient if you ask meonce that got going they wanted me to download an update for the game
thats cool i was expecting this but the update was like  files and several gigs of information
have they ever made update files before
why did i even spend the time to install the game if i had to redownload all the files anyways
the setup continues  finally
now i have the updated ffxi and am ready to play
my frustration is starting to subside
i click the play button        all servers down for maintenance
ok heres a concept backup serversat this point i am completely frustrated
i call the customer service number which isnt toll free by the way to ask for my money back
customer service number is busy
try again  busyi love final fantasy games and i also love mmorpgs
i hate bad business practices and playonline is full of those
be warned if you do purchase this game and want to take a few months off three to be exact you have to repurchase the game
this is terrible terrible business and i would have expected a lot more from the people who make final fantasy
i would have loved to try this game but that was not a possiblityat first this game is very involving and very fun but then you start to get into the higher levels and you realize something that is stated as quoteasy preyquot can easily kill you
also every group camps out at the same place
so if your in a group of  and are lv  you can bet there will be like  other groups of six camping the same ol spot
also this game is not enjoyable at all
its not even a game its more like a full time job
trying to gain levels is like trying to convince waiting for your hair to grow
also once you have spent  hours gaining  exp its is  exp to gain a level at higher levels and then die and lose  you will be very angry
this is when you look over at the clock and realize you just spent  hours to lose  exp wow thats fun
so ignore all the other positive reviews of this game cause it truly is horrible
also i have been a fan off the ff seris until 
 sucked so did  and so will   in fact square enix sucks square needs to break away from enix and start making quality games like ff again
anyway if you have no ambition and want nothing more than to sit in front of a computer all day then please get this game
if you would rather enjoy yourself get a normal rpg that has a plot not an mmorpgi had unfortunately very high expectations of this game
i mean final fantasy mmorpg
whoa
the best of two worlds collideunfortunately the result of the collision is a horrid mess
square smashed this game out of the park graphically and the sounds effects and music are decent too
unfortunately as well thats where the positives stop the ui is awful and unintuitive play control is ruthlessly cumbersome players are mostly unhelpful to new players raceclass combination is pretty boring
each race has a best class and most people go that route did i mention play control is horrible the combat system is also unintuitive
i highly recommend playing a melee character as a first
any casting class will be killed over and over and over
and apparently this is just blindly accepted the chat system is pesky oh yeah the play control
dont even get me started on itnow the reason i weighed play control so heavily is because in any mmorpg youre going to spend a lot of time traveling around
a lot
that mixed with the horrible ui and combat system just make for a very frustrating experience
if you want a game with any sort of substance
do yourself a favor and check out world of warcraft
or even dark age of cameloti receieved this game to find out that even though it was described to be playable on ps to find out this brand new disc does not even read on my ps
note i have no problems with any other ps games i own
this was the first one that was unplayable
ive heard this type of thing happening to other ps owners and now know the gaming tales are sadley trueboy did they really screw this game upfirst of all you can tell that this is not emulatedthe games all have a different feel sounds are not quite right etcthe whole layout is bad and takes place in an arcade funny the intellivision was a home systemand the background music makes me want to pound my head into a wall after a few minutessome games i cant even get to startthis is almost as bad as the  in  controllerof all the retro out there they really screwed up intellivision big timeintellivision deserves much better than the crp they are putting outspend the money at a yard sale and buy the real console because this is horriblei purchased this because it said in the description that it was an official nintendo controller it is not
it does however look exactly like the official nintendo controller so i figured there wouldnt be much difference but boy was i wrongafter a week the c stick would stick meaning you would have to manually center it when not using it
the z button also stuck and i have yet to be able to to fix this so when i play games with this controller it plays like the zbutton is constantly being held downdo not buy this and i suspect many of the other gamecube controller deals online are similar to this
id recommend just going to the store and making sure you get an official nintendo product or even a quality rd party controlleri bought this game because i really liked return to castle wolfenstein but didnt realize that the entire game is for online multiplayer crap if youre looking for single player action this sure as hell isnt it
save your moneyno it wasnt
i remember being very excited when driver  was supposed to come out
you were supposed to be a gangster running from the law a game built oin the same engine same physics as the destruction derby gamesbut whoever made driver  thought it way too controversial to make a villian as the lead so they decided to make it an quoton the runquot police officer
that was weak and i lost interest in it dont care how great the game was
do i want a watered down version of an artists vision
please why dont you put that fig leaf on quotdavidquots unit in florenceso here we go now we have drivr a couple years after the gta wave breaks
yay
in drivr they finally let you get out of the car and do foot missions fight shoot run over people now that the coast is clear
there is nothing innovative about what they are trying to do here
drivr is not the original
any company that forfeits its edginess to be politically correct will not get my money
might as well have tipper gore in the passenger seat the whole time telling tanner what he could and could not dothis game was definately not worth the hype if there was any
i remember seeing a commercial for it and i was thinking gta ripoff and it pretty much is
gta is alot better than this in everything this game was to bland
i got bored with this really really quickokay im not going to waste alot of time beating a dead horse all of the negative comments about this game are all true
remember the car grabbing light poles from driver
they are here along with shoddy physics poor aiming control and a lack of speed that will disgust you
you can grab the fastest car in the game aim it down the longest straight away you can find and youll still not have any feeling of really moving
i loved driver and even driver  but this game should have been properly debugged before release
long and shortsave your cash rent first and youll see what i and so many others have said all along this game sucksway back in the olden days i played a game called driver for pc what a rush car physics were funky and cool miami at night was moody and mysterious and the cop chases well for get about it it was great
and all that painful popup
come on it was  afterall
well here we are its  drivr has been loooong awaited by those of us who adored the first offering from reflections and now that we have it all i can say is what the hll
ill only review this on the graphics merits so if you like the game play and can numb yourself to the absolutely pathetic textures look away now
talk about popup holy where did that car come from batman the ai vehicles not to mention buildings trees power poles and peds appear out of nowhere not more than a block away at times they dont fade in they just appear like some crazy magic trick
textures tear and flicker and quite frequently disappear all together just to reappear again
now mind you the lighting effects are beautiful note miami at dusk bathed in that golden tropical glow but there is absolutely very little draw distance and the unbelievable amount of graphics glitches that are found at ever turn are utterly disappointing and inexcusable they may have passed muster back in the day but not at a time when project gothem  and grand tourismo rule the roads
i went back and ran pg and recounted wreckless last night just to make sure i wasnt being too hard on poor old drivr but i came away being even harder on it
great video games start with can you imagine great graphics
call me a graphics geek but if a title cant draw me in visually then the journey for me and that title will be a short one
how the creative teams at reflections and finally microsoft let this pass to distribution with so many bugs to work out is beyond me xbox has so much riding on the quality of the games to sell itself that allowing such a shoddy example of workmanship find a place on store shelves is inexcusable
on the upside however drivrs opening cut scene is the most cinematic ive ever seen and frankly stunning
the levels cities are huge and exacting in their detail but the clipping and overall poor graphics execution relegates what could have easily been one heck of a game to the shoulda coulda woulda file
simply put i was expecting so much more and got far less than i could have ever imagined from drivr and how sadi bought this game a few weeks ago from target for  it also included a nd disc with tips i had a  coupon as well
this game is unbelievably frustrating i cant believe reflections spent nearly  years developing this game
while the graphics are nice and some how impressed me some what it doesnt make up for the frustrating and dull gameplay
here is a list of cons because there just arent enough positives things to say about this gameconsdriving controls are very sensitive and your car tends to slide like as if it were on iceon foot controls i like to call it run n gun are cumbersome to say the least and the aiming system isnt very good at all eitherdid i mention that this game is on the difficult side and sometimes very frustrating
i was on the mission where you had to stop the gator for good and trying to drive and shoot at the same time just pod me right offi have played other games similar to this true crime streets of la the getaway and of course gta
driver may of pioneered this genre but this installment was just poorly put together
many games of this genre may come and go but grand theft auto is still king of the genre
if you are really interested in checking out this game i strongly recommend renting this i wish i had done so or waiting for the price to drop to under just bad plain bad the only thing saving this game is its theater or replay mode
and using cheats in this game is fun too
but the single player is the worst ive seen in a video game
its like the developers spent more money on the cutscenes then the actual game
because the controls handle poorly the missions are structured poorly everything in this game feels shallow and has that been there done that feel
just avoid this game and please save your money dont support badly designed games like thisi am a huge fan of the resident evil series and out of the games i have played this is the worst
i have to say that the characters are stupid obnoxious and terribly crated
but on the plus side the graphics are fantastic and not very glitchy the only decent character is koko
this is the worst game in my  games that i havei found this at a resale shop for  im glad i didnt buy it on amazon for 
this was the worst game i ever played
it was so bad you wouldt believe it
please take my word for it and dont buy this game and waste your moneyi have played this game for  days and i coulnt get passed the first levelit is slower than turtles and very hardwhen you walk into another room oh my gosh i can take a coffe break of how long it takes to loadhow long dose it take one person to just read something like womens restroomif you love resident evilfor this game you can just kiss your residential evil likeness goodbyethis game has impressive graphics but its unbelievable how many hold times there are
every single time you change a room there is a hold time
i felt like i was waiting half the time and playing the game the other half
i actually want to play more of this game but i dont want to deal with waiting every minute or so when i have to go into another room
get rid of the countless hold times and this game is great
they should have put more timeeffort into this gamei waited until the day this game came out to buy iti was hoping for this game to be really fun like re and code veronica but when i put it in i was uterly disapointedthe game play was very bad with very bad controlsthe other resident evil games had better controlsthe other thing is that this game had no story line you just start off in a bar and run from zombiesdo not get this game just wait for reafter playing a few of the other re games i was excited about this one despite the different programmers
utter disappointment was my experience
in fact i havent even attempted other re games by the same programmers which were obviously just generated with the re name for the moneyok this does have the best graphics but i dont care what anybody says the friking loading time  u have to wait everytime u enter a room almost makes u want to shoot yourself
it ruined the whole game for me i seriously threw it awaywhile i have played this game one on one i have not played the game online
this may explain the difference between my one star rating and the multitude of five star ratings for this productas a one person game resident evil outbreak does not live up to its predecessors
gone is any semblance of a plot
this is unfortunate since most of the charm of the prior incarnations of this game came from the storylinegone also are intuitive controls
here you have to load each bullet into your gun
havent any of these people ever heard of clips
and most frustrating is the snail pace with which the characters accomplish every task
unless you are running which is immpossible to maintain if you are trying to accomplish anything else you move at the rate of  mile an hourat some point i feel that a franchise such as the resident evil franchise simply puts out products because they know people will buy them based on name recognition
i believe this is the case here
resident evil code name veronica was the last decent game made along this line i do not own a nintendo system
save your money for a game worthy of the  price tag
this game is a rental at bestman im glad i rented instead of buying
this game is unbelievably bad
the reasons are way too many to list
i just wanted to contribute some bad feedback to a game that truly does not deserve to be called resident evil
if you thought the movie was great youre probably mindless enough to like this game
if not stay awayresident evils  for the original playstation are two of the best games ever made
re alone surpasses nearly all the other horror based games that were created for the consule and there were plenty to follow
with the evolution of the new gaming systems came new resident evil games
re nemsis proved to be a challenging game of cat and mouse
re survivor squandered in its attempt to switch the horror genre to the first person
now resident evil is back on the playstation after some new titles under the nintendo name
the suspsense and antcipation for the game were killing me so i quickly bought it when it was released in april of this year
little did i know that the game itself would kill me
re outbreak is quite frankly the most dissapointing horror game in the storied franchise
the game is bad very bad and it has a number of reasons why
first you can not turn a survial based game into a team effort
the fact that you have to help nearly everyone in this game just as much as yourself is ridiculous
the game doesnt allow you to focus on the tasks and puzzles at hand not to mention the  billion zombies that are thrown your way
the loading screens are absolutely agonizing
they were never good on the psone so you think with the adaption to the ps this minor glich would get cleared up
oops
the story is slow the characters are dull and the constant reptitive lines spoken by them is enough to make you want to turn into a zombie
oh wait you can in this game and then kill all of your teammates
what
who came up with that brillant idea
with such a storied past you think capcom would play off its original success
instead resident evil outbreak is dead on arrivali have a very stateoftheart computer with all the accelerated video drivers sound etc that is needed to run any game with all the drivers kept up to date
this game wouldnt even load and kept crashing the system even to the blue screen of dumping physical memory
i ran all patches changed video modes changed compatibility modes and nothing would work
if thats any indication of whats left for problems if it ever runs check out the other reviews of those who actually got it to worklots of problems
what a shame such a promising game ended up such a wastei just finished playing this game last night
it was the worse adventure game ive ever played
the dialogue is inane
the voice acting is horrible
the body language is goofy
the navigation is a painful exercise in frustration
the puzzles and tasks are either pointless or impossibly difficult or both
i had to consult two different walkthroughs just to get through some of the puzzlesits really too bad because the visuals are stunning
the graphics and colors are very good and the cutscenes are especially nice
but these things are not enough to save this game from being truly awful to get throughnormally i love sonic the hedgehog but this was the worst game ive ever played in my lifedo not buy this gamethere are good reasons this game never really took off here are the gameplay was severly lacking in almost all aspects
the power speed fly switch up was poorly designed and they do the same thing every time
the levels were done very bad too
you also dont get as much freedom as in previous sonic games
its pretty much there way or shut off the system and get a life wayo thats soooo awsome  different sonic teams
wrong
there may be  different teams but they all do the same levels so whats the point
same levels same skills boringno choas
those little guys were awsome
im going to miss umso all in all if you buy this game you can still sell it back on amazon
o yeah the sound and music was bad to i can still hear that stupid robot chantingif i were you i would rent this game first
from sonics first adventure on the genesis up till sadx sonic was a huge hit
on my scale sonic went from a  down to about a  why did they even put knuckles on his team because he was his second worst enemyfirst is eggmanhehe back in the early s
sonic should always fly solo or with his best pal tails and not flying around in weird formations and making fantasised attacksif you still intend on getting a sonic game on crack then rent this before you buy itthe basic formula to ruin a sonic game is to throw  in extra playable characters now play as three at one time
no thankssonic should be about running and rings this game was mostly about that but it gets to the point where youre running around the halloweenhaunted house levels for hours and hours
i still have not beaten that game and ive had it for yearssure its okbut once you beat it youll never want to play it again ithe concept of the game is great
half the stuff you can let the ai do for you concerning econimics trade manpwer military leaders et al
but some basic stuff like changing from army to navy management cant be done
or seeing and possibly retreating from certain territories under atack
to heck with diplomacy if you cant do these basics forget itive seen a lot of overrated games but this one amazed even metake max payne
remember how it was really hard without bullet time
ok  take away most of the bullet time turn it into an fps where you die every time you run out of bullet time oh excuse me slowmo due to your guys amazing reflexes include a bunch of superstandard guns and environments and voila a highly rated greatselling gamewhy do people love it
one word  graphics
yeah those bullets look so amazing whizzing by you in slowmo  who cares
looks dont make a great game
gameplay doesin fairness fear
excels in several areas
first the combat style is innovative and fresh even though it wears thin after a while
the slowmotion option is a nice touch but the programmers should have let you use it only in certain situations
as it stands in the game its far too easy to slip into slowmo and eradicate enemies without much problem
the game would have been ten times more difficult if this ability had been limited
as it was even while playing on hard level i died only once or twice and beat the game in a relatively short period of time
secondly as noted by other reviewers the sound and lightning effects are superb
the shadows are especially good and can lead to some scary moments
third its nice how the programmers included a function that lets you test drive the graphics frame rate prior to actually playing the game
this lets you determine which bells and whistles slow down your system and which do notunfortunately the good aspects noted above cannot outweigh the bad
first off the violence and language are taken to a ridiculous extreme
thankfully you can reduce the gore somewhat in the game menu and there is a patch that removes most though not all of the foul language but thats not sufficient to salvage the effort
the game would have been just as good  even better  without all of the needless violence and potty mouths
other games especially those in the adventure genre create legitimately scary atmospheres without resorting to cheap horror movie tricks remember the best selling pc game of all time is a nonviolent pointandclick adventure game that is truly unique
the key to creating a sense of scariness is to leave most everything to the imagination of the gamer
fear
does this well in some instances but in others it jumps overboard and drownsin terms of story and level design the initial missions are quite good but the novelty quickly wears off into boredom
one of the good things about half life  is the level variety
there is constantly something to engage your mind not just your trigger finger
in fear the levels are basically the same and the pattern grows tiresome
the story is pieced together in a fragmented way
i had to search online to figure out what exactly happened in the end
the system requirements are also way off the charts
i have a fairly decent computer ghz pentium  gb pc ram geforce gt graphics and i could not run the game on high resolution without getting significant lag
even with the graphics turned down i could only get an average of  frames per second which is not the best
perhaps its due to poor programming since half life  provides equal graphics without eating your computers hardwarewhile there are some fun aspects overall the game gets a losing score due to needlessly excessive violence and language a terribly plotted story and boredominducing levelsthis game is so popular only because of advertisement
just think about these facts the single player is so short that it take no longer than  hours and the story is extremely stupid especially the ending when there is nuclear explosion and our hero flyes out of there on helecopter
the multiplayer is one of the worst fps multiplayers
coupal weapons similar maps same skins and few stupid modsthe only thing about this game is its graphics but they aint looking so good it just will be very laggy unless you have the best video cardit is secured by securom which means if you have any cdemulators installed this game will not workwill say something like security modul cannot be activated
if you ever had this problem with any games you definitely will have it herealthough this game is fun to play it is a nightmare to install
my husband spent several weekends trying to get the game to install and play without crashing even though we more than exceeded the minimum requirements
after countless hours with tech support and on gaming forums after my husband pulled what was left of his hair out just kidding and cursed and threatened and verbally abused the game and its developers not kidding fear
is finally up and runningonce installed the game is a really fun  but linear  fps
with headphones on and the lights out some parts are really creapy in a good waysi doom  te parecio poco preparese para ese nuevo fps
fear es un juego reciente ke porta no solo uno de los motores graficos mas exquisitos sino tambien una tematica de survivalhorror nunca antes vista digna de una produccion de hollywood
la accion y el miedo se combinan perfectamente para proporcionar una experiencia llena de adrenalinafear
was hyped to be one great horror shooter
it delivers some good visuals good positional audio butthe story is way too poorly covered to convey any real sense of dread  ok youre fighting evil but how and when and why alma became this evil agent is never really explained  nor is most of the rest of the storyits doled out piecemeal as youd expect with a horror game but the first  of the game has  of the story while the last  when you get to the underground site has about  of the story squished into a small timeframe and area
thats right       
so where is the other 
apparently hopefully somewhere in the sequelthe game plays like a cardboard cutout shooter too
the weapons are wimpy except one which has too wide of an area of effect to use it for most of the game
the levels are very drab run of the mill shooter stuff  big pipes and wooden crates are everwhereits also very short and the ending because of the story elements left out of the game comes up very abruptlythis shooter is nothing newsadly its the same old resident evil clone dressed up in a  era enginethis is another game that wont run on modern pcs
again i went online  as this is a fairly new game and it should run in compatibility mode but it will not
i found out that once again the developer went out of business and there is some flaw in the runtime code
the people that are running it searched the internet for enthusiast fixes
there is no developer fix
if you like to fiddle with your software to get it working  buy it
if you like it to run without spending days trying to find a fix for something that is inherently broken on the net then this is not for youunless you are never going to cancel your subscription do not buy this game
the stupidest idea anyone has ever thought of if your subscription is cancelled for more than  months you must buy a new copy of the game subscribe and start over
unless you paln to never cancel your subscription i would suggest not buying this gameasking for this retarded game and having someone waste  on dollars on a gift for me when i could have bought something fun or useful no more square enix for me im boycotting after this waste of time
a game without an ending or point is retarded this game is for people who dress up like elves goblins hobbits etc
in their homes and want to share their idiocy with the world it doesnt use a microphone it is the most complicated game for anything i have ever seen in the game and just trying to get into the game it is very laggy even with cable internet it is not the best looking for graphics it has very inneedofhelp controls for movementdont buy this just for this game
trust me
unless your a diehard ff fan then its your gamble
i got the harddrive for socom  and for all the games that will use it in the futurefrom spotty controls to boring combat this game will not satisfy any sort of action buffs yearning for a good video game
dont waste your moneythis game is pieced together from digital photos taken on the island of capri
the island is a beautiful place and perhaps it is worth the price simply to wander its roads and trails in this photo format
however after you have walked everywhere and picked up all the obvious clues you honestly do not have a clue what you are suppose to be doing
i must admit that i did not solve anything that i would consider a puzzle before i quit playing out of boredomi was drawn to this game by one thing and it turned out to be far from the truth in my opinion
the box says quotthink myst but in a real locationquot  not only does it not even compare to myst in any way but i found it  boring tedious and pointless and after  days of wandering aimlessly through it and having no fun at all i uninstalled itthis is the worst game i have come across in a long time
it is hard to understand the accent and there is no way of knowing what you have to do except to talk to people with these accents
if you buy it you will not even try to play it to its fullest as it is a dud
stay away from itagain an interesting concept that just doesnt work well
this game is like looking at someones lousy and boring photo collection of their trip to capri
i sold this game back to a store for a fraction of what i paid for it
it really sucks
another case of intriguing packaging hiding a very lame product
oh welllive and learni really really wish that i had read some reviews of this game before i bought it because now i cant return it
i could have spent my money on something much better than this string of snapshots with voiceovers attatched
if this game were freeware i probably would have liked it but its not
instead its a twenty dollar game that plays like freeware and has packaging like mystincidentally it was the references to myst on the packaging that led me to buy this game
the packaging says quotthink myst but in a real locationquot quandary
true like this game myst was basically snapshots of a fictional world that you could occaisionally interact with much like this game but theres a few big differences between myst and this game
myst never really felt like a string of snapshots to me because the world it depicted was so beautiful and mysterious and the puzzles were so engaging
capri is beautiful but moving through it is confusing and frusterating
there are so many places where one street looks just like another which makes getting turned around or lost really easy unless you check the map every step of the way and doing that just makes the game feel even more clunky
i enjoyed the scenery in myst but i could care less about the many many snapshots of streets that a quiet weekend in capri includes
there should really be a better way to navigate the world of this game
i havent finished this game yet but the puzzles mostly seem to involve doing errands for people which combined with the frusterating navigation becomes incredibly tedious
the people themselves are another annoying aspect of the game
its impossible to talk to any of them which seems odd for a game that takes pride in being located in a real place
youd think being able to talk to people would add to the reality of it
the people themselves are also snapshots by the way
they are never animated even when theyre talking  even myst animated talking people
there are in fact very few animations in this gamethis game has for me redefined bad games
i cannot believe that someone allowed this game to be released
its amazing to me that someone seriously thought that basing a game off of thousands of touristy photographs would be a good idea  and some of the photos arent even all that good blurry with bad composition or lens flares
my plan is to sell this game as soon as i can
although i cant get cash from any of the places in my area i can get game credit
the next time around ill make sure i thoroughly research the game before i buy it
this game may cost only twenty dollars but its a waste of every one of those dollars
do yourself a favor and get something better
if you want to try this game wait until it hits the bargain binsif everyone has the same problem with a game thats a bug
you shouldnt have to play a game  times to get through it
ive had characters disappear on screen not be able to interogate witnesses evidence be collected and then disappear
ubisoft the games manufacturer says it is a noted problem but the patch they gave does not work for all the problems
i feel that they rushed this game out to capitalize on the past success of the previous game
time between announcement of release and release was a scanty  months
is that enough time to put out a quality computer gamealso i had one other complaint about the game
now it wants the cd in the disk drive for it to work and it doesnt matter which cd
in the previous version you could do a full install and not need the cd for it to run which i thought was a definite plusso wait for a unbugged version or get the original version which even though it was short it worked
dont waste your time or money on this
i was extremely disappointed as i love csithis may possibly be the worst game i have ever played in my life
the game is more like a horrible rpg than and action shooter
all you do is walk around find the bad guys and tell your men to shoot thats right you dont even get to aim you just tell your entire team to fire
i dont think this game even deserves  star
the reason i put  star was because they wouldnt let me put  i wouldnt pay more than  for this game
trust me its a horrible game and stay away from it
i can understand that this was made to train the troops in the field but at least make it fun like americas army
if you like this game you should be shotit disgusts me that they would make a dinky fighter out of such a revolutionary moviei read all the reviews and thoughthow bad could it be i mean its fight club well let me put it this way i only paid  for this game and was still pissed and felt like i was ripped off
i hated it so much
the moves suck and are way to hard to do and the game is just real boringand they sure talk about fight club and project mayhem quite openly two things they are not supossed to talk about at all
i hope by the time you read this and all the other reviews you take our word and decide not to waste your time or money like we didif you love the movie youll hate the gameto say the idea of making a video game based on fight club raised an eye brow was saying it lightly
what could have been an otherwise decent fighting game is loaded with glitches bugs horrible controls blocky graphics and a lame fighting engine
not to mention that since the games license based on the book by chuck palahniuk and the revolutionary film is the main selling point of the game if you took away the license this would just be a run of the mill fighter that is a wonder it ever got approved for production
none of the fighters save for bob look like their movie counterparts which isnt surprising but it would have been nice you can only beat up fred durst so many times
also each fighters moves are so generic and similar to each other that it seems like not much thought had been put into the game
all in all fans of the book and movie who may have wanted to check this out are better off leaving this on the shelf where it belongs its not even worth rentingill make this short and sweetthis game blows from clunky bad controls to the obviosly showing unfinsished gameplay and desighn
save your self from playing this garbageget the film its excellentlatesthis game sucks big time
the characters are retarded lookingthe gameplay is crapthe music is very annoyingthe game modes are dullits just an all around bad game
you can tell whoever made this gametried their best to make this a tekken cloneand failed terribly
there are some unlockables in fight clubbut they are not worth the time to unlock
overalli highly recommend you dont pay one dollar for this game
if you want a good fighting game for your psthen pick up any of the mortal kombats or any of the real tekken gamesand leave this piece of garbage alone
if there is any reason at all to buy this gameits to laugh at and nothing morehello and welcome to my review
this game isnt that bad but the interaction and alot of the controls of this game are alittle too hard for most players
i had no problem but many of my friends were using words to describe it that isnt worth mentioning
the storyline is alittle dry with no real mission laid out and only through dry humor can you advance in some points
it would have been nicer to have a list of choicesmaybe in the next version
it was too easy to beat and did it in less than hrs
so if your bored and renting a gamethis is for you
if your a hardcore rpgrthen you want something more to sink your teeth into
just my opinion
 happy holidaysthis is not good game and the graphics are dated
i really purchased this as an addon to pacific fighterswhich is also produced by ubisoftthe level of realisim and flight models are very poor and the control setup and user interface are very user unfriendly and would be very difficult for the novicedesktop flyer
over allthis is the worst simflyinggame ever made
dont waste your money on this onejust blew  on far cry and pandora tomorrow  no more purchases from ubi software  guess we all have to install regular cd drives to play this companys games  well im physically disabled and not going to pay  for some to install a  part to play a  game one companys games  so many decent games out therefpsrpgrts im not jumping through hoops to play anyones game  if it doesnt work on my system as it is ill pass  i have no copy software just one basic cdrw drive that came with my computer  i hope ubi software take a nice revenue hit for this bs antipiracy nonsensejust a friendly warning to all cdrcdrwdvdrdvdrw drive owners
ubi soft as a feature on their pc software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity
why they feel that will slow down a game cracker and why they dont mind blowing off an entire segment of the market is entirely beyond me but thats not the point here
call ubi soft tech support before buying this or any other pc game from them and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install
software such as chessmaster  just to grab a random example doesnt come with a warning on the box in some cases they claim  i havent found a single box that does nor is there a warning on the amazon product pages short of reviews like this
one could speculate that theyre perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some wont be able to install it but ill leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imaginationubi softs tech support has said that this feature extends to all of their pc titles
so fair warning particularly to folks with laptops where dvdcdrw drives came standard ask before you buy
perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy ubi will smarten up
flawed because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isnt going to slow a determined game crackerpirate down its only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game
worse they dont find out until theyve opened the package and tried to install which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the sellerim certain this game deserves more than  star and suspect it will see some good reviews from people who are able to install but i cant give it more than a single
thats a commentary on ubi soft and their feature not about the game itself
in fact when i get around to writing a review of the xbox version it may well merit a star ratingi love mk games so i bought this one
i dont know why this game is just not a great game
it is not a bad game but i honestly would rather play the first mk on game boy color
this game is only fun the first ten minutes or so
this game isnt worth more than  dolors but that is only my opinionthis is not the game you want if you were introduced to the series by the  title red dead redemptionit is a completely different game and you get none of what made the rdredemption so greatstoryline  horrible
depth of character is nonexistent
storyline follows several different characters but it doesn teach you much about them at all except they have a reason to killopen world exploration  none
its level for level
hell even n did worlds better in giving you games where you can just explore
in redemption this was probably one of the best features
you were in the old west
not in this game
its completely linear set up level by level
going into the sheriffs office takes you to the next  minute long level
each area has nothing to explore
even the original mario one provided more to explore with their secret pipes
the main town in this game has a total of maybe  buildings half of them closed
shooting up the bad guys  soooo not fun
everytime you shoot a bad guy they go into this character animation where they react to the hit
cool right
nope
once they are in that animation any additional bullets you shoot their way do not count until they are done with the animationif you are like me considering buying this game bc you have a hunger to satisfy before red dead revolution is eventually announced and released go buy some western movies i can recommend a few
bc this game is a huge disappointment
its not even a genuine rockstar game
it was developed by someone else and picked up by r after they shelved itthis game might work okay on xbox but it freezes up on xbox  when battling bad bessie even though it is supposed to be compatible
there is supposed away around this but it is very hard to dostay away from bessie and kill her at the same time
yea righti just want to let people know how much dissappointed i am with this game
i just threw away my  bucks
i have a state of the art computer system and i can play every other online game with no issues like ut city of heroes all other battlefield series farcry novalogic new game joint operations and i have no problems
meaning no lag
bfvlag plain and simple
it feels like you are playing a game in slow motionthe game is a memory hog that leeches to your system resources until your system cant spare anymore and dont release them which equals to severe lagpoorly written code
either your guy would freeze up for a few minutes or would move in time delayed jerky movements
you can pretty much do nothing other than getting frustated at being totally hopeless and getting killed by the time your get some normal movements back and the process starts again
the game also spawns you right in the middle of a fight at your base at the same point everytime and you are a open bait for spawn campers
the graphics are also pretty unimpressive compared to what we currently have out there
i tried majority of the servers out there same lag issues sometime it wont even let me log in while there are more than  vacant slots or more for some weird reason
i uninstalled the game for good after trying the new patch reinstalling the game etc
i have gone back to playing the orginal bf and its stable expansions
i would never buy another ea battlefield series game again until its out for couple of months and gets good reviews
its game that was released in its early beta state to mint some money
save your moneyor buy this game and burn ityour choice ofcoursei know nobody cares what i think but bf  and bf vietnam are perhaps two of the worst games ive ever played
in  the controls are of course completely dated and terrible though i dont care about the graphics theyre pretty cool actually
bf vietnam does a great job at atmosphere
you really feel like youre there in vietnam
but then what happens
the control of the weapons is trash
talk about clunky
the call of duty series blows this game away in every regard
sure call of duty could learn some things from this game  how to use bigger maps and vehicles for example
but as far as actual gameplay and excitement call of duty is infinitely better
there were times in this game where id go maybe  minutes without even seeing an enemy
all you do is walk around keep walking keep walking maybe this is like real war but if i wanted to be a real soldier id go join the armyonly for the internet unless you like playing in a small old school sandbox smaller than the first gta lol anyways i luckily sold it whew i hate games for the internet i need action in my little world not playing with some dumb punky little kid half way around the world i have a new near topoftheline athlonbased system with equivalent advanced graphic card a gigabyte of ram etc yet this game was still full of bugs and play was mushy at best
at different times i would get a sort of flare on the screen that would block out half of the action and effectively render that particular game over or unplayable
as a result i have only played this game a couple of times which hurts given the expense
i have tried looking for patches but frankly i resent having to spend so much time trying to effectively repair something that should have worked out of the box
this game looks promising with all of the new equipment but if its not going to work smoothly then it might as well be junk
unfortunately i dont have a nephew to give it away tounplayable fps
gameplay is very jerky long loading times two minutes or more when beginning a new scenarioyou have to sit through almost an entire song while waiting annoyingdistracting lag when trying to go from stand to crouch to prone awkward controlfeel when attempting to pilot aircraft which i couldnt get the hang of despite endless attempts overall a big disappointment traded in to eb for ten bucks after a few days
reccommend call of duty insteadthis game is horrible
the best part of the game was the training mode where you could run around and shoot moving targets like duck hunt
even then the controls were worse than gta
its difficult to shoot accurately
the programmers know this thats why as long as the target turns red its a hit even if it looks like a no chance shot
you can drag bodies and switch clothes but it all seems rather pointless
you can try and sneak around but it seems like it doesnt matter
you can just kill them however you want anyway
reloading is riduclously slow too and before you die time slows down and so it seems like it takes f o r e v e r there are a lot of other games out there
i dont recommend wasting cash on this one
if youre looking for a shooter like halo try kill switch
if youre looking for a sneak around game like metal gear try tenchu
if youre just looking for more violence take it up a notch and try manhunt
save your money and pass on hitmani wanted to play this game but the sellerhernando games and owner cl
brand run a shady business
they sent me a game i purchased as very nice condition that had scratches and smudges all over it
he then had the nerve to tell me that they buff and polish their gameswhat a crock
he told me he would handle this personally and told me i could keep the game but would like to show his staff
i sent back the game because it would freeze at the end of the first stage or i would have kept it
then he insults me by saying that he would expodite the order
dont go through the same thing and buy somewhere else
there are thankfully businesses that keep their promise of satisfied customersi tried to like this game but no dice
i kept on comparing it to the much better smackdowntitle by thqthe controls were lame the wrestlers seem to be punching rather then wrestlingduring a match after about the th or th bunch they bleed already
the wrestler seem smallcompared to smackdownlook i have been a wrestling fan for about  years now andthis game really disappointed me
the reason i gave any stars is because of the roster ofwrestlers it hasmy advice save the  for smackdown vs raw by thq the real authorityon wrestling gameswell i learned my lesson with rockstar and rented this one
i bought gtaiii because of the hype and hated it
once i got over the newness of running around anywhere i realized how much it sucked
then i bought manhunt which was unspeakably terrible
i rented vice city which was alrightthen in some moment of madness rented san andreas which was a ugly ps level graphics mess of a game
like gtaiii it was frequently too hard and frustrating and definitely not worth the effort
which leads to the warriors a bad game based on a bad movie which plays badly
what more is there to saythe landscape is changing in the gaming market
no more are sega and nintendo the uncontested big boys of the industry
after knocking out nec atari and snk both sega and nintendo thought nobody would come along to challenge anymore
but then came sony with the playstation platform and now another solid heavyweight has tipped the scales and heavy they aremicrosoftanybody that played halo even if they didnt exactly fall in love with the game experienced the raw power of what xbox was capable of
no longer are lan parties and first person shooters just a pc specialtythe xbox is a lowcost high powered gaming pc in a proprietary case
housing an intel pentium  processor invidia graphics a decent hard drive and a builtin rj ethernet port
the system comes with the microsoft controller s a refined and overall better design than the original microsoft controller
you get four controller ports like on the nintendo gamecube
dvd is an option plus you can download your cds to the internal hard drive
some games alow for personlized soundtracksplaylists like dead or alive extreme beach volleyball and even counter strikethe system is physically large and heavy
of the three major systems its the bulkiest
but dont let the large design detur you from taking a look at this system its whats inside that really counts and this system delivers the goodsthe xbox suck  the hunk of junk failed when i played for just  minutes
i got it running again for a while when i tried to save it got automatically deleted
any slackjawed idiot would see that most of the xbox games are on the computerduh
i threw mine away instead of giving it back
then i got a ps a few days after the ps worked like a charm nothing bad happened
well sure you have to buy memory cards for the ps but its worth it
what if you run out of memory on the xbox what will happen huh
what
open the electricution in a box
and if your trying to fix itat least i didif its broken dont try it will just damage the game and i knew what i what i was doingmy dad works at a support center for broken electronicsif i were you trust me i know get the ps its more durable and you can play longer for like over  hours since i was playing gta san andreas for ps not xbox
and take note if you want a game thats on ps but you still want to keep your xbox you have to wait a year or more for them to come outwell most of thembuy a ps its betterwhere do i start
ihate the xbox
not one thing about it appeals to me except a handful of its games
its a bulky system that weighs more than the combined weight of the brains of the people who bought the xbox
the controllers themselves are larger than a ps or gamecube
it was made by nerds for nerds
most of its games are on at least one other system and just made for the money
microsnots plan is to create a device that will net them even more moneyooohh look at me im microsoft im going to mak a bigcrappy game system so i can be even more rich
then ill buy out all the good game companies and turn them into mainstream crap
i would rather drive a very sharp stick covered in dog doo in my eye than even own an xbox
theres not much more i can say about a system with only  different letters in its name and controller that feels like an iron maiden
oh yea and buy the way the only reason that their online is any good is because the system is made by a company that builds computers
of course writing this review is a waste of time because xbox owners and people who would consider buying an xbox cant read anywaythis system is completely worthless
ill start with the hardware itself it doesnt work
the hard drive is not nearly as effective at storing information as normal memory cards in fact it often decided to erase my save files on a whim
i have never had this problem with a ps or gamecubebut this problem pales in comparison to the paltry game lineup
lets face the facts unless your gaming palate consists entirely of generic action games licensed garbage and edgy adult titles you will be bored out of your mind with this thing
oh sure it purports to have rpgs in the form of trash like fable jade empire and kotor but these are just more generic action games dressed up in rpg clothingoh and news flash pretty graphics can only numb your brain to the pain of mangled game design for so long
once you wake from the ooooh it looks so good stupor you will realize that you are wasting your timeas for me i found one single game that was halfway decent on this console and even then it was a game that also appeared on other systems
and still worse halfway through it the xbox erased my data
yippeeunless you are a braindead b addicted to violence and mature content or c clueless as to what a good game consists of skip this clump of dung and buy a ps
or even better a gamecube
a sweet decadent purply gamecube
ahhh blissive had my xbox for barely five months and it just stopped working
bestbuy left me on hold for  minutes and microsoft tells me i can spend  to have it serviced or spend another  to buy a brand new one
 day warranty my a
its a great system but my recommendation would be to get the extended warranty
 my girlfriend bought me another xbox and that one also broke
this time after  months
luckily we had the extended warranty
maybe i just have bad luck but its been really irritatingi guess xbox is ok i know a lot of you are like drooling over it but im not anymorethe goodsgraphics are nicehalos funonline playis very fun wit friendsthe badsvery small selection of gamesgraphics are no better some games are terrible
sound is no betteris very bulky and delicatedefective ones were reliesed the whole first yearselling a  dollar machine for  now is your just buying a cpu so whats the big deal about xbox livexbox live charges an arm and a legjust get internet accesscontrollers are friggen huge and annoying
the small ones are  to spendystuck playing the same old games over and over and over againconstantly screwing up on me toowell i rest my case
xbox sucks
its good for a few things and thats it
dont blow your moneythis game had many faults in my opinion
there was almost no storyline
you could talk to characters to play minigames solve puzzles and problems and move to new areas and although they gave you a necessary collectible item they had no affect on events in the storyline
in fact only hunter spyro sparx professor and red had any effect on the main storyline
only spyro professor and red would be considered main characters
as for the actual characters about seventyfive percent or more had annoying voices comments characteristics speech ways of talking mini games puzzles and problems and tasks
some had five out of seven annoyances
it made you not want to even bother listening to most the characters
the mini games were usually terrible
with sparx you had to avoid getting squashed crushed eaten run over or attacked more than three times
you had about three weapons but usually only the standard weapon was useful
you could speed up or slow down but only temporarily
the last sparx games were easier than the first ones since all you had to do was shoot and dodge enemies instead of also avoiding obstacles and opening doors in addition to fighting
blinks mini games were also boring since basically you either shot squashed tackled or bombed enemies
most could be shot far away by zooming in so the only challenges were making sure you didnt get to close to some enemies jumping at the right time for something to land or grab on to and having bombs left over to destroy the dark gems
st byrd mini games were a little better though not much
basically you used bombs and missiles to destroy enemies who often couldnt fight back and either targets or cannons
you also flew through gates and hoops
spyros mini game was the worst if that is possible
you aimed and fired at a certain amount of enemies before they killed passed or stole from you
hunters game play was okay but usually you could zoom and shoot enemies before they knew you were there so the main obstacle was not falling off a cliff or getting knocked off one by an obstacle
spyros adventure mode was fun since you could use electric fire water and ice breath and bombs charge and horn dive enemies while gliding jumping or running to defeat enemies
environments were varied and skills could be learned from elders
some of the puzzles were boring but for most part playing spyro or one of the other two dragons was fun
objective is to destroy dark gems and collect eggs and light gems throughout game
overall spyro was fun mini games were boring most characters were annoying in one way or another and the storyline was too short and silly
if you want spyro with more actioncombat realistic graphics good characters and storyline and no mini games try the legend of spyro trilogy
it focuses more on fighting than exploration and puzzles but is much betterespecially for kids older than ten or younger kids who like action without blooddespite the unsatisfied reviews of some people i am going to buy this game anyway
mainly because i love spyro and i want to own all the spyro games
i just wish the spyro season of fire and spyro season of ice were available for the ps format instead of just gameboyi grew up on spyro
i played every other game in the series and when this one came out i was reall excited
i never even finished it
why
because maybe  or less of the way through i came to the conclusion that the game was terrible
i was about  at the time and this was the first title i ever sold back to gamestop and never regretted my decision
heros tail was my last spyro game and in my opinion its where spyros fate was sealed and i got off the ride
this game is barely a shadow of what spyro is supposed to be
its not even a so different it can be fun sort of change its a its so different its a forgettable mess that killed the spyro franchise sort of change
this is the sonic  of spyroi have been a fan of this series ever since i picked up the first one with my brand new playstation in   it always seemed to know its place in life as a bridge between old d platform games and the present
it used the new technology to update platforming with humor and attitude of the characters along with great sound effects and background music
in this title whatever theyve done with all these elements just doesnt add up to the same charming experience as previous outingsmovement in one general direction collecting objects is gone and replaced with a free roaming enviornment
i didnt see very good clues telling you what you are supposed to doing or going next
the d environment makes it challenging to perform the classic crash moves of spinning or bouncing on top of enemies with accuracy although i suppose you might get used to that over timeit is really easy to die in this game and it took us  or  attempts to get past the first level
at first i sort of liked the music but after roaming around trying to figure out where to go the music got irritating and seemed to loop pretty often
the graphics are attractive but are missing the previous versions style  polish
in the previous titles crash was very expressive and you could see a sort of dumb look on his face
that type of thing seems to be missing in twinsanity
even collecting the fruit is less fun the satisfying slurppy sound is gone and the fruit doesnt always fly across the screen into your fruit countto sum up with all the great platform games out there there is just no reason to buy this one especially at full price
pick up jax ii or rachet  clank going commando or both off the greatest hits shelfthis is the very first mmorpg i have tried
after playing it for a month i am definitely not impressed
i knew about the monthly fee and read many differing reviews so i decided to give this game a go
the character customization is the only thing i really enjoyed
afterwards the sheer amount of just running around and clicking the same buttons over and over again just to attack attack attack
what this game seriously needs is something besides talking to an npc or attacking
the incredible amount of time it takes to level up and complete later missions of just fighting fighting fighting made me truly ask myself why is this worth  a month
i could get more fun out of the original dragon warrior or final fantasy
i would only recommend this to a person who is both a true comic book and mmorpg fani bought the gamethere was a bad disk hours later i had a website to download the whole game fromthat  hour wait was the longest ive had from a csr sincethe game does what it says it will and more
you become a hero fighting villains and interacting with a huge community online
you get to create your hero from scratch
while every power that might cause a trademark infringement is not in the game you should easily make a hero that fits you and what you want and then dress them as you likethe first major free content release is here after a series of minor patches and tweaks and additions
now costume options are even more profound
there is more to do for those who spend  ours a day playing this game im not one of them so im still taking my sweet time and enjoying the game and got bored rapidly
there is a lot more for folks like me for when i do finally make my hero strong enough to face the new dangers addedbotoom line they added a lot
more is going to happen this fall
next year they release the villain side of you to play
over two hundred thousand players active communities and lots of fun
check out the website before you buy if you have any doubtsyou needa mid end machine with a decent graphics carda high speed internet connection
your aol dialup is usable but will prolly leave you frustratedtime
just take time spent watching tv and turn it into playing this and you might avoid getting divorcedthe game is suitable for teens
the content folks and csrs vigorously enforce any violations
there is a profanity filter on as a default at start
the chat window can be closed for the unsupervised very youngplay the super hero you have inside you and make some new friends onlinepeople starting the game fresh will eventually come to despise it or rather the developers as much as the legions of veterans whove quityou see every few months the developers rebalance their vision which typically results in massive changes to characters that players have spent months and months playing
for some they can respec a process in which the developers  admit that theyve screwed up the game so much people need to redo their characters while for others the changes are so severe and illplanned that their characters are rendered completely uselessi still have a level  electricityelectricity blaster that is completely unplayable under last falls fix
and that happened after the developers promised no major changes which convinced me to pony up a few more months of fees
never going to make that mistake againi strongly urge people looking for a welldesigned mmo experience to try world of warcraft at least until the marvel superhero mmo is released
city of heroesvillains is simply not worth it
the server populations are shadows of their former selves and even the new players who didnt experience what the game used to be will eventually be burned by the developerstheyre crooks who constantly nerf player powers to try to slow progress and wring more money out of their customers
not to be trustedi cant believe i just wrote that
but its true
the developers just abused the community trust too many times with lies arrogance and clumsiness
stay far far away from city of heroeslefty hitters expirence a power outagethe ball only goes maybe  as far compared to rhbsand jose gulliens arm stregth is a  he has a cannon for a arm
whats up with that and the dynasty mode is seriously messed up cause minor league players never turn out to be any better than avg playersi must be getting over the d platform genre or something cause this game is just plain boringto complicatedwhen you cant get teamplayer ratings right you cant make a good baseball gameoverall

i played  and  inning it was enough for me
everytime i made contact it was a soft roller to nd three straight times the same result
i got one out pitching with a system that looked like making kick offs which is difficult to master how about doing it over  times
three pitches one out one double and one home run i had enough
graphics and player models look great but its no fun if you cant play the game with out being a hardcore game
anyway baseball has become so bad of lately why spend  bucks in this game when there are better sports or action games less complicated specially if you dont have time to spare in order to play a video gameso i sit here playing my xbox and i glance at the svcchaos game box and i wonder why did i buy that game
ladies and gentle men this will be a very short reviewthis game is garbage
i am a long standing d game fan and snk is almost the lone survivor of the d age
so it saddens me when they release a game like this which is such an obvious rushed and uncared for release just to satisfy contractual demands they had with capcom
low res graphics and i mean sub par neo geo graphicssound is even worseskip itbuy capcom vs snk eo muuucchh better better everything snk really dropped the ballafter playing guilty gear this game jus would not cut itthis game was so bad and left so much to be desired that i someone who never writes reviews was compelled to write one just to keep other people from buying it and ultimately further rewarding an extremely subpar release
the game play is horrible
the graphics are sloppy
the animation is unfathomably choppy the frames per second are very very low  maybe they couldve gotten away with this  years ago on nintendo version  or something
if youre expecting anything like arcade gameplay look elsewhere
this was something that was dished out to the public to make a few bucks and not much more
quality and effort just werent put into this gameblah wasted moneyi think that this call of duty was to hard and the gameplay was to slow
i didnt enjoy this game
i didnt have fun while playing this call of duty
i struggling to keep alive and make my objectives
too hard for me atleast
rent before buying this one or play call of duty  big red one if you have just the original xbox and your looking for a call of dutyactivision shouldve reconsidered before hiring a game company like spark limited to ruin a whole epic
why couldnt they hire infinity wardif you are a call of duty crazer avoid this
this game is more like designed by an unskillful ametur company
even if you see a teaser trailer of the actual game footage they create a diversion to gimmick
the intro movie in the game has got nothing to do with the game at allgood thingsnonebad thingsplenty youll find them in call of duty fines hour
the modelling and graphics are rushed and a few number of weapons are missing from the pc version  weapons omitted from the release like the mp and all the pistols are gone and only one rocket launcher which is the panzershrek
all the classic weapons from the original pc release isnt includednext downside pointtight aiming
the feel of the weapon your holding is absolutely a shocker
you cant even aim correctly at a far german  it will move too fast causing you to waste time and get asassinated
comparing this to the pc version aiming with the mouse is easier to usewhy cant we not forget
saving during missions
guess what there is no saving ability during missions and you can only save after a mission
pc call of duty has a inmission saving ability incase if you get stuck on something
finest hour doesnt  every time you die you have to start sorrowly from the beginning all over again back to square one and builds up frustrationthirdly is the looping music
ripped from the mp music from the pc version but causes continuous looping at a point
michael giacchino deserves better than thisand yes it takes forever bloody hits to finally kill a german and its unrealistic
if you shoot an enemy in the head on the pc call of duty then the enemy dies instantly
you wont see it happen on finest hourso sad spark unlimited get to learn how to program games so sadthis game is the worst game i have ever played
the graphics look like yur playing on ps and the ai is really stupid
the commercials made this game look awsome but it is know where near awsomei played this game for  hours with my year old son and it was unbelievably frustrating
ive never played a game before with such horribly designed levels where you fight your way through hordes of bad guys for  hours only to find yourself facing a bridge and the wrong xman character to get across it so you have to start all over at a longgone save where that particular character is still alive and someone manage to keep himher alive long enough to reach the bridge
the camera view is horrible so that you can only see about  feet in front of your characters
there is no way to heal your most vulnerable characters because there are woefully few health drops
the ai
controlled xmen characters are so freaking stupid that theyll walk right off a cliff and die which means you have to constantly switch from your favorite char to one of the idiot ai
chars to get them in the right place and they constantly get stuck and are too stupid to jump over little obstacles to keep up with you
this game is fun when it works which is only really when youre playing solo or player coop when you dont have to deal with the stupid ai
overally i became so frustrated and angry while playing this game that i had to shut it off
only an xmen fan would give this a star rating because the game levels are a confusing mess the ai
is stupid there are no clues for solving puzzles like crossing damaged bridges and you have to use a specific xmen character to solve certain parts of the game with no warning in advance and that char probably will die before you reach it
horrible horrible game
the only game ive played thats worse than this is tmnt for xbox and i play about  games per yearits nice to rent if you are saving up for a good game
i wouldnt invest in this game as the graphics are cartoony
the only good thing is mid mission if you find an extraction point you can change characters
but the game play is nothing like advertised on the tv
save your dough for a good game and rent this on a rainy dayfirst off garbage is stuff you throw away and xmen legends needs to be thrown away
i bought played it for about an hour and then use it to eat hamburger helper off it
i not even going to go into details
if you think this game is fun
your garbage tooi got this game a few months ago and i have only been able to keep it running for a few hours of gameplay
and the companys technical support doesnt know anything at all about their product
i let them know what is wrong give them crash logs everythingand they still cant figure it out
it got to the point where i gave the game to my friend and i just play it at his house all the time now
dont get unless you know exactly that it is going to worki bought it to play with my little niece and nephew but i was disappointed
the game is not a game
its tens of little games that have horrible graphics and last  seconds
they are pointless and confusingthis is the worst mario game ever
its to easy to beat and its boring
dont buy this gameso mario vs donkey kong
nintendos latest shameless capitalization of a oncevenerable series of games
i bit the bullet and started playing this recently curiosity winning out over the recent experiences with mariobranded games
despite such tragedies of game design of the last  years like mario sunshine and wario world i still harbor warm feelings for the mario games of the late th century forgetting time and again that as their management and lead designers age and stagnate fun clever original games like those are seemingly forever in nintendos pastthe game started out alright an interesting puzzlefocused twist on the mainsequence super mario series they eliminated the venerable stompingenemiesandgrabbingpowerups formula and replaced it entirely with simple logic puzzles in underwhelming levels usually no larger than two screens worth
you can still jump around but marios jumping range is no higher than about twice his height which for mario is absolutely pathetic
he also moves at a constant rate of speed no matter how long hes been running making nimble jumps practically impossible and skids randomly when he stops i found myself constantly plunging into crevasses and falling off cliffs wondering with utterly genuine surprise and confusion why the character was receiving commands i wasnt inputting
probably the biggest sin of all though is the ludicrously short distance he can fall before pancaking on the ground and whining like a toddler
and if youre falling while holding something hell pitch the item across the screen once youve fallen a certain distance forcing you to retrieve it once hes done feeling sorry for himselfalso marios got the same voice actor theyve been using in mario games for years charles martinet who produces an entirely testiclefree whiny broken falsetto soaked in an italian accent that rings less authentically than a wichita godfathers pizza commercial
after maybe  minutes of gameplay i was nearly in tears begging the gods of video games to make him shut up even if youre mother teresa you can only really hear that mama mia
croon a limited number of times before a primal urge to exterminate mankind kicks in
and god help you if you let the rescued minimarios fall off the screen on the mini mario levels until you retrieve all of them which can sometimes take a while theyll continuously shriek oh mario
every second or so like starving lupine infants producing a sensation that i can only describe as cannibalistic rage mixed with crippling nausea
one of the biggest letdowns in the game is the inability to pitch these mewling little parasites into an active caldera forever silencing their demonic little voicesdonkey kong himself is probably the strangest part of the game though
during the opening cinematic we see dk sitting on his fat simian butt in his house flipping idly through channels until he sees a commercial advertising some kind of weird mini mario dolls
then suddenly hearts appear in dks eyes
i am not making this up
it appears to anyone with more than one digit in their age that donkey kong is either harboring a secret lust for everyones favorite effeminate plumber or has a sick fetish for plushie toys
the latter becomes evident as we see dk break into the factory and steal one sack full of minimarios crippling the entire toy doll industry
apparently in their panic the ubiquitous androgenous little toadstool slaves forgot they could just turn the machines back on and uh you know just uh make more
instead mario comes to the rescue and follows dk through six worlds of improbable puzzles rescuing one mini mario on every levelso yeah yet another failed opportunity to restore the mario franchise to some mote of its former glory
im sure nintendo wont care as itll still undoubtedly make them money but its yet another shovel working to dig their corporate gravei absolutely loved the original rise of nations
fantastic rts game
also extremely stable this will be important in a moment
i upgraded to this expansion after about  months of rise of nations
it immediately transformed my gaming experience from one of delight in a deep complex and endlessly replayable rts game into one of unbridled frustration
the expansion causes the game to crash constantly and without warning although i often get an amazingly helpful exception
window afterwards
it crashes during loading
it crashes during saving
it crashes at the start of the game
it crashes  hours into a game
it crashes when  units are fighting
it crashes when a single peasant is walking
it will even in something ive never seen before crash in the middle of crashing
it is without doubt the least stable game or expansion i have ever played and ive played temple of elemental evil
i regret the day i bought this expansion because it has so colored my view of the game that i dont even like playing the original anymore because i half expect it to die with every move
the nominal benefits of the expansion  new nations a few new campaigns and tweaks to some old nations are slightly outweighed by the fact that you have no chance in hell of playing or finishing any of them
avoid this expansion at all costsfirst of all this game is pretty fun to play even though the voice acting is a bit cheesy
great character dev nice pocket universes to visit and such but i agree with the previous reviewer talking about starforce
i went to the website to check out what in heck it was and my pc was left alone until i came on the particular topic in thier discussion forum and then my privacy settings warning message came up meaning that if you even got to the faq you get bombarded with bs
i volunteerely installed the demowhich by the way also uses starforce and have had no problems but that doesnt mean you wont have problems
i warn you do not buy this game
it is good but not worth it to puke up your system
i was waiting to save up enought to buy until i read that reveiw and then went to the very sitelarian and found out that thier was indeed such a program that installs and that it can cause reboots and other system problems on some peoples systems
i dont normally believe what i read but i reaserched it and found that it is not mentioned in the eula at all
some idiots on the larian forum said that they would have to mention every file installed not so just the significant ones
i think this quotdriverquot should be mentioned
doesnt anyone have any common sense anymore
i have no problems on my systemyet but out of principle i am not going to buy this game and encourage more violations to my freedom in future games such as quotphoning homequot and paying a fee everytime i load the game
its just a silly game and not worth iti didnt know a game company could install a programdrivers onto my computer without informing me
and the only way to uninstall the programdrivers is to get the removal program from the game company site  its not even included on the cdgame 
talk about shady and underhanded tactics
i refuse to allow anyone to have access to my computer so this game is being returned
with so many worthy games available im not going to add to what hopefully doesnt become the industry standard if you want to play our game we must have access to your computer
the risk just doesnt outweigh the reward fans of the survival horror gaming genre were no doubt excited by unraveling the mystery of sirens errie japanese town with the terrifying past
sadly the premise is about as exciting as the game getsthe prosthis game is a really gorgeous visual treat
the chracters are rendered with a new technolgy that actually wraps realistic images onto d computerized planesthe setting has been developed well
the village of hanuda is a scary place cast in eternal darkness surrounded by a sea of blood and of course the siren going off in the backgroundthe cons and there are manythe game developers dubbed the game with a british voice over crew which in the beginning is comical but after awhile just feels ridiculous
for some people this may not be an issue at all but for me it just seemed distracting playing a japanese guy and to hear him shout oi mate
wait up
secondly the gameplay is terribly limited and redos abound
more skilled gamers may not have to replay missions as much but i found it hard not to be killed as  of the time your only defense is to run and hide
the game employs a drop down menu to issue command to your character
the menu is easy to use but truly annoying
a good example occurs on the first mission
your goal is to escape a bad guy via car
the drop down menu asks you  would you like to pick up the car key
 would you like get in the car
 put key in ignition
 turn key to start car truly gets to be cumbersome to game playlastly the game uses a event system time table for you to keep track of events as they happen to all  playable chracters
while that sounds convoluted in itself it only gets worse that you have to play all ten characters and not one at a time
the game is broken up into missions
for exampleone mission may involve a journalist and reveal certian parts of the mystery and these events are recorded on the time table
the next mission you are introduced to a new character and complete the next mission and learn more
you must refer back to the time table to try and piece it all togethersiren was a truly exciting idea thta really failed to deliver
i dont feel many people actually completed as i myself grew bored and gave up halfway through
if you truly want to be scared and enetertained i recommend fatal frame  or  as both are in my opinion the best and scariest the genre has to offerhow can you have a game where all the characters are japanese the setting is japan and yet have all the characters speak in uk english with uk accents
talk about spoiling a great thing
siren  is supposed to be on the horizon and hopefully the games makers will come to their senses and include the japanese audio track for all releases
it could have been right up there with silent hill but instead the realism and thus the intensity and scary factor is lessened because of the lack of a japanese audio track which could have been easily included since this game was released in japan with such an audio track
those responsible for releasing this in america must have made a major mental lapse  i hope so because if they actually sat down and thought of some reasons to not include the original language track then theres simply no excuse no justification
ridiculous just plain ridiculousits a star wars game but its a pretty bad one
ok the graphics look awesome as a multiplayer game i could see this being good
single player mode can have two extreems easy or hard
those arent selectable settings but the way you choose to play
at each level your character becomes immediately involved in a large battle your character is one of many fighting this battle and there are no specific goals other than taking over command post
you can elect to piloting ships steal an atat etc but this really only serves to bring  a loose bit of freedom
it makes the game a giant mush without any order to it
you can fall back and let the computer controlled team mates win the level for you or you can engage in combat and usually be destroyed almost immediately
bottom line this is a poor game
one of the worst star wars games ever made
save your moneyi thought this game would be awesome based on the reviews but it sucks
the graphics are blurry and pixelatedi have an awesome hdtv so no its not my screen
very disappointedthe battles in this  game are kind of short and whats worse winning them  doesnt depend on the level of player participation
as one reviewer noted you can win many battles  in this  game by killing one enemy or none at all
maybe its different with online play but ive not ventured into that arena yet and have no plans to in the futurethe graphics are much like the cgi of most george lucas films theyre kinda pretty and also kinda plastic and dull
the same goes for the sound effects
the laser blasts sound well they dont have that much ump
also noted by one reviewer the player isnt at the center of the action in this game
its just an all around dull experience i wont be renting the sequelmy first piece of advise  do not buy this game until an official patch is released
i am not the only person saying thiseven then you should be leery until maybe a nd patch is out
this game is loaded with bugs the graphics engine consumes your cpu and ram no matter how powerful your system is
please read on  i dont hate this gamei just think they should have tested it before releasing it to the publicthere are many fansites with forums
in the forums you will find people screaming and yelling from the rooftops about how bad buggy and choppy this game islet me make myself clear and explain what i mean by beta for those that do not knowwhen a software company creates a program it typically goes through several stages before being released
beta is a version that is almost ready for sale to the public but needs to go through test drives first to hunt and find problems crashes bugs mistakes etc
this version would not be sold or released to the public for widespread use
no waya release that is ready for widespread public use or sale is called a gold or rtm version
this means that it runs beautifully very few bugs or crash problems if anywell vampires bloodlines is nothing but a beta
i can prove it
keep readingi have a p ati x  gb corsair rametc
you name it i have nothing but top of the line latest and greatestthis game chugs along
it consumes over  mbs of ram when being run i get choppy frames and lots of lag at timeshow can this be
easy this game was not meant to be released so soon
i think there was pressure to get it out before xmas
the code and graphics engine behind this game was not ready for retail releasebloodlines crashes at certain parts of the game lip sync is off on many characters some missions of the game cannot be completed graphics errors and goof ups abound while playing the game the combat action is terrible involuntary switching from st to rd person disrupts your game play
i could go on and onthe good diverse campaignsmissions funny interaction with characters some interesting weapons to use very creative game with clever ideas and lots of thought put into the conceptthe bad missions become repetitive lots of level transitions that take forever to load
lots of talking about meaningless things with characters
it almost seems like they added this crap just to keep you busy
the graphics are nice but the characters are stiff and unrealistic lookingthe ugly parts of game cannot be completed successfully parts of game cause you to crash to desktop there is an unofficial patch but it does not work under many circumstances slow load times choppy framerates music and voice sync is off in many situations
the worst part is the collision detection part of the graphics engine
translation you can be stopped dead in your tracks by a measely drinking cup or piece of chair on the floor while just walking but worst of all while being shot at or chased
talk about ruining the gameplay experience
this game was not ready for primetime and should never have been released so soon
i think this game will be a good game once an official patch or two have been released and proven successfuldont buy this game until these issues have been resolved
trust me on thisthis game was to short i beat it in  hrsthats why i gave it  star for overall stars for the funess because it was kind of fungame sucked just didnt like it
the first problem i experienced with this game as the key code wouldnt work
after getting a third code it worked
however the game play sucked just couldnt get n the game
wouldnt recommenddont buy this game because it doesnt work on windows  even though microsofts website clearly states the game is compatible and should work with no problemsthis is another game from this manufacturer that refuses to play straight from the box
i have a system that exceeds the minimum requirements and a video card that it says works fine with the game
however the game refuses to work just the incompatible card message pops up all the time
no matter what additional drivers are installed or additional tweakingit matters not
these people should be sued for poor performance
let the buyer bewarei had high expectations for this game
i played the single player demo and the multiplayer demo  both worked fine on my nearly brand new system pghz  gb ram radeon xt mb xp sp
however i installed my purchased copy only to encounter some firewall vbscript error at the end of installation and then when attempting to play the game it cannot find the installation cd disk
i attempted to install the game on my second pc and encountered the same error
so i returned my copy to amazon and requested an exchange for another copy since i suspected maybe the disk was damaged
i received my nd copy only  days later great return process amazon
 reinstalled the game and again had the same error
i have a liteon ldws dvdcdrw combo drive and updated the firmware per information i found on the ea site but that didnt resolve anything
i havent had any other compatibility problems with other games ex ut and this drive or with the drive itself so it must be something with the game
i guess ill have to go back to call of duty for my wwii genre action gamingi loved medal of honor on the xboxps so i thought i would give this a chance
as an experienced gamer i had high expectations for this game
big mistake
took forever to install and the load times are horrendous
i start playing the game and i get to a part where i need to rescue a wounded soldier
i cant even get through the doors below deck because of the fires and everytime i attempted it the guy i was trying to rescue was burned to deaththis game is terrible not what i expected
i uninstalled it and got rid of it
i do not recommend this game to anyone except diehard military fansthe seller was buynowlv
i paid  bucks
it worked fine on my pc running windows xp home spi took a chance on this game based on what i read about it and based on the good reviewsits about mobsters copsrobbers and organized crime so you can expect scenes with drugs prostitutes etc
i thought the game was darkgloomyan example of gameplayopen a door and there are mobsters to kill kill them
then go around a cornersame thing
over  over again
i thought it was boring and i stopped playing after an hour or soi would rather replay a game that i previously enjoyed than play this game for the first time
before you buy this one checkout some of the gameplay videos on youtubevisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsmidway has officially changed the title lineup on this collection show your anger and write them a bad review
they removed stun runner steel talons and the original mortal combatonce again the only way to play stun runner at home legally no mame is to buy an arcade jamma or the only console version which is pretty good atari lynxbefore i start this review i want to say a few things
i am a long time gamer i have lots of love for all genres especially jrpgs and i am fairly lenient on games
i try to find enjoyment in games that are simply unenjoyable or have many issues
however i am sorry to say that fable the lost chapter brings a new definition to the term garbage
it is simply the worst game i have ever played in my entire life
now i will tell you whystory  it blows
it is very disjointed and is hardly enjoyable
it is your very basic story about your family being killed and rising to become a hero to beat the evil
nothing more and nothing less
im fine with that but the way the story presents itself is dreadfulvoice acting  atrocious crap
a  year old child could bring more emotion to characters than the people who did this
it is unbelievable in every sense of the word
the characters seems lifeless and the voice actors are annoyingmusic  nothing memorable at all
i know you dont have nobuo uem or tsuyoshi sekito but damn not one good track at allgameplay  its bad
you will essentially be button mashing the entire game with the exception of occasionally healing yourself or casting a lame animation spell
the goodbad system in the game is flawed beyond belief
i know that if you commit bad deeds you should be punished but this game forces you to be a good guy or else you will have to pay massive amounts of money which is simply impossible
the entire system is unnecessary if you cant choosetechnical issues  loads of them
there is popin screen tearing freezing and many other various glitches in the game
my favorite game of the current generation is bug ridden as well the last remnant but at least it had good va story gameplay and amazing musici know this is coming off as a huge rant and i dont mean to offend any of the fable fans
however i was just extremely disappointed with this game after hearing just glowing impressions from them
i am just ashamed that i spent  dollars on this and i bought the nd one as well which i am just horrified to openim sorry peter m but if your other games are as bad as this one i will have to agree with your comment about you never making a good game
if you like wrpgs i would recommend that you borrow this from a friend or rent it first so you dont take a leap of faith like i didrating  abysmalokay whether you have high expectations or none at all this game just doesnt work
for one the whole freedom of choice thing is a huge lie
if you want to be good you can rescue the same people over and over for evil you kill them repeatedly
thats it
second you cannot choose where you want to go and what you want to do there
this game is missionbased just like every other bland game this year
oh sure you can choose which mission you want but if you choose any but the right one youll find yourself getting killed in an instant
so no matter what you do you have to follow a linear paththe gameplay is a mess as well
the combat system doesnt work half the time youll often accidentally target people instead of enemies and even when it does work youll still get killed because your skills arent powerful enough
how do you get them more powerful
by going to the forest and killing bees until you level up
hmmm where have i heard this before
in every single other rpg to hit the market perhaps
unlike better games where you always find yourself at the right level to move forward if you take on all the available enemies fable forces you to go back and forth between areas to get the enemies to respawn watching a long loading screen each and every time you exit and enter an area
what funeven the noncombat interface is completely dilapidated
menus were a monster to navigate and it took me a good ten minutes just to get my equipment on
and dont get me started on my attempt to use the controller customization featurefinally there are the things that arent broken exactly but are still annoying
like the people for example
even when you are just walking through an area perhaps on your way back to kill more bees npcs are constantly chattering away in irritating accents
you cant get a moments peace
also you can call me a prude if you wish but i cant believe that burp and fart have their own buttons
this game is rated m for mature but perhaps it should be rated i for immatureoverall fable is an annoying clunky and frustrating game
far from the promised revoloution it delivers a package that doesnt even meet mediocre standardsoverhyped is not the word im thinking of
ripoff is more accurate
this game had so much potential but falls flat in every way
while the new revolution in thirdperson pointofview camera work makes you never want to go back to baldurs gate the blatant false advertising that proceeded the release makes a case for class action lawsuit
the trailer that is shown on cinematech has nothing to do with the game
there definitely wasnt any consequence for my actions as the makers would have you believe
good or evil made no difference except  you get a halo or horns
big whoop
and dont even get me started about the confining story line and the whole two minutes in took to beat the final boss and take the game back to eblame lame lame
the makers should be ashamedrent it if you must
but resist the urge to snap the disc in half at the endof course it has now turned the m rated game into a for adult for specific reasons
shooting innoncent people for no reasondoing missions like having sex with girlshijacking carskilling and killing over and over
okay so you pretty much get my idea of all of the violence
but what most of you want to know is the gameplay
it does have many glitches and although driving in a car can befun all of the gameplay is boring and not good at all
want something good to teach your kidswhat about e rated games like kingdom hearts or katamari damacy
but oh my gosh stay away from this game
waste you own money and time if you have the guts toodespite the claims that this game would be so much more everything than other gta games its just more of the same with a few added tricks like swimming etc
the worst thing about this game is the frustrating missions
when you get to the first date missions youll see
you have to drive  minutes to get there there is nowhere to save within miles and miles then you might chase the guys  of the  missions for  minutes then some car might pull out and crash youand then you get sorry they got away
after some sh like this happens a couple of times and you waste hours just getting back to square one youll be tired of this cr like i am
i deleted this game off of my memory card and i was happy to do itavoidwell this is a wonderfull game
it teaches people that it is fun to run around with automatic weapons and shoot people for no apparent reason
the first thing that i see is a bunch of corrupt cops mug your character and take his money and then beat him
i can barely stand to look at this game because it is so sinful
i was watching a friend play this and he pulls out two sub machine guns and gun down a man on a motercycle just for the bike
he then goes on the road and shoot at cars while the people are inside
this game was banned in australia for crying out loud
you can even get prostitutes and use them for sex and then kill them
i dont understand why it could ever be fun to just go out and kill people even in a stupid video game like this one
i dont mind any other shooters such as halo or call of duty because your not gunning down innocent people
the few aspects that i do like are changing the radio station on the car and parachuting out of airplanes
everything else is just sick
this game sucks and all the copies should be destroyedi dont understand how this game got a best game rating at the spike tv vg awards other than by bribemy friends and i rented this game to see if it was as good as its hyped to belooks to me like rockstar did a rush job on this game because the physics suck
how realistic is it for a guy on a biycle to be able to knock over a telephone pole
or to be able to explode a car by punching it enough times
these guys arent doing drivebys its more like a park  shoot
and the driving physics also suck worse than davilexs knight rider the game
the worst part of san andreas is the gangsta ddr segment where you press buttons to dance although youre actually just doing the same boring moves to the same song over and over nuttin but a gthang
snoop dog musta been stoned outta his mind or paid an arseload of royalty fees for use of his and dres songs because im sure hes played better games than this one
or maybe snoop hasnt even played the game at all and just decided hed endourse it for no reasonthe bottom line is this game sucks
it plays out like a really crappy urban gangsta flick and it perpetuates the stereotype that all black people sell drugs beat hookers do drive bys on each other and kill cops
believe it or not there are some really intelligent african americans out there who have college degrees in medicine and dont speak in ebonicsa few years ago when i had just recently gotten a ps i was super pumped when i got this controller
it was getting great reviews i found it to be more comfortable than the official sony controllers and mine was working flawlessly for a few months
the rubber contacts on the buttons are made out of some ridiculously cheap rubber that even the chinese knockoff makers would probably laugh at and it was not long before my x button started sticking when it was depressed
for fighting games like soul calibur  and mortal kombat deception you need lightning fast response from the buttons
one sticky button completely ruins this controller and eventually all of them will wear out due to the terrible material logitech usesi actually considered picking up a logitech wireless ps controller at one point since it uses the same form factor and hoping that logitech finally learned their lesson about the crappy material i figured it would be easy to swap out the rubber contacts from the ps controller to restore my ps controller betterthannew
however i learned ahead of time that logitech uses the same crappy material in the ps controllers and the buttons wear out just as quickly
i will probably never buy a logitech controller again
my official ps controllers still work just fine after many years of making jak and daxter jump platforms and doing kombos and fatalities in mortal kombat and that durability is worth putting up with wires for
logitechs terrible neglect for quality materials ruined what would have otherwise been the ultimate controller for ps ownerslike several other people have observed the buttons on this controller once depressed tend to stay that way
ive had two of these logitech controllers for my ps
on the first one the r button didnt spring back once depressed which made games that went relied on the r nearly impossible to play
on the second controller the x and square button started sticking as other reviewers have said these are two of the most important buttons on the controller ie broken x and square buttons  no gameplay
even if all the other or most of the features on the logitech controller are solid the inability to play videogames using this input device makes the whole package uselessand what about the graphics
as a strong iy fan i was looking forward to this gamewe  bought it some years ago and ive just now gotten around to playing it a biti say a bit bc i cannot stand another  minutes of it
deformed graphics waaay too much talking thattakes forever no real action
seems geared to the very young kiddie set
i just cant take this seriouslybut i am seriously disappointedthe reason i got this game is because of its overall concept of being able to explore a dangerous zone on earth
as i grew up in eastern europe the atmosphere reminds me at my experience during the communist eraive played many fps games and recently finished fear doom  hl and far cry
the graphics ai and overall gameplay in stalker are pretty weak compared with any of the games mentioned above
the ai of the enemies is very poor the gameplay is cumbersome as you have to micromanage very many little details and reading a lot of dialog text is annoying
during play you will have to spend a large amount of time in inventorythe load times are very slow due to what it seems to be poor caching and memory management
the reason i believe that to be the case is that it even takes a long time to go back to a recent quicksavethe slowness and other bugs i encountered made me apply a patch that was released recently
the new patch broke all my saved games and i had to use a unlimited health trainer to speed up the process and get back to where i was
wasted about  hoursoverall the game play is poor and the support is terriblethe freeflowing nonlinear gameplay is hamstrung by the fact the game forces you through timed linear missions where you will save restore restore restore restore kill another mob repeat the saverestore process over and overi have been playing fps titles since wolfenstein and was one of the first people to play doom while it was still sharewear and this one is perhaps the most frustrating one i have foundeven on novice it is too hard
part of this is because the maps have bottlenecks where sadly you are the one entering into a tight killzone where  mobs are well hidden and shooting at you
part of this is becase the mobs are too hard to killmaybe the programmers think it is cool to make human opponents that can be shot pointblank in the face with a shotguntwiceand recover before you can reload your shotgun which hold two rounds and shoot you dead
personally i dont enjoy fighting ai controlled opponents with infinite ammo and superhuman resilienceoh and just to make things even more fun the mobs you are assisting on the missions tend to all die within the first  seconds of battlealso i have seen people talk about the rpgaspects of this game
there are none
if you play all the way through to the end your character will have the same skills as when you started
and he will still only be able to carry  pounds
while  pounds may not sound too bad remember you carry loot back to your home base and sell it to make money
well since you have to carry around first aid kits and ammo and food and bandages and  weps what that means is if you carry around enough of those items to use on a mission you are coming back with no lootdo yourself a favor borrow a copy from a friend before you buy it
if you like it after trying it buy a copy
otherwise save your moneylike most games the difficulty level is absolutely ridiculous
need a game that non experts can beatlets start with the things i likedthe run down look of the environment smart ai nice textures and i especially love the pdf map
the appearance of the human npcs gives them a gi
joe kind of looknot goodeven after version  its brutal on your system specs but should run much better on newer mid to high end gaming machine
i was running it on a pentium ghz with gb ddr with an x xge agp card
it stuttered and froze up george bush at a kanye west concert
it was not open ended it was scripted and linearthe unforgivable no vehicles
five years in the making should equal at least a skateboardway too political
from the enemy factions to the military it felt like i was playing red dawn the video game with mutants
what happened to the stalking
i bought the game for stalking not call of duty type actioni had to go on the internet to find out why the game kept giving me a german error code after i tried to start it for the first timemine is a relatively old system but i should have never had to boost my virtual memory to gig for the thing to even startuninstalled it chucked it in the closetit has no minimul system requirements listed and whether or not the internet is required
that automatically draws a one star review from me
sorry but ive gotten a dozen programs in the last two weeksonly two of them work on my systemall because i wasnt given the minimal system requirements so i would have known betteryeah yeah yeah oldtechno should have looked it upno no no the manufacturers knows we need this information they failed to list ittheyve got my moneywhat more do i want from them
so here they arewindows  sppentium  gig amdxpmb memory ramgig hard disknvidia geforce ati radeon mb directx c compatable graphics carddvdrom drivedirectx  compatable sound cardif you play it on the internet you need kbps upstream to play  kbps to host  playersbye
you know this is probably gonna be a fine gamefirst of all i gotta say im a fan of the game series
i watched them all on outube when i had a weaker computer
but now that i have a good one i bought the game to check it outthe game has  fix patchesremember when games didnt need patches
i installed them and started the game on medium difficultythe game is very buggy andwrong
enemies can see you through bushes walls smoke etc and they shoot you when they shouldnt
they know your position all the time
throw grenades at you and you wont know who killed you
they have infinite ammo as wellanyway there are tons of bugs and technical bugs
such a shame
the story is nice and couldve been a great gamethis game takes place in russia and was written by russians that have no idea how to write a game
actually this is just a sorry excuse for a game
the game is fundamentally flawedeven after it gets patched
and the patches will keep coming
dont waste your money
i would have rated this a negative  stars if i could havewhat makes me so upset is that this game had the potential to be one of the best games ever designed
it is almost like the designers studied every one of the games finest features and decided to deliberately and utterly make them frustrating and stupidthe biggest game killer for me about this is that the single player game is treated like you are hosting your game as a server as you often see the disconnecting and synchronizing clientsave that garbage for multiplayerthe problem with this is that all the stuff you kill in the game respawns the very next morning every day totally destroying and ruining what could have been a satisfying experience with working your way through the game
the same bandits you kill over and over keep ressurrecting and attacking you as you pass even while the corpses of their previous bodies are still laying at their feet
and of course the unique npcs if they are killed and they seem to be pathetic weaklings compared to the respawning bandits and their godlike killing abilities where they can headshot you at  meters with a pistol  do not come back so if they were a quest turnin too bad  the designers thought that god like near unkillable respawning bandits was more fun for your immersiontotally destroyed
do not buy this wreckthis game isnt that good
the battle is slow and i just didnt like it disagea looks much better get that or another rpg
dont waste your money on this gamei wonder if the people who have so far reviewed the bards tale pc on the web actually played it or the demo or if they are relying on the reputation of previous games with the same name to make a judgment call about this game
i do not believe many did play it because if they did they would have seen how frustrating and how little fun the game becomes as it drags on
yes the voice acting is funny and enjoyable but a cute and quirky story cannot make up for the games overall poor designduring certain animations and more importantly during battle the game will slow to a crawl comparable to the lag you might experience playing a newly released mmorpg on a dialup connection
the slow down is a known problem for users of certain models of geforce and radeon cards but not all users will be affected
as of the date of this review there is no support for this issue and no official forum for discussion of such tech problemsdont rely on the game box and screenshots as a judge of the game environment
basically we are dealing with a slightly modified old fashioned topdown view with the added bonus of trees and other structures that must become transparent to allow you to see your character as you move under them
due to the limited field of view the minimap becomes essential to know what is a few feet away from you either because you will not be able to actually see monsters until they are practically right on top of you or because they will be obscured if they move under trees that you are not under at the same momentyes you have companions that have cool powers that will be helpful in different situations
but no matter what you do if you are ganged up on by more than three monsters at once you may as well give up and load your game
this is because most of the monsters you fight have a tendency to knock you down or stun you for some time when they hit
basically if you cannot block perfectly you will be roundrobined to death as you enemy takes turns knocking you down and doing damage to you while you cannot stand up and recover
meanwhile your companions will do whatever would be most illogical in such a situation healers will run forward and fight monsters with their fists warriors will stop fighting in the middle of a battle and simply stand still ranged weapon users will fire at monsters offscreen drawing them into the battleforget about the claim less a more i the monsters arent any better than most gamesyou will simply be overwhelmed with numbers in most casesoverall the game is sub parthe price at release is low for a reasoni bought this game only to find out that it would not work on our pc
if you do not have a tl vidoe card it will not run
be sure your video card is a tl before you buy this productive played vietnam games a lot like viet cong nam and this one is right up there with them
good graphics storyline and weaponslove the part where planes come in and napalm an area
the load times are long and no gauge or level to see how much time before gameplay startslot of swearing and bad language in the game  but its a lot of funsierra brought us many wonderful titles over the years including the kings quest heros quest police quest and leisure suit larry serials
in most cases they did a good job putting together creative cute situation driven puzzle games
here they delivered an appalling blend of poor graphics bad language and simplistic game playgone are interaction with characters puzzles and good writing
instead one plays simple d minigames and views poorly developed cutscenesthe game is a bizarre blend of exceptionally childish humor such as fart jokes and random acts of notveryclever profanity coupled with  or  minigames so shoddy and simplistic they recall the days of cga
too simple for those over  too profane for those under  this game would not be worth playing if it were free
at  sierra sells their reputation and little else
i will think twice and read some reviews before purchasing another sierra productwho are these people who review and praise a game that hasnt even come out yet
yeeshthe reviewer below says that it should be as good as the previous larry games well theres something you should knowthe leisure suit larry series was created by al lowe who made every title until he and hundreds others were fired by sierraal lowe had no contribution to this title even though sierra said he would be involved
this title is the concotion of a third party developer who have never made an adventure game in their life
from previews ive heard the game is alright but its obvious that is hasnt got the distanct influence al lowe gave his games to make them personal and fun
another critcism i heard is that it relies too much on nostalgiafor what its worth im not getting the game until al lowe gives his apporval
id advise fans do the same but please dont praise a game you havent played yetor is this guy below me a marketing gooni notice that theres no mention of al lowe anywhere from sierra
heres the simple truth  if the genius creator of lsls    is missing then this isnt an lsl game at all  just a cheap rip offmessage to pointyhaired bosses at sierra you can buy the lsl concept
you can buy larrys image
but if you dont have al lowe you dont have anythingthis game will amuse and entertain an inexperienced  year old kid
so if your not in that age rangeskip this gameit is dull repetitive uninspired
this game was hyped up to sell you on the concept that it was going to be a baudy risque game for adults
well there is certainly no nudity
there are certainly no interesting game moments
you spend your time playing skill games equivalent to frogger to accumulate points to score with the targeted female
yawn
it is brief dull pointless
here is the worst partthe scumbags behind larry sierra which has been teetering on collapse for years now are releasing an uncensored version that includes nudity
so if you already wasted  you will have to do it again
heres a tipif you already own lslyou can download nude patches for the game from some of the popular gaming websites that will make it exactly like the uncensored version for free
just google it and youll find itsave your money
teach these guys a lesson by not buying this game
make them pay in green for doing crappy work hyping a product and trying to stealwaste your moneyi bought this game thinking it would be like star wars meets unreal tournament
boy was i wrong
i dont care about the pretty graphics or all the vehicles i can drivefly
this game is just another battlefield title
i hate the battlefield series
 starshmm ordered it a week ago and they amazon still havent shipped it hopefully the reason is that they are going to send me a version that worksread online many of the cds are bad anyhowif the game is anything like  ill be happyhowever hearing it locks to fps on online sounds scary oh well maybe by xmas this will finally shipi thought this game would be a great one and an improvement over the first ee
well not quiet this ee has nothing to offer the grqphics look like the ones in age of empires ii realeased in  i believe
the game runs slow i have a computer with the following specificationswindows xpdx cintel pentium   ghz gb of ram ram video cardand yet the game runs slowi love empire earth i because the graphics are good and the game runs smoothlythis new released now is a major disappointment and i dont understand why if the graphics are not good
the gaphics of this game look like a paint by an abstract painterif you have played the first empire earth you will see the difference between ee i and ee ii and you will go back to the first onesave your money and play ee i ntil these guys come with a real improvement over ee iwhat could the game designers have been thinking
ive been ambivalent about dynasty warriors  to begin with but id learned to accept its shortcomings
but in this installment in the series its almost like the shortcomings are the only things left
they took the least fun and most annoying features of dynasty warriors  and made it the sole purpose for dynasty warriors   empires and the result is a supremely monotonous and charmless gamefirst of all its as if they felt that the old enemies werent powerful enough with their dozens of archers interrupting your every move ally soldiers who love standing around watching you get pummeled unlimited musou special attacks for enemy generals and overlarge maps that take forever to navigate
now to add to your misery you have enemy generals who respawn indefinitely enemy troops no longer have to emerge at a gate they can literally materialize beside you from thin air enemy commanders can pull one sixhit combo that takes half your health the player can be infinitely juggled so that you can lose your entire life bar if you fall down just once
if the computer opponent happens to be behind you you may as well kiss the fight goodbye theres a new type of enemy the sorceress who can shoot endless flameicelightning at you so that you wont be able to get up for about a minute straight special items arent available every turn you have to wait for some kind of production schedule theres a low limit as to how many generals you can have in your roster and no your characters items and achievements from dynasty warriors  dont carry overthe game mechanics have been altered so that now the emphasis isnt on fighting uh isnt this a fighting game
 but capturing these annoying strongholds
and to do that you have to kill every single enemy within a large radius
so if one enemy troop hides in a nook from you youll have to run around looking for him
also you now have to run from place to place and ignore enemy generals just to capture these strongholds fast enough that your allies dont screw you up in your other locations
level after level of this  its amazingly dreary
you can forget about using some of your more eccentric generals the only characters that matter now are ones with a very long weapon range and crowdcontrol abilities
i may have  characters available but the fighting mechanics and supercheap computer opponents mean that i only use two xu huang and lu bu
they may as well have gotten rid of all the other available characters because trying to use zhang jiao or meng huo in this game is suicidethe gaming equivalent of an eternal root canal
save your moneyi think my title and ks review says it all
unless youve played sh games before andor are absolutely a survivaldemented horror freak do not buy
rent if you are curious then youll only be disappointed in a small sum of money wastedi cant believe i wasted forty minutes of my life beated retarded dogs with metal poles
i was hoping it would get better or something trying to find reason for wasting thirtyodd bucks on itthen a ghost showed up and i said screw this crap
and i played good games like mk deception and burnout people need to get a reality check
just cause video games are popular now more than ever new and hyped dont mean good
old school games like the original mks tekken old wolfenstein for its day doom  and rainbow six were the good stuff
and those arcade fighters the side scrollers with big guy the martial artist and the middle man were awesome in their day
and diablo  dont get me started
all these games in their day were defining
revoluntionary
fun
halo silent hill midnight club quake  halflife  were hyped yesterday and are being hyped today
someone persuaded the masses somehow to buy them and i got caught up in itbring back games with imagination and  gasp  an actually satisfying fun factor
these days its hard to find the good ones burnout  mk deception return to castle wolfenstein amongst the throngs of retarted trash
grand theft what
pixel porn and finding the best way to torture and mutilate people punisher manhunt
no wonder people think violence stems from video games
by removing the fun and innovation thats all they got anymorei dont think im even shure that is from the silenthill seriesthis game is confusing and it gets sortof boringyou might like this one if you like walking around never finding any thing realy diferent from the same floating in bodyments that hurt you when they touch youi rented it and hated itthe set up sounded interesting enough
man trapped in apartment which showed more signs of decay as the time passed
man finds hole in wall andin his desperation to get outdecided to go inside and into a hellish adventure
game startwhen actually playing the game though suddenly you wish that the main character james townsend would just succumb to the monsters ghosts and other unnamable creatures trying to kill him
why
because nearly everything is wrong with the gamefirst the good stuff the graphics and the creepy atmosphere is on par and above when compared to its playstation  predecessors
someone mentioned the graphics is brigher than before which is a great welcome since i wasnt too much of a fan of the too dark to play atmosphere
the music is on key providing an appropriately somber welcome during the introduction and an antcrawingupyourspine chills during gameplay
this makes the bonus soundtrack included with preorders a gem to ownnow the bad stuff
i do not like the new inventory system one bit
you can only carry a small amount of items and when you accidentally pick up useless ones you have to trek back to your house ill talk about why that gets tiring later and put it in your magic infinite box
but you cant risk not picking up the item because you might need it and you need to pick up it up to read the description of it
this limited inventory system is made even worse by the fact that each clip of  bullets for your first gun this goes for later firearms too takes up one space in your iventory by itself
sure in your magic infinite capacity box they take up only one space for all the bullets but in your pocket yes one space per clip
this makes guns a very unreliable source of protection or you can run home everytime you run out of bulletsassuming you had any
ammo is terrible scarce even on easy mode
you can rely on your trusty melee weapon near the beginning but later on the enemies are too tough one big healing resource is taken away from you and turned into a source of hp depletion and you have concerns other than your own life such as getting a good ending to risk just bashing the enemies brains in with a shoveladding to even more trips back to your pad is that fact that the only place to save is on a notebook in your apartment
so yes you have to go there everytime you want to save
horrible
when im in the middle of the story i dont want to make an extra special trip back to my apartment just so i dont lose an hours worth of playhealing items are also scarce so in the first half of the game anytime you needed to heal up your hp you run home and wait for your hp to fill back upthe trip back to and from the apartment through the hole in your wall gets tiresome around the fifth time to do it
leaving the apartment you get the same animation for warp speed into the depths of despare through a stone pipe everytime and no matter how many buttons i press i cant skip that movie
same thing with returning to your apartment you have to endure the annoying james is not a morning person ritual of getting out of bed that takes way too long for it to be fun when youre on a routine trip back to your place for a save or to drop off some itemsthe ghost enemies are the most annoying enemies ive ever encountered
at first i was scared since i couldnt kill them and their mere presence depletes your hp but soon they just grew into a pain in the rear
in a certain level there were a lot of narrow passageways
if a ghost were to approach and they approach fast you would have to take it down you can stun them before proceeding that would have been fine if its undead body doesnt block your walkway
so you find yourself in a hopeless situation that causes you to find the nearest exit leave and come back into the room hoping you can outrun the ghost this time before it blocks your pathokay so this could be made up with a great story
silent hill  wasnt the most innovative in gameplay but the great backstory made up for the small number of flaws and made it a fantastic horror experience
this time the story could not overcome all the problems with gameplay
bits of the story is revealed as you play but it just doesnt happen fast enough for is not riveting enough to keep me interested
james seems like a nice enough guy but since you mostly encounter the dead or people who arent key to the story for the first half of the game you dont find out too much about james at allive been a big fan of the silent hill series since the first game came out but this one is just utterly dissapointing
i know they didnt rush it but the problem might be they tried too many things that just didnt work
im a fan of creative innovation but just because its new doesnt mean ill praise it
back to the drawing board with you konamithough i admit the premise is intriguing and the atmosphere is spooky as hell there is very little real substance to the game and im not sure why i continue to play these silent hill titles
lots of walking around whacking these creatures with a plank of wood  thats not my idea of fun gaming and i find it disappointing that in some ways silent hill has set the standard for survival horror lower than it should be
they all pale in comparison to other games in the genre like fatal frame resident evil and clocktowerto see how ripped off nintendo is lets do a simple conversion maththe goal is to find a  blocks card has how many mega byte or kilo bytelet us do some calculation bit   byte mega bit or byte   kilo bit or bytememory card  blocks   mbit  kbit   kbyte   mbyte kbyte   blocks   kbyteblockhow much is nintendo charging
how large is playstation  card mega byte   mbit   blocks    blockshow much are we paying for  mbyte sd compact flash or memory stickaround  or even freeand who wants mb cards these daysnot a lot of people almost no one
most people today are going for  to  gb or gb for flash memory for psp mp videos and pictureslets use the   mb   blocks as of todays standard
that means  blocks should cost    wow so nintendo is actually over priced by  by charging at so in conclusionnintendo is  over charged consumers for only  mb memory card which no body even use today for any mp players nor usb massive storage device with even many times faster speed than this gamecube card
the saddiest part is for those people who has wii and want to play gamecube games they are forced me use the gamecube memory cards
you cannot save gamecube data on wii internal memory nor sd cards
nintendo is creating a hazzles to consumersthe wii will destroy the card at randomall saves on the card will corrupt
they will remain corrupt when moved to a  or a   they remain corrupt when using the card on a real gamecube
the card remains corrupted when all saves on the card have been erased and new saves are started using only a real gamecubeits a  white brickthe backgroundi purchased this  memory card when i bought my wii
i never had a gamecube so i thought id mess around with some gamecube games due to the wiis backwards compatibility
deceptively with no issues i played several gamecube games on my wii over the course of a few monthsthen i played fzero gx with  on wii
from that point on my  was bricked and all my saves were lost
are certain games save mechanisms not compatible with wii
is the wii randomly introducing electric shock to corrupt the card
the cause may not be known but i have a  white brick
it cant be formattedill consider buying another someday but only to use in a real gamecubethis piece of s corrupted on me out of nowhere
i was enjoy playing my videogames and all of a sudden the saved data erasedby this point most gamers have tried the original donkey kong
while not quite as iconic as pacman donkey kong was effectively what put nintendo on the map in the gaming industry and the debut of a certain jump man who would later be renamed mario
you may have heard of him
he went on to have a pretty successful career after this gameso what is donkey kong
a giant ape who kidnaps pauline not princess peach who mario 
er jump man must rescue
donkey kong throws barrels at jump man
jump man must avoid the barrels jump over other obstacles climb ladders etc to get to the top of the screen and save the princess from the throes of bowser 
er 
donkey kongwhat is notable about this game and other early prefamicomnes titles was nintendo was actually a third party
once upon a time in the early s they licensed their ips to other platforms at the very start of their foray into video games
given the troubled fortunes of the wii u during its initial launch cycle and nintendo president saturo iwatas adamant refusal to license out its ips to tabletsmart phone devices playing mario and donkey kong on anything other than nintendo hardware just seems bizarre and thats because no one has played their ips on nonnintendo hardware at least legally in decadesone of my first experiences with nintendo games was playing donkey kong and mario bros on the atari  in  nintendo and atari were trying to broker a deal and when that fell thru they brought out the famicom that year and the palus equivalent nes in  before that though they did publish their games on the atari and some other hardwarethe gameboy advance title in the classic nes series is appropriately enough the nes version of donkey kong
the problem with the nes port is that its only three levels and is missing the fourth level that was exclusive to the arcade which is the pie levelby now years after its release and the gameboy advance long superceded by nintendos subsequent handhelds there is very little appeal in picking up this edition of donkey kong
first its only three levels long and can literally be beaten in ten to twenty minutes with the only appeal being to go for high scores which was appropriate to the market in the early s 
but even by the late s people just didnt care about high scoresoverall the classic nes series was fairly disappointing
with few exeptions such as the legend of zelda zelda ii the adventure of link and super mario bros nintendo released in america anyway mostly very short gameplay experiences
the japanese famicom mini series had a much stronger lineup than the games we got in the westin terms of donkey kong i would pick it up on the virtual console if you really want to play it
do not waste your money on the gameboy advance versionbut i dont like this game at all
im a big zelda fan and loved all the gbc n gba and gamecube games but because of my age i had never played the classic zelda games
so i picked this up aiming to be a fullblown zelda aficionadoyet within a few minutes of play i realized that the game was far too primitive for someone reared in the era of links awakening dx and ocarina of time
there are no npcs to talk to no exploration to be done none of anything that i had come to expect from the series
i am well aware that i was probably expecting too much but whether thats true or not i was disappointedalthough i didnt find anything to enjoy in this game im not saying that its bad
im sure that it was a classic of its era and those who grew up with nes games will probably fall in love with it all over again
but from the perspective of someone who relies only on what she has read and heard for info on this bygone time it simply seems like a bland watereddown hack n slasherpacman is the game that basically defined the arcade
but this isnt the quotclassic arcade seriesquot its the quotclassic nes seriesquot which means we get the nes version
this is not a good thing and while pacman is one of the games that will never be forgotten the quotclassic nes seriesquot doesnt capture it in all its glory
pacman was a nice classic arcade game
i wouldnt consider the nes version to be a classic in anyway
there are a few things that stand out as to whythe gameplay isnt bad
youre pacman in a maze eating up little yellow pelts
the big pelts give you the chance to capture the ghostbut as i said some things are just wrong
for example the arcade version was a stretched out screen with the score at the top
this version shows the score off to the far right and tries to hard to fit it into the screen
youll notice that pacman the fruit and the ghost are all bigger than the corridor of the mazepacman also suffers from what many other classic nes games suffer from and this one has it bad
for one its been rereleased several times
if you have the namco museum youre fine and thats even out on the gba
dont buy the classic nes series of pacman
instead buy the namco museum package
not only is it better but its also the arcade versionfor roughly the same price you could get super mario bros deluxe it plays on all game boy systems and has everythign this game has plus a lot more
does this game have super mario bros  hidden in it
no
does it have a calendar
no
mini games
no
youre much better off with mario bros deluxei will most likely get many nos for was this review helpful
because of my negative review and i hate to be the oddball of the bunch but please hear me out before voting no
i was a mario fanatic during my freshman year of highschool
playing mario brothers for hours on end
i would leave the console on at night there was no saving marios progress only to have to start over the next day because mom turned off the console she just didnt understand i made it all the way to world 
mario was a huge success for its time
there was nothing better
so feeling nostalgic i picked up a copy for my gameboy advanceafter a few hours of gameplay i was done with it
in this day and age where games of the same price can be so much more entertaining why did i blow my money on mario
its not that i expected cutting edge graphics or changing the game why change a classic
i would have been able to make it thru to the end if they just added one feature just one
a simple thing like a save game feature would have given it  stars from methis is a perfect example of nintendo recycling old games and making a bundle
no thought process went into this it was an old idea repackaged
one thing this did for me is made me appreciate the advancement in the video game industry
in a day and age when reviewers complain about games being too repetitive mario does not deserve a good review even from those of us who grew up with pac man and galagai will agree that when mario first hit the streets it was the greatest thing out there
however at this point and time mario is definitly showing his age
think to yourself if this game was released today for the first time ever would it truely deserve  starsi highly dont reccommend you buy thisunless you can play about  hours straight or have an ac adapter then you can buy itthis doesnt even have a save featurehow messed upi tried many ways including asking nintendothere is none which is completely absurdi am an avid star wars fan but this is unbearable
i went into this game with high hopes because the game got such good reviews and im such a huge fan however i came out confused and ultimately very upset
its not like the game is a complete mess and doesnt do anything right its just not fun and overall unbelievably forgettable
lets start with the graphics at times i felt like i was playing an early xbox  game but most of the time it felt like a ps game or something especially the outside portions of the game
i found them to be blurry and lacking detail
gameplay the gameplay in this game is atrocious to say the least
the mechanics and everything are fine but it takes too many bullets to take down certain enemies and overall its just very repetitive and not fun at all
i would equate this game to left for dead because the enemies come and keep on coming
they are relentless and you dont even have time to look around at the environment
this game is not even in the same league as halo so dont even say it
now i would go over some other things in the game but if youre like me then the gameplay is probably the most important thing and you already know how i feel about it so i will leave you with a list of my favorite fps games of all time and you can see why i thought this game was crap
these are in order starting with the best
 goldeneyen  perfect darkn  red faction ps  medal of honor and medal of honor undergroundps  bioshock and bioshock infinite xbox  some of my other favorites are haloxbox cold winterps times splitters  and future perfectps xbox area xbox ps duke nukem d and the list goes on and onthe only way i can explain the positive reviews for this game are simply my theory that gamers are idiots
theyll play anything if its given good reviews and other people like it
theres nothing new in mercenaries that hasnt been done before
you accept a contract
you drive around to the bad guy and subdue him or kill him
o k  all this has been done before and vastly more interesting in games like metal gear solid call of duty hitman etc
etc
etc
its not fun or challenging or original
also the gameplay itself is bad
shooting people isnt fun here you just pull the trigger and move your crosshairs across the screen
boring
the graphics arent very good either
just because other people say its good doesnt make it sothis game could be one of the best games out there but it has way too many bugs
here are the most anoying ones character gets trapped inside boulder and cant get out game sometimes say theres no controller connected and the most annoying one  i successfully entered the abort codes for the nukes after hours of really intense battles eliminated the foot soldiers then the game froze just as i was about to capture the ace of spades
what the hecki really liked the first two jak games so i was excited to try jak  whoa
major mistake
this game is nothing more than a lame racingwannabe
i was very disappointed in this game
if you are expecting a platformer look elsewherei know this game came out a long time ago
however i recently dusted off the old ps in an attempt to pick up some gems i missed
boy was i wrong about this game
it is a good idea to bring an exclusive fps to the ps one that is unique fun and has good replay value
this is not that game
to give consumers a clue on the back the only review it cites is from playstation magazine which gave it ayou guessed it
hmmmwhat a surprisethis game is a standard fps
storywise you play an isa good guys soldier named templar who is part of the army tasked with repelling the helghast bad guys invasion
the campaign is quite long for an fps which would be a plusif the game was fun to playthere isnt much weapon varietyor mission variety for that matter
most weapons have a unique secondary fire but more often than not youll be using the plain old assault riflegameplay wise the game is rather dull
it consists mainly of walking a set path and helghast pop out at you
thats it
there is some variety like taking out tanks but overall if you play for prolonged periods of time you will get boredgraphicswise its okay i guess
im used to nextgen graphics now so i dont really know
however in some situations it does seem like the game is too much for the ps to handle so the fps drops
also the game is so dark
i mean it wouldnt be that bad if they gave us a flashlight but they dont
a lot of time is spent in corridors which are so dark and disorienting you wont know which end is up
you wont even be able to see your weapon
maybe this is why they made the helghast have the glowing eyesotherwise nobody would be able to spot them
furthermore the game has a very grainy washedout look
some may say it adds to the warlike feel but i think it just contributes to making the game boring
finally there is virtually no notable music in this game
this is a major con when comparing to halo which has a fantastic musical score that is abundant throughout the gamenow onto my biggest gripethe controls
i dont know who the heck was in charge of controls for this game but they should be fired
these are the clunkiest controls of any game i have ever played in my entire life
aiming is very difficult due to it being very very sensitive
hope you dont want to walk or run while shooting because that will take a ton of practice
most of the time in order to hit anything you have to take cover pop out and fire
rinse and repeat for each hallway
character movement is also sluggish it feels like my guy is walking in tar or somethingthis game has online multiplayer as well as offline against bots
i cant really say much now since there were like  people online when i played
the problem with this is that those  are the really hardcore fans that have been playing since it came out and are practically pros at it by now so expect to get destroyed
however even if i was better the clunky controls still hinder online as it does with the campaignoverall i think this is a poor choice for an fps if youre in the market for one
there are many others out there that offer a more compelling story cooler weapons and most importantly comfortable controls
i believe this was a sorry effort on sonys part to compete with halo
the good critic reviews make me seriously puzzledthis game in no way is above average for first person shooters
it is the exact definition of averagenothing about it makes it unique
buy this only if you want  hours of frustration and boredom in a dark hallway
im not trying to blindy bash the gamejust trying to give a different voice than the others that have so highly praised this gameprosdecent graphicsoffline and online multiplayerlong campaigngood valueconshorrid controlshardly any musicdark dreary and grainy lookboring repetitivelack of imaginative weaponsi just ejected this game partway through and put it in my goodwill pile
whats wrong with it
the question is where do i beginthe ai is retarded
sometimes they just sit there looking at you five yards away like they are blind but  mostly they just wander back and forth
they dont banzai charge nor do they hide and make you come after them
all you have to do is keep your gun trained on their doorway and they repeatedly wander into your sightsthe things the characters and enemies shout are stupid and repetitive and the groans they make when they get hit become annoying
and i dont like their stupid british accents either
if you hit them with one bullet they shout im under heavy fiah
the weapons arent accurate beyond point blank range although the bad guys seem to have no trouble hitting you at long range and it takes several hits to kill one bad guy
if you see three of them bunched together at thirty yards you can empty a whole clip at them and sometimes not even kill one of them while they are busy shouting suppressing fiah
aaaugh
im under attock
there is a sniper rifle but the aiming system is idiotic and nearly impossible to useyour character is slow and areas are large which is normally a good thing except here you cant hit anything beyond fifty yards
you can sprint but only for a short ways and you cant fire while you are sprinting
the bouncy way your character walks is lame too
plus the pathway is totally linear
there are no side areas worth exploring no hidden items or powerups to look for and since you can only carry three weapons at a time most of the ammo you find is unusable
there is a ton of the ammo for the standard rifle but hardly any for the bomb launchers
reloading takes a long time too
your character cant jump and small curbs and boxes hold him up
there are about four obstacles in the game that you can vault over which takes several seconds and is a lame featureyour teammates are seemingly invincible so when you run across bad guys you can just hide and let your teammates kill themthat is unless they come and hide behind you
if you and your whole team is in firing position all of the bad guys shoot at you and the rest of your team stops firing and strolls over to your side appearing at the ready
other times they will shout this way take a few steps down the path and then stop and wait for you to take point
they get in your way a lot toothere are no health packs i dont think but your health recharges over time
so if you get hit all you have to do is hide out for a few seconds in complete safety since the enemies dont charge and youre back to full healthwhen you die the camera pans around your dead body for ten or fifteen seconds while i am wishing i could get on with the game
that was really annoying
in fact nearly everything about this game is annoying
i had played the excellent project snowblind right before this and killzone was a major letdown in comparison to it or to all other fpss for that matteronly a baffoon would not see this coming
if it cant even handle deus ex  and rainbow six  what makes you think its going to be able to run a halo clone
call up any psychic theyll tell you the same thing im telling you
sattle up the syrup boys we are headed to the flopzonethis game i thought would be good but it is very annoying
in the game when you kill someone they make the same annoying sounds
they say the same things when they get hurt
they shooting was alright but not great
i just bought this game to see if i liked it but didnt
probably wont buy killzone what a piece of garbage
i rented this game and returned it the next day because i didnt want it to plague my other ps games with its filth
thank goodness i didnt buy this crap
the framerate is terrible and the screen feels like its right up in your face
i couldnt play it because it gave me a headache the first time ever while playing video games
from what i hear you shoot the same looking bad guys the entire game
what fun is that
id give it a zero
ive gotta go
thinking about the  i spent on renting this game is starting to make me angry and you wouldnt like me when im angryour whole family highly dislikes this game
we purchased it because of great reviews on amazon yet this game doesnt have enough save points and after  minutes we got tired of replaying the same paths over and over again each time with less ammoi am taking my time to write a honest review about this game
if you are those kind of people who like games who resemble the real life then this game is not for youthe negatives which are more then the positives by the way
 in real life when teams are on offense most of the time defenses get tired
well in madden  and  that is not the case if your offense is on the field most of the time your offense gets tired and their defense gets stronger
when the computer wants to score there is nothing you can do
even if your cb is covering  the ball will go through his body and the wr will catch it  i have never seen that in other games like espn
as we all know in madden players are rated by an overall number
in madden  and  for example if your defense is agains the computer you have a big disadvantage one single offensive linemen can block   overall players of your defense
the most ridiculus part of this game is when a cpu player is running in one direction and then accelerates in the ooposite direction and tackles your player and the block at the same timei can keep going on and on and tell you why after  minutes this game is not fun anymore but the negatives are so many that i would need days to review this games  and if you ask yourself why am i including madden  in my review
i do it because i have a friend who is a game tester and he told me that the gameplay of madden  is exactly the same as the personally i am done with the madden series until thye redisign the gameplay and it resembles more to real lifei admit it i have something of an ulterior motive in rating this game so low
its a good football game really it is
however after playing ea sports titles for the past decade ive discovered a football game i like much better
unfortunately because of ea and the nfls greed exclusive rights to nfl licensed products has been grantedmeaning we will not get an espn nfl k game
hence i will no longer be playing ea titles
for any serious gamers out there that welcome competition among our titles thus ensuring that the best products are available join my in my boycott
like i said earlier i prefer the bulk of eas sports titles to the espn brand
however i think their nhl and nfl products are surperior to eas
but ill no longer have a choice in nfl products
im not happy with either ea or the nfli bought madden  and i loved it primarily due to the incredible new owner mode but this year theres a new football champ and his name is espn k
this game is amazing and its only  bucks
save yourself  bucks and go with the game that won best of show awards  e
sorry ea sports you lose
game overthere is one thing it must have in  if im going to buy itin dynasty mode when you create your schedule at the beginning of the year you must play x number of games in your conference and you cant change them
in  michigan did not play penn state or wisconsin
so even if i play  years of dystany football with michigan i can never play against psu or wii would also like to see being able to switch players positions
if i have  guards rated at  and  centers at  i cant cut the centers and have one of the guards move overand it would be cool to see michigan run out of the tunnel hitting the go blue banner on the way outnew audio clips really needed to be added
ive played a lot of hours on  and im really sick of hearing the same comments over and over and over againlets hope  improve these areas and ill be happythe graphics are horriblesound effects stinkrecievers always drop passescontrols dont work half the timea total waste of time and moneyok i have played tons of zelda games and this is junk how can nintendo do so bad this game is to easy took me about  hours to beat and all you do is press the b button and the bad guys die that fast this is just not a good game
go buy a better game like tales of symphonia that games the best if you are like  this game zelda four swords is ok but any older it just not worth your money good thing my freind bought it and let me play
game play it the worst it nothing like the old zelda game like oot or mm this is just like a game boy adv zelda game but you pay alot moreover all this is a peace of junk sorry nintendo but i know you can do better next timeyou hold down your left mouse button and watch a circle change colordifferent colors equal different cutscenes
ie green circle you slit enemys throat with glass yellow circle you slit enemys throat and stab his heart red circle you drill his eyes outyour character has no moves or combos or real attacks of any kind unless he has a gunim not even going to keep my review coherent because this game doesnt deserve the effort on my partfor a gaming experience that truly screams the mid nineties its the donkey kong country series
i never played this as a kid but i can still feel the waves of nostalgia gently blowing at me
its challenging as s though
but fun and still amazing to look at  years later
probably best to experience on the snes
but its cooli got this because my favorite game is dk  for the super i was excited to find this and when i got it i was very disappointed its a lot different and i hate it i wouldnt recommend it to anyonethis game was not fun at all if you like college strip tease and stuff then this is for you
all you do is walk around theirs women and college students you play strip and other stupid games
this game was just dumb this is what any other college student dose so this game was a waste of timeive been a long time fan of lsl  have played the games since i was about   snuck onto my dads computer
i was overjoyed to see that there was going to be another outing for this series  was looking forward to it even when i heard that the series was not going to surround our favorite hero larry
however when i actually played the game i was incredibly dissapointedunlike its predecessors the game is entirely a series of minigames instead of the point  click first person interface of the previous ones
that wouldnt have been so bad except they were the same exact minigames that repeated with each character you pursue
the plotline was actually pretty watered down for a lsl release  was obviously missing the signature al lowe humor that made the previous ones so popular
there were some funny moments in the game such as the summer lovingesque song in the gay bar but they were few  far between
ultimately i was glad that id rented it for my ps instead of actually buying it
i have to say that i didnt entirely expect it to be great when i discovered that it was due for the ps as well as for the computer but i didnt expect it to be as terrible as it was
for people who just discovered the series they are sure to be pleasantly surprised when they discover how much more entertaining the original games are but for the rest of us well well always have the originalsi see that there is no mention of al lowe being involved with creating this
if he is missing then i can guarantee you that the humor and gameplay quality will be missing as well and online opinion would seem to confirm thiswhat a shame that sierra wasnt smart enough to employ him
i was looking forward to a real lsl game not a rip offdear reader  i suspect you are on the chessmaster  page because you are unaware of the fritz program amazon asin bbga which is what serious chess players use to play chess both against the computer and against others on the internetchessmaster even version  has got to be one of the most irritating intrusive pieces of software that ive ever installed on my computerfirst of all before permitting itself to be installed chessmaster scans your hard drive for any software it deems illicit such as clonecd or other kinds of windows utilities that allow users to duplicate files
if it detects anything it doesnt like it wont allow you to install the game on your computer
the problem is much of the software on its banned list are or at least were intended to be completely innocuous
as if this wasnt enough chessmaster wont deign to tell you which piece of software it objects to leaving you to guess
whats really baffling is the realization that software pirates could easily copy the chessmaster cd without having to install it first of course
so what was the point of the programmers having chessmaster do this
to strike a blow for intellectual property rights in generalanyhow another irritant is that the chessmaster game has decided to model itself on certain racing games which only unlock certain tracks and cars if youve beaten certain lesser opponents and trackswell chessmaster works the same way
the programmers have decided to make certain colored d boards and all the d boards unlockable meaning that you cant adjust the boards colors and look to suit you unless you unlock it
this means you have to play about i think  games at a certain level before youre even allowed to play d chess one of the reasons many people buy this particular program i think
very frustrating for those who like to play d right from the outsetbut it goes further
chessmaster also wont allow you to specify your level meaning that you have to play dozens of probably unpleasant games against opponents which probably cruelly outrank you or laughably underrank you
you have to earn your rating so to speak
youre not allowed to start playing at your level for quite some while and youre also not allowed to play above your levelno im not finished yet
ive noticed that chess programs are popular on laptop computers because of their low graphics and sound requirements
unfortunately chessmaster requires you to insert the disk every time you play it making play onthego more of a hassleboy am i sorry i bought this thingrarely am i compelled to stop what i am doing and write a review about a product
however this product is such garbage that i felt that needin fact it should receive no starsfirst the game can only be used with certain video cards which is something i did not learn until after i received the product
specifically it can only be used with a geforce fx or an ati  series graphics processor
now keep in nind i meet those specs anwaysecond you need the st cd of  to play the game
although not normally a problem if you have an ultraportable or tablet pc forget about this productthird the installation is over mb minimum install
thats if you do not install anything but just the pure game filesafter installing i rebooted my dell  gb ram p  gb hard drive ati graphics card with mb ram on board
i started the program and it locked up my computer
tried again no luck
rebooted and tried opening the program it finally opened
however all the graphics were offlong story short this game should be taken off the market and the development team put out on the streetall i want to do is play chess
do not buy
save yourself the aggravationif youre considering buying this game consider very carefully especially if you enjoyed some of the earlier myst games
there is very little that is positive about myst iv revelation besides the highquality graphics camera improved movement and the theme song that plays at the main menu
in general the game is a frustrating queue of puzzle after puzzle with little incentive to actually spend the time to solve them
the worlds are disappointing and the game has a heavy dose of newage material signifying a departure from the mainly mechanical nature of the earlier myst gamesthe ageswhile every detail is in place and the quality of the graphics good the worlds are disappointing unattractive and unenjoyable to interact withtomanha is a collection of glass houses nice aspects but could have been betterhaven is one of the better worlds with a few lovely places
still it wasnt that greatspire is the ugliest world ive ever seen in any of the myst games
if youve seen the disney rendition of sleeping beauty youll see spire bears a resemblance to the evil maleficents castleserenia while difficult to actually describe is an unlikable world nonetheless
it is chockfull of newage materialthe puzzlesnot all the puzzles in this game are hard but some are time consuming and frustrating
in serenia especially once you solve one puzzle another one soon follows
unlike in myst iii exile where you dont mind spending an hour fiddling with controls all you want to do with revelation is get the puzzles and the whole game for that matter done and over withthe infamous mangree puzzle is located in haven
even when you know what you are supposed to accomplish and are good at producing the correct sounds its still a pain
you also have to deal with the throne in spire no pun intended
this puzzle also deals with sounds and its annoyinga walkthrough is recommended if you have my patience level
unless youre lucky youll need a game patch for the mangree puzzle and probably for the throne
fortunately the patches are free and fairly easy to download and install at ubisofts websitethis game is not worth your time or money
for the most part the worlds are unenjoyable the puzzles arent fun and all you want to do is finish the game as quickly as possible
if you want listen to the theme song somehow the best thing about revelation and perhaps see screenshots if you want to see what the game looks like
but if you liked the other myst games there is absolutely no guarantee youll like this one in fact it will probably be exactly the oppositetoday i have read about no less than three games including this one that have such stupid copy protection schemes that i will not buy the game
way to go
you have lost another customerat some point the steam starforce dvdrw hating game companies are going to figure out why there sales keep slippingtoo badim off to find a game that doesnt compromise my computerreason enough not to buy itjri would love to buy this game but i do not want to risk harm to my computer from the hidden starforce copy protection
google itim sure all the people that wanted it already have it legal or not
i would like to buy a copy without the damaging starforceive heard there are illegal versions available but i want to buy it ubi soft
there are many games ive bought and played that dont use this draconian method of copy protectionthis game is way too difficult and complex
no way to reduce the difficulty level either
would not recommend for people who arent expert gamersmy gameshark worked perfect and allowed me to cheat to my hearts content about  timesafter  or so uses the device simply stopped workingand looking at other reviews i am not the only one with this problemif you want to buy this you might as well take a  bill and put in a fire
highly not recommended productfor some reason this product will break after  use in a game boy advance
i bought this item played it  time and then it broken after rebooting
what it is is that nintendo made different chips that after there chips enter the slot they will breakif you put it into your gba after  use you will be prompted with a white screen of death
you will not be able to fix thisdo not buyquestions
email me at beatonyahoocomswg combat is  broken and unbalanced
people go on more solo missions than anything by abusing the broken food and doctors buffs
so what happens is people get together in a group so that they get tougher missions then just split off and do the missions alonecombat is broken broken brokenand dont even get me started on pvp
if you dont have  comp armour x valarian brandy and  ham doctor buffs you will die
also you cant just master a profession you choose
you have to stack your templates by picking the most powerful skills from all the professionsotherwise you will be  useless in pvp
and its been this way the whole time
soe has been promising us to fix combatpvp since december and they havent
now they are releasing jtl before they fix the current gamequotthis isnt related to jtlquot im sureyou are saying but its the track record of the company you are purchasing this game from
if this track record doesnt spell it out for you let me do ityou will buy jtl it will be horribly buggy and unbalanced
once soe manages to get jtl to not constantly crash andor gets it to function properly they will move on to their next money making adventure leaving you with a horribly unbalanced game where probably one ship owns all the others or some dreadful part combination
and you have to ask yourself will that one ship be neutral rebel or imperial
then just pray its one of the ships on your sideplease consider yourself warned before buying this game
as of now all of the original game problems are not being fixed so that the devs can work on the expansion game
what
am i really to believe that i should pay another  dollars on top of my monthly rate when the original required core game is still not working correctly
the combat system is virtually worthless jedis kill all pvp players to earn more points and content is extremely lacking
which brings up a point
in the expansion the devs have stated that most of your time will be spent on the ground as opposed to space travel making money to pay for repairs  upgrades  etc
well isnt the ground where all the problems and glitches are
i seriously doubt that the new expansion will fix many problems
i really believe it is yet another way to get people to spend more money on empty promises
be wary of all these  star ratings  i have played off and on for almost a year now and cant wait for my  year contract to expirei will not be renewing or purchasing the expansioni have lost faith in the forcethe game crashes my machine when i try to play
considering that i can not play this game at all i consider this to be a complete failurethese items should be pulled from amazonafter september th  all new star wars galaxies account codes are no longer able to be used
the game is shutting down on the th of december and new players are no longer allowed to enter the gameif you buy this you will not be able to have access to what you paid for so unless you just want the box then you should not buy thisrepeat no one who buys a new cd key for star wars galaxies will be able to enter the game and any account who has not been active as of september th  will not be able to reactivate and enter the game
please be awareits just as well the game has not been updated in  years and its wise that sony is deciding to close it
if you want a good star wars mmo preorder the old republic as it will be out on december thswg doa with launch of cu ripsoe since you and lucasfilm wont listen to fanswe wont pay to betatest
rotw cancelled st day of cuswg cancelled after giving cu a couple of daysblah takes a day to master a pilot prof if youre halfdecentadds a completely useless side to a game that is wholly landbasedbit of a sideshow to the grinding blahfest that was swgah well with the cu swg isnt around for much longer in this galaxy anywayavoidi would recommend however that you spend your money on a classic like xwing vs tie fighter for the same but better effect
pvp is consensual  so if youd like you can fly your little tie fighter in the middle of a group of x wings and their lasers wont hurt you unless you want them to
you can get most ships that have been seen in the movies but as imperial youll want to complete the jedi starfighter quest which gives you anakins episode iii fighterwhat is fun about that is that its the best fighter in the game  so ship building professions cannot build anything that is nearly as good and thus have become worthless and with the advent of the nge pushed into an even more minority statusthis expansion is also currently free with the starter kit that is also available on amazon but its not really worth itid suggest buying some chuck norris moviessoe ruined the game with the combat upgrade
dont waste your money
they also have horrible customer servicestar wars galaxies an empire dividedsigh where to beginthis game could be better namedstar wars galaxies a development team vs a player basenever in all my life have i seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar
its truly sickening
i was a month veteran of the game i had been playing since week one ive canceled my account and will never do business with soe again
please read onin the beginningthis game was alright it was fun it was unique and it was totally bugridden and unbalanced
over the course of the last  months the soe dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game
they in fact did very little if anything at all
they milked us
they exploited the star wars name to make a buck
they made promise after promise after promise and never delivered squat
dont believe me
just ask any smuggler in the game for their opinionthey strung us along and led us to believe that the fixes to the game were right around the corner
instead they were hard at work on an expansion pack to sell us
and then once again promised us that the fixes weve all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us just hang on this game is going to be great
they promised us that they were going to do this combat upgrade and do it right and it wouldnt be released until its ready
we all had a lot of hope we thought that they had finally figure out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse
god how wrong we all werewell much to everyones surprise they made the announcement that the long awaited cu would be coming out along with the rage of the wookiees expansion pack
uhhhmmm did i miss something somewhere
the alpha test for the cu was supposed to begin in january it never happened
beta testing began in april  whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live
we all rolled up our sleeves and dove in
i think after the first week or so the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink inthey went and copypasted eq code into the swg game so they could streamline their operation by having one dev team work on both swg and eq
the cu was supposed to go live on may th
soe decided to push it to live a whole  weeks sooner than that
honestly with all the bugs that were still in beta and now in live beta could have gone on another  months
i guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it
why am i not surprisedthe cu itself is unplayable
it has become everquest in space or everstar galaxies questwars as we call it
there are just too many things to list
im sure a lot of other reviews here go into much more detailas you all can imagine the player community was totally enraged
we went to the swg forum boards to voice our concerns
the only response we ever got back from soe was thousands of deleted threads and players banned from the forums
facing futility a large portion of the player base has left the game permanently this timethis is just not how you do business
i personally will never deal with sony online entertainment soe ever again
i do not pay my hard earned money to be lied to deceived ignored strung along censored and banned for voicing my concerns
i do not pay money to folks who treat me a paying customer in this fashionstar wars galaxies is dead
servers are emptying
people are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons
if you are a fan of star wars and this is the only reason i ever started playing this game to begin with you will be sadly disappointedswg is nothing more than an exploit of a title a milk machine
i for one am tired of being milkedyou have been warnedwhich is unfortunate because it looks so fascinating
ahh but live and learn
sometimes things simply do not work outafter playing through fm at least  times when i had heard square enix was going to be making fm i was extatic
finally after long months of waiting i was able to finally purchase the game
after about  hours of gameplay the game found itself amid the rest of the trash on my bedroom floor
what happened
how could fm be such a disappointment
all square had to do was keep all the features of fm create a new intriging storyline boost the graphics and thats all she wrote
they boosted the graphics started a decent storyline from the  hours of the game that i played but took out way to many features that made fm so great
they completey destroyed the customization system in this game
pilots skills are basically pre set
it doesnt matter how long you practice with your weapons anymore bc you can only get skills for the beginning weapons your characters start our with
wanzers designs are sub par at best and very generic
forget about trying to capture enemy wanzers
they completely removed that feature from the game
so no more slicing and dicing captured enemy wanzers one of the coolest features i thought in fm  they got rid of the net surfing
i am sure plenty of ppl thought this feature was annoying and useless in fm
well it never really affected the game so if players didnt like the net they didnt have to use the feature
the net would only reward players who took the time to surf and discover all the hidden training maps and programs you could download
remeber this review was only written based on  hrs of gameplay
but for me thats all that was needed
they really killed the skill system in my opinion
and that was the top reason why i loved fm so much for its exp and skill system
this game will never touch my ps againgame will not installno solutions found by companyi cant even try the gameit simply wont workwaste of moneymight as well flush your money down the toiletrushed they didnt even beta test it and they only internally playtested it and it showshorrible ai sloppy unit movement poor controls and lackluster gameplay highlight this title
worst of all most of the gameplay is copied from kohan and kohan and doesnt even measure up to those gamespoor avoid itsorry for being a stick in the mud but if i had seen this game running before i got it i probably would have just watched someone else play it
the big con to this game that i was really looking forward to playing is the fixed world camera with a tiny little tilt to the left or right that springs back the moment you release the key
zooming in or out takes you somewhat closer to the fights but you cannot choose your action viewpoint meaning that tbfme is a very limited rts  i knew it was limited but didnt realize how much so much so that it is nothing more than draw a big box around whatever group is present on the screen and right click on the enemy and then watch the battle but watch what
amazing d fight sequences
and i think you might just get my point here  the film is the better d fight sequencesi am sorry but the fact that you could not rotate the camera just blew me away
it felt like playing rtype final or some other d platform shoot em up
the extreme and i mean extreme lack of critical thinking in this game just makes it a very glorious looking bad game
it is not even a game when compared to any modern rts
the best way of describing it is like a gawkfest where you can literally sit back and just let the game run itself
i would not have minded that if i could actually choose an angle to gawk at the battlesthe best way of describing my disappointment is to imagine if the producers of this thing just recorded a demo of the whole game on dvd for you to watchanyhow all this depends on how much time you invest in games
if you are a fan of the movie and do not play games then maybe this will satisfy you
if you have any experience with rts gaming and a pimpin fast computer you have a right to know that you can not rotate or tilt the world
if i knew that then maybe this item would have got a far better ratingi would love to have recommended it but sadly i am a gamer and felt badly letdown by the lack of world controls
something as simple as a  rotate with a degree tilt would have made it five stars even with the simplest of rts controls
as i said watching the film is betterall they did was take a poorly made rts engine and slap lotr into the title
if you played age of empires or empire earth or even star craft back in the day youd understand what i mean
this game is horriblethe good the tetsugen is an awesome weapon kurenai is a sexy assassin the game looks pretty goodthe bad broken camera terrible platforming weird and awkward controls stupid ai generic looking enemiesi try to be forgiving with games but there are some that just cant be overlooked
red ninja is a perfect example that has mechanics that are broken beyond reason or repair
the story is the first thing you will notice that isnt very interesting
you are trying to stop a rival clan from getting a machine gun blueprint from yours to use to destroy their enemies
the beginning cut scene shows your clan using a machine gun to cut down hordes of samurais
just one machine gun
after this your leader tells the man in charge of making it to destroy it because it dishonors the rules of engagement
sure thats noble but all this for one stupid machine gunyou will notice the game is severely flawed in the tutorial
the camera is completely useless the controls are awkward the platforming is uncontrollable and the enemies are stupid as well as generic
the only interesting thing in the whole game are the tetsugen weapon and kurenais panties
the camera is inverted no matter what you do
in the options you can turn it off but it becomes inverted vertically instead of horizontally
i constantly had to consciously remember to turn the camera the opposite way i wanted it to go
this is so frustrating during already busted boss fights or when surveying enemy patrols
on top of all this the combat works a little but needs a lot of work
you can use the tetsugen as a melee weapon or throw it from a distance and slice enemies in half
one awesome feature was being able to run around enemies in a circle while one is tethered and trip them down or cut them in half
good luck keeping all the enemies focused because of that broken camerasecondly is the platforming this is probably more frustrating than anything because you need to do this to avoid enemy detection
you can shimmy ledges ropes wall run and dash around but the combination of the camera and the weird controls make it frustrating
wall running consists of you having to be in a dash while running at a wall
you have to continue running while moving the analog stick in the direction you want kurenai to run
this is ridiculous and unintuitive
a lot of times i had her bouncing off walls because the camera just couldnt keep up
enemies will detect you even when you on rooftops which is weird
swimming is no better because enemies can always see you and you can only hide underwater while being still
completely useless
you can use projectiles by picking them up but aiming them is just too time consuming
there should be some sort of autoaim for theseif that isnt enough for you to stay away i dont know what will
i got two levels in and just couldnt take anymore
the camera constantly going berserk and doing its own thing the stupid ai weird control scheme bad platforming and just overall an unpolished mess
the combat is somewhat saveable but the camera and controls make this frustrating as well
the game looks pretty good but in the end you wont even care
not even the sexy seduction kills are enough to save this game
i hope one day this series is revived but needs to be built from the ground up
just stay away from this pile of garbagethis game absolutly sucks to the max the movie sucks how can the game posibly be any better sure the graphics are good but it sucks just as aquaman and super man geez katamari damacy is better than that if you want an good game get halo   doom  or splinter cell chaos theory or at least get spiderman  the best marvel game out there you can explore new york and the fighting and controls are good
since the scale doesnt have a zero give this game a  out of the shipping was decently fast but i got a completely different dragon ball z game in a budokai  case im not happy at all about this transaction i asked for budokai  not budokai tenkaichi i want my money back asapi didnt like this game
i play games as a way to relax between work a way to escape a way to keep my mind stimulated
alida didnt do this for me
most of the time i wasnt quite sure why i was running back and forth doing things and i never could figure out the whole logic or whatever with setting the planets in those covered trays and had to do them all trial and error and must have done them wrong since there was no indication when you got them rightthe other segments had some means of letting you know when things were set correctly
when i finally go to the part where all the various items had been fiddled with and the lost chord should have played to open the vaults nothing happened
i sat there for a minute thinking about what was probably off and decided that whatever the ending it had to be pretty sucky since the beginning premise was pretty lameand i decided it wasnt worth going back and refiguring anything
i just uninstalled it took the game to work for someone else to try for free
there was no initial reason for me as the hero to want to go find whateverthewomansnamewas boyfriend im rather sick of someone telling me something needs to be done ive gotten to the point where im going why cant you do it yourself you lazy bum
and since adjusting all those gizmos didnt give me any incentive i didnt feel any need to successfully complete the game
i seriously could not think of anything good or interesting happening if id just go back and correct my wrong settingso i uninstalled
it wasnt fun the graphics were just okay by todays high standard a little more incentive would have gone a long way to encourage this player to want to find the final solutioni play lots of adventure games
im smarter than your average bear
the puzzles were just stupidhere is an example
you look in a window and an old lamp is flickering
you are supposed to count the flickers they are a code
a code to what
another totally unrelated puzzle far away
how do you know this
you cheat and use a walkthroughthe puzzles are so random
when you read the solution you dont go ah ha
you go what the heck
with every adventure game you sometimes have to go to a walkthrough to get unstuck
this game requires walkthrough help all the way throughtoo bad the graphics were kind of cool the idea had potential its just the puzzles that failed this gamevery disappointed in this game because after three installs it still will not work on my sixmonth old computer using windows xp
it keeps on crashing my computer and causing it to reboot
when i was able to play it for a few minutes the puzzles made no sense and were very difficult
the instruction book that comes with the game is very poorly written and is not accurate
the instructions are unclear and dont match up with what is displayed on your computer screen
perhaps this is due to the instructions being translated from french or somethingi dont knowvery upset that i blew  on yet another game i cannot play on my computerthis game sucks
too many friggin bugsi just wanted to say that i nearly bought this game but thanksto a lady i talked to at eb games and the reviews by all you folks i have saved my money
many thanks for taking the time to submit a review charlie spivey richmond vawhile dungeon lords is on shelves it is unfinished
i dont mean the usual unforeseen minor bugs and occasional quirks
i mean dreamcatcher has quite deliberately released a game that is a minimum of  months of intense work away from being a viable product
some of the features didnt work from the cd install so dreamcatcher removed them in a patch
other features such as the map are documented but still not implementedthe bugs are too numerous to catalogue here but they are gamebreaking
the issues are too severe for dreamcatcher to not have known this product is nowhere close to completion much less ready for retail
so i must urge the reader do not purchase this productplaying this game until the end of time could qualifyi found this game as part of an rpg pack for  and even with  decent games it wasnt worth it there is now a minimap
however it doesnt tell you much of anything
you still have no idea where to go or how to get there monster spawns are insane
i stop to breathe and  monster come tearing at me
even lowlevel monsters are tough to kill meaning the quickbutton for healing potions should be very easily accessible combat control is nonexistent
the manual tells you to vary your attacks forward sidetoside jumping but the ai is quicker than you and almost no attacks actually get through camera control is horrible
the camera is controlled by turning the mouse
however spinning the camera while frantically leftclicking to attack and circling to very attacks means its very easy to lose sight of your character and the monsters graphics are still horrible
it isnt uncommon for the pc or a monster to end up floating in midair minigames do not work
unlocking doors and removing traps on chests requires a rather cheesy minigame
there were several times when i succeeded in the game but the game still reacted as if i had failednote this review is based on the alpha demo version and not the final release of this gamesimply bad
i dont know how the final version will be but the demo of this game is horrible
dated graphics engine bad physics simple ai poor gameplay etc not good at all
they will have to do a lot of tweaking on this game to convence me to go buy this game when it comes out in a few days from now but right now as is its junki would rather play castle strike than this title which is another bad gameif you want actionadventure and rpg style game play with spells and powers and hl graphics engine get vampire bloodlines its much much much better than this junk
trust methis game disgusts me to the point where i dont even want to write a review
call it laziness but look at other negative reviews and my points would be about the same
this game is a complete waste of money and im seriously considering lobbying for a classaction lawsuit against the publishersi downloaded the demo twice from two different sites and the game screen would not even load
so i have no idea what the game is like
but hey its pretty pathetic when you cant even get a game companys demo to work and its not my system because i am running a top of the line dell the fault falls on dwbradley heuristic park inc dreamcatcher all of thema friend of mine bought the game for his new dell system and couldnt get it to work either
half the features dont even work
thats just sick
pure garbageso this is what i think every single person that purchased this piece of trash should have their money refunded
dw bradley and everyone else that played a part in the creation and distribution should be sued
the last time i checked there was and is a law against false advertising every last copy in existence should be burneddo not buy this gamei dont understand the positive reviews 
 i backup all the negative points already stated  the only only game that comes to mind as being this buggy was sacredbut its fixed with the latest patch  to remove instead of fix problems  tells me they rushed this out and didnt want to put in the time to fix it  or just dont care 
 the fighting system  poor  so that means you got an incomplete buggy and poor attempt at a gameplay  was given the gamefree by a friend who pointed out what most have stated  i really didnt want to belive it was that bad  yes it is as bad as the poor reviews state  i gave it to charity  maybe they can get a few bucks for it  been really disappointed in most games out the past  months or so  seems either graphicsmultiplayerantipiracy hoops to jump through are the main concerns of game developers  so ive turned to looking for overlooked older games and replaying favorites  games dont have to be complicated to be fun  this isnt an endorsement but ive had good luck with groove games relatively inexpensive war shooters  im not asking for much decent graphics  decent storylineif rpg  good gameplaysadly what could have been a terrific came was released prematurely
pc gamers review of zero stars is harsh but if they wont give us a finsished game why should they get any stars at allhopefully in a few patch versions theyll get caught up but by that time dreamcatcher heuristic park and dungeon lords will become will become a new catchphrase and joke for the industry trend to release games before they are donewhythe ability to patch a game does not give a manufacturer the right to sell you incomplete goods
its false advertising should be illegal and shows a blatent disregard for their paying customers
previous customers  i expect a book to be finished when i buy it i dont expect to see a half edited film when i pay my ticket to see a movieone other thingto all of you who review the item with out actually playing the thing stop
this is a forum for informed opinions about a product from people who have experience with the product
when i read about people rating a game they havent played because the site wont let them express an opinion with out doing sodontthis game might appeal to some people
but i dont know any of them
i knew pretty quick that i dont like it
tried to give it away to a couple of people
no one wants itfrom my original reviewif george lucas and the folks at lucas arts who are responsible for this game care about the future of star wars games  or the future of their jobs they will release a serious patch to this game that fixes the many many problems that are here
well theyve released a patch but its certainly not everything we wished fori was very upset over this game when i first bought it
it had so many bugs and so many annoying storyplot holes that it was painful to play at times
obsidian and lucas arts just released a patch for the game that addresses a few of the problems i was having  but there really isnt much they could do about the holes in the story because they rushed the game to stores instead of letting the designers finish the gameonce patched kotor  the sith lords is more fun to play  similar to the original kotor
the only thing that prevents it from getting a perfect score on the fun scale is the fact that there are still a few holes in the storyplot huge chunks that are completely missing
that and since it was rushed there are some parts of the game that are just underdeveloped meaning its hard to understand what is going on in parts because the writersdesigners didnt have time to put in the needed story elements so that players clearly understand whats going onmy overall rating of the game has improved since the patch because i dont have as many annoying crashes and performance problems
i would now give it a  or  stars overallif you loved kotor then kotor  can be fun  just be prepared for some frustrating times and make sure you update with the patchthis game at present is in terrible shape
my character has things coming out of his head
also for some reason the camera spins wildly around my character at some times
it appears to be the same engine that powered kotor because it definitely isnt any better lookingso why the problems
lucasarts says lowend video cards are responsible for these errorssorry guys
my comp is  ht p gig ram  mb ati radeon
this game should run fine especially since it isnt anything comparable to highend games in looks like doom or halflife  which both ran great on my comp
fix it lucasartsobsidian
i wouldnt recommend buying this game until these major bugs are fixed
wait a couple of months till they release the real game
avoidi loved the first game
that was a good game this game is terrible
i finally threw this game away from frustration
this game wasnt completed its buggy and lucas arts will never recieve a penny for another game from mei have windows  and it doesnt work
it just crashes as soon as you play it
infact this game has ruined my computer
im not sure why but now everytime i use my computer its super slow and it started happening when i played this game
coincidencewarningthis game is incomplete and will leave gamers frustrated and bored out of their respective wits
that would be a good warning that lucasarts could have slapped on the back of kotor
this halfbaked yet full priced game is a complete catastophe
so here is a joke
what do you get when you add broken gameplay imcomplete storyline confusing controls and horrible graphics
kotor of course
now you may think i am just being mean but i dont particularly enjoy bashing games
i much rather enjoy praising them but in cases like this there is just no praise to be found
ok i would not be so mad if lucasarts actually stuck with their promise of releasing a patch to solve this horrendous mess
but i regret to say that they have so far released no such thing
and unless they do soon i will tell you to stay away from this game at all costsi have the first kotor game and the game ran almost perfectly with no glitches awsome gameplay and a satisfying endingthis however was none of these things it crased so many times i just gave up playing i have state of the art system just for your info it wich means this game was a total waste of money and time
the plot has a million holes in it and seems to not tell you what really happens
some poeple i know complained about carth in the first one but all of the characters in this game are  times worse
one very annying factor is your hk droid is totaly ruined compared to the hilarious insulting robot from the original that we all liked
so now i have a  dollar paper weight
wow do i feel lucky
ltso basically this game is for kotor fanatics onlyi want to say first off that this is a pretty good game
the fun factor is  for sure for me and i beat the game  times
that said i had to buy it for xbox
the pc version is not user friendly in the least
you will be able to install your game but unable to play it on vista
i have checked around on  different sites no one can give a straight answer to the problem
even if you manage to play the game it does have a lot of glitching and freezing at some points mostly while opening things and running around a lot
but from time to time throwing grenades can also trigger it
dont get me wrong the game itself is fun customizing is average as i would have liked to choose from a variety f faces attires and saber styles for the get go
choosing your path is a bit too straight forward it seems but all and all it is a fun game
once you have beaten it about  times you are ready to retire it for a long time
after a year or two you may go back to it again only to realize its shear simplicity
that said once i was able to play the game smoothly the first few times it was pretty epic considering when it came out and all
comparing it to games today it still gets a fairly decent score in the fun department
i would still give it  for the fun and back then a 
so why the one star
well because i was refering more to being able to play the xbox version this pc version was never able to launch and so if the game cant be played how can it be any goodknights of the old republic  was one of the greatest games and stories every in videogames
thats just my opinion but any rpg fan  star wars geek or just any gamer that enjoys a deep story will agree
i think ive beaten the first game six or seven times
i was really excited for knights of the old republic  sith lords
i remember  the day i got it
i installed that bad boy and with wide eyes and a smile i created my future jedi guardian
my wide eyes and smile turned into shooting daggers and grinding teeth and me saying waitwhat huh who this guy talking about wait why am i here
 what was the point of that this cant be the only dialog choices they give me that cut scene makes no sense what kind of garbage ending was that
 ive beaten kotor  three times now and its obvious this game is completely and painfully unfinishedso lets talk about this poop shoot game first
its  playable and combat is an exact clone of the original
so if your a fan of combat from the first game youll be happy but like a double edge sword this is a freakin sequel it should be enhanced but they didnt change anything at all and i mean anythingincluding skillsthe main problem with this game is the most important thing with a game like this the storynow first let me explain something
bioware is the company that made the first knights of the republic
bioware is also responsible for making other great games like baulders gate  neverwinter nights  jade empire and most notably the mass effect saga
now after bioware made kotor  they immediately began work on jade empire for xbox
lucustarts wanted them to make the sequel to kotor unfortunately their developers were tied up with jade empire
so lucustarts turned to obsidian a well known company that made such hits as icewind dale neverwinter nights  and fallout new vegas
sounds confusing doesnt it
obsidian is well known for picking up sequels that bioware and bethesda dont have time for
but theyre still a great company
unfortunately when they took on a sequel for knights of the old republic its obvious that they struggled with it and lucustarts really rushed them on the project
i thinknoi know that obsidian couldnt have done better than bioware
the story was to much for them to take on
unless they couldve gotten into the minds of bioware and gotten more time to work on the project i think fans like me wouldve been much more satisfiedjust like in kotor  you wake up on a a ship with no memory and you have to relearn your powersgeeoff the bat this game sucks
are you serious 
the further you get in this game feels like a cheap rip off of the first
except your an exiled jedi they call the exilewow the cheese is strong in this one
you have to go around the galaxy looking for the rest of the jedi which are almost driven to extinction by the sith
hmmm thats funny  in the first game i destroyed the sith armada
it doesnt matter
kotor  didnt follow the plot to first which it shouldve but it does desperately try to name drop from it
kotor fails to follow its own plot
each story quest is a struggle to get momentum going and the events that happen within move the arc of the plot further away
the boring characters who join you all have lack luster and generic personas
you wont want to befriend any of them or romance them
each character in the first game all had a story to tell and a quest to boot
in kotor  the characters leave you scratching your head and going mmmmkkkk i guess since i have no more dialog options ill go see what the droids are up too
its really frustrating when this happens
once i noticed i was headed towards the endgame i knew it was almost over
i had more questions than answers and strange cut scenes started playing
a boss fight later and credits rolled
my jaw dropped and curses flared out
i immediately started another gamesame thingthird gamesame
this games plot is just a wrecksome people agree with me and some people say im to hard on it
we should be hard on sequels to great games
its one thing if the sequel isnt as good as the first but its an insult to just give up and send an unfinished product to the consumer
obsidian pulled a fast one on us
many well known magazines praised this game as good
how this happens
i dont know but i do know that knights of the old republic  sith lords is an unfinished game
and unfinished games do not deserve praise no matter what the title of the game is
if you never played knights of the old republic  you can get it on steam for cheap and even on ipad
if you want to play the sequel find a box write  this has lightsabers on it dump in used kitty litter with a glow stick and thats about as good as knights of the old republic  sith lords ispokemon is like so old and nintendo is sitting on the ledge of their backs trying to revive a game and trading cards for little babies and toddlers
even the whole pokeacutemon fad are mostly consisted of    yearold asians that cant do anything better than to play some japanese crapget to play something like mario and also play the old arcade classics like galaga donkey kong xevious pole position more others and the legendary ms and pac man which are all classified as the most popular games of all time  thus which you call are real games and not like a game that involves baby cute monsters with annoying little anime characters battling with theiror if you dont prefer to play real games then youd rather spend playing sports and other stuff in the outside world
oh when will this craze ever die
so we can get back to our living needspokemon must diethis is the worst outfit around in the mmog world and that is saying somethingfrom game design to playability to long term appeal their games are bottom of the barreland regarding customer service  forget about it
you are just a dollar figure to them they dont give a youknowwhat about anything else like improving their products or listening to feedback from their customers and making appropriate changesfor an example go to the sony station forums for everquest  there you will see a section titled the glass house the title alone is a dead giveaway of soes attitude towards their customers where customers who complain about eq  threads are all locked and sent
this gives you an idea of what soe thinks of their customers
if you dont love their game and act like a sycophant and praise every boneheaded decision they make you are persona non grataeq  continues sony online entertainments abysmal track recorda local area friend of mine started out as a beta tester for eq and became frustrated and bored with it and allowed me to continue in his place and while the game has many beautiful graphical elements far surpassing anything else its the skeleton of the game i must now tell you aboutif you are a diehard group oriented type player you will most likely enjoy eqif you are diehard solo oriented type player you will not enjoy eqthe content is so group oriented that on some of your core quests to continue to level requires a group
this is the bad part about the game as a wholeif you are a duo husband and wife team like you are going to run into the same problems you wont even be able to kill the quest mob as a duo you need that rd person
this is a very sad part of the game and for many working class adultsthe mobs are setup mostly for  players  being the optimum choice with one archetype of each catagory healer scout mage warror the other two can be anything really scout this time around being most important because they are the ones that create the bonus specials to combatmostly through my beta play i researched and tested the solo content that i could find and while early on there seemed to be viable content in open areas and dungeons alike the recent last patch has now taken away all dungeon content for soloists
thus the soloist is reduced to yard trash mobs with little or no loot and never any decent loot at all and the slowest experience grind aroundit appears as if soe has misled us while not misleading us they love to use play on words like you can solo to  yep you can solo to  but you will pay hell doing so
you will find yourself frustrated and unrewarded for your play other than experience which is about rd if that much that of what groups get per kill
you will be reduced to buying all of your gear from crafters or other players and never feel any satisfaction of a reward for all your work
this is not good for those who enjoy soloingthere is no twinking other than you can hand down level restricted equipment to your alts or someone lower but you will never see the likes of a level one in level  gear anymore or even level  gear there is basically no powerleveling since all encounters are locked and outside buffings or heals or special spells by other players have no affect
once you are in a locked encounter you are own your own whether grouped or solo thats all the power youre going to ever get
so those expecting their buddies to powerlevel them up in eq you had better start looking for another game
its gonethe grouping levels are about the same as eqlive starting out you can group with people about  levels higher than you and it scales up as you gain levels at about a  range
you can be  of another persons level and still group with themi pity some of you on launch day be prepared to be bombarded by group requests relentlessly
even in beta there are just too many children playing it
be prepared for the vulgar mouthed smack talking rude crude and socially unacceptable causing ruin to your gaming pleasure and groups
because now when one person dies the whole group pays for it th of your experience is zappoed everytime some idiot or fool does something stupid
and you know kids they love to do stupid things and cause frustrationthe game is being launched about  complete if that its not exactly ready but its ready sort of thing
its ready enough that it will probably have the same kind of launch day and days and weeks ahead as any other
expect long downtimes for emergency patches and possibly to not even be able to login at all that first day
expect quests to be broken
expect crashes to desktop
actually just expect the norm cause thats just how they do these games nowadays theres not a one that doesnt have bugsflaws gaming issues and incomplete programming when released
you can buy it or not thats your choice just expect to have some rough and rocky rides along the wayif i were group oriented i would probably enjoy the ride of eq but i am predominantly a soloist and when i beta test that is what i look for in them how much do they offer a casual player with little time to play  to  hours a day if that
not all casual players are soloist but many are forced to solo in these games due to time factors
and when it takes hours to find a group or someone that will have you you just dont get your moneys worth out of the gameduos might do a little better if you are willing to pick up a rd one extra is not as bad as  extra because the more you have in your group the more chance you have of gaining that idiot or fool i spoke of beforemy review here is focused on how i play and what i look for of course i cannot descibe every little detail about eq i have descibed and reviewed what i felt important to deliver to the rest of the uninformed out there that might be thinking about buying this game for the same reason i thought about buying it but will no longer be doing so
i hope it was helpfuli played eq from release
i am an experienced gamer having played eq for  years ao for  years wwiiol for  years acbeta coh daoc eve and even sowithout a doubt eq has so many bells and whistles that the early part of the game should appeal to anyonethere is a great customization feature on creation that allows for some good face mixing but no clothingthere is a good tutorial that gets the novice player right into the gamethe starting quests further involve you in the workings of the game and no player should feel lostthe weapon armor and spell variety are sufficient to be interesting to almost everyonethe quests are generally rewarding with only  or so being pointless duds for rewardsthe class quests are simple require a little thought but arent so harsh that  of the player base couldnt figure out how to finishthe mobs are very plentiful for rapid lowlevel advancementzones are instanced when the population gets heavy meaning youll have  other instances of the same zone to enter if one is far too crowdedcombat is fun with special moves available that drastically help a player win a hard combatbut sometimes the bells and whistles ring flatthe special combat moves are not intuitive and require offline study to understandplayers mash buttons in groups  meaning that special moves are very hard to pull off in almost all groups
unless you have consistent friends who all agree to pursue the moves dont count on getting any offas a player reaches the midteens in level the mobs become underconned
meaning you will need to start groupingas you hit your s the experience penalties begin hitting so severely that many players will quit a group if just one player diesin certain areas  healer will not suffice
 or more are required
much time is spent waiting for a second healer before adventuring
many times the group breaks up before a nd healer is foundthe experience grind is so bad that only someone with  hours per night can hope to progress considering that an hour or two is spent making a group and hoping that no one diestaken together this is not a solofriendly game and after playing into my s this game took on the ugly aspect of work
the game is not suitable for duos either my wife and i play togetherunless you are prepared to spend hours hoping for a good group each night of  people then dont buy this game
it might be worth the purchase if you intend to stay in the lowbie levels
it is definitely worth the purchase if you are a powergamer with  hours per day available to spendit aint worth your money if youre looking for a game to carry your poor solo or duo butts through more than a month of playrecommendation consider the above three types of player carefully before you buyrct incluye ya a rct con sus expansiones pero este pack incluye eso y  expansiones con cientos de atracciones tiendas escenarios y cosas para personalizar tu parque tematico pero esta vez la variante seran la epoca y el lugaraggghhh
i cant believe my xp cant handle it
the game crashes even with the smallest of rollercoasters built
any more than  people in the park and it packs up
forget the scenarios theyve already got too much in them for my pc to cope with
i havnt given this game a proper fun rating because i really dont have much idea how it plays yet
i havnt had much chanceluckily ill be getting a top of the range pc early next year
my ones got jittery of late anyway
so hopefully ill be able to give a proper review soon
im hopeful since many reviwers here have got it working long enough to assess it in detaili got it with a gift card
i thought that it would be good to play because i love the first one the expansion packs and roller coaster tycoon  it just isnt good
for like i think i got it for more at best buy its a waste of money
the graphics are nothing compared to the first  gamesand their expansion packsi urge anyone who is interested in buying this game to try out the free demo available for download on the atari websitethey the new developers not chris sawyer attempted to reinvent a game that worked brilliantly in its previous incarnations only they should have stopped at the visuals which are very impressive and that really is the only place the original game failed
the core game play is so very confusing now and the interface is just little dots with meaninless icons that fill your screen with visual overload
nothing is where it used to be and things are split across multiple icons that it becomes a hunt and peck situationthe core mechanics of the game the way you build rides  place sidewalks have all changed so significantly i feel theyve destroyed the game in the process
i am a huge fans of rct and  but im seriously considering passing on this hunk of junkthis game is a complete waste of time
by far the most unrealistic hunting game everanyone that has ever hunted will toss this game out quicki tried this game when it was first released with many bugs and found it almost unplayable
then i downloaded the patch and things worked fine but it seemed that the game was biased against meso i sold that copy and forgot about this game until this version came out
i figured that after all this time and feedback they must have fixed this game or tweaked it a bit at least in the gameplay area but i was wrongthis time i played the game very well only to get to the modern age and find that the only pool of oil is halfway around the world and one of the other superpowers has it
the opponent then builds tanks which i cant and destroys me after ive wasted oops i mean invested many hours of gameplayit seems that you either  become a complete fanatic and study the fan sites and discussion boards and learn the specific peculiarities of the various civs and wind up playing it for years
in other words put in the time required to complete a law degree at night but rather than a new career youve got civ geeks you can chat with
realize after playing for so many hours that the whole soundtrack is playing and looping in your head that the game is still flawed
it could have been tweaked a bit just to make it reasonably winnable
like maybe distribute resources something like they are in the real earth with oil in a number of different continents
but the people behind the game didnt and they got your money again and you sell the game used and recover most of your money before the next version of this game comes out  which it now has with apparently lots of bugs  so ill wait a year or two until its fixed and buy a used copy and try againand you correctly guessed that i chose option so its a five star fun game that could have been great with a little more fine tuning but ends up being an exercise in futilityi installed and enjoyed this game until i found my usb cddvd combo drive wouldnt work then my ie browser started crashing and soon after i realized that this game installed securom v on my pc
i am not impressed
i completely uninstalled the game but could not get rid of securom
i still get requests to register civ complete when i logon to my pc even though its uninstalled and my drive is still not functioning and ie is still crashing
there is no warning on the box anywhere that securom is on it  i never would have purchased or installed it had i been aware
the only solution now is to reformat my entire drive and install the os from scratch
the game itself i would rate  stars but the securom bs
ruined my experienceive never played the original sid meiers pirates
but i have played cutthroats which i found to be very lavish and expansive despite severe limitations regarding commanding troops to besiege cities and other sorts of detailsthis one has rather good graphics for a relatively small game and plays well and fluidly
for my taste it has far too great of a cartoonishness to it which severely limits the potential for it to be as violent and cutthroat as well cutthroats
theres no throatcutting in this onejust a swing on a rope a haha and a smirk as the enemy shakes his fist and goes oooh youuu
the campaigns as well follow an utterly ridiculous task of find baron montalbon or whatever his name is whom you defeat in battle and he gives you one piece of a multipiece map to find a family member of yours
then you must track him down again because youre apparently too stupid to have him tell you everything then kill him to get another piece of that one map
once you have all the pieces you rescue your family member never see them again and have to hunt down the same person again and again for more map pieces for family members ranging from aunts sisters fathers mothers etceterathen theres ridiculous quests involving lost cities and hunting down famous pirates from history all just smashed together in whatever year you pick
despite supposedly gaining infamy for killing these famous pirates you dont get anything except the number  slot on most famous pirates and a lot of moneya surprising feature which seems to severely limit my actions is that as soon as you start to gain successes commanding multiple ships with a hundred or more men and lots of gold morale starts going down the crapper at breakneck speed to a point where even getting vast amounts of gold cant solve ityour best result is to either kill them off in pitched battles or retire for a short while
this eats away a few years of your life before you return with a smaller crew and smaller shipabout the only aspects of gameplay which are always entertaining are ship battles and turnbased gridbased land battles
ship battles are real time involving simultaneous use of steering and sluggish firing to break down your enemys ship and either destroy it or board and force a surrender or fight it out on deck where surprisingly your forces always seem to die quicker than the enemys no matter what
land battles are particularly fun in execution and strategybut these are very very small aspects of a broader game which most of the time is spent sailing and the wind almost always blows in one direction for months endlessly making sailing take a lot of gametime and visiting cities to do the exact same dreckget a few minor upgrades to your ships sell some cargo visit the tavern to recruit some random bandits speak to a cloned barmaid about whatever usually she doesnt give you anything important just ooh you so scary you is numba  pirate in the evar or talk to some random guy in a corner offering valuable things like jewelry or maps or informationthen theres dancing
every major town has a governor who has a daughter who comes in three formats plain attractive beautiful
every time you visit you do a little olde english dance to baroque harpsichord music and you must press buttons properly in sequence or trip over your own clownshoes
she basically falls in love with you based on your dancing giving her stuff and killing her suitors
i havent yet discovered if this has any relevance to the overall gameplay at all or is just an excuse to add another minigame into it complete with more cleavageonce youve reached an old age and are too sick to pirate it will always be sickness that forces you to retire you cannot continue on with your character
but really you wouldnt want to
new games no matter if you start in    or  are exactly the same as one another with the exact same quests games technology and pirates
this is a dumbeddown kiddiefriendly version of historical piracy in the carribean and as such you dont get to live the life of a real pirate complete with kidnapping butchering people scurvy ransoming people for medical supplies actual event blackbeard ransomed people for medicine sex drinking black bart roberts died because his ship was ambushed while his men were all drunk etceteraeven pirates of the carribean was more violent and realistic than this gamebeing that they are of the same genre i have to compare cutthroats with pirates
in cutthroats you can invade cities with massive armies of your men including with cannons taken off your ship have townspeople try to fight you off then surrender and you can take them prisoner or execute them including women and children you have to keep your ship supplied not only with food but with gunpowder for the cannons accessories like sugar and rum and tobacco for the mens morale you have to buy guns and grenades and pistols if you want to arm your men for personal combat lifeboats if you want your men to survive when the ship sinks and wait in harbor for your ship to be repaired if damagedin pirates all you need is food and cannons
everything else is provided and repairs are done instantaneously
while landbattles are fun they are only more fun than in cutthroats because in cutthroats the map is huge and your men move at a snails pace quite literally
theres no murdering raping pillaging or anything that was synonymous with pirateswhile the game has a fun nostalgia effect to it  the system crashes make it unplayable
my system is top of the line custom built in march of  constant system lock ups and crash to reset make it not worth the money
apparently some users have figured out that it is due to incompatability with intel chipsetswhatanyway the game company provides no fixes and no forumsfaqs on the website
tell you anything
bottom line  save your money for something that works as intendedit amazes me that people actually review something before it actually gets released and theres no beta or demo version out eitheryes we all know the original pirates was one of the most highly addictingbest games of all time
if this game is half as fun as the original it will be a huge success
howeverall you have to do is look at some other remake games to realize sometimes this doesnt happendevelopers monkey too much with the game play and it ruins the game eg
master of orion iii
wait until the game is released or youve atleast played a demo or beta version before you rate somethingotherwise its just useless conjecturehalo  is worst than halo  the doubling up on weapons isnt that cool because you waste all your ammo on one alien
the aliens look a lot like monkeys and half the time they only die when you hit them with your gun so halo  isnt really a shooter game
some missions are too enclosed so when you start a fight there is no where to go
even if you liked halo  dont get this because this game is so stupidi think this game needs a ladder to get above one level to crapthe devil may cry series is headed down hill
the original was a wonderful game but i just plain couldnt handle devil may cry   the dialogue is absolutely horrible
dante spouts the most lame phrases youve ever heard
not much plot here just lots of slashing
although the slashing is more difficult seeing as the american normal mode is equal to the japanese hard mode
all in all a pretty worthless game
stick to your origins because capcom has tried to become too mainstreamthis game was pure crap
words cannot explain how crappy this game really is
this game is like puke telling crap it smells good
if you buy this game you are wasting precious dollars on pure garbage
u bastardscapcom is working on a special edition version of this game where it will have a new character to play as and extra bonus stagesthis game looks and plays great
unfortunately the people who made this game dont seem to realize that video games are supposed to be entertaining and not frustrating
i beat the game in normal difficulty but there were lots of struggles and cursing along the way
i would give this game a higher rating if not for the cheap diffulty level
if i wanted to test my skills by fighting hard battles id choose hard mode
thats the reason why some games allow you to choose the level of difficulty
the normal mode in this one however is like extreme in most other games
i dont think i would want to try the extreme mode or even the hard mode on this one
dont buy if you dont have alot of patience
the only thing that kept me trying to beat this game was the story which i should say was pretty goodresident evil  was the longawaited sequel to resident evil  development took a long time and had many hands
so what do we have herewell you have a handful of weapons that must now be manually aimed
these weapons can be upgraded in statistics such as reload speed power and clip size
aiming is done via a red laser that tags what you are looking at
enemies are now infested spanish villagers who will drop ammo once they are killednext rather than being in the confined areas of the mansion you get to roam larger open areas with houses
these environments are done in full d meaning they arent background pastes
also you can interact with them by pressing the a button to do moves such as jumping out the window opening doors etcfinally the largest change is not the controls as many would believe
its the camera
the camera now follows leon behind his back
and this is how resident evil became truly dnow are these changes good or bad
lots of re fans will tell you it improved the series
but the reality here is that thats not the case
re has lost the static camera ammo fearing nature that it once was
it has turned into an action gamewhat largely happens throughout your play is that you enter an area pick off multiple enemies pick up ammo and proceed to the next area
compare that to resident evil  on the gamecube where you would get a piece of one puzzle that would unlock when you beat anotherammo is ridiculously plentiful and scattered everywhere which further reinforces this new type of gameplay
how good is the storyline
ill tell you a bit and you judge for yourself
the presidents daughter has been kidnapped by spanish villagers who are infested with a parasite that grows in their bodies
so they only send leon with no guns other than a pistol and with no backup like the army
then you have ada wong randomly appear and do backflips and acrobatic moves in a dress and high heelsso yes resident evil has turned from a game that was about conserving your ammo figuring out how to solve puzzles and an atmosphere of fear to a game of mindless blasting
the storyline is absolutely not related to the other res and the cutscenes become overthetop unrealistic
that seems to be the trend for re and beyond so if you are a fan of this thats greatotherwise weve lost a great franchise in a dying genrethis game is unplayable after just  mins playing it i had to stop cause it made me feel sick and dizzy from the game playeven my gf who was watching me play it got sick and dizzy from just watching the screenthe other resident evil games are just fine i played them for hours and never had once got dizzy or felt sick from thembut this one is like medal of honor for any of you who have played medal of honor you know what im talking aboutit makes you sick and dizzy playing itdont know why the makers of this game couldnt keep it like the new and improved resident evil for gamecubethe fact that this games movement makes you sick and dizzy makes this unplayable and that is a major flawi dont recommend this for anyonei love ubisoft they have made some of the bestgames out therebut they totally messed up on this gameit seems like something from the early sthe aircraft handle terribly even if using a joystickpoint the nose up a few degrees  the plane stalls
what fun is thatthat would be more consistent with world war  biplanes that had tiny enginesmoreover the scenarios are very primitive and boringif youre an il fan u will be badly  disappointedrecieved game v  days ago and ran great out of the box
updated game with the latest patches for standalone version now game dont work
ubisoft had me change alot of my settings and game still dont run
sent information about my system to ubisoft  days ago havent heard from them yet
im not changing any more of my settings just to run this game
my operating system is xp pac  processor amd athlon  dual core  ghz and  mb ram and nvidia geforce gt card
so i have more than enough to run this gamethis review will be short because i was never able to play the game
be careful if you buy the pc version of the game
make sure your system requirements are exactly what is on the box or you will be as dissapointed as i was
even my top of the line computer wouldent run it because i didnt have one of the handfull of vidio cards supported
bottom line buy with cautionwhy is this game being advertised on television as if it is a new game
it is a year old and apparently a port to the pcafter unloading a full clip at a nazi ten feet away from me and hitting nothing for the hundreth time i uninstalled this game and deleted the file
im very happy with the price i paid for itthis game is repetitive annoying and frustratingrepetitive every mission is almost exactly the same
move a little forward trigger the oncoming nazis command your squad to shoot while you navigate around the obstacles to shoot the nazis which become instantly aware of your presence through some mystical scrying powersannoying you can only listen to the bap bap bap bap of an mg endlessly firing without ever having to swap hot barrels for a good hour or two before you smash your speakers through the nearest window
the speech your squadmates shout is always the same
i got sick of hearing the same darn loud annoying voice everytime i issued a commandfrustrating there is no way to hit anything in this game
your gun constantly wavers about uselessly
you can use up all your ammo shooting at one stinkin guy because your highly accurate m rifle couldnt hit fat albert if he was strapped to the broad side of a big red barn that was on fire
you can round a corner and unload an entire clip of your thompson at a guy crosshairs deadon and pepper the wall behind him but put zero holes in him
what is this pulp fiction
this was the last straw for mei decided it wasnt worth finishing this game
i kept rounding a particular corner armed with the foreknowledge of the enemys position theres no variation in this game and kept unloading my thompson on him and kept getting instantly killed
over and over and over
it has since been uninstalled saves and profile deletedfirst of all any review of this game dated before march is a load of lies
lies
this game was not available until 
not august 
how honest can a reviewer of this product be if the game was not available at the time the review was written
go home losers
get a lifelet me cut to the quick brothers in arms tries to be call of duty with squad based action
it fails miserably
this game tries to offer a really solid squad based game
no more typical first person shooter
in other words you dont go running full speed shooting everything in site
and your squad mates actually do help you defeat the enemysadly this sounds better than it actually isgame graphics this game runs on the unreal engine so i expected top of the line graphics
you get far less than that
even the soldiers have no facial expressions
their lips move but the face does not change or offer any emotion or expression
stick lips on a x pine plank and you will get the same experience
vocalsdialog ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh soooo painful
cliche after cliche tons of curse words thrown in as a desperate attempt to give you the grit of war
bad monologues that run on forever bad cutscenes nothing interesting at allweapons nice selectionbut highly inaccurate
to get any accurate shooting done you must aim down the barrel
with all the fast action going on you have no time to aim and line up a shot
if you shoot with out aiming you better be  feet away from the guyand even then they will kill you quick
you will not get the chance to use many of the weapons eitherunless you hunt on the ground for the dead soldiers dropped weaponsgameplay squad based activity is decent but repetitive
the missions are almost pointless and definitely are redundant
it winds up turning into the same thing everytime
get ready start the mission germans appear order your squad to provide cover fire while you flank them and kill them
wash rinse and repeatuntil the game is finally donegame length short and not creative
i finished this game on the difficult setting in  hours
i finished it on the hardest setting in  hours
too short and the gameplay is so clumsy at times that you just dont want to play it again
not rewarding at allno one ever expects a sequel to match the original but even when approaching it from that angle this game is horrible
if you must play it do yourself a favor and wait until the game is on the discount rackwhich by my estimation shouldnt be too long from now
had this game had to stand on its on merits i have no doubt it would be a complete and utter failure
why
the storylinewhat little there was extremely lame and weak
there is only one thing truly genius  about it they were able to take a  hour story and stretch it into  some grueling hours of bored anticipation
bored anticipation
whatever do i mean
ill explain
they kept showing movie clips of things going on with the characters and things around you but not a single one played out
for instance it showed me a short clip of someone making contacting with carth but carth played absolutely no role in the game and no information adding to game was given in the clipso your setting there bored to tears playing the game but the clips lead you to believe more is just about to happen that the plot will thicken that finally all the hours of torture youve endured playing this stupid game will pay off but thenwell just when you cant believe the game could get any worse you come to the ending and the game plummets to lows no video game i have ever played has reached
your only sense of satisfaction is knowing you will never have to endure another minute of torture playing this game hoping praying and having the faith to believe it will get betteri could write plenty more about my disappointments in this game from its annoying plotless no personality characters to the mundane get you nowhere fast tasks to the add no real value to the game conversations to the who thought being a jedi could suck fights but hopefully i convinced you to save yourself a little money by waiting to purchase this game
this game isnt just a poor sequel its a poor game overall
but if you choose to waste your money on this gamewell dont say you werent warnedoh sorry but one more thing that really adds to the cons of this gameall the time spent waiting for scenes to loadi turned on my computer and surfed the web while i waited trust me youll need something to do because you wont get wrapped up in the plot or lack thereof of this gamewarning some spoilers discussed possibly as i go on
i have been a game player for many years now
i have always leaned towards the rpg side and kotor was a great game
the sequel however is a rushed buggy game that does not improve much upon the first one
i feel fairly good about saying this was a rush job to get out before xmassacrificing game play and storyling testing for the dollarfirst lets talk about controls
they are much like the first one
once you are in a battle you have many selections to choose from and it becomes very cumbersome to do alot of strategy besides whether to pick flurry or power shot
the queue system helps some but if you move or pick something else your queue gets reset
also the new powers added to the game really dont add very much from what the first game had  you will fiund yourself still using heal and stunhorror as in the first game
also you will notice players gettting stuck alot and terrible ai
i more than once was able to kill enemies by just standing far away and shooting them without them ever engaging menext the story itself
the storyline is very average
there are no big surprises and the slight inclusion of the characters from the first game is not very exciting
the influence feature is just afwul for your party members
you do not influence them
you have to answer the dialauge sections as they would like to hear or you lose influence and you will not find out very much about them
also several story arcs are never completed and some just make no sense
you will understand what i mean if you decide to play this gameespecially one of the worst rpg endings in memorydont buy these reviews from people who think this is the best thing going
it was a rehash of the first game with bugs and unfininshed ideas
trust me and rent before you buythis game is so bad you cant even get started in it the instruction manual has no information of any use and the on screen help is nonexistentgo for reel fishing  or earlier reel fishing games such as  and the original one if you want to enjoy a fishing gamemy review could be an exact copy of what j tyson wrote on august enjoyed playing this game up to the point it becomes impossible
how is this
it started in dragast the second stage of the game
the first puzzle i encountered was visually blocked out by green and white vertical lines that cover the entire screen
i thought maybe this was an isolated problem
i was able to get by this one puzzle referring to a walkthrough kind of ruins it for me
the very next puzzle had a similar problem
i contacted dreamcatcher and was given a patch to download and install that was supposed to fix the problem
no such luck
i have since been requested to provide some information from my pc and i am waiting for a response
this problem occured with two separate sets of disks
only some of the puzzles are affected
i think the graphics are great and would love to be able to play this game minus the problemsive done everything company has advised over their website to no avail
it would be real nice to spend this kind of money for some enjoyment and get grief instead
otherwise as far as it goes up until dragast its a pretty nice game
nice if company did more for quality controlyou enter a room collect some things and solve a puzzle
then you enter another room and solve a puzzle
then you go outside and solve a puzzle
then you go someplace else and solve some puzzles
exquisitely rendered graphics cannot compensate for the absence of a story interesting characters or dialogue
one walkthrough simply dismisses the game and tells you how to solve the puzzles
it is just another puzzle gamethis south korean game is very boring
i got a free trial and gave up after a couple nights
they had some bandwidth problems too so this is worth less than nothing
some of the english text in the game is poorly translated and makes zero sense to a native english speaker
this game doesnt even deserve half a starwhy play this when you cannot read the  code
if you need a new doorstop buy this game
aggravation is paramount to trying to play thisword of caution i explained all the acronyms and onling game lingo i used in my review in case those who are reading dont know the vocabulary
if youre an experienced player just read past it  i didnt do it to annoy you
 just about all of the features of guild wars really got me excited to play especially the minimap arrows pointing where you should go to finish quests and teleporting here and there rather than yachting or flying
i bought it the night before launch and anxiously awaited the floodgates opening at midnightunfortunately i was disappointed though clearly not all will be
i am primarily a pve player versus environment and sometimes enjoying soloing not having to group with other players
just like in real life in my virtual life i need some alone time
however soloing in guild wars is oddly depressingsince the outdoors areas are instanced meaning only you and your group or only you if there is no group no one is out there but you in the abyss
as much as i hate shouted arguments in everquest or world of warcraft and dealing with immature players who would run up to me take their computer clothes off and dance around in an attempt to either be suggestive weird or annoying more likely i actually started missing it
not the pseudocyber underpants mind you but the feel of real lifein real life things are always happening
in battle out of battle creating crafted items trading or whatever youre doing people are around
getting on your nerves providing help or just flexing because they learned how to do it an hour before other players add to the rich landscape of the game environmentin guild wars soloing single player action felt artificial to me
after  or  levels i felt i was just doing the same thing over and over again click the quest in the log and watch the arrow light up on minimap
teleport to town nearest quest target
run around eerily silent landscape evidently only bad guys live outside
and kill until i finished quest
turn in lather rinse repeati love getting lost in video games but this one truly feel like i was wasting my timethis is not a slam review by any means
i dont love pvp player versus player action
i also dont hate it
i dont love group play but i dont hate that either
some people love this game and will actually be angry to hear that someone doesnt
i guess i can understand that  you get passionate about what you like
i just dont like guild wars at all
it was just no fun for megameplay was disappointing
you learn a ton of skills right away but you can only ever use  or so and you can only use the ones you picked in town before you left for the quest
whats the point in learning hundreds of skills if you can only use 
why have  letters in the alphabet if you can only make up to letter words
they say its an innovation but i think its lame
ive heard developers say its like an electronic take on magic the gathering
i think that was supposed to entice mehow about future addons to the product
when they become available players who buy them could have  skills completely foreign and unavailable to you
sure developers guarantee that youll still be competitive but eh who knowsall of my fighting felt like a flurry of button presses
my character was casting this hitting for that and ugh it was just a mess
dont get me wrong the graphics are fantastic but i felt like i was slipping and swirling all over coated by fancy graphics but i never really felt like i could make sense of it all
lots of sparkles very esoteric
pretty but weirdly unnecessarybasically i love being able to play solo or with friends waving to people as i run by them on the road receiving a surprise buff spell a temporary statistical skill increase from a stranger or chatting in an impromptu session about what we miss from the old days of computers as we all stood at the docks leveling our fishing skillspeople make the game fun because people are what its all about
in guild wars you see people in town or in battle
otherwise its a constant reminder that youre playing on your computer all by yourself and i dont need a game to remind me of thatthe graphics were okay but the server problems even with a  mbps connection and a windows  computer made it a horrible experiencethe developers heavily promoted the pvp competition aspects of this game the player skill over hours played mantra and all that was simply misleadingthey turned it into a wow refugee camp literally on the eve of release there were many open betas to play and they were a totally different fast action teambased game
if you want a mini wow with the exact same quest icons and fed ex delivery style missions and a decent story campaign mode besides those thats good for one play through then you wont regret the month of play there is to this game
what is misleading is the pvp its not pickup and play all the things you need for it must be unlocked thus theres no way you can just pick up and play with friends like a normal team vs game
that basically killed an entire long following amount of guilds of the game and pvp is very much dead
pve also has no long term value
so the main problem here is they botched the mmo part heavily in every sense it basically feels like a single player game you can play with other people but that has low replayability once youve won itthis game obviously isnt a finished product
its full of glitches and bugs
it is hardly worth more then et for the atari it isnt worth it even if you want a time wasting game
its supposed to be a racing game but it isnt
your opponent doesnt even move
there is a fixer that you can download but even then you always win
and when you do you get greeted by a delightful  youre winner 
you can easily move off track and nobody would care
you can fly through nothing
this game has no barriers you can even pass through everything including bridges
you can even run thousands of miles in a circle and stop in a microsecondif you want to get the game for a laugh buy it but buy it somewhere else
its overpriced on amazoneveryone else has said the same things i wanna say
just download this game from a torrent site and play for yourself
you may get a slight kick out of itthis game is the worst
thats why im telling you to save your money and buy something better
this is what you do
you get a truck and race against someone
dont worry you can win every time because the opponent doesnt move
want to go straight on the bridge
you will fall through it and back up
another thing houses in the way
no problem you can go right through them also poles and other objects
you can go out of the game system and back into the race
there ya go dont waste your time and buy thisps
i would rate this game  stars if i could but it wont let meoh big rigslets just say that what everybody maybe even the  star reviews shockingly said about this game was all trueupon booting up the game theres absolutely no sound whatsoever and neither is there music
funnily enough in the credits some guy was actually credited for soundanyway you have only two gameplay options custom race and random race
custom race allows you to select your semitrailer truck and the course you race in
there are only five tracksno wait
scratch that
four tracks
one track isnt even playable as loading it crashes the game
anyway all the tracks overstay their welcome and last around  minutes
on top of that they have absolutely nothing to offer and they do not stand out from each other in any way
oh yeah and random race automatically selects your truck and track so you may have a  chance of crashing the gamenow that i think of itthe game is not only extremely bland but borderline broken
youre supposed to deliver cargo while being chased by police
the questions are where are the police
whats this truck doing here
why wont the truck move
wheres my cargo
how come my truck controls so stiffly
why do i move so freakishly fast in reverse
why do i stop dead in my tracks when i stop reversing
why can i go through all the objects as if they have no substance
why can i drive up and down mountains
why is this game so utterly broken
overall as long as you stay away from this game youre winnerif you read all the other reviews i think you get the point i just dont get why would they even relase a game that isnt finished
and even if the game was finished it would probebly be terrible
if you look at the back of the box it says  big rig trucks with trailers  unique routes including desert forest plains and cities day time and nighttime driving will challenge even the most experienced trucker s of miles of highways and byways across america levels with a veriety of wicked challenges including the ultimate traffic stopper a police roadblockdont listen to what it says its all liesst of all the trucks dont even have trailersnd of all the maps are not at all unique they are terriblerd of all it says the game is challenging when your opponent just freezes before it reaches the finish line and sometimes when you dont even start it says youre winner
nice grammeryep you shure are a winner always at this game because it is impposible to lose
what was the company thinkingyou should see the video clips of the game your gonna lagh out loud
got search for a video of the game online and ull seeanyways remember that youre winner always at this gamethe title of my reveiw may be just a bit harsh but boy is it true
big rigs is so bad i cant even call it a game
remember superman  this game makes that one look like halflife oh where shall i begin
big rigs claims to be a racing game but you dont race anybody
your opponent is there at the beginning but he never moves
i actually sat there for two hours waiting for him to start
there isnt even any multiplayer so you cant race anybody at allthis should be enough to make this the worst game ever butwait theres more
theres the extremely cheasy graphics
all four of the tracks you can race on are incredibly blocky and look as though it has been raining mud
mud or steaming piles of horse s
there also isnt any variety in the cars
you always play the same truck every race
then theres the clipping
your car will drive through anything and everything
i dont mean crash through i mean it seemlessly passes through houses and bridges and anything else
to all of you who gave this game a five make a note when your truck goes through a bridge it is not a feature
cits a bug a horrible bug that the developers were to lazy to fixthe box says and i quote get ready for somecb talking action
but theres no cb or any sound for that matter
no engine noises no music no tire sounds no anything
even the annoying guy yelling at you in collin mccray rally is better then the silence of a crappy gamebut the final straw is what happened after  days of playing
i realized after climbing up a veritcal hill you could actually drive off into nothingness
there are no barriers you just drive off into a blank and empty world
the very words that came out of my mouth next were what the f
there is nothing decent about this game no matter what that shead poop tells you
avoid at all costsso todays game market is pretty well if not over saturated with strategy games
with this being the case it makes sense that developers of the new comers learn from and improve based on titles that have been on the shelves
obviously this logic doesnt follow through in the real world enter kingdom under firenow although some of the sounds of battle are pretty well done kuf leaves a generic after taste
swords clash with as much enthusiasm as a high school thespian take on hamlet
horses arrows trampling feet all sound generic and uninspired
the final death blow to the sound quality comes from the voice acting
dialogue feels cheap and meaningless between yawn inspiring battle charges and filler buster comments among charactersthe graphics have also suffered
although character models look good form long range animations and detail look childish at a closer glance
i simply cant say enough bad things about the animation
one such example is the way characters run through trees and obstacles it looks more like theyre running in place while the world moves around and shifts out of their way
usually poor voice acting and graphics go hand in hand and kuf is no exception
characters dont even speak their lines
instead the programmers decided to have the characters constantly chew gum  while the voice track is played
even after they speak  the characters continue to do the chewing motionis this level of programing really acceptable with the capabilities of the xboxgameplay quickly becomes boring no matter what the mission is
battles mean mashing your troops into enemy troops with the ocassional support of varying soldier types
this does add a level of tactics to the game but not enough to competeor even step in the same field as other strategy titles
the core of all battles is getting your character in the thick of the melee
the quickest and most efficient way to end these battles is by finding the commander of the enemy forces and quickly taking them out
its a good idea but translates into a random chance on the battlefield as the commanders always look like the other enemies on the screen
youll be lucky if you find themwith everything said kingdom under fire is a title that adds no ambition to the rts genre
all aspects of the game range from bland to mediocre and onward to generic
this title is obviously an attempt by programmers who love rts to get a foot hold on the genre the reallity is that they should have stayed out or developed a more valiant effort
for those with computers running at a good  ability there is an endless sea of rts games
sadly kingdom under fire throws in the towel to even the classics from the past decade
if youre curious rent it
otherwise pass it by on your way to a blizzard or sierra titlethis is just great potential wasted
the flaws lie in the outrageous difficulty you try beating the emperess messed up controls rolling the wrong way cos the camera moved causing you a fatal accident and the checkpints youll find yourself  mins back whenever you die which is every few minutes
if you combine these the game does nothing but  constantly
there is absolutely nothing to enjoy here because what is good is simply eclipsed by the hard nature and frustrating fights
the fight with the emperess are really the points where youll think i just dont want to waste my time on this if youre expecting a game like prince of persia sands of time thats a puzzlesolving sort of game look elsewhere
this game starts you right in the middle of combat
that wouldnt be a problem if the combat was fun
unfortunately its not
the controls dont feel good and its not intuitive
 minutes into the game youre fighting a boss
absolutely ridiculous
it seems they tried to put graphics over gameplay for this game
if you want a fighting game just play something like devil may cry or ninja gaiden not thisi played the game for  hours i went to sleepnot good not even worth tryingim not satisfied with the product at all
i owned the game once before and played it over and over because the game itself was awesome
im just not satisfied with this purchase because i thought that i was getting a great deal with a used game but what i was really getting was a game that didnt even work
i feel that the game shouldnt even be allowed to be sold
im not happy with this game at alli agree with the earlier review
they changed prince of persia from an excellent platformer to a ninja gaiden look alike with much more fightingsure it looks good and the gameplay is ok but the final boss jinpachi is really cheap and lame
even at the easy difficulty just a couple of hits from this freak and youre dead
the devil within minigame is also stupid some levels are just impossible and too hard
i wouldnt mind it if you could save your game whenever you want to or at least just before some critical part of the game but unfortunately that is not the case here not to mention some save points are hidden
imagine getting through the most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles spending around  hours or more to get to the boss level then finally finding yourself trying over and over to beat the boss until you just give up but you cant save your game then youre gonna have to redo the entire level again
that is one sick stupid game design
the only reason im playing this minigame is just to get the hidden itemsthe graphics in this game is the only thing in it thats better than the original
everything else is somehow worsethe biggest problem with this game is that it forces you to complete an entire multiple stage mission without being able to save after any part of it
i completed the first part of mission  and was unable to save after this stage which should have been a save checkpoint
once i completed this part i promptly got shot in the head on the harder second part of mission  and was forced to try the entire mission overthe aming with any of the guns is absolutely horrible as well
the orders you can give to your teammates is restricted to covering fire taking point throwing grenades or coming back to your position
your team also wont engage any enemy they see on their own either without you firing or directing them to provide covering fireordinarily an enhanced enemy ai would be a good thing but even during the first mission the enhanced ai is a disaster
i have yet to have been wounded i simply get shot in the head and die immediately
im not getting close to the enemy either and am prone on the ground behind foliage yet i get shot in the head during a firefight every time
this doesnt make any sensealso what made the original ghost recon unique has been taken out of this game
you are one character in the game you cannot switch to different soldiers on your team like in the previous gr pc and ps gamessave your money
id only buy this game if it was severely discountedthe graphics are ok but thats about itits way too hardi started out on normal difficultycouldnt get  minutes into the first levelso i have reduced it to recruit difficultythe easiest and still cannot get past the first levelmy idea of fun isnt playing a level  times before i can get past itthere is no health and no savingyou cant pick up extra weapons you can only trade yours for your enemies dropped ones it seems incredibly linear like r lockdown that game isnt that great eitheri have the first conflict desert storm game and it is better than both gr and r lockdown
i dont think ill be buying any more clancy titlesi loved the original ghost recon and jungle storm for the ps
that said this is nothing like those
the very essence of team play here is overridden by the insane difficulty of simple tasks like team commands or switching to grenades or zooming on the ps
in the first mission which would have been simple for a sniper and demolitions expert from the original game becomes an impossible challenge of patience in gr because of the terrible zoomaim combined with illustriousbutalwaysintheway graphics
even a firstperson view option would have helped substantially as would being allowed to select your gun the default you start with runs out of bullets every time you pull the trigger and takes forever to reload while the enemy kills you but sadly neither option existsthe game concepts like being able to pick up enemys weapons are far cooler ideas than realities
coupled with the loss of multiplayer ability you can play against the yearold hackers online but you cant have friends over for a game this is a huge step back in the ghost recon world
gameplay reminds me of the original playstation and while the graphics are gorgeous they cannot alone make a gamebottom line dont buy this game
rainbow  for all of its ineptitude is a better choice or stick to the first two ghost recon titles
and if you absolutely must see this suck for yourself save  and rent it from blockbusterthis is not ghost recon what i dont understand is why are all the great games going into teams of four
ghost recon  was amazing and had  man teams but now you only have one four man team
in the original rainbow six games you had eight men which was amazing now you only have four
is every military game trying to turn into socom i mean you cant make it much more obviouslets put forward the facts now
i may not know the true greatness of tom clancy because his only game i like is chaos theory
the graphics for ghost recon  are outstanding
the sound and music also rock
but here comes the bad part
for one thing i despise this oneshotkill thng
it makes the game impossible and totally unfun
you have very few weapon selections and cant pick up the enemies
multiplayer is no fun at all
if you give orders to your squad via your xbox live headset theyll usually do the wrong thing
dont bother with this awful part of the series
go pick up summit strike insteadthe first xenosaga games budget was at like  and they cranked out a heck of a good game
however when it came to the second xenosaga game this one its like they only got a  budget and they cranked out a  well a piece of crap game
from the way the characters look to the way they sound its pretty corny
the level designs and music totally sucks and the battle system will leave you saying wtf
im currently playing the rd xenosaga game and it seems like they got a  budget and so far at  hours  into the game it feels the same way as it did when i played the first xenosaga game pretty good
so it seems like they cranked out a good product with the third xenosaga game and im having a good time playing through it so far
lets just hope it stays that way
as for this one forget about it
definately play the first one forget about the second one just watch the cut scenes from the game on the internet somewhere so that you can keep track of what the story is all about and definately play the third one
i didnt finish this game
i just took it back to the store and got my money back
its just not a good play
at least not to meif anyone enjoyed the entry that was xenosaga part one the character design story gameplay and music would stand out first in your mind
the voice acting was spot on although many say that momo was annoying to begin with
i enjoyed the leveling up and appreciated each characters diverse weaponry
i love the lengthy cut scenes and the cliffhanger ending with the reentry into second milita
xenosaga ii however should expound on all of these things and morethe first disappointment i had once i popped this game in was the vast difference in character models
yes there are those who dont like the bigeyed anime look and chubby faces but once you guide these guys though  hours of gameplay i think it grows on you
what the development team was thinking in making the character change is beyond methe second disappointment is the drastic change shion makes as a person
didnt this game start immediately after the first
now she is no longer the sweet polite intelligent scientist we knew
she tells allen to be a man
its not the same shion that was like okay sure when tony hits on herthe voice acting took a wide left as kosmos sounds like well a girl instead of the straighttobusiness android
the music that was the epic london symphony was replaced by an  casio beat machine
i will not comment morethe biggest departure in my experience was the eternal loading times before each battle
i went to make a sandwich when i got into a battleit was at this point after finishing the first disk i did not even complete the game i just dropped it off at the store for my refund
we all wonder why this game is on two disks when it is far shorter cutscenes included and part one was all on one disk and it was double the length
it is good that xenosaga iii redeemed the seriesthis game is so lacking in current technology that it is like playing pacman
there are animated sequences that are well done like small snippets of a cartoon  but the gameplay is awkward and outdated
if you are used to the quality of play in sayjak or ratchet and clank then you will be terribly disappointed in this gameif i had been able to preview it before i bought it for my daughter it would still be on a shelf somewhere in a wrapperit is also rated teen  believe me with all the gore how it got past a mature rating i will never know
yuck
also if you are worried at all about gratutitous cursing  stay away from this one
it usually doesnt phase me but to have my daughter exposed to hearing curse words in almost every sentence  it was too much for methis is a loser all around as far as i am concerned
take you child to mcdonalds or something with the money you will save you will be glad you did
i would have given it a zero but the choice was not offeredi was looking forward to playing this xbox game on my xbox  original xbox games are known for having glitches when being played on the xbox  some are negligible and some make the game unenjoyable and unplayable
this glitch is a big problem for the more skilled players because it is a distraction when the game randomly goes into slow motion for a seconda very fun game with decent graphics compared to other systems ruined because of this frame rate issue
i was really looking forward to playing this but i cant
the disc is clean and almost no scratches and setting the system to p p or i does not fix the problem
the game runs in p and even if you choose to run it in p which makes the game a pixelated mess the game still slows downi heard all the criticisms  how the game is unworthy of the tekken franchise and the character of nina williams how the controls are just not great and the gameplay is subpar
but nina was the one character i bothered to master in tekken as much as i like the game i was always pretty bad at it and could never memorize all those controls so i thought theres gotta be some enjoyment in playing this character in an espionage setting rightwrong
death by degrees contains everything that i hate about post video games and nothing i like about tekken or espionage gamesthe fighting mechanics are a direct ripoff of jet lis rise to honor with timed slaps of the right analog stick to execute moves
not the greatest control scheme but at least youll be able to execute something
but just five minutes into the game i was treated to what i consider the most inexcusable of modern game problems  bad camera
the superlong intro movies and cut scenes should have clued me in
death by degrees once again demonstrates that the most annoying sentient beings on earth are game designers who think they are filmmakers
this game blasts your perspective around mercilessly so that as youre trying to run to the right the camera does a degree shift and suddenly youre running up and towards the new angle but hey  youre still pushing right on the stick
there is an overtheshoulder pov available by holding the r button with the right analog stick set to rotate the camera but while this feature helps ground the controls it is also so frequently disabled that i gave up trying after  minutesthe puzzles are basically running around trying out objects straining your eyes to see tiny little glowing items that you have to pick up or interact with
the maps are large and unwieldy and because of the hyperactive camera angles i couldnt tell left from right explored area from new area
oh and save points are invisible
you have to use this savepoint detector on the upperright corner and play a game of warm warmer hot to try to find save points
well the last thing im looking at is the upperright corner when im trying to find my way around
i spent  minutes just to get past two puzzles in the tutorial 
level
the objectives didnt even ellicit a frustration factor  its not engaging enough for that
for the amount of running around and random mashing of the x button trying to locate the object youre supposed to pick up or interact with any sense of achieving progress is gone
i dont feel angered by failing the infrared puzzle i dont feel fulfilled by acing the sniper part
its all just a big amorphous messdeath by degrees is just as bad as one of its ultralowbudget predecessors in the femaleagent mold rogue ops the ninedollar game nobody buys and for good reason
even if youre a diehard nina fan like me avoid this one and get tekken  instead
hard to believe namco unleashed this garbage on us
with this kind of performance in the stealthespionage arena looks like namco should stick with releasing more tekken and time crisis games and leave the espionage genre to expertsi consider myself a fan of tactical espionage
ive played through all of the ps metal gears the games i consider to be the top in the genre several times
i enjoyed nina williams character in tekken and the idea of a female lead
ugh i should have just avoided it
not only are the controls poor everything has to do with the right analog stick but the camera changes from you being able to control it to not depending on where you are
to run you need to hold r but this also switches to an overthehead view
as you enter a different section the camera may switch back to fixed or visa versa
how are you supposed to be able to sneak up on people if you cant even control the character well
i already want to throw it away
horrible horrible gamei really do not like the world of warcraft spell setups in some games and as a christian i didnt like the story in the game and dealing with demons and stuff like that
i dont think it is wise playing with stuff like that and after reading about it and see for myself what was in the game more than the demo i tore the game up
if your a person who likes fantasy rts games stick with lord of the rings battle for middle earth or if you just like rts games in general keep with age of empires  empire earth and other games
this is a religious review of my personal ideas on playing games and i wished i had read more about the games story line and setup before just seeing the eye candy
some games i can stand but some just bother me in this departmentthis game used to be great
the graphics are a little dated now  but not brutally so
the game play was fun the customizability of the cars is so wide its almost irritating but well worth itdown side  ea dumped the online servers apparently which was half the appeal of the gamebottom line  if youve never played it before and can get it really cheap it might be worthwhile but dont spend serious money on itfirst let me start off by saying that i am no computer dummy
i have been around computers for over  years
its safe to say that i know what i am doing
secondly i have a very highend very powerful gaming computer on which i have played many large and complicated games
i have never had one freeze up on me ever
this game freezes up at least  of the time
i choose a game mode and when i go to tee off it freezes on the loading screen
it has nothing to do with my graphics card because i am able to practice and i have managed to play a few amateur games
however i am now stuck because everything that involves making money that i try to do causes the game to freeze
tw  never did this on my computer and i loved that game
this game is great when i can play it but ea really didnt work out the kinks on this
shame on themhere is the formulafull spectrum warrior  everything good  a slow st person shooter with blocky movements  close combat first to fightafter hearing good things about this game i finally decided to buy it and it was one of the worst mistakes ive made in a long time
let me start by saying that action games specifically shooters are by far my favorite genre
some of my recent favorites are killswitch rainbow six vegas sniper elite fear condemned project snowblind prey and nightfire just to name a few
basically ive been playing fpss since medal of honor on ps and sof on pc so inexperience is not the reason i dislike this gamethis game is just terrible as a whole
the graphics are abysmal the gameplay is not challenging or fun the sound is bad plus there is zero originality
this game has no redeeming factors and this is coming from a legitimate fan of the genre
the guns look terrible the squad controls are weak and the levels are uninspired
i just cant think of anything good to say about this game
the second you get past the menus and the gameplay starts everything just keeps getting worse and worse
the only people who i can see defending this are people that tested it or kids who dont know betterif you want a good action game play any of the ones i listed all of them are  or less now and its the best time to pick them up if you havent already
this game is a total failure and anyone who says otherwise simply hasnt played any good shooters
try rainbow vegas or global operations a pc classic if you want a good counterterrorist experience
even the port of counter strike on xbox is more fun than this trash and thats saying somethingthere is in no arguing that star ocean til the end of time is a large long game
in playing it from start to finish you will definitely get your moneys worth as you traverse two disks packed full of content
the question is do you really want to spend time on this game
the third is a cult console rpg series star ocean  isnt a broken game but in almost every aspect of the game is suffers from serious flaws that like a big black hole sucks whatever enjoyment might be had far away into its mysterious depths
it all builds up to make this one of the most awful games ive played this console generationin a fifty hour long rpg story is a major element
star oceans is bad very bad
it takes about three hours until you really get going
it begins with a whiny young man named fayt and his irritating friend sophia on vacation on some resort planet
suddenly an intergalatic army of invaders storm the place looking for fayt and his father a famous scientist
fayt escapes to find himself alone on a backwards planet
he is rescued by a group called quark but then the space invaders show up again and fayt and his new allies are marooned on another backwaters planet this time involved in a war
the plot is not that interesting but when you get to disk two along comes a plot twist that is so horrible it just sinks the rest of the story
this plot twist is like something m night shamalan would come up with while drunk
on top of the bad plot there are tons of poorly directed cut scenes
the dialogue is circular and meandering
the game is almost entirely voice acted
only a few of the voices are really bad but mostly it sounds uninspired
it all comes together to create an atmosphere that watching star ocean is like watching a bad community playand then we come to the battle system the other major aspect of star ocean  the main problem with star oceans system is that the ally ai is abominal
your two computer controlled allies will be little help to you at all as they almost always attack by uncontrollably kamikazing the enemies
they dont dodge at all so when the big bad monster gets ready to attack they rush right into its waiting claws
also you have a life bar and a magic bar and if one of them reaches zero the character will die
you have magic attacks and special physical attacks that deplete these bars
your allies will use them indiscriminately so its a constant struggle to keep them alive
when you realize that this is actually the directors cut version of the game it is inexcusable that the programmers could add in alternate costumes for a fighting minigame but couldnt fix the deplorable ai
besides the deadweight allies the difficulty curve for this game is broken
instead of getting just a little harder in each new area star ocean  throws out any kind of natural progression
enemies that are simple to defeat will be replaced with enemies that are about five times harder
youll need to spend hours leveling to stand a decent chanceanother really awful of the game is its main side quest item inventing
this thing is trap
its an impenatrable costly system meant to seperate you from your money
i tried desperately to figure this system out
i spent tons of game  money only to be able to have success inventing the most useless low grade items around and then find myself unable to buy more useful items readily available in storesif its an rpg you crave you can find a much better game out there
star ocean til the end of time isnt worth your timethere is exactly one reason that i hated this game  poor ai artificial intelligence
in this game you control one character in battle while you are accompanied by two other characters controlled by the computer ai
these computer players are more of a reliability than anything
you have a few choices for their behavior but none of them seem to have a significant effect on how they fight
its really only two settings they have rush recklessly into battle and die or do nothing
first of all why is there even a setting for doing nothing
at least make them dodge enemies or something  this was retarded
other than that they always recklessly rush into battle and wont even dodge obvious attacks or back away from enemies when theyre in danger
so they die off within one or two battlesand if you expect to heal them think again
they wont protect you so youll likely be interrupted by enemies when you try to heal them
so theyll die and then you cant even heal yourself because it takes too long to cast without someone protecting you from enemieswhat this all means is this
youre going to have to grind levels and fight for an hour on ridiculous enemies to move the story on for  minutes
then youll repeatand trust me the enemies are ridiculous
in one of the first dungeon areas you fight these men in robes who yell out things like no my money
and i hate you
these are fat men in robes in some ruins that are supposed to be inhabited by bandits
what are fat robed men doing in bandit infested ruins
im sorry it just is too ridiculousheres some of the good in this game
the roleplaying aspect is pretty interesting though awfully shallow
by this i mean your roleplaying doesnt change the story too significantly
the exploring is ok but still pretty lame
most treasure chests are filled with only healing berries really lame
there is a lot of voice acting but it is pretty horrible
the characters are shallow and their actions and dialogue are unrealisticoverall its just poorly designed
bad gameplay story and charactersconflict vietnam is a squad based third person shooter
you control a squad of four soldiers who must go from objective to objective while killing enemies on the waythats about it
the mission is totally linear  leading the play from one point to the next with no variance
you can pick up vc weapons or stick with your own gi weaponsthe graphics are terrible
this is a crossconsole game that was made for the slowest console ps and the graphics probably look the same across the board
water ground rocks and enemies look fake and blockish
theres no detail and the lighting is often awkwardthe control is not intuitive
aiming automatically locks on during firefights which makes for some lame combat action
squad conrols are cumbersome and take too much time to use during combatas many other reviewers have said ghost recon is a far superior squad based game
brute force has more intuitive firing and squad controls
and almost any other xbox game has better graphics
there are at least three other vietnam era games currently out on xbox  try one of them insteadlets face it all mario parties stink but this is just plain horrible
its probably the second worst mario game ever
the graphics and sound are a pain to look at or listen to
no good gameplay means no replay value
in fact theres nothing good about this game at all when you think about it
i rate this game if you enjoy mario party games like me dont get thisit stinkshere are three reasons why i hate ityou can only play as marioluigipeach and yoshino starsits missions that are soooo annoyinglack of of minigamesyesthe minigames and gadgets are fun butthere isnt enough to keep me occupiedits just junk the thing had potential but it was done terribly as for hardware its alright but it isnt any better than a regular keyboard at all
the thing that makes it junk is the software i used if for a few months because i didnt want to waste my money but i just gave up whenever i changed keysets it would freeze and i would have to reboot or unplug the usb i tried using their costomer support but it was worthless i then tried to download the newest version of the software while installing it it just froze then i couldnt use my mouse so i couldnt do anything the fact that the keyboard software messed up my mouse is pathetic i had to manually turn off my computer and do a safe start to be able to finnaly remove the horrible softwaresave your money this keyboard is worthless im using a  dollar keyboard that i got at wallmart right now and it is way betteri used it for a short time and can not understand why some people give it  starts
it is junk it has dust all over it in my corner
i may throw it out soonthis has to be the worst mario game ever made even the mario party games and super mario bros  are better
the graphics and sound stink
the pinball based gameplay ruins anything that could possibly be mario about the game
in one word horrible
i rate this game no i hate this game
all the sims games except for gameboy games have been great
i bought the sims bustin out on gba and it was 
i sold it to a used game seller
i had to do the same with this one
if u want real sims but the pc or gamecube or ps games no gba
has this happened to ui bought the xbox version and was disappointed to see that the schedules are generated incorrectly after the first season
i bought the ps version  same crap
how can you suckers out there possibly say madden  is going to be dethroned
are you complete idiots
look morons the nfc west plays the nfc south this season
in season two the nfc west should play the nfc east
in season three the nfc west should play the nfc north
it never happens
the nfc west keeps playing the nfc south over and over and over again
that means counting the division opponets you get only six different opponets a season when you should get at least ten
espn knows much about presentation but nothing about how nfl schedules work
the game is fun in year one but after that all of you simulation fans will be gravely disappointed
if youre a moron who doesnt know any better this game is for you
there is no fcking way in hll this game is better than madden  and the beautiful thing about it is that i dont even have to play madden  to know that it isnt released yet
sega got  out of me so i guess im just as much of a sucker as the rest of you nitwits who write reviews before you thoroughly investigate a game
just about all of this games features are pointless  the practice sessions that bring your stats down instead of up so much for practice the crib dumb the quotplayer of the gamequot interviews an endless cliche spewing machine
soon you will be pressing the button to skip all of them to start the next game and shutting off the quotweekly preparationquot option
dethrone madden
yeah right
sega cant even make a fcking schedule right and that has been a problem with their football games since the dreamcast
all of you out there will vote that this review didnt help you and even write counter reviews debating this issue
youve got to get the schedules right to be a serious contender
this game couldve been shouldve been but its never going to be
you cant polish a turdi bought this game because i am an icp fan and i was hoping they were going to improve dramatically on the first one
not only it this one just as bad but i found the controls were even worse
i was very pissed that eidos decided to release this thing they called a game
i am sorry they used icps name to promote it
i love their music and the porn stars they used in this game but this was just horrible
it was a piece of crap that wasnt even worth the  dollars i spent on it
sorry
dont waste your money on this
icp fans should not promote this
i wish there was a decent game with them in it that i could give props tothis game is just flat out dumb
everything about this game is badthe graphics are down right terribleive seen better looking graphics on the ps onethe game modes are very limitedall you can do is play a crappy story modewhich is a waste of timeand play one on one matches over and over againin lame background areaswhy would i wanna backyard wrestle in a burger joint
the wrestlers are just laughable to look at itpass on this gameits not even worth a dollar in my opinionif you want a really good wrestling game for pspick up wwe smackdown vs raw and leave this piece of crap alonemy kid played the game for  min only it is not fun
if you want to try it just rent iti played this game until chapter  all the dancing levels were very hard to beat
i think this game is not worth buying rent iti got this game cause it was a good price and the reviews at the time were fairly good
but i have to agree with the other reviews that this game is a joke
im an avid game player and  like others have said  i had difficulty in getting past level   it wasnt a fun challenge to get past it either
just smashing buttons  and i did just as well smashing buttons randomly
gave my game to good willas much as i enjoyed the first sims and nabbed it the first week of release i realized after a while what a pox it was
will wright the talent that gave us sim city and all its offspring has been doing nothing else new creativley due to having to work on the sims and even simcity  is tainted by the sim characters you can import into your towni wish this sim fad would go the way of the beany babiestheres so much copy protection on this game that it wont even install on some of the systems
have fun trying to get it to work
thanks eai checked to see if i had the system requirements and felt i was all set
i preordered this game a month in advance
checked the ups site like crazy waiting for it to arrive
when i downloaded the game it was pretty fast and i was happy about that but when i clicked on to play
nothing
it kept saying my graphic adapter was not compatible with directx   which is not true because it is yet it continue to say that it wasnt
so i spent the next two fustrating days downloading and updating my driver to trying to rechecking my system for higher requirements because the lowest requirements they printed was just not gonna work trying to download other drivers checking the easy info provided with the game
i even went to best buy to talk to a tech support person and even hunted down a new video card but couldnt buy itthen i learned that the main reason why it kept saying it wasnt compatible with directx to play the game is because i had a different video card brand than the one listed on the box
basically you must have ati radeon latest verison only  or nvidia geforce only the latest verison the main reason why i say only the latest version because like i said before the lowest requirements listed are bogus
i wish they had a more broad range of graphic adapter support thats also compatible with directx  for this game instead of having to buy a whole new product
and if your computer is atleast a year old forget it period
unless you want to shell out hundreds of dollars for a brand new video card
and if you have a year old notebook you better not even look at this gamei would love to play this game but i dont love it enough to go broke just to play it and i know that sometime in the near distant future i will have to upgrade or even buy a brand new computer but im not doing that just to play a fifty dollar pc game
at least i still have gta san andreas to look forward to and i know i can play that
until then im selling my sims a few days back  went out a got the game its only  bucks and theres a reason
you can only play as yellow blue and red but even more only as there zords
you cant even play the rangerspersonally i think thats kinda sillyi was hoping it was like the old sega game from the mmpr movie that was a good gamemade no sense but it was funyou can get the game if you want too  bucks for a ps game wont bust your bank but if your looking for a old style pr game with hand to hand cobat with foot soldersgiant robo fighting is all you got hereno power rangers are in this at all just the megazords and its not even that perfectly applied i was really hoping for a better graphics version on the ps lightspeed rescuefirst of all i own smackdown here comes the pain for playstation  that game is very fun and i am still playing it
after i first heard about day of reckoning i was very excited
but when i finally played it
manit sucked
 the story mode is not worth playing at all
the story mode on here comes the pain for playstation  is a million times more fun than this sorry excuse for a wrestling game
you cannot play as a wwe superstar on the story mode for day of reckoning
that really sucks
they didnt even add the elimination chamer match on this game like they did on here comes the pain
why does gamecube even bother making wwe wrestling games
playstation  really knows how to make a fun realistic wwe game
gamecube dosentthis game will probably be a huge seller because the changes they made will appeal to the younger masses
but if you are like me and want to try and create the same experience drivers have on sundays then avoid this kiddie game at all coststhe decline started with last years hokey grudges and alliances feature
pressing the r button to draft was unrealistic
it has continued with the elimination of the cockpit view and elimination of customizable gameplay features
you can still set various assists and difficulty levels but they are more part of a package system and do not allow you to adjust every aspect of racing ai and rules like in the pastbut there are improvements
the level of gameplay modes is huge
the creation of various racing series is very good
the inclusion of more road courses adds great variety
the graphics and sound and the best yet
the sense of speed and framerate are superb
and it is onlinehowever losing the cockpit view is a huge loss
nascar dirt to daytona could do it despite having various racing classes so eas omission is either intentional or lazy
most will not agree since ea is targeting this to younger gamers and ea figures the hardcore nascar crowd will buy it whether they like it or not
whether they trade it back in doesnt matter they got their money
but the cockpit view provides an immersive simulator experience similar to a first person shooter
when you drive a car you do not drive it from the bumper or from behind you drive it from inside the vehicle
but since so many huge games such as gran turismo and need for speed do not provide a cockpit view ea figures they can get away with itif you are a teenager or new to nascar you will probably love this game
but if you are used to playing simulator racers such as motogp f indycar and toca race driver then the direction ea is taking this series will probably make you sick
were part of a dying class that will have to suck it out on unstable pc platforms
im sticking with nascar  on the ps when drafting was a matter of accurate physics and not a press of the buttona real interesting fact is the lack of the ea sports bio with this game
the fact the ea ommited it means they must have really rushed this game to get it to market before the official chase to the cup begins in two weeks
when was the last time ea ommited a blatant marketing tool such as the ea bio
ea is the king of marketingbottom line if you are a sim racer then nascar  is not for you
im sure ea is counting on the sim crowd to buy the pc version and leave the console version to rack up big sales with trendy younger demographic
thats why ea is the king i guess but if they treated madden this way and added arcade elements then america would revolt
the fact that ea has exclusive rights to nascar for several more years is frustrating indeed
buy the year  im sure powerups will be littering daytona or bristol to give you car extra boost ala mario kart
sadi thought the purpose of this game was to make it better and not worst than last years game
nba live  was probably the best nba game ever
in nba live  you can barely even see the players
they made the players super tiny
tiny as an ant
you cant tell who is carmelo anthony and who is allen iverson
there is no more edit player
there is still no create a team mode
they are making it worst than last years game instead of making it betterea sports tried too hard to make this game more like espn nba k which that game wasnt that great
crappy
but good for its price
nba live  is an over priced piece of crap and desreves less than one star
i say ea sports should stick to their own style and not copy otheres
especially when their own style was better
im a huge fan of nba live  but  really sucks
ea sports please make nba live nba live and not make nba live  espn nba kif they just updated their roster and kept the same gameplay etc and kept the pt shooting contest the game would be at least somewhat worthy of the  they charge
but since its nothing like their master piece nba live  the most this piece of crap item is worth only i dont think anyones demanding it nowadays considering that this game is  years and a console removed from whats current but after reading my review fornhl which is still a superior hockey game even  years after the fact i had to sound off on what was singlehandledly the most frustrating hockey title that ive ever played
in short the controls are baffling the gameplay is confusing and the ai is completely off
what do i mean by that last point
well if you sent the game on any difficulty you can pepper the opposing goaltender with  shots and still expect to lose the easiest setting means your goalie will stop  shots out of  while the hardest setting means your goalies going to leak like a bp pipeline
hardly what i would consider an enjoyable gaming experience and the failure of this title opened the door for people to start paying attention to the k series hockey games until nhl  came out and colton orred the competition into wii landskip this and get any of the other games instead
even nhl  which i was enthusiastic about was a step above what this game could deliverwith the hightech technorockacid music pervading all the levels the odd controls including the somewhat mandatory option to wield all weapons onehandedly except assault rifles and rocket launchers allowing for two weapons to be wielded at once and the much harsher technological grittiness of the whole thing insanely high tech items weird futuristic weapons cloned enemies that range from looking like swat team members to the vin diesel character riddick this does not feel like a bond gamei think if it werent for the slightly familiar acidic version of the bond theme on the main menu and the presence of bond villains like auric goldfinger dr no pussy galore francisco scaramanga oddjob xenia onatopp and others this wouldnt be a bond game at all but random action shootemup the evil
ai i either must not have seen yet im not completely through the campaign or is so unremarkable as to be not there
it apparently consists of individual enemies shooting at you then trying to run up to you to bash you over the head with their weapons if you arent fast enough to shoot them
since almost all of them wear high tech body armor it takes quite a few shots from even a rapidfire machine gun resembling goldeneye s rcp to take them down
theres no blood no permanent bodies and no realistic methods of death
slain enemies take a second or two to keel over in the same two or three motions of falling forward as if drunk or keeling backwardsits absolutely astonishing that mi would reject this guy as seen in a cutscene considering how much of an expert with guns this guy must be
hes able to wield two separate guns no matter how big reload them without dropping either gun for any reason and can absorb unbelievable amounts of damage on normal mode
and can even regenerate health and armor
in fact the only reason i can see that hes been kicked out is because he let mis golden boy james bond die in a simulation where really there was nothing he could dobond was hanging off a ledge several feet away and by the time goldeneye reaches him he falls to his deathone thing about the game that is fantastic is the cutscenes
the d modeling is smooth and beautiful without being too gritty warts and all like shrek which would probably make this game  or  discs instead of   the story is actually a good one which has goldeneye working for auric goldfinger starting off in a war with dr no and actually making goldfinger look not like a maniacal enemy seeking the worlds destruction but rather like a crime boss with his priorities in order
scaramanga makes an appearance as the inventor of goldeneyes eye implant hence his name which allows some mildly helpful but ultimately unimportant technologies you really wouldnt need except for one or two instances in some missionsall in all aside from the cutscenes story and main theme music you would never be able to tell this is a bond game
theres none of that flair style or mood pervasive in all other bond games
even though youre playing a bad guy you and your enemies seem of such high caliber class and technique that it makes the franchise seem more like something out of a ridiculously complex spy moviethis game when i first fot it was the best
but now when i think over the plot it is very stupid and immature
goldeneye the main character turns evil because mi wont accept him as an agent
you can wield two guns at the same time which is kind of cool but what is he some mutant evil cowboy
after you use up all your weapons you have to use and extremely weak pistol with unlimited ammo
and after under cover for  seconds your health goes back up
the multiplayer is extremely boring and confusing
and the game has an extremely weak plot that revolves around goldeneye turning against goldfinger and oddjob
this game is extremely stupid
dont get itthis game is such an abomination not even my ps wanted to play it as it made strange whirring noises as it played the disc as if to say why is this piece of crap inside of me
what did i ever do to you
if the action genre was a living being then trigger man would be the herpes of the action genre with its terrible gameplay and murderous difficulty
this game was only  when i found it in the bargain bin but ill tell you right now this was the worst  investment i have ever made
there is no reason for a budget title to suck this muchwhat the game is a thirdperson action title with lame puzzles tossed into the mix
you play as a guy known only as the trigger man and you do the dirty work for a mob boss and do what he tells you to do
there are eight missions of absolute hell to trek through thanks to the agonizing gameplay and insane difficulty
when the son of a rival mob boss is killed its up to the trigger man to kill the goons of the boss and protect the mob family you work for
an unoriginal plot for an unoriginal gamegraphics this game looks like a goodlooking nintendo  game
the textures are sloppy and the environments are somewhat bland
it would have looked fantastic on the n but this is not really acceptable on psmusic this area is pretty bad
the music either ranges from elevator music to bad porno soundtrack
this area sucks really bad and the music was never interesting to listen to thank god for my ipodsound the weapons sound exactly the same and this games production values are so low they didnt even have voiceacting in this terrible game
instead you get to read text boxes reminiscent of nessnesgenesisearly psone and n eras
text boxes are not accepted on console games anymore
yet another area the game fails miserably ingameplay this area is torture because of bad controls and an insane difficulty
moving your character is like maneuvering a tank and aiming your weapon is a nightmare
your enemies are tough to kill unless you nail them perfectly in the head if you dont hit them in the head unless you have a shotgun or uzi you will be shooting your enemies up to ten times before they finally die
your health is cheap and you will die a lot
sometimes just by entering a new section you can get mowed down within seconds
it will take you numerous tries just to get through certain sections of each stage
you will run into trouble just on the first stage because you have to sneak past police officers near the end of the level
thanks to your terrible controls your enemies will have numerous instances in which they will have no trouble killing you
this game throws too many enemies at you at one time which will lead to a number of your unfair deaths
also a number of questionable design choices such as the fact that there are almost no ammo pickups from enemies when you kill them you have to find a box somewhere in the level and fill up your ammo from there
trigger man is without a doubt not only one of the most frustrating and infuriating games ive ever played it was also awful enough to make my list of the ten worst games ive ever played
crave entertainment for the love of god stop trying to make religious and action titles its not working out at alloverall stay the hell away from this game it will only bring great pain numerous fbombs and screaming and extreme anger if you dare play it
not only is this one of the worst ps games ever its one of the worst action titles ever and one of the worst games ever
a miserable game from start to finish
perhaps if the developer wnt games had tried harder we would have at least gotten a mediocre title i would have settled for mediocrity after playing something this awfulthe good good n graphics and a checkpoint system unlike bad boys miami takedown but bad boys was slightly betterthe bad the n graphics the music the story the gameplay the murderous difficulty the numerous unfair deaths no ammo pickups and too many enemiesim going to make this as short as possible the game absolutly sucked the graphics were incrediably cheap the back ground noise was insanly fake and annoying
and it was litterly the crappiest game ive ever playeddo not buy this
i think some high school kids put this together for a school project or somthing and they failed miseriably
suckedreviewed for big boss games by jrrwith the wealth of budget titles being released you have to wonder if they are worth the usual  price tag
sadly with this game a  price tag wouldnt helptrigger man comes to all platforms and suffers the same fate equally wellyour a mob hitman and the gang wars are about to begin
sounds cool right
in concept it is
but poor execution in all departments kills any chance of fun
i couldnt resistplaystation  graphics mixed with subpar controls ridiculous character animation and poor level design plague the entire game
no voice samples at all period
yup youll be reading the whole comedy er i mean storybasically a really low budget wannabe hitman knockoff on its best day
gettin rubbed out would be more worth your timeto sum it up its curtains for this game seeokay iam going to tell you nice and slow this game was garbaggggggggggggggggggggggggge the graphics was a joke the gameing was stupid and unrealistic
was the creaters drinking when they were makeing this game cause everything sucks bad in this junk fest
like i said the graphics was a joke it was to cartooney and to comic bookish if you actually like this game then you need to come out of kindergarten cause this game is nowhere near fun just a stupid wanabe  game with very poor graphics and stupid characteristics
i couldnt believe i brought this game i want my money back bs
this was a terrible gametrigger man came with two other ps games so i paid around  for the game as i would have never bought myself
the game has an interesting plot but it has bad graphics reminding the original nintendo games
i dont recommend anybody buying iti bought this game for my grandson and then found out it had way too much cussing and violence
i got rid of it not wishung to forster this game on anyone elselet me start off by saying iam a huge poker fan and play it often in home games and this game was a big disapointment there is no fun factor to this game it is very dull and boring how about some custom music to keep us playing the game and the characters look like they where whipped together fast by a anamator and are funny to look at and listen to that is about it overall this game is very sketchy and boringif ya buy this game hoping to learn any new games like texas holdem dont get it
it is too slow playing after you loose your hand beter to buy the casino game not as much detail but plays faster more enjoyable this plays till the other characters play down to  players and it gets boriong watching it not like watching on tvtoo out datedi began season one and enjoyed it
i began season two and stopped dead in my tracks
this game does not use the scheduling formula mandated by the nfl
i was the seattle seahawks and had to play the entire nfc south division in year two but i just played that division in year one i shouldve been playing the nfc east
i simulated year two
i looked at year three  same thing i shouldve been playing the nfc north but i got stuck with the nfc south again
not even the slick production and awesome graphics can save this bummer
if you got suckerd in by the price tag like i did take it back to the retailer you got it from if you can say its defective or something and hope they dont stick you with a replacement
if you havent bought it yet hang on to your twenty bucks  it will be better spent on madden  come august th
im sorry but if you do not know how to make an nfl schedule correctly you shouldnt be in the business
skip this one folks
twenty bucks is still twenty buckshave never had anything but great love for  mario games until paper mario  doors was releasednot going to bore anyone with all the details of my dislike of this gameif you are foolish enough to purchase it  even at a discounted price you will soon see what i meanread all the hype and those glowing remarks made by some and that sold me to try ithorrible mistakepaid  dollars for the game and got a  dollar trade in on an other game at slackersplayed the game for about an hour before i had to shut it down and take it out of the console cant believe this game being that bad after all the great mario games of the past but it isi thought this game was going to be okay well i was wrong  see im new to the mario rpg games now and now the game just got boringwhy did it get boring because its impossible to get passed chapter  section where mario has to walk on these blue panels to avoid being shocked  i even asked how to do this but they said stay in the middle and thats what i did and still it did not work and they were not specific about it  so i plan on selling this game to someone who is good at itif you dont like hard difficult impossible games then this is not the game you want you ll just get annoyed and yell at the top of your lungs because you cant get passed nothing on here  so the game is boring because i cant get passed chapter  and i give up on itother then that it could be impossible to also get passed chapter  especially i heard the final boss has  hp thats alot  and totally impossibleso this is my opinion and feel free to flame me for itdont waste your moneyi thought the reason why we play games was to have fun not exercise in frustration
the difficulty level is very uneven  most of the time youre doing same mundane silly tasks but at every boss you will want to hurl the friggin gamecube out of the window
in addition in some instances there is like  minutes of doing the same cakewalk from a save point to the cheapo boss which naturally youre forced to repeat over and over again as it will take you many tries to beat the thing
whats with the rare save points
ok so i dont play videogames  hours every day i play occasionally for fun not to prove myself to anybody
i want to pick up a game be done with it and move on
why not give me an option to play on an easier difficultysecond the game doesnt improve on its predecessor in any way
mp was a revelation
even though its bosses were legendary what with the idiotic  visor and  beam clutter during the fight it still gave an incredible sense of adventure
here the lightdark world trick is more of a nuissance than anything
theres not much difference between the worlds levels either most of the time you cant even tell which one youre in
theres too much backtracking
you return to the same cavesrooms over and over again for different items or whatever
at  into the game at a puzzle where the camera switches on you so that you cant even see what youre doing i had enough  and since i was bored out of my mind anyway i quit
definitely a game not for adultsi am an avid video game player so please take heed to my words if your thinking on purchasing
even though it is a james bond game it absouletly sucks
i ahve probally played every game out there and this low on the listits like they took fear
and made it james bond and added a little daylight and took away the girl and blood
this game lacked everything a action game needs
lame lame lamethis game is more like an arcade game it could have been better if it wasnt rushedif you want to play a good sims game then go buy the sims bustin out
do not even bother to rent the urbz it is awful
i thought this game would be similar to the sims  and the sims bustin out
instead they tried to be hip and ruined the whole game
the best thing about the game is that it is really short and the black eyed peas did the musicthe loading time is very longin fact i bet if you added up all the loading time its longer than the actual gameplay
you carry your furniture around with you and the furniture is different in every district which i thought was annoyingevery district is different
there are the goths the artsy people etc when you go to different districts you get a job
i thought this was going to be cool because in bustin out you didnt get to see your sim at work
but it all turns out to be boring
you press different buttons on your controller in different combinations to perform your tasks
some of the jobs were cute and funny like training pet ferrets but the button pressing was very boring and repetitive
they missed a perfectly good opportunity to be inventiveits all about climbing the social ladder impressing people and proving how cool you are etc every night each district has a party at a club but you have to have the right reputation to get into the club and wear the right clothes or you wont be able to get past the bouncer
so for example when you come back from the artsy district dont think you are going to get into the hip hop club dressed like andy warholchanging your outfit when you go to different districts was very annoying
if you wear the wrong clothes in the wrong district the natives will insult your clothes
but if you have a great rep they will start dressing like you
i thought the whole point of having the different clothes hairstyles etc was to be able to make your sim look the way you wantedat the club a dude dressed like a run dmc reject will teach you a power social move that will help you impress others and get a reputation faster
but the characters all are exagerated stereotypes with stupid names
the game tries really hard to be funny but its just cornyunlike in the other games your character couldnt even get married and have kids which i thought was lame
there were no real goals in the game its all about fitting in and impressing characters that were irritating
people from different districts dont get along so for example the goths might want you to pull a prank on the artsies but who caresbeing from new york i thought the urbz would be a funny take on the urban inner city
its just corny repetitive and annoyingin fact im pretty sure it isntbut being a huge fan of the sims and sims i thought id buy it because living in a huge city i hoped it would parallel and be fun  simsstyleugh
it is so notif youre one of those people like me who hate going out to big clubs and watching people fawn fakefakefake
over some celebdujour or some musician or someone whos someone  ugh  then this game isnt for youits about ladder climbing and about who you know not what you know
its about kissing butt something i have a hard time doing and being a player this is beyond my generation
i think teenagers and maybe young adults into their early s might like this game
or anyone who likes playing the game  then give it a shototherwise dont waste your moneytrue waste of moneyi bought this because i love sim gamesbut this is awfullyou can barely leave your sims homethen your stuck on this one street that has only  places to go interactions with the other sims is toughthey dont like youif you can get a sim to like youit might take a month for them to date youfor those of you expecting the same old battlefield  ported to ps you are going to be disappointed
the game retain almost none of its orginal featues no longer are you trying to control a map through spawn points but rather the old run here shoot this
hotswapping takes you totaly out of the game by constantly switching players
rather than dying and chosing a new unit when the player dies which isnt often due to tons of health they are given command of the nearest allied unit no matter their class
the realism involved is taken out with these features and with virtually unlimited ammo and health the game is boring and easy
some gamers might find it entertaining to go around shooting things but for true fans of battlefield  this game is a sad disappointmentprospretty good graphicseasy controlsmuliplayer can be fun all though usually notconsreally easyno stategytons of health unlimited ammoboring repitive not he same as battlefield pcif you want a military shooter do not pick up this game try socom or the pc batttlefield but this game is lacking in all qualities that make up a decent modern fpsyou gotta be kiddin me
what a sorry excuse to use the goldeneye title to sell games
automatically gamers will think about the original goldeneye for the n to this day in comparison to other shooter multiplayer games
if i wanted to see cartoons id watch bugs bunny
this game took a major step backwards
nothing seems lifelike
forget about stealth
you can basically go blasting through levels without any thought and make it through with little resistence
this is another game i rented and returned the next day
why cant anyone make a decent james bond gamefirst to answer tom question acclaim went bankrupt so there will be no more all star baseball
to bad to for it was by far the best out there
but that actually brings me to my complaint of mlb k
i like baseball games where they have the real players for at least the  man roster which this game does not
plus the pitchers dont have there real life wined ups like they had in all star baseballwhich if you ask me ruined the game right there
second the batters dont have there real life stanceslike they did in all star baseball
i am going to sell my copy of major league baseball k back
and wait for  sports mlb  which is do out in a couple of weeks
at least when take two bought the rights to mlb they made it so s baseball game will stay around
unless take two does a hell of a lot better job on next years game
i will stick with this game is really bad
i got this and mvp baseball  
mvp baseball is the real deal
this game is awful
my son told me to play the other game mvp baseball i fell for the hype and got this game 
my son hated it
we got the mvp  baseball game from ea sportsthis is the worst basketball game ive played in years
for one they have no season mode just the association which is pretty stupid because you can only control one team and it is pretty pointless
everytime you leave a guy opened for three hell make it which doesnt happen in real life and i left shaq open for  threes and he made all of them pretty unrealistic
everytime i tried to dunk it gets blocked or i miss it
almost everytime i have the lead with a couple of minutes to go the cpu makes every shot to take the lead and win the game or sometimes i have to make buzzer beaters to win
when i contest a player for three they just put up a prayer and make it
that makes me furious
this game is just horrible and it is in my trash so the garbage men can brake the stupid gamebefore i begin let me state i am a very very good video game racer
ive beaten or at least accomplished a lot on many racing games
i am very good
this game however is even too hard for me
the difficulty level is insane
the tracks are full of right angle turns tricky s curves hard to miss traffic and drivers you compete against that are absoutely brutal
the sponsor races are near impossible for anybody without driving skill nearing that of godlyi was warned before i bought this game that it can make people who never get mad at games extremely enraged
i was even shown a photo of what somebody did to a ps controller
however i just figured that was those peoples character fault and got this game anyway with the mindset i would not give into getting mad
well after trying  or so times to beat the same race i was so angry that i started smashing the controller over my head as hard as i could
and what i did to myself after that to relive the extreme stress i am probably not allowed to talk about on here so i will leave it out
but i really hurt myself and it left me emotionally scarred
for like two weeks after i stopped playing the game i was extremely short fused with people and freaking out and screaming and yelling and breaking things every time some little thing went wrong in my life
and i am never like this
i had just lost my ability to handle stressoh i should also mention that unless you win a race you get nothing absoutely nothing
unlike burnout  you do not get any points you won unless you win the race
had a really insane drift that earned you like  reputation points
well if you lose the race too bad you arent getting itso unless your racing skill borders on the divine and unless you could compete against the best video game racers in the country and likely win this is not the game for youthis game is an over glorfication of how stupid need for speed has gotten
how much more punishment and abuse can this great classic take
looks like electronic arts and its executives thought it would be nice to suck its customers dry out of money
damn spongey execs
i thought the nfs series couldnt get worse after the first undergroundi guess the dumbases at electronic arts proved me wrong
its a pathetic excuse for a game
hasnt anyone else found the connection yet
hmm lets see when nfsu came out their was a familiar movie hintfast and the furious
ok so they copied the movie i cant blame them its hard to gain material for a game with a long historybut nfsu was a big dissapointment
the overall originality of the game was nonexistent
familiar enough the time nfsu came out so did too fast too furious
wow thats really ironic
the game is full of advertisments which literally drive you away from the original concept of the game
as the huge nfs fan i was this just pushed me more towards gran turismo
even nitendo racing games like formula one beat out this game on originality and gameplay
playing this game is like playing a big advertismentnot really my way of having fun
so if you want to join the rest of aholes who enjoy playing a game with cheap graphics shiy musicno gameplay and nonexistent originality then by all means go ahead
if i were in your place i would stick with formula oneit has a pointlove the game after playing it a few days i knew it was well worth twenty bucks but in franchise mode it freezes
im at the point now where its virtually unplayable
dont waste your money buying this buy the ea version or take your chances with next years versionwhat happened
after waiting for  months since the release of the return of the king i am left feeling cheated disappointed ripped off bamboozled tricked deceived duped hoodwinked swindled and defrauded
this game plainly sucks
ea has brought shame to the lord of the rings gaming franchise
what kind of bleeping blank is this
there is no real interaction with the characters
the game is played in a stop and go method
you confront your enemy then you choose what your plan of attack is then you execute your attack
the enemy stays put while you hit him once then you run back to where you started and now it is the enemies turn to hit you
you dont even get to play as the main characters just some no name character
i make none of this up
what happened to the combinations blocking banes gambits rush attacks death charges from the other great gamesi challenge anyone to play eas two towers and return of the king then immediately play this bleeping game and call the third age a great gameea you idiots really know how to screw a good thing up
good one bro go smoke another oneall the lord of the ring games are stupid but this one was really bad
the grafics are ok and the controls take a while to get used to and by the time you do it gets boring
dont buy anthing that has lord of the ring on it because in a couple years all of it is going to be worth nothinguggh
where do i start with this
well maybe i should start by criticizing myself
i am a silly silly person for ever believing that a monopolizing greedy company that cares about nothing but exclusive licenses could know the first thing about rpgs
now that ive given myself a firm lecture ill start in on this gameill begin at the beginning
you are placed in the shoes of an unattractive personalityless ranger who you know and care nothing about
a few minutes into the game he meets a female elf who far from being aweinspring and regal as elves are meant to be is about as exciting as a limp carrot
they find some sort of flimsy excuse to travel together and off you go finding more lifeless tagalong party members along the way
there is absoloutely no pretense of story
and seeing as it doesnt even follow the traditional lord of the rings storyline the feeling that you are in the world of lotr is just not therenow that ive gotten past the atrocious characters and story ill move on to gameplay
the combat system works ill give it that but seeing as it also worked in the  other rpgs it has been used in this isnt much of an accomplishment
you select attacks from a menu you watch everyone attack and then the enemy takes their turn
i now firmly believe that someone must have snuck into the ea offices taken out their trusty whiteout and wiped the word innovation from every single dictionary
its the only possible excuse for such a bland experienceand here we are at yet another failure the menu system
seeing as you have to bring up the menu every five seconds to level up allocate experience points equip items watch overused movie clips check to see if you have any sidequests they just show up on the menu theres no sort of you have a new sidequest alert fix the skill tree and listen to ian mckellan talk youd think that it would at least be fun to navigate
oh no
the menu is plain black with the tiniest most hardtoread text ever and almost no pictures
after awhile i developed such a severe case of menuaversion syndrome that i didnt even care about trying on new equipment or leveling up anymore
seeing as getting loot and upgrading yourself is the heart and soul of an rpg this is a very very bad thingoverall this game just annoyed me to no end
i sold it two days later at a loss of 
and let me tell you it was the biggest waste of  ever in my lifeat least the urbz sims have a life cause i dont
very addictive game
i think young girls would enjoy this game more than boys or adults
what i enjoyed about the previous sims games was you could create which perked my interest in architecture
you cannot create much in this game
you mostly work to raise your reputation to complete goals
also the creators of urbz should have given us gamers a better instructional booklet
had no idea how to use the power ups and wasnt sure what to do when i had to go to work
what do you do if the robot station burns down
the urbz are not very happy in this part of town
be prepared to spend most of your time waiting for the game to load
thats one of the reasons i do not have the patience to play the game through again
you cant complete the last goal  it must be a secret
rumors are spreading that you have to play through the game  more times to fulfill the last goal
some games i enjoy the second  third times when i play through but this is not one of those games
if this is a taste of where the sims games are heading i wont be playing with the sims anymore  sorry bellathis used to be the device that i recommended to friends that were looking for a cheat device for playstation  it was easy to use and best of all they updated their code archive quickly to reflect new releases
the addition of the day one archive made it eaven easier to download an entire code archive onto a usb drive and drop a zillion codes into your ps
now it has become clear that cmgsccc the coders that pelikan handed over the exclusive rights to upkeep of their reputation as a quality company have recently decided to stop updating their code archives leaving many gamers in the lurch
its likely they are too busy developing codes for the playstation  codebreaker that will inevitably be coming out soon and left those of us who bought their previous product out in the cold
if you want to hack older games this is still a great product but if you need it for anyhting current id recommend a game shark
they at least kept responability for their own coding in housewell i took the time to ask the store associates about this product but that was a waste because the kid didnt know anything about it and couldnt answer one of my questions
so i took a chance and bought it anyway
big mistake
this product does not work on all ps systems
i put the disc in and it just came up as a disc read error
i have a regular version of the ps  not a slim one  and it will not work on my system yet the game stores sell this product with no warning
i called the codebreaker manufacturer and they explained to me that it will not work on every ps system
if you do buy this save the receipti bought the game following the recommendations of the people saying it was a good game that it was better than need for speed underground  but its not as good as this one
the graphics are very bad not as good as in the ea game there are more cars and thats better than other games
but the control of them its unrealistic specially when you have to brake or slide its like the brake of a bikecycle
its very difficult to find the places you have to go for the challenges the map has no detail of realism
and the panel with the speed its really bad becuase its difficult to see the numbers and the n its only a blow
not to mention the decoration of the cars a child can make them better
i want my money back i want a good game not an immitation of a good one
buy need for speed underground this game is one of the worst games i ever played in my life
and i played the smurfs on playstation
even the theme is bad
answer questions to see girls flash
how lame is that
very boring
this game is just like watching street smarts on tv
and the theme is supposed to be to see girls naked in a game
no
this game is like watching street smarts and howard stern
boring theme and the nudity is censored
if they censor it why do they put nudity in there in the first place
theres no point of playing a game that mentions girls get naked and its always censored anyways
just like howard stern i would tell howard stern theres no point of watching a show with nudity if its always censored anyways
if theres any nudity in the game at all its censored by either scrambling the picture of the boobs or covering them with the guy game logo
definely not worth the 
worst game i ever played
i would rather play jeopardy than play thisstupid gamefilled with grainy looking full motion video footage of bimbos flashing their censored breasts and some bozo saying a bunch of idiotic nonsensenot worth the time or especially the moneythe game starts out as a very quick lively game involving campaigning to become president
while put out in time for the  election season you can choose among a cadre of many different politicians from modern senators to expresidents to legends such as george washington ulysses s grant abraham lincoln thomas jefferson etcthe routine is a very fun turnbased thing in which you must travel across the country build campaign headquarters give speeches pay for ads hire political operatives such as smear merchant to lower your candidates approval in the state or even intimidators who raise your approval by  per turn or political capital to gain the support of organizations such as the nra naacp womens groups environmental groups etc and fundraisershowever as soon as election night comes around and you either win or lose thats pretty much the end of the game
theres no replay value in the game as everything goes exactly the same way and can be fully accomplished within an hourfirst of all ignore the idiots that reviewed this game just because they needed it soooo bad and gave it  stars just because they wanted pacific assault to get high ratingssuch immature little weenies
moh when first released really rocked the gaming world
but after the release of call of duty we can see how pathetic the moh franchise now isi was loyal and loved moh
i thought cod was just a simplistic rip off
i was wrong
cod really is a much better game the weapons and graphics are more realistic the sounds the environments
everythingpacific assault is nothing more than mod in the pacific
instead of germans you fight the japanese
duhit is not realistic the graphics are dated the missions are lame and you get level load after level load interrupting your game play
have you ever seen a rat in a maze
that is what it feels like playing this game
you have narrow paths they force you to follow
you dont have half the freedom that cod offers
as soon as a large confrontation is about to happenthe game does an autosave
if that is not a predictable dead give away i dont know what is
you get frantic and confusing objectives thrown at you enemies thrown at you by the dozens
this game seemed more like serious sam than it did mohyou start off storming a beach and just as you are getting into the battle you are knocked outyou wake up years earlier in boot camp and learn how to use the game
then you are at pearl harbor just as it gets attacked
you spend time running through a ship saving men from the firewowwhoopeee
you get topside and have to shoot down zeros as they attack
after all this garbage you finally get to the jungle and have some fun
but not reallythe levels are so scripted and predictable that you dont have any choice but to hit the enemy head on every time
i think the most annoying thing is that a simple bush or log trips you up
moving around and getting around obstacles can be a real pain in the rear in this game
the weapons are really terrible
very inaccurate
also very weak
an enemy can be  feet from me and it takes  shots from a bar rifle to kill the guy
realistically it would take  or  in cod it takes one or two
the sound effects of the guns are soft dull and unfulfillingwhat did i like about this gamejust  things   you have to call a medic over to get health
no stumbling over health packsnice touch
nice until they felt like compromising this strategy in some battle by dumping health packs on  the ground and in fox holes in the middle of the game  you can trade up your weapons
they typically start you with a pistol and a riflemachine gun
i drop the rifle and grab a machine gun as soon as i can
now i can have  machine guns
very handy
or i can carry a sniper rifle and a machine gun
an awesome combothe graphics are ok nothing phenomenal
cod still kicks butt there too
the enemy ai is the same
nothing new
they charge at you aggressively and sometimes it seems like they are flanking you but then they just disappear never to return
geeee thanks a lot how excitingyou do get to play in a squad which is a very welcome addition to this franchise
however in many cases when your in a tightnarrow jungle path your team mates just keep getting in the way
oh and they never die
never
dont worry about protecting them
just kill until the enemy is gone
your teammates will miraculously survive every time unless the game is scripted to cause a deathwhich happens a few times
even with this benefit the levels get redundant
go here get attacked
go here get attacked
the storyline seems like an after thought or even nonexistantlet me say that modallied assault and the spearhead expansion pack were both really fun and i feel i got my moneys worth
the breakthrough expansion pack was just a snack to tide us over until pacific assault was donepacific assault is now finished and it is not worth the purchaseas always my advice is waitwaitsave your money download and play the demo when available and then wait until this game is  on sale after xmas
if you download the demo play it and really enjoy itthen play it again on a harder setting and see if you still want to buy the game
if so then go for it
you can either be patient and listen to a guy that is only trying to save you your moneyor just fork over your money and be disappointed lateri really dont know what the hype is about
bought the game played the tutorial and all i ever do is fight gauls fight rebels fight gauls allied with rebels rebels allied with germania who are allied with britannia who are allied with thats right the gauls
oooh veni vidi vici
yea rightsenate missions consist of blockading one port after another very exhilirating
not
people get added to your retinue and they all have their special talents and points
where is my calculator so i can figure out what good they are to me with whatever leader they belong to if indeed they serve that leader any good and if not i can move them to another leader or general if it works over there
ooops didnt work lets see if i take procrasis the diplomat from general falucha and give him to general blah blah blahthere is no sense of accomplishement other then winning ground and lets face it all the fighting in the end amounts to a chaotic mad rush and fight to see who kills more
you really do need multiplayer to handle seige engines by one person and the dogs by another and the chariots and archers etc etc cause as a single player it aint gonna work so just end up piling all your troops on top of the other and usually if your numbers are greater you will win everytimestupid aithis reminds me of all the hype of tresspasser jurassic park and how it would be non scripted and you could go everywhere and really feel immersed in that island b worldwell in the end the game was interesting for its concepts but scripted and dull but if you went over to some fan forums it seemed like the game couldnt do no wrong and who the hell was anybody else to say otherwiseso the people who give it  stars kinda puzzle me
cant return the game so it has to be  stars
cant admit that its not the end all and be all of the tw series so its gotta be good and the rest of us dont know how to play or our computer sucks yada yada
oh well maybe there will be a ww total war in the futurethere are literally hundreds of errors in this game
many of the true fans such as me have fixed many many of them and yet others we cant unless we break the law which i will do soon if it comes to it just to prove the excuse about the cost being too much is also a lieadditionally the official website support is a world class failure of the first order

i make a point of only buying games where the demo works on my box and i like it
the demo runs fine on my ghz pentium with geforce nvidia mxbut the full program wont run
it says i need to have opengl  or better
duh  i have drivers for opengl 
of course  i cant get my money back  company policygrrrrwhen i saw this game at the video store i was shocked i didnt think they made a porno video game
just to see whst it was like i rented it
what a waste it was boring and lame
all you do is walk around trying to get women to get naked for you and get this you can make your characters have sex whao wait a minute what the h is going on
so i returned it and now giving it a bad reviewit took me about a week to get through this and there were two defining moments in this time that can sum up this game
i almost threw my laptop across the room during the last timed scene because the mouse pointer wouldnt register where to go
when i finally got to the end i started to watch the movie and he talked and talked and talked and then i felt my eyes get heavy and i fell asleep
i woke up about  minutes later and what was he doing still talking
i hit the escape key and quit the gameif you have trouble sleeping  this games for you
if you have anger management issues stay awaybuyer beware  the product description does not describe some important aspects of the gamethis game secretly installs copyprotection software called securom which can cause many problems for your computer some of which are when installing the game the user is not informed that securom is being installed
securom denies administrators full access to their pc and blocks the administrator from editing certain parts of the registry
securom can interfere with the operation of hardware specifically disc drives
securom can interfere with the proper operation of software
when the game is uninstalled securom is not uninstalled  it remains permanently on your computer
the manner in which securom runs on your computer is similar to that of malicious software called malware and many people do indeed consider securom to be malwarecurrently two class action lawsuits have been filed against electronic arts ea for their use of securomid never played a mgs game before started with this one
this game is god awful
i wont bother going into detail its already covered in the negative reviews herethe reasons for the low rating have been covered horrible camera angles etc
just not a very good game
mgs was great but the last two have been horrible and not a lot of funavoidunfun and very short
once you select your  main weapons at the start of the game you are stuck with them
nothing new here folks same old crapshoot em up and one hit you are dead
the graphics are very bland and it seems as though they slapped this one together in less than a month
rent only
otherwise you will be disappointedi played this game before and this is like a joke
i dont no what was so great about this game but theirs only three stages some decent characters and i gotten to a point that theirs nothing really good about this game
when i was playing storymode it was okay but the gameplay is to easy theirs only like speacial attacks and the rest is like any other wresling game
this game was not good just a girls only fighting gameyeah i liked the first one
it was a pretty fun game
but this bland sequel is a horrible waste of time
even after the first  minutes i was already sick of this game and just wanted to turn it off
its atrociously repetetive the environments suck and the camera angles are all skewed making it hard to fight off enemies with some sort of control of your character
there are times when everything on the screen is so far away that you basically need to hold a magnifying glass up to the screen to see what you need to do
a cheap way of getting around poor graphics
and the music just sucked so bad it was almost offensive
dont even waste your time on this junk heap of worthlessnessthats it folks wwe and thq are no more
wwe filed suit against jakks and thq and this will end their alliance
this game wont come out and there will be no future releases of smackdown
too bad
i so wanted to play with only half the  roster of last years version and missing so many key characters
i dont care about match types give me wrestlers to choose from
create a belt crap
better graphics
the graphics will never be better than raw on xbox or no mercy on n so spare me the we added more graphics garbage
why in this day and age cant we have  wrestlers with good graphics
i dont need voice overs or commentary just give me the wrestlers ill do the rest
i would have never bought this game even if it were to come out
now that the rights have been lost by thq i dont have to read about how amazing this game is when compared to last years version it sucks
i am still amazed that we went from a masterpiece no mercy on n to this crap
shouldnt the games improve
now wwe must join up with acclaim and we all saw how bad that was raw is war
to hit  buttons to bodyslam is insane  wrestling is going down the toilet and the loss of thq is a huge blow
this is the end of an era
lets be honest though who wants to play a game without the rock stone cold hogan lesnar nash steiner or goldberg
but hey you can be eugene oh goody
ah but you can play as a legend yeah i can do that in legends of wrestling too
maybe this is for the best
better to go out on top
goodbye smackdown its been funthis game is really boring
theres nothing new
no new game modes
no new roster
nothing
dont buy
stick with the very old smackdown games or get smackdown vs raw  that games the besthorrible game
ive owned every wwe smackdown game and i can say that this one is the worst
why
because the created wrestler feature is garbage and there are no tag team titleswhy get rid of the tag team titleswhy cant thq make a wrestling game decent
in wwe day of reckoning for gamecube and wwe raw for xbox has the best created wrestler feature of anything ive ever played
yet the game play of both games are complete garbagethen you have wwe smackdown vs raw and all smackdown games before smackdown vs raw for the ps and it has an amazing gameplay
but the created wrestler feature is pathetic
expecially in smackdown vs rawso here is what i dont understand
if thq makes smackdown vs raw and day of reckoning
cant they make a game that has good game play and good created wrestler featureshello
ive played every thq wrestling game ever made and i can honestly say that i now hate thq and i will never buy one of their games again until they get it rightif you want to play chess go grab a real chess board
the two player mode isnt really two players
you have to share the same controller
yes you literally have to pass the controller back and forth for every move
no one plays this game on xbox livei loved the suikoden series but for some reason konami felt they needed to change the formula after suikoden  the result ended up producing a mediocre suikoden  and a terrible suikoden  this game is completely uninteresting
i could not even get all the way through it because of a storyline that called for meandering on a boat in the middle of the ocean for several hours of gameplay
save your money when it comes to this one
konami has produced much betteri am a fan of suikoden series i ii and iii but iv is a completely different game
sure the name and the idea of  stars of destiny is there but the main character walks weird the dialogue is too long and is rather confusing going from room to room
suikoden iii was excellent but im sad to even writing a negative review to one of my favorite series of all times
rent it first before forking over some people seem to think that suikoden  is the best game ever yet cant even write a decent review concerning it
most people here seem to be too loyal to the original suikodens to admit that this game is terrible
suikoden  is my favorite game of all time so i actually know what im talking aboutthe graphics are horrid
the towns dont get better
there are literally  dungeons in the whole game that are absolutely terrible
the character models are bland and disproportional
the main character has eyes the size of grapefruits while other have regular eyes
whats worst the enemy badguys are so incredibly unoriginal and boring to look at
theres some grass with mist floating over it
grass is one of your monsters these monsters arent interesting like those leaves seen in previous suikodens
all the monsters look stupidthe story has been done before
it deals with the runes a little more but doesnt really have much else to do with the previous suikodens
considering it takes place  years before the first they cant put many original characters inclive flik viktor
one of your first missions is to go to middleport
when you arrive there a man asks you to kill a monster in the sea
apparently it was just a black pot with the ability to call upon the water god
that was stupid and pointlessthe battles quickly become repetitive as they are constant
random battles occur way too often
breath of fire for the gba had this problem but those battles you could deal with
this game has way too many easy battles
upgrade at a blacksmith and buy some armor and youll be unstoppable
the water battles would be fun if they werent so strategically easy
if your enemies have lightning boats get an earth rune cannon and hes dead
its as simple as that
the duels dont occur enough
when they do they are so easy as you just listen to what the opponents say and you winthe worst thing about this game are the little technical issues that konami decided not to fix
for example autopilot doesnt work ever
what they did for the islands was make large invisible barriers around them
when you first have to go to middleport cruise around the island its on
you will realize that the collision size of the land is too big and when you hit it it will cause you to spin off into some weird direction
another stupid thing is the way your character walks
he looks like hes sprinting but he doesnt move fast at all
even worse konami made the characters swing their swords like idiots
when you hit an enemy your character will walk up and lightly swing their sword
the sound of the sword hitting and the impact point are different
that sounds weird but play it and youll see what i meanso how are the characters exactly
they must be good considering there are  well some of them are
however you quickly learn that konami didnt know what to do with most characters
snowe is constantly changing personalities
at first hes a brave fighter than he falls on his arm and breaks it apparently
he then complains about it and runs away
 minutes later you see him rowing a boat
he then gets out and complains about how he cant move his arm
the commander believes him
how was he rowing that boat just now if he couldnt move is arm
why is snowe all of a sudden scared of battle
about  minutes earlier you got attacked and he was fine
and why did those guards let that one dude raise his hand up and summon his rune
why didnt they just kill him
things like this make the characters seem stupid and uneveni would love to give this game a good review
i truly would
i loved the original suikodens and konami is better than this
one person said that the graphics were the best they have ever been in the series
no they arent
they arent the best in the series and anyone can clearly tell you that
gmr reviewed the game and only gave it a  out of  this is a horrible score to recieve from them
the graphics are so bad to support the higher poly character models
everything runs smooth but it looks like crap
that leaves only one real questionwhy do you think konami is only selling this game for  bucks
why wont they just sell it for 
maybe they know that it isnt that great considering the screenshots released a year ago look exactly like the game nowwhat happend
suikodan  was probably one of the most inventive rpgs ive ever played but suikodan  stinksthe characters are boring the story is dull and without any plot twists or inspiring hardships
the music is quiet nonexistent or boring
the gameplay lack challenges and the enemies constist of roughly  or so models in the whole game  colored in different variations
traveling from one island to another is slower than mud literally hours if you want to explore the sea chart
plus while getting most the  characters was optional in suikoden  in suikoden  its practically required to continue the boring story
basically its find people watch a scene find some more people watch a scenei would rather watch pait dry its faster pacedgoing to buy the xbox o i have  it didnt show that it was for original buy thank youdo not buy this product unless you have the original xbox
it does not work on xbox  i was promised it would work by the item description and it does not
i was informed that i needed to have a hard drive to play the disc so i dropped  on a  gigabyte hard drive for my  and it still does not workthe item details is pretty much a boldfaced lie
if i could give the product a  out of  stars i wouldif they threw in a stragegy guide this would be totally awesome package but they didnt some good goodies though if your a true fan maybe i can see you picking this up but is it really worth 
i suggest you wait it out to see if another package is made possiblily with the stragegy guide
i rate  star for the package not for the game cause its gonna kick buttthis memory card is the most piece of junk id ever seen i gottin  of these in the summer on one memory card it always says format failed and the oher memory card when you want to look at you saved games it will load up the first two games and then it goes back to the main menu and another thing there built so damn cheapthese games are stupid make no sense at all
you cant like the main characters
this is my opinion only
i am sure people love these games
i do not
i want action i like games with ak grenade launchers like the desert storm series
possibly the original splinter cell is ok syphon filter on ps one are better games even though the graphics are terrible
winback covert operations on n and ps are good
i have them both
teenagers may like the splinter cell series
to each his own
thank youthis game is impossible
why bother making it if its impossible
one unit of a certain type could easily wipe oot a whole frickin army of another
ochall of the ps one and ps codes just disappeared after  months of owning this product
all of the codes disappeared
that was  codes that went into thin air with no way to get them back and with no warranty
up yours ari really enjoyed call of duty
unfortunately the same thing that makes the medal of honor yet another wwii game addons so awful and a complete waste of data makes this addon to call of duty so bad
you literally follow a path that can not alter in any way or the game kills you
a mortar shell magically lands on your head if you dont follow a very linear set of orders in a set time allotment
there is no ability to find alternate solutions in a battlefield scenario unlike the original game your orders are just barked one after the other in rapid succession and they sound very much like one of the developers just pulled them randomly from a hat full of ideas written by the neighbors kid they have nothing to do with strategy in a battle
essentially this one addon has made me completely lose any interest i had in grey matter the company that did the addon a long time ago they used to make great games when they were xatrix that is definitely not the case anymore they must not have any of the original developers and i certainly am wary of anything from infinity ward if they have such low standards for their products while claiming they are commited to excellence
not even close guys not even closeall reviews before  are worthlessst of all i dont know who these people are that post reviews before the game is even released but they should be completely ignored
ego maniacs and know nothings wanting to prove they could do a review first i guessbasically this is the same game you have come to love  cod but with new missions
nothing is really mind blowing or must have about this expansion packi bought this game on the  at compusa installed it at pm on the th and within  hours on the th i have finished the expansion packi really feel ripped off
 down the tubes almostthe missions are almost the same as before infantry blowing things up driving a tank but some of the new battles are very fierce and challenging
you also get to play as a bomber gunner
there are some new weapons but nothing amazing
the flame thrower is cool but you really never get enough ammo or get the chance to use it under the right circumstances   like flushing out a bunker
the ai is the same
the graphics are the same
the moodatmosphere is the samethe missions are still very scripted
your men will not move forward until you do they get in the way and will not move and block your shots still
the tanks wont go forward until you take heavy machine guns outeven though the tanks should provide infantry with firepower
is this worth playing
yes
is it worth barelyi would have paid  if they had made it longer and more in depth
why not
the engine is already developed the bulk of the work is done now all you have to do is build the levels
i meani was done in  hours on the veteran difficulty setting
if i had to choose between spending my money on doom  or this i would choose coduo
doom  is scary and edgyand that is all
after the first level or so scary gets old and you start looking for a good gameplay
coduo might be short but atleast it was thrillingoh well i thought it would be a fun game to play that i got from a thrift store for 
now its not even worth selling on amazon because of the low price seti was really excited to get this game
i popped it in and was disappointed from the start
do you see how small the people are
it should be called grand theft ants
good graphics but the people are small and very hard to see
not worth anythinghow could one game bring down a video game empire
well atari paid twenty one million dollars for the rights to make videogames based on the  summer blockbuster movie et but atari only gave game programmer howard scott warshaw six weeks to come up with the final product so et
would be on store shelves in time for the  holiday shopping season
well warshaw simply was not given enough time to make et
a worthwhile product
atari thought so many people would buy the et
game that they manufactured more et
cartridges than there were atari  systems already in households
boy were they wrong
people returned the game in droves
here are the main gripes about the game frustrating difficulty
getting all the phone pieces and calling the mothership was almost impossible while et
is being chased by a doctor who returns et
to the downtown playfield and an fbi agent who will confiscate all of et
s phone pieces
add to the fact that it was very easy to fall in those godawfullyannoying pits and you have a recipe for disasteret
was such a huge disaster for atari that atari had to put loads of unsold et
carts along with other unsold carts like the dreadful atari  version of pacman and unsold atari consoles and computers to a landfill in alamogordo new mexico have the merchandise crushed by a steamroller and buried under several slabs of concrete
crappy games like et
singlehandedly brought down atari the video game empire of the s and the early slet me start by saying this game is absolutely fantastic
there are literally no words to describe how bad the graphics are
it is astonding unresponsive controls and was built in an amazingly short time and this game was so well done that it nearly destroyed the video game industry
i suggest you take every copy of this game and send them to the new mexico landfill at oncethese games are remakes of arcade games
the remakes are worse than the original especially golden axe
the only decent game is space harrier and out runoverall dont buy this game
i recommend capcom classics collection midway arcade treasures  then namco th anniversary collectiondear sega why not make a collection of true original sega arcade hits
game like altered beast shinobi after burner metal slug zaxxon frogger choplifter planet harrier golden axe etc alex the kidd phantasy stars from sega consoles
the fun brawler similar to kungfu master from the sega master systemat first glance this sega classics collection appears to be a great buy for its price
the packaging states that classic sega games from yesteryear such as golden axe alien syndrome space harrier outrun columns fantasy zone virtua racing monaco gp tant r and bonanza bros are here but these games hardly resemble the classic favorites from segas heydays
maybe thats because the games are supposedly remastered with different graphics sound and music and none of it is for the better at all
the graphics on all of the games look like polygonal messes the music is atrocious theres way too many load screens and plenty of more gripes that are too many to mention here
space harrier isnt challenging here golden axe is annoying with some just plain bad hit detection and the racing games are almost uncontrolable
if you have fond memories of the aforementioned games avoid this at all costs and others who may be looking to pick this up be warned these are not the classic games the way you remember them
sega usually has a good history track with classic game compilations the various smash pack volumes for example and why they would try something like this now is just mind boggling
avoid at all costsweak sauce cant believe people used to pay  bucks for this game back in the early s
lol painful game
the original copies of this game i can understand maybe being collectible
but when dbz budokai  was released for ps a bunch of copies of this dbgt ps game were redistributed by the people releasing budokai  
this game is by far the worst db game ever made
it is not a collectible and was only considered a collectible briefly because of americas ignorance
for  bucks it may be worth
just to laugh at the campiness
dont take my word for it buy it as a trophy collectible waste your money
but do yourself a favor
youtube the game playi love d capcom fighting games as much as anyone else but fighting evolution is just a huge let down
the game features characters from street fighter ii darkstalkers street fighter iii street fighter alpha and for what ever reason characters from red earth while it does include fan favorites ryu chunli and felicia most of the other characters just suck wheres ken cammy and morrigan
the whole tag team system seems pointless since you can only switch characters between rounds the fighting system seems a bit unbalanced meaning some characters can be easily overwelmed by fast characters like ryu
the graphics look ugly the backgrounds look all blurry and all the characters except ingrid look as if they were cut and pasted from their original gamescapcoms successful ploy of wasting your money and getting suck on a disk
really bad game enough said
dont get it unless you need every fighting game but dont bother popping the disk in for a gofollowing the wellacredited franchise after x guilty gear isuka takes a drastic overall from its focused fighting approach into a more arcadestyled sidescrolling one
with that being said this is so far the only game of the franchise that actually lives up to its title  being guilty for being horrible hands down the worst of the seriesregardless of your fighting genre skill level going into this game when compared to x isuka is downright awful
mechanicwise the biggest and most noticable flaw is the fact that players must get used to switching a characters facing direction an aspect that will find you many game overs time and time again  simply by forgeting to press a button
this alone is the biggest reason many fighting gamers shelf this title after several short playthroughs
the rest of the games features include a sidescroller mode ala streets of rage style and a buildafighter using moves from all the characters
unique in their own way their appeal is however very short livedthe player vs aspect doesnt help the replay value either forcing players to filter through the chaos on one screen as they switch between two linear d planes of the field to attack aid or hurt thats right their own teammates in the process of hurting the oppositionthe only good mark about isuka
the music
always has been a highlight of the franchise but overall avoid this game
for a better cooler and garenteed experience with a longlasting replay value pick up the more recent titles of the series guilty gear accent core or its updated version guilty gear accent core plusim sorry that others find this game to be the best but lets get down to an honest review
the thing that kills this game is the fact that the single player mode is goverened by the same rules as the  player
this totally kills the game
imaging having to press a button to turn around
this might be acceptable in a d game but come on a d side scroller
worse yet in a  on  battle the flaw really showsprosthe graphics are once again awesome as the previous version nothing beteron paper the action can sound cool
 player combat sounds crazy and funconsstory mode is not what it was in xhaving to press a button to turn around is awarkard adn dumbsingle player for god alone knows what reason is guided by the multi player rules player chaos not implemented very well
the fighting this time seems brokenfinal word get guilty gear x and leave this crap alonethis discusses the collectors edition of half life   if you would like to hear about how great the game is venture to the regular boxed game but i am going to discuss the sloppy package that vivendi universal calls a collectors edition
first i would like you to know i recieved this on the day of the half life  release 
kudos to amazoncom they are a great company
however i would like you to know that another half life  collectors edition  aka half life  gold can be purchased over steam go to  and download the client for a mere  dollars more and you get over  times the extras than this puny packagethis sad package comes with a dvd and a tshirtnow tell me what is the price of this
for a dvd with half life  on it and a tshirt with the half life  logo
whats more rich is that once you install the game you have to still unlock it via steam and if the steam network is down then good luck trying to play it right awaythe steam gold package comes with stickers posters a hat a strategy guide a shirt the soundtrack on cd the entire catalog of games played on steam including half life  counter strike opposing force and a special edition boxmake no mistake this collectors edition is a complete rip off buyer bewarethis review is for the collectors edition only the actual game is awesomethe collectors edition  quite frankly  is a ripoffto make sure you understand what you are getting half life   the game half life  remake using the new source engine counter strike remake using the new source engine prima official hint book a tshirtthe game itself is awesome no questions asked
the remake of half life  is cool too but you can download that for free when you buy the regular version of half life  the same is true for cs
so basically you get a tshirt which is actually a nice shirt and the prima thingythe prima book is not the strategy guide
instead it is a tiny booklet with excerps from the strategy guide and the making of book raising the bar
it is an advertisement for these two books at best and by itself almost completely uselessso basically you are paying an extra  bucks for a tshirt
oh but perhaps you want the nice big box
think again
the box itself is crappy both in quality and in design
in fact at first i thought the box got damaged and mangled during shipment but it didnt
it just looks that badthis is probalby the worst collectors edition of any game i have ever seen
it delivers little value unless you want a tshirt
it doesnt even have a printed game manual for crying out loudrequieres steam and is too expensive i thinki would rather buy it without drm or restrictions like steam etcjust got this item in today
first problem after plugging them in was the volume control on the chord was stuck
i had to force the thing to move
the second problem was the mic would not pick anything short of tapping the thing hard or yelling
the third problem was the right headphone was not working
i took the pos apart to discover that the right earphone was not soldered to the proper location
i will not be returning these because i dont want logitech to refurbish these
i want them in the trash
i also hate to say based on what i saw i will not purchase anything audio from them againi was looking for a decent pair of headphones to use for a program called teamspeak
my outfit on a game called planetside uses it to do faster communication
after comparing prices this was the cheapest and because of the trusted name of logitech on the side i thought i could trust these headphones were of decent qualitywrong goes to show me once again always read the reviews
my troubles started when people couldnt hear me unless i shouted to the heavens even after i had the settings on the highest they could go to boast performance
next was the horrible design
after  minutes my ears started to hurt because there was no support for the headphones which pulled and pinched my ears
the sound quality is fine but unless i held the mic close to my face it wouldnt pick up which is impractical to gamersi plan on returning these less then  hours of purchasing them and to buy something decent that i reviewed this time
what a waste of moneycheaply made plastic and uncomfortable
i have had these for about two months and they already broke
i have owned three different logitech gaming headsets and they all were garbage after a couple of months
the problem always started with the volume control even though i never use it but after month the right earpiece wouldnt even get sound unless you press down and hold the volume control
after another month they just stopped all together and i was even extra careful with this one too since the same thing happened with the other two logitech models i owned
after opening the volume control up this time and seeing the cheap parts they used to make it i understand why it stopped working
i will never buy a logitech headset again thats for surei have three boys and we all play online games with our pc
these are not meant for comfort
after a while of play my ears would hurt
then i got a report from online players that my mic did not work or it was very intermittant
now there is a short in the wire and the sound cuts in and out
i have had these for about a year
shouldnt something like that suppose to last longer
was logitech bought out by someone
their items have been poor in quality and break after a short time of use
i have had a couple of mice by them recently stop working after a short period of use
i think i am done with logitechyeah it has a nice fit but if you like to have a lbs helmet on then this is for youthe mic is immobile
but it looks really cool to have it onsound range is quiet
tested on most applications works but the top of the ears hurt after a bitmy son and i play final fantasy xi on various systems pc workstations playstation  and playstation 
my primary access is a dell precision  workstation using this controller
i also use the same controller on a dell laptop inspiron 
this is a great controller when it works but thus far they die quickly
over the years i bought  of them and thus far only  of them are workingwhen i contacted logitech for support they turned me down because amazoncom wont provide warranty support unless you have a paper receipt
the only receipt i have when buying from amazoncom is what i show on my screen
i did a copy and paste and even turned it into a pdf file for printing but the logitech employee said it could be a fakewhen i contacted amazoncom about getting a paper receipt the first person said shed send me a new controller
when it didnt arrive i called and another person said the first person exceed her authority as it broke after the th day or maybe it was the  week mark
so im stuck with a controller no one will fix even though it died during the warranty periodas for the other two dead controller they died somewhere between the th and th month
i didnt even try to get them fixed exchanged or my money backi dont know of a better controller when it is work which is why i keep coming back
i hope people out there have some suggestions
i also hope someone from logitech reads this and has a solution for amazoncom customers
logitech should honor their warranty even if we buy through amazoncomthis game was and is so hyped i thought it would blow its competitor at its release devil may cry  out of the water
it had decent action but no where nere the fun or variety of dmc  with annoying button combos to pull of finishing moves this worked in re when it was used sparsley and to make you watch cut scenes but is over used here
had it not been so hyped i would have given it  stars as a rental but it is worthy of warning to parents
nudity sex and gore in this game
if you dont let your kids watch rrated movies and play games like grandtheft auto dont buy this gameit began ok but quickly devolved into a cra game
thankfully i rented on a gamepass and can trade this one in for something else because i cant believe how highly this game is rated and how cray this game really is
once you die falling off of stuff or swimming then the thing squishes you into the wall  times you will understand what i am saying
this game blowsits ok until you get to the part where you have to walk through thin planks while avoiding traps
trust me that part is so frustrating that it made me hate this game so much
stupid game designers who come up with stupid ideas like this should be fired
anyway i got past that but then came the final battle
id been playing in normal mode but then i has to switch to easy mode just to beat the final boss
well that was fine or so i thought
to unlock the bonuses you have to beat god mode
well by god mode they literally meant you have to be a god to beat it
yes god because only a god can beat that ridiculously impossible difficulty level
in other words you can forget about the unlockables because you wont be able to unlock them
zero replay valueits original thats for sure but that doesnt mean its good
its not
it get monotonous very quickly its tedious and its just not very entertaining
the graphics are ps quality
there are a lot of great games you can buy for   this isnt one of themsince i started playing this game my life was in turmoilhad to uninstall it everything settled down for mecant explain itlike it was evilpainkiller was an awesome game
i still love it and anyone who has not played it should get it
if you dont have it you will need to buy it before you can play this addonnow for this expansion packit is total garbage
how the guys behind painkiller could have sunk so low so fast leaves me mystifiedthe good  this expansion pack offers a serious upgrade in graphics quality compared to the original game
very nice but not enough to justify the steaming pile of stink this addon isthe bad disgustingly short gameplay time
basically i think the levels are leftovers picked up from the floor of the crappy idea department at dreamcatcherfrustratingly stupid enemies
hide behind a pillar or in a corner and just shoot them as they do nothing to get you
stand in a doorway and watch as they do nothingwatch as rockets and other weapons go through the enemy without hurting them
big time clipping errorsmario style jumping puzzles and timing puzzles
this is a first person shooter not a mario and luigi game
so if you can imagine trying to do jumpingtiming stunts in first person mode with a character that handles like an  wheeler one measely boss character that is no fun at all to fightnothing new or original in this expansion pack
it is just crappy leftovers that a very smart guy decided not to include in the original game and for good reasons
save your 
 is halfway to a copy of halflife 
also there are some awesome releases coming this first quarter of the new year
this addon is not worth 
i wouldnt even let my dog pee on itif you have played painkiller you will be on a very exciting high after surviving such a thrilling creepy roller coaster of game play
if you expect the same thing from this addon you will be dropped into the depths of a suicidal depression
yes it really is that badrealistically this game is unplayablethere is no information as to what the game is about or how to play
you are told about some long dead tatans and their tombs
you are supposed to collect some crystals
that is all you knowthe guide to the first five minutes of the game took me over an hour and i still had not reached the first destination
the game is simply too dark
it is almost impossible to follow the correct paths
cursor points that are supposed to aid you in direction are barely visible with a magnifying glass because they are so faintcursor movement is problematic at best
a mouse and four keyboard keys are required to move
the functions of the keys are never explained
a serious problem is that as you proceed along a path the image is magnified
if you make a wrong turn you move into a partial magnified image of another scene and orientation is lost
you must frequently reload the game to get back to your original orientationmy wife started playing games with myst
she gave up after two hours of this gamei had heard great things about this series and how scary they were and what a great storyline the silent hill series has
unfortunately i will never know because i uninstalled it after about  hours of gameplay
i have been playing computer games for  years of all types from zork to kings quest to fps games and without a doubt this game has the worst movement controls and combat system ive ever seen
it is incredibly awkward to move mainly because of the camera angles which continually change direction
sometimes the camera will be in front of you facing the character almost always a terrible position if combat is involved and sometimes it will switch to a birds eye view and you wil be staring at the characters head
combat is awkward too due to the camera angles
its difficult to target certain monsters and some you wont even know are there until theyre right on top of you when the camera is faced forwards
this just not make for a scary gameplay experience just frustrating
i hate dying to what appears to be a very easy monster because the camera angle wont easily shift to it
when the camera is in first person view response time of the mouse is not very quick you cant change this even with your mouse and trying to use the look cursor to view objects takes way too longin addition to this the game is slow
you can run but combat moves are about half as slow as traditional games even adventure ones
and if you die prepare to have to go through a lot of trouble to get back to your resume point including having to go through the same cinematic sequences since the game has very inopportune save pointsi wont be going back to the silent hill series without playing a demo of future games first
this game almost would have been much better as an adventure game instead of an action game
id rather watch the cinematic sequences and try to figure out puzzles than spend my entire time just trying to move around and fight curse of blackmoor manor initially looked to be quite interesting as far as my personal tastes are concerned
it has astronomy greek muses fairy changelings and a friendly pet parrot
yet this is my least favorite game so far
i think my irritation stems from having an obvious villain the graphics for the face just scream villain before you ever get to a mystery an unrealistic annoyingly uncommunicative friend linda wants help but then will barely speak to you once youre there to help her with the mystery issues with lighting in secret passages im not a fan of small beams of light moving rooms poorly lit moving rooms just to amp up my irritation puzzles that require too much back and forth between the rooms andor the cellphoneinventory screens too many forced side games and a mystery you cant actually take proactive steps to solve instead you are stuck in pointless puzzle land with things that have nothing to do with your actual caseher would be greatly served if it could come up with a way to more easily move between inventorycellphone and the screen youre looking at rather than trapping the cursor in boxes so that you cant move between the two or move things to get a better view of the items youre comparing
this is true of all the her games ive played thus far but the set up of blackmoor takes something thats mildly irritating elsewhere and turns it into a frustrating feature that prolongs the game unnecessarily two stars
i had written a review of this game a couple days ago giving it only one star
but im rewriting my review and im unable to change the rating scale
i had the same problem with blackmore manor that ive had with a few other nancy drew game  inability to finish the game because of the timed puzzles
everytime i play nd games i select the senior detective level  which is probably a big mistake
i always seem to have difficulty completing timed puzzles
i guess my old closer to  than  hands just dont have quick enough reflexes to accomplish these puzzles
with the blackmore curse my first problem came in the form of a typing test
the player needs to take the test and achieve a high enough score to obtain a clue  without which the game cannot progress
i dont know what score was needed but the best i could do was wpm  not good enough
in order to get past this i uninstalled the game and then reinstalled it
my old saves were not deleted with the uninstall so when i restarted the game i chose junior detective and loaded up my last saved game from the first install
this actually worked and i was able to take the test again and achieve a high enough score to obtain the clue and continue on with the gameunfortunately when i was almost at the end of the game there was another timed puzzle going to three locations and touching certain objects with a wand within a very short amount of time
i tried this over and over and over without success
therefore i was unable to complete the last couple of tasks and finish the game
i had the same problem at the very end of shadow ranch and on one of the games in deception island
i know in one of the earliest games her interactive had a patch available for download to allow extra time to finish the final puzzle  even with the extra time i couldnt finish that game
apparently im hopeless in these gamesthe sad thing is that i really enjoyed everything that came before this stopping place in blackmore manor
the untimed puzzles were more challenging than previous games and a haunted mansion is a great setting for a game
but this is the fourth time i couldnt finish a nancy drew game
i dont think ill be buying anymorethis is by far one of the worst games ive ever played
for one theres no excuse for the sorry graphics on a ps
they wouldve been acceptable on the first playstation but its downright terrible
the camera angles are not your friend
everything else about this game is just stupidbut what do i know
i only played it for five minutes before i quit because i couldnt take it anymore
i drove all the way back to the video store and returned it within a half hour of renting it
even if i didnt have the car i wouldve walked the two miles just to get it out of my house
thats how bad this game sucksthis doesnt come with the communicator part that goes in the controller this is just the headsetand it sucksyoud be better off buying one of the cheap ones with the headset that wraps around your head this one always falls out of my earin my opinion a waste of  buckschrisyou have to hand it to color dreamswisdom tree
sure their games were bottom of the barrel when it comes to every important aspect of gaming but they knew how to take advantage of the technical flaws of the nes and produce unlicensed games for the console
what did they get out of it
a bunch of laughs from retro video gamers like myself especially with their most notorious title under the wisdom tree moniker bible adventuresthis is one of those games that you would either punish your children with or be one of the very few titles that ned flanders would ever let rod and todd play
it consists of three games but lets take a look at their objectivesnoahs ark  wander around as noah and pick up two of every creature to carry back to the ark
baby moses  pick up baby moses and carry him to the end
david and goliath  pick up sheep and carry them to the goalsounds like loads of fun especially when all three games have the same concept that was heavily lifted from super mario bros  or if youre wanting to be super critical the japan exclusive disk game yume kj doki doki panic which super mario bros  is based off of
by the time you finish the first level of any of these stages its hard to feel satisfied instead repulsed at the fact that time was wasted to carry things to their goal and nothing else
sure there may be a few enemies to raise the challenge but who cares when the gameplay is no fun whatsoever
lets not forget to mention that in order to get health points you have to look at bible verses that pop up
i cant make this stuff upwith awful gameplay aside the game itself is poorly programmed
the music is recycled the graphics are below average and its very comical to see your character pick up multiple objects at one time
you can tell how hard they worked when it came to the debugging process from playing even a minute of ittrash like this is a mockery to the nes catalog
it may be more civil than hunting vampires or shooting enemy forces but thats like saying that you would prefer a box of mcnuggets over a rotisserie chicken
this game is nothing more than an object for ridicule and destructionrips stuff off from classics and compresses it into a short nonfun game
it wasnt even legally made by nintendothe game i received is a fake and not genuine nintendo product the game does work but i have herd that these cheap knockoffs can damage your console the ratings on this company are good
there must be alot of idiots out there
i paid full price for a genuine collectible
this isnt worth the shipping i paid on itthis game would seemingly be an excellent game however the battery that maintains the save files is dead and i cant save on the cartridge
ughthis game is made out to be a masterpiece but in my opinion the game lacks a good storyline and really lacks good graphics
the old pokemon games had better graphics than this game
the graphics seem like they were just thrown together
i dont reccomend this game to anyone unless you dont care about the graphic quiality and will be returning minereceived the card in decent time
once i plugged it into my console it would not register at first startup
second bootup it did register
then prompted me to format card
since there was no data on it i hit the button to format it
the card had other plans by then giving me an error message saying could not format card
never received a response from the manufacturer about technical support
all in all this card is a complete waste of money
now it doesnt seem to even show up when i plug it into my console except when it wants to
this thing is a total dud
save your money and find someone who is selling an original sony memory cardi was attracted by the  cent price tag figuring what could go wrong but even if i didnt have to pay shipping and handling  is still too much
unless youre actually looking to buy a piece of rectangular plastic in which case its a good price
because thats all it isbeware if you buy this game and have any type of problem whatsoever regarding the battlenet account that you are required to create
you will never be able to reach blizzard phone support you will get a recorded message always that their phone queues are full and email support for billing  account issues is horrible
we got billed two times in the same month for an a month subscription of wow and cant get the second erroneous charge credited backyup i had it in my cart for the deal price of  and right at checkout poof the price was   so pay in advance  months tis cheapestthis game is nothing like real tennisthe play stops and freezes while a player hits a power shoti love tennis so i want a game that is like real tennisand so far only smashcourt tennis  is like real tennisthis game is  just about flash and looks and not true to real tennisthe stopping and freezing and then starting up during play is just too much for any true tennis fan to takealso the player is so far away from a ball and can magically get to it while powering up yet again and the screen stops play yet againand then when it starts ip the player is able to get to the ball that is so far awayagain nothinglike real tennisthis game is utterly bad and not just because of the comparison to its prequel
to come after the single greatest online shooter in history it is an insult an atrocious abomination worthy of scorn beyond measure
however even if it were called something completely different and in no way related to unreal championship it would still be a very bad game
it lacks entertainment value in spades the story while actually pretty good is extremely short and is replaced with the standard tournament style ladders and the characters are frustratingly blandmalcolm the one really interesting character can only be unlocked by going through an absolutely excruciating series of challenges which manage to be both horribly difficult and horribly boring at the same time which is a triumph in and of itself
the addition of raiden from mortal kombat is a humorous marketing ploy which while probably making them millions is gimicky at bestonline play is no better
gameplay is hampered by difficult controls and the fact that half the weapons can be easily reflected back by anyone with reflexes and the melee weapon every character starts with
the maps are so bad as to be humorous
half of them are an exercise in jumping either off of buildings or into lifts to get on to the buildings in order to jump off them again when you find someone who is below you
the other half are bland and repetitive every inch looking like every other inchall in all this may be in the top  worst xbox games ever made
the fact that it appends one of the best xbox games ever made compounds this fact not that it needs compounding to be blatantly obvious leaving the player feeling insulted and ripped offplayed this on xbox live for  minutes and turned it off
cant believe i paid  for this crap
halo  owns uclook at the title i know that ds came out before psp but think about it it is gay making a pda a gaming system i mean creative idea i have a ds and i hate it i dont knw why i bought it i mean sure in the future better games are gonna come out o yea and for those kids eviews maybe your saying a ds is more durable than psp because you cant handle a psp your gonna break it psp is way better nintendo is cool and all but psp just kicked dss ass in this contestwell let me just say that handhelds for the longest time now have bored me to tearsi own a gameboy color and a gameboy advance sp and to tell you the truth i hate both of them
why
the games
to use the overused word most of the games on handhelds are kiddie
handheld games are either boring simplified d platformers weak d action games or cheap rpgs even golden sun which is probably the best handheld rpg is weak imo
i play too many rpgs to be happy with any of the rpgs in handhelds because their stories are so weak simple and not well presented
god even squareenix has let me down i love squareenix for consoles
sword of mana is too simplistic to hold my attention for long as opposed to the obscene amount of time i spend on console rpgs
even ff tactics was a letdown since the psone version was much betternow lets look at the ds
for one thing i have always thought it funny that many young gamers call the touch screen revolutionary
for one thing ive had a palm pilot that plays game with a stylus pen for about  years now
its nothing new and it is certaintly not fun
most of the palm pilot games are boring as hell compounded by having to use the stylus if developers couldnt find fun uses for a touch screen then what makes you think they will now
the ds is the same thing
im guessing nintendo was trying to create mouselike controls by integrating the touch screen on the ds and sadly they failed
for one thing its not a mouse and the fact that as a handheld you have to use one hand to hold it while you try to control it with the stylus means that the other buttons are pretty much a pain in the ass to try and use
constantly having to move your handholding the stylus pen and focus away from the screen to make sure you hit the right buttonsecond problem with the ds is the games
it has none worth buying
the port of the mario  game is ok if you have never owned a n
i still have my n and mario  and to tell you the truth mario  was a game i never did play for long because i just got tired of the mario type of gameplay
like i said i like my games with a little meat on them such as an interesting epic story
it would have been better if they had ported ocarina of time to the ds then maybe it would at least have a game thats fun to play although having already played it on the n i dont see why i would have bought it again and having to control link with a stylustouch screen would have been a total nightmarenow the upcoming games are also kind of sad
most of them are games clearly aimed at a demographic consisting of  year olds
there are almost no games that one would consider adult and i dont mean blood and gore but interesting stories and engrossing characters sorry mascots are just not what adult players look forward to
nintendo imo has been on the downslide for such a long time now
each passing year it becomes clearer and clearer that they just dont understand the gaming market anymore
for one thing gone are the days when players were content to play games that have no story but are just random go fetch this coin or get this mushroom or capture cutsy pokemon etc
its sad that this is true in all their products as my gamecube and collection of games can be a testament too
i only have about  gamecube games
the rest of their offerings are either for kids or sport games which i dont like to play as muchif you are going to be spending any money on a handheld seriously check yourself if you are over  and are looking at a ds
odds are that if you are over  you play pc games and console games and nothing in the ds game collection will suit your tastes dollars for a system is not a lot but it will annoy you once you find that you have to spend  something bucks to buy games which more frequent than not are so kiddie that you will most likely throw them away in disgustpictochat is ok but then again the  feet limit makes it kind of silly
i mean techinically you only have to raise your voice and you can talk to a person  feet away
unless your plan is to completely cut yourself off from human interaction that you would choose to use pictochat when you can just as easily talk to that other person then the uses of it are quite limitedthe ds is rather big and clunky which makes its lack of anything else but games will show
for one thing you will need to pack your mp player dvd player and ds if you want to be able to hear music watch a movie and play games
portable dvd players are not small i have a  inch screen one and unless you got an ipod mini your mp player is not that small either especially if you have one that has a gb capacityi do find that the clamshell design is fine mostly because it keeps your screens safe
but im pretty sure if they had not added that stupid second screen the ds could have been a whole lot light and thinnersmallernot recommend for adults should come as a warning on the back of the ds boxthis thing is a total waste of money
i borrowed my friends for a week during the summer and the games sucked
they were either childish or not my type
nintendo only makes games for either children or the japanese gamer
they dont make games for the average mature american gamer
also the graphics are no better than the gbas
its just a gba with two screens wifi and a stylus
this machine also lacks features doesnt playback videos music or photos and has barley used its wifi feature
the screen where you use the stylus also gets scratched from excess use
only buy it for you or somebody else if you are either a child lack good taste in games or if you have yet to grow up and still like only e rated games
seriously if you want a good time go get a psp they know what the customer wants
finally dont believe what the nintendo fanboys say about it
they say the games sucks and are few and far between but they forget to mention that it was released many months after the ds and the good games are already comming out
they say it lacks battery power capacity it doesnt i use it a hour a day at least and i only recharge it every four days and the screen only scratches if you are heavy handed
i have mine since the release over half a year ago and i take it everywhere vacation subway college car etc i just wipe the screen off with the rag it came with and it looks new and never have i had a dead pixel
the time of nintendo has ended and the time of sony and the psp has comelets face it
nintendo only made one good system
that was the game boy advance sp
i have to admit that the graphics on this are pretty good especially on nintendogs
but the psp has better graphics and better games too
also the psp can do more than the ds
i see on point in the touch screen
you have to be in the same room as the other person for the pictochat to work
and even if you didnt talking on the phone is much better
well psp rocks
ds sucksunless e has something spectacular for ds this is could turn into this eras virtual boy
go to gaming websites even the ngage has a higher number of  rated games than ds
nothing can change the embarassment of thatthis was not as good as the liteit also came with a broken mikehad to return itthe ds is the worst system ever
im not just talking about handhelds im talking about all sytems
the games suck grafixs are even worst than the games
yhea i know it looks cool with the two screens but thier terrible backlite and thie touch sensitvie screen is the biggest pice of crap ever
so for every one out thier lookin for a portable system cough up the extra  bucks to get a psp wich can play games movies and mps
and oh yhea the grafixs on the psp are way better than a gamecubeplease ignore all these one star reviews that nintendo nuts are giving the psp
they are just angry nintendo fanboys who are upset that theyve been outdone in every concievable way yet again by sony
nintendo never learns and when their backs are turned sony always comes in and takes over their market
they did it with the n and now they are doing it with the psp
the psp is the ultimate hand held gaming machines that is worth every penny
want to know why its more expensive than the ds
thats because it has better games graphics and can do alot more than just play gamesthese reviwers are little kids who cant afford a beautiful psp and so they are mad because mummy and daddy wont buy it for them and so they are stuck with their ultra cheap crappy nintendo ds so they feel they have to stick up for their crappy hand held no matter how awful it really is
want to know why the ds is much cheaper
thats because you get what you pay for
cheap system for cheap money
it costs so little because it plays like a ten year old garbage console
you want to complain about dead pixels
how about d games that are so pixelated you can barely see whats going on screen
thats what you get with the ds
oh and dont forget those ten year old game boy games you can playwowhowexcitingdo yourself a favor
get yourself or your kid a psp because anything else is just embarassingthis game sucks do not buy it stay away is they only thing i can tell you and just get  for they xboox or they psmine didnt even work at all felt like a knockoff and no matter what i tried it didnt work one bitmakes one helluva coaster thoughi bought this over amazon and within three days the plastic knob that controls the joy stick broke
it just desintigrated
very cheap and soft plastic was used
if it is not a sony dont by it
you are wasting your moneyconsidering that this was perported to be like pharaoh only in d and i had liked pharaoh very much  i tried this one outthe only needing  cd for a d game in this day and age should have turned me off of the idea pharaoh only needed  cd too but instead i pushed ahead with itin no way does this resemble any of the famous predecessor games caesar iii or pharaoh or zeusmaster of olympusfor one part the user interface is abysmally clunky with building options opening up from the side crowding up much of the screen and needing to be clicked again in order to close it up
building placement is awkward and roads are seemingly useless as it doesnt matter where you place buildings because people will reach them regardlessnext immigration
rather than simply building housing for your people you have to build individual buildings which house only one working man his wife and single child
also you have to build the houses for shopkeepers as they apparently work out of the home and have to constantly build new ones to add variety to every area of your cityall other buildings save these require bricks to be built so you must build a brickmaker and a bricklayer both act as houses and work areas and the game itself even admits that bricklayers are lazy and wont deliver bricks anywhere unless its close by
thus you have to build brickmakers and layers almost everywhereall in all everything else is a mess involving just building buildings with production constantly stalled by lazy bricklayers and very difficult to understand controls unlike pharaoh and the others there is no advisors page which helps guide you around the constructing of a functioning city rather than a mere village
the large building size also means that cities will be very small and unimpressive my tutorial city in pharaoh was over  citizens large to function well whereas my tutorial city in children of the nile had less than fifty
watching the little people walk around is utterly pointless and boringmade even worse is that the more advanced buildings such as temples and the like require educated priests trained at a school and just getting a single priest to come to the city to work at the school is a hassle
even then they have insanely important tasks to perform rather than teach such as dealing with medicine and hospitals courting the gods etcall in all a very terrible uninvolving uninteresting game
total failurenot at all what i expected it to be theres nothing to this game other than building a bunch of building in specific order very very boring played it once and quit waste of moneythis game is supposed to be the improved version of pharaoah which was a terriffic game imho but was a flat two dimensional plane game
i hate how theyre taking these games like roller coaster tycoon and making them three dimensional when the three dimensionality only makes it more difficult to maneuver across the terrainfor this game i couldnt play it that long because the game designers went for realism over function in creating the buildings with the result that every building looks the same so you forget what is what not to mention that everything looks bland overallcoming from a man who has been playing paintball for  years this game was a bitter disappointment
it was way to easy and there wasnt anywhere near as many accessories you would expect from a paintball game
please dont waste your time or money on this product borrow or rent first  and you will understand what i am sayingim a huge fan of kingdom hearts
but this game is such a let down
the card system puts me to sleep
its incredibly annoying
i dont like cards
any type of cards
but i love kingdom hearts
unfortunately cards ruined it
im looking forwards to kingdom hearts  i dont think ill ever finish playing chain of memories though
too boringbad graphics even for a gba gamecontrolls that are not very responsive  and a card battle system that sucks and is hard to use ill stick with the first two on the ps that are goodthis review may only legally be shown directly on amazoncomi would not recommend this product
for  more you can buy an officially licensed product which is proven to be much better quality
im amazed that these companies are still selling these starter kits as every one ive ever purchased from the store was immediately returnedusually none of the items work as they are supposed to the headphones have terrible sound etcspend the extra  and get the starter kit that carries the official nintendo seal  its much better qualityintecs line of products really dont hold up well and this is no exceptioneverything you get in hear besides the car charger are terrible so just get the car charger itself
but since you probally want to know heres whythe screen protectors are actually a poorly made piece of cardboard that will leave a whole thing of sticky stuff behind
its an awful screen protector that actually fell off the first day i got it
the headphones have no bass dont go loud and are uncomfortable
they broke after a week
so my advice is to get the car charger seperate as well as some great headphones from bose sony phillps whatever
and as for the screen protectors get one that costs about seven bucks as they are expensive but will do a great job in protecting your screem from light and making the life of it longernot reccomended
dont waste your money and same goes for the psp and ds lite versions of the starter kit
they both are the same poor qualitywhat the heck is this piece of crap
amazon needs  rating lower then  the screen protectors stink
air bubbles everywhere and all that sticky mess if u try to take it off
the earphones work okay but some  cent earphones may work better
the car adapter works but i wouldnt recommend a car adaptergeez just charge it at home
hey if u really are a starter go ahead and buy the thingsuckersi got this with my ds as part of a package
i can tell you its the most useless piece of garbage
first off the headphones had  right ear pieces and the retractable cord is worthless and gets tangled up easily
the covers for the screens are junk too
the one that covers up the touchpad doesnt fit right and the other cover falls off and doesnt stick at all
as for the car charger i havent used it yet but i doubt it works all that well either
intec makes the worst accessories
dont even consider buying this or even if you get it with a package deal toss it outok first of all let me say that yes this mic has a nice look and feel to italso being wireless it adds to its attractivness but over all this mic after a long time of wearing it can really hurt your earit becomes very uncomfortable to wear and has even given me headaches being as how me and a friend needed a headset we both bought onei no longer use this headset while my freind has no choice till he gets his  also and to this day he constantly has to say hold up im switching my mic to my other ear cause this ear is starting to hurt with the  controller and headset being wireless and it becoming more availible just wait cause in the end this headset isnt worth the price and it wont be compatible for your oh no
where is the  star option for this review
i want my money back and the last  minutes of my life
this cartridge is pretty much an upgrade of pictochat which is already built in the ds
i think you better off getting a root canal than dealing with this game
now call your dentist and get your root canal appointment
youll have more fun with that insteadi am amazed that there are a few positive reviews here
please disregard these reviews as they must be from folks with a stake in this game
basically this game is making you pay for what you already get
it is a shame nintendo deceived its fans by even allowing it to be released
so much for their past seal of qualitywhy would you spend money on this especially since youre nintendo ds comes with pictochat which is far superior
im just warning you not to waste your money on this worthless piece of junkthis is a really dumb meaningless game
glad i didnt pay for it
spend your money wisely and on other ds games
any one of them is better than thisunless it would go toward a bonfire
seriously this game is the worst game i have every played in my life and when i think of a bad game this one comes to mind
egm actually gave it two  and a   sad
but then again i dont think that this game dosent even deserve a rating other than steaming pile of a fat  year old middle school dropouts deleted by amazon
thus this game dosent even deseerve to exist
pictochat which thq ripped off is better and thats free
but maybe you want some more explaining
here you gofun chatting through greatlooking bit character animationseveryone in pin pals is represented by an avatar you can dress up and customizetry to upgrade your avatar by earning cool points  collect trade chat and play minigames to winsupports the single cartridge multiplayer function   people can play through a single cartridgethe avator is so ugly it is just pointless
and the single chat function is terrible
why would you even consider talking to ai
avators
theres also less functions in the game as well
less characters smaller keyboard and only one pencil width
pictochat has all this
who wants to buy clothes for that tiny picture anyway
i will warn you do not buy this game
if you do you are buying a product that falls in the same catergorie as kidz bop
simplified and kiddy mess
kidz bop is a terrible music series and to be honest i dont like pictochat
unless you want to draw stupid pictures than dont bother
just dont get this
you will regret it
unless your a moron and actually like this lame kiddy image than save your money and buy brain age or big brain academy instead
if you already have itjust save your money periodif you buy this and like it you are an imbecileokay so a little bit after this game first came out i borrowed it from a friend
i said id take it for a week at least and ended up giving it back to him the next day
i probably played for about  minutes until i realized how stupid this game was
i dont even know why i wanted to borrow it in the first place
i guess i must have heard the game was good and i wanted to try some of the many ds launch titles there were
okay as you can see i really didnt like this game at all but i better start writing about the actual game about now ehso the premise of this game is basically playing through the eyes of one of two people a guy or a girl
you pretty much go around talking to people in the ski lodge that you are at and try to complete off the wall ridiculous missions
some of these include hooking up with certain people etci cant believe im writing about this game right nowits that badsorry back to the point of this review
so this talking that i said you do well its pretty much reading actually
there are no voiceovers or anything
you have to read every single one of the meaningless conversations and choose the answer you think would be best to help you accomplish the task at hand
again you can tell how much i didnt like this game
overall its a very dumb game in my opinion and isnt even worth a rent or even a look for that matter
this is the type of game you expect to come out in japan where people love simulation type games especially on handheld systems
what this game simulates however i have no idea
this gameis not sure this can even be called a game  it is more like reading a bad book where you decide some of the aspects
if you get a response wrong you must repeat sections
this become tired very fast
the graphics while nice are very limited
music is repetitive and as there isnt really anything to do in the game but pick responses you get bored with all of it in  minutes or less
save your money and your brain cellsit is a fun game e for every won right rong it starts super easy then on level  it gets ultri hard if you wont a easy game get super mirio dsnow before you start screaming at me i like racing games
but this one was terrible
 levels and  cars not very good if you ask me
now i wasnt expecting a excellent game that would knock my socks off but come on
the controls were clunky and the limited variation in the soundtrack didnt help much
you need about  cars to beat the game and the fact that theres turbo completely messes up the point of racing games that arent destruction derbies
this was would have been better if once you got a lamborghini you werent home free with the game
the fact that there are real cars doesnt do a darn thing if you have turbo which can make you go over  mph without hardly trying even in a hummer
now im not saying go buy ridge racers
but seriously this game isnt really all its supposedly worth
here is a rating on a scale of one to tensoundthe fact that you could use some second hand music program on the computer to make the music is pretty lame the sfx are basicly what a three year old would do to make a car noise and some cars honking at you that sound like dying waterbuffalosgraphicsseriously the graphics are what you would expect from a game for the snes super nintendo entertainment system and oncoming traffic looks like a drawing that a toddler could dogameplaythe camera angles arent bad but the controls are terrible
you use the b button to accelerate and the a button to brake
not to mention the fact that when you fly off the road into some restaurant or something like that nothing really happens
you just slow down for something like a tenth of a second
then you just go on going  mph in a hummerdifficultythis game takes five minutes to learn and  hours to beat
pretty easymultiplayernot very fun for multiplayer
some games have worse but this is still wanting to bash your head in with a marsupial boringoveralli think this is the worst arcade racing game ive ever played and ive been playing games for  yearsafterthoughtsfor people who like this game think what you want i cant force you to hate this game but seriously i think if you want a portable racing game you would be better off forgetting that urge and getting a stationary console racing game i would suggest forza motor sport for xbox or gran turismo  for the psthis product is not what i expected
the quality is poor and its not even worth the  dollars i paid for it
there is not much to say about this product but a simply dont buy itdid not fit my nintendo ds lite keeping it in my electronics drawer  may have a use for it lateri didnet like this
i got it at best buy and i couldent wait to put it in to my computer
when i put it in i got my wingman joystick and started playing
the joystick didnet even work  it wasnet the joystick that wasnet working it was the game
it started to freeze
it didnet have good graphics
dont get it
your going to waste your moneyit was not a good remake and id rather play the original then the remake
overall i rate this game the game says play as mario luigi wario and yoshithis is true but you do not get to select characters starting the game you just start as yoshi as have to unlock the rest which is beyond stupid this game is big enough without have to unlock characters espessially mario
this is the same exact game as mario  which i hate with the new feature of unlocking mario wario and luigiwow
if you bought mario  dont but this its the same boring game get new super mario ds its much better and even better than the turd new super mario wiithis was much better on nintendo  this is just nintendo milking like they usually do
the ds doesnt work well for this gamei have played tons of mario games
i got a wii for xmas in  and a ds in december  i never had the original ds but the ds can play ds and dsi games
ive heard great reviews for this and the original n game
super mario  is often said to be the best mario game ever
i played the n version first on the wii
the game was somewhat fun but the horrible controls and the terrible movement of mario  camera angles made it star
i heard this game had new stars  characters so i got it
plus because it was a game released in  ten yrs
old the camera angles and graphics would be better than the game on the n 
i was wrong by a long shotfirst the new characters thing is stupid
its a pain in the butt to have to switch from yoshi to mario and back to yoshi for some stars
the pick up a wario hat and youre now wario thing is lame because make one error and you gotta start the whole level over again
i did not like this new feature at all
its one area that the horrible n version is superior to the terrible ds versionsecond the graphics are a nightmare
the graphics look worse than on an n
they bother my eyes and youll keep dying because you cant see where your going or where the goomba chasing you went
three seconds later he hits you and you have to grab a coin to restore it
easy right
wait
i cant tell where the coin is
ok im exaggerating a bit but not by too muchthird the controls are very confusing
the touch screen thing is a fail
you have to drag your finger while looking at both screens at the same time
if you are playing this on the old ds your other option is the control pad
i never did good with control pads except on the wii so they might not be too bad
im glad i had a ds with the thumbstick which is ok i guess
but why b to jump
a is a much better fit for this
they used y for sprintgood and a for punchbad
the controls overall are a complete mess that is not necessarythird the sound is horrible
that annoying music
poor sound quality
that stupid sound mario makes when he punches
these are all in hereoverall super mario  ds is on par with super mario n which both suck
super mario  is not how d platforming should be done
for the price of  us dollars this is not worth it
rent it before buying it
its not worth one cent to me
if youre looking for a d mario game on the go buy super mario d land with charming graphics nice music and good controls  gameplay
if you want a list of mario games in order here it isbest super mario galaxy  wii super paper mario wii super mario galaxy wii super mario d land ds paper mario nworst super mario super mario  ds n ds super mario bros  nes super mario world  snes super mario bros   nes super mario sunshine gcnoverall for this buy the far superior super mario galaxy  this game may be fun at first but youll fell yourself exploding with rage due to bad music bad graphics bad controls and the game being simply too hard to be funthis is by far one of the worst pc games ive ever playedif youve played the previous dogz and catz games this one is no differentno word can describe how aweful these graphics are
they are not in d and the petz look nothing like the real thingthe framerate of this game is probably one of the worst things in the game
slow and annoyingyou cant pick the gender of your petzyou can also have your petz run around the desktop
wowyour options are very limitedoverall this is not only one of the worst pc games this is one of the worst video games ever
stay far away from this game
 out of  starsnot only do i hate the animation style and the fact that its nothing but a bunch of minigames put together but when you fail at whatever task and have to start again it takes too longyes the animation looks good from a technical point of view but all people appear in silhouette
i dont feel any connection to the socalled story because i am basically playing with what appears to be shop window mannequins
and the music is annoying as hell toothe focus of this game seems to concentrate far too much on how to incorporate the features of the nintendo ds into the gameplay rather than making the gameplay any good or bearable
sega and sonic team should be ashamed for making a game this bland and bad
they should have spent the time and money on something much betterthis game is the worst
u cant eeven see the peoples face
y dont u spend ur money on something better
something like maybe a good game like super mario  ds madden  the urbzz sims in the city andor warioware touched
i have a review for each so be sure  look at it
this game is the worst i have ever played
dont get this game it has a harible story harible graphics and very very harible formatas an old lsl an sierra in general fan this game is a bomb
they rewrote the meaning of adventure game
youll have more fun with froggerany leisure suit larry game that didnt involve al lowe isnt an lsl game at all
what a shame that sierra wasnt smart enough to employ himmessage to pointyhaired bosses at sierra  you can buy the lsl name you can buy larrys face but al lowe is the soul of leisure suit larry and if you havent got him you havent got anythinganyone who likes this needs to get their head checked and buy some real gamesi have every right to say this because ive beaten all of the previous lsl games which al lowe made
i guess it makes sense that this game sucks because he had nothing to do with itspend your money on lsl instead the graffix are simple but the fun factor is phenomenalthis game sucks
i mean budokai  is better its alot better compared to thi nothing good on it its old styled and crapy badas s graphicz
and seriously do not buy this just stick with the good ol series like budokai  and the new one tenkaichiseriously atari this was a big let down im sorry thanks for reading this take my advise and some other angry customers adviceim sorry to say but this game really let me down
nothing like the previous ones i dont suggest you buy even hardcore fans will be ashamed to add this to their collectionhonestlykgi wasnt expecting much from this game since it was based on the we stole akira toriyamas characters to make a few bucks anime
for a side scroller this game has terrible graphics and controls
throw this one away in the garbagepoor graphics long load times an age of empires knock off with poor graphics
all your characters look the samenot very fun or impressive
save yourself some frustration and get a newer game grade  fvery little i have seen of this game so far makes we want to keep playing
in its attempt to be both rts and rpg is fails
sound graphics game controls just dont do anything for me
especially the camera control it has no rotate ability that i have been able to find yet
you are stuck with the basic perspective the game gives you and this gets annoying when you cant rotate the camera to see the bottom of the screenas the heading says dull and uninspiring
think ill uninstall it and get back my disk spacehail flaviuswell yet again is another game sold that would not save due to corruption issues
not mentioning this in your selling guide is really low so other people bewarei was excited about the potential of this game
but when i took this game home
i couldnt help but realize that thq forgot to finish this game
the loading time is tremendous and i had hoped the create a wrestler feature would allow for some truly bizarre creations
not the case here either
everything about this game is second rate
the character models are nice but the create a wrestler loading times gameplay are  maybe top notch in the early days of playstation  which required loading for every movement
i am a big fan of raw  which allowed you to create bizarre characters set to custom soundtracks and behind the scenes antics
all of which have been left out here
listen to all of the  star reviews on this page because they are very true
stay away from this unfinished game
thq really needs to recall this product and finish the game
they completely rushed this  game with good potential out and forgot to include the spirit and hijinks of wwe and a next generation game engine bc this engine loads with practically every move you make
in summary the create a wrestler mode is so limited you cant control the entrance well you cant even create a female wrestler
the character models are nice but marred by bad gameplay and very few characters to choose from
the only other good thing i have to say about this game is the ric flair entrance and some of the  other characters you can be are quite authentic
but there are so few characters to choose from that its really laughable
rent this game before buying
or go buy the budget priced raw for xbox as far as im concerned none of the nextgen wrestling games have come close to topping raw  which given the time elapsed after raw   is quite sadlets just say this game gave me a whole new appreciation for the smackdown games
if you buy this game  want to create a female wrestler dont bother
this crappy game will only allow you to create male wrestlers
save yourself some time money  absolute frustration  dont get this piece of crapjust not this one
vince mcmahon is rolling over in his grave and he aint dead yet at the flaming turd that is wrestlemania xxiis it this hard to make a good wrestling game for the xbox
the shelf life of this system is winding down with the xbox  around the corner and we the fans havent gotten oneone
good wrestling gamehow bad is this game
lets just say that in some third world countries you could be dragged out into the streets and have your house destroyed if you even thought of releasing a game this badlets go to the score cardiffy at best live playhorrendous controlsthe game locks up
even my old nintendo didnt do thatcreate a wrestler is limited its a step down from raw i could go on all daybut thats not how i rollshame on you wweshame on you thqi want my money back
i hope studio gigante goes under for the trash they dumped on to an unsuspecting marketwhy thq why
after playing this game i have come to the conclusion that this game is probobly worse then the original raw for xbox
i will make this review in procon format as usualprovoice overgraphics are pretty good in terms of character models
blood is realistic lookingcontons of glitchesgame freezes oftencareer mode is way to easy to beat
commentators repeat themselves way to much
roster is to small under  superstars limited gametypes no hardcore what
put them in a submission  times in a row and youve won
unbalanced difficulty levelsas you can see i would not spend  dollars on this game if i were youthe collision detection alone is reason enough to give this game a  out of  star reviewif only there were a  out of  optionthis is hands down the very worst wrestling game ever made but is it the worst game in general of all time
im not sure
undoubtedly the most disappointing game ive ever played though
to date
caw create a wrestler customization is the absolute worsethis game has no pros whatsoever
the best feature of the game is the graphics by  standards they was good
thats what built the hype around the gameyou cant even play in coach mode so you dont have to play the animated game crap
i guess ill have to stick with ootpbb game as this one was a dudedited i have decided to give this game a more clear headed reviewwhere i have no doubt this game is great in fact i myself would love to play it ea has just simply lost touch with reality
when you design a game that can only be played with the most sophisticated system configurations it tends to alienate your customer base
i mean there was a guy on eas message boards yesterday that cannot play with a brand new alienware area  pc that probably ran anywhere from  to  dollars
a machine that was tailor made for gamingi run a p ghz gb ram and an ati  mb ddr video card
this config is perfect for all video games in my opinion
top of the line
no of course not but should be good enough
however everywhere i go i am met with your pc is too outdated
yet star wars battlefront  just got released works fine
call of duty 
no problems
this is the only game i cannot play with my config
that should tell customers and the makers something
now even if call of duty didnt work do to conflicts there is an option to dumb it down to dx and lower the graphics
however with bf the menus are so intensive that i do not even have a chance to lower settingsi mean it is just poor designing and planning on eas part
if a card is still readily available on the market then video game producers should allow for all to play the games they releasei took part in a survey last night to determine how outdated my pc was and as it turns out my configuration made up  of all who took part and i believe the figures ran into a million and a half participants
where  were lower end than mine and the other  were slightly higherperhaps ea should take part in these before releasing the next title that cannot be playeddont buy unless you buy a new top of the line gaming pc firstmaybe this is an excellent multiplayer online game i dont know but i bought it for what i thought was a single player campaign mode
well as far as i can tell there is none
you can play around seven or ten battlefields capturing enemy flags but one has nothing to do with the other
i must be missing out on the graphics too although i have an athlon  x  gb ram xfx gt mb
go figure
to sum up if you want single player action stay awayi dont know why this is even still available for purchase on this site because the game was cancelled and all servers shut down  years ago in  this product is nothing more than a  boxif youll look youll notice the last review was in this stand works for the psslim models with the screw hole on the bottom along with the two slots for stability lol yeah right
this thing simply does not hold the ps slim model in a stable manner no matter how tight you screw it on
i might have to wedge something under inbetween the stand and the ps since theres a gap where its merely floating above the stand
i have my ps right next to my ps on my computer desk and even the slightest movement i make causes the desk and ps to wobble around from side to side
i know its not good to have movement when playing games etc so i dont know if this is worth getting at all
the picture of the product shows what looks like a slot that the ps goes into to offer support on either side but in reality this product is nothing like the one picturedthis game has a decent premise let the player run free while doing jobs for different factions
true its been done before but never in a location such as this everyone adds their own little tweaks
my biggest gripe with this game is that it looks horrible
i have a fairly nice gaming rig athlon  gig corsair xms memory geforce  oc as you can see this rig isnt a puppy i can run fear doom far cry half life  and oblivion at midhigh to high settings with almost no slowdown this game looks like morrowind and still slows down
the other thing is the voice acting in the cinematics its ok but in the actualy game itself it sounds terrible
its a game they could have done so much with but for one reason or another they didntcouldnt
well you all know how ataris been doing lately and perhaps games like this are the result or the causegreat if you like doing stupid tasks in a tony hawk style manner
only problem is the time clock is always ticking making this an arcade adventure rather than a video game
dont waste the money good graphics or not this game is not entertainingthis game has some good qualities but the pure racing person will have issues as you gain  for running into objects and cars which blows
you are in a race and losing so blast your car and everyone around you to get  for the next race
realistic
not
they dont even have a view from inside the car it is a bumper view with no part of the car visible
the interface with arrow buttons is bad and you cant even race online just by lan
in short stick with leadfoot or dtrsc and you will be at least  better offjcif the only shooter youve ever played is the oringinal doom or duke nuke em or if youre under  years old then youll probably like this gameif however youve ever played black socom everything or nothing cold winter splinter cell max payne syphon filter including the ps syphon filter red faction or any other decent shooter then youll be bored out of you mind like i was
this game is cartoonish and has a distinct arcadegame feel to it
every  seconds someone is telling you which way to go
kills are very unsatisfying and weapons lack that visceral feel that you get in the games listed abovedont be foold  although some of the designers behind golden eye created this game future perfect is not even close to golden eyei put this junk right back for sale on amazon after i beat it today
who knows
maybe im old now to me the humor was dried out
the graphics sucked even with my ps component cable
the music was weird and giant foot steps near the end of the game were iritating as well as some alarms
everybody whom played this game know those two computers are stupid hard to link up unessesarily
i know i cant spell but im leaven it like that
one thing i liked alot though was you can customize the controller but the engineers make you change weapons too much and even take your weapons after the missions
i felt like throwin this game in the toiletif you remember papyrus and sierra sports versions of their far superior nascar racing series then you know the real deal
i can sum this ea garbage up in two words
it sucks
if only there was a zero rating optionthis game will not work on vista no matter what you do
it just wont read
i am a computer programmer so i am very familiar with getting older games to play on vista but this one just wouldnt do iti gave such a poor rating anyways because the production companies website said this product was compatible with vista but once i purchased and called to see if there was something i wasnt doing right they let me know their information was wrong and that it wasnt vista compatibleboo f grade
 star for the name
 ratingbooea has proven they are bad for gamers
their exclusive licensing has done nothing but harm gaming for all gamers
this product is a prime example its outrageously poorthe graphics look like something from  years ago
how can you release a game with graphics that look like a  year old drew them
i recommend going to an importer and ordering the new gtr fia gt instead its heaven sent compared to this ea garbagekeep it up ea keep releasing the garbage games  best anyone can do is to just globally boycott ea gamestwo words it sucks
i sold mine on ebay and got some money back
ea makes some good games and why theyd put out a stinker like this is beyond methis is the worst nascar game everthere are a lot of nascar and racing games out there this one is just all badfake as all get outits about as much fun as sorting socksthis has got to be the worst game i have ever played
they used false advertising
it said shooter as the genre
you dont even aim or shoot the gun
you tell the  soldiers you control to shoot the bad guys but they cant even aim good and they dont shoot unless you tell them to
even if they are going to die they dont shoot
you cant even walk around you tell the soldiers where to go
also on the box it says its based on a army training thing
i thought it would be a action packed shooter because thats what it looked like on the box but i was wrong
there is no action at all you just move around while you see a couple bad guys who just wound half your guys
i rented this game from blockbuster went home and put it in my ps played it for  minutes then brought it back to blockbuster
if all us army soldiers trained on something like this the us army would be the worst army in the worlddo not buy listen to everybody when they say the game freezes
it always does
dont waist your time and especially your moneythis is without a doubt the worst baseball simulator out there
its like ea just gave up on the product being that its the last year they are doing it
the baseball games are just unrealistic
for example  im three months into my season and all my starters have at least  perfect games each while my team has a batting average of 
its just impossible to hit in this game for both computer and player
ive even adjusted the contact levels to no avail
this game is just terriblehonesly this whole kit is not worth it
i can buy the fact that some people want good things like this but seriously evyerthing you get here is just cheaply made and the case is also really stupid
the case dosent really have many compartments for alot of things especially if you are wanting to use your own stuff
what really bugs me is the products they gave usumd casethe thing only fits  games and if you are planning to go on a long trick you certainly wont entertain yourself with only  discs
got to have a variety and it wont be any fun to just be playing  games either
the case itself blows as wellneck strapthis makes the psp really awkard around your neck unless you want to be a poser rapper if you do that i will laugh at you
worthlessheadphonesgood god these are the worst headphones ever
they dont go loud and youll drain the battery because the input of the sound levels drain the battery but the output will bog down the sound that was already produced
the gimmicky slider in the middle is the only good thing but ill take exellect sound over some stupid slider anydaythe screen protectorthe exact same thing that came in the starter kit it leaves a stick resedue
simple unnacceptablethe car chargerthe only thing worth a  but its a poor cheap plastic thing there are better car chargers out therethe cloththe only good thing in this waste of plastic but the psp cloth is better and you can find above average cloths packed in with decent sceen protectors for a better valueand honestly the case aint worth it either
it sounds like a good idea but its the complete opposite
save your money there are better products for a better value out therei rented this gamei created my guy and entered him in the heavyweight classi went through the ranks with this guy starting around rank  i worked through the guyssome stronger than others i eventually reached the first place guyso after koing him you get the heavyweight belt woo hoo then you go down one weight class to light hevyweighteasier cause they dont have as much powerso then you get up to the st place guy and ko him toothen you go for the unified title which is basically a really strong and fast guy so i eventually  koed him too
then you defend your titles until you lose them
then theirs not much else you can doits not for friends coming over cause you need time to get used to the controlsi thought it was good at first then you realize that you just wasted  hours of your life for nothing not much entertainment at alli cant believe i wasted my  on this garbage
the pitching  throwing meters are very irratating
the commentating is boring and repetitive
the crowds look so lifeless  fake
the batting interface is horrible
the noname music performers suck hardim returning it for mlb k even mlb  is better than this game
dont waste your time or money on this game please look elsewhere for a decent baseball title
sorry ea but your baseball title sucks the big fattie
latei actually bought the  pack pelican metallic ones for  but its the same thing
the thing looks really cool and stylish fits in the ds nicely but thats about it
but what i didnt know when i bought it is that the tip is finer than the ds one making it very prone to scratches in a matter of months or even weeks depending how often you play and how much the game requires a stylus
stick to the official nintendo one no matter how cool looking rd party stylus pens arethe salesperson at the store i bought this product from talked me into getting it along with my ds
what a waste of money
if you dont have the hands of an arterial surgeon dont expect to get these on without annoying air bubbles under them
they are utterly worthlessscreen protectors may seem a good idea to use but i think its not worth it
unless put on perfectly one may find air bubbles on the screen even with the help of a soft card
if one manages to put on correctly however  more force is needed to activate the touch screen
these slips may reflect light a little too much making it harder to see and when used the little marks from the stylus will contribute to an even harder to see screen
its a very sticky mess so if you do buy it put it on with care because it is very hard to get off again
not reccomended
if you dont want your screen to scratch take good care of it because these wont helpthis is by far the worst accessory you could put on your ds
the bottom screen looks grainy when applied and like some of you said when you try to peel them off you get a mess all over the screen and the soft card makes scratches to the protector
please do yourself a favor and buy the hori ones
its a much better productif you think that the only company making screen protectors for nds would do it rightyour horribliy wrong
this is the worst accessory you could buy for your nds
you get two sticky covers that your supposed to put on the screens to protect them
the problem is the protector themselves are full of dust and arent clear
you can hardly see the screens when you put them on
even worse when you try to peel them off this sticky goo gets stuck all over the screen
save yourself a few bucks and wait for the licensed onesthis i could have done withoutive had some fun moments with it but wow if all dorms look that bad im very grateful i never needed oneim glad the other reviewers got so much out of the gamei found it frustrating that i couldnt move more than billionth of a microinch without attracting another monster encounter on maps
it got to the point that i got turned around and confused as to which corridor i was trying to go because you are attacked  times even in one room
thats ridiculousi got stuck part way through the game where you try to evade a jailer
with no save point possible on each map level you have to sit through several minutes of cut scenes every time you die over and over and over againi took the disc out held it tightly till it snapped in half then tore the box and manual in half and threw it in the trash
the best place for such timewasting junk
i wouldnt even sell this used to anyonei read about this game in game informer and it sounded interesting
unfortunatly this game falls short on many levels
the graphics look good but they are not great the gameplay is choppy and very sticky
initially i thought i had spilled some soda or juice on my controller but thats not the problem the game is just choppy
and this gets irritating really quicknothing really special or outstanding about the game but with a little more fine tuning it could have been greatthis game was a great disappointment
i am a huge rpg fan and have been unhappy lately with the offerings
everything is action rpgsreal time combat so many movies your sould screams with impatience lots of buttonmashing tricks to perform you can beat a game without ever learning a strategy deeper than hit the attack button
i have been pining for a decent rpg with turnbased combat that forces you to think
this game was not itthe plusno random encounters
random encounters can be fun but many games just have too many
i swear ive played games where you beat an encounter and then fall into another one less than two steps latter
that can be frustrating especially when youre trying to solve a puzzle or advance an interesting part of the story
stella deus eliminates that frustration
you fight when you want to fightcombat scenarios are great
not the best animation but i like the ap concept
cool movement especially use of the terrainfusion
other games have similar concepts but this is really easy to use
intuitivethe negativethis could have been made over a decade ago
noninteractive environments actually no environments at all except in combat
fairly weak storyline
easy to beat
side quests are short some less than a minute and boil down to one or two quick battles or even worse you pick a quest and the game seemingly randomly tells you if you succeeded or not
booringi figured out an easy way to level up
take a weaker character not too much weaker or the other characters will dodge all his attacks
put him in the first level of the catacombs with a bunch of more powerful characters
i have found that a character killing a character two levels higher will earn about  exp
you can level up pretty quick
on the first level of the catacombs after a few levels you can ignore the opponents they always miss and just concentrate on having your party murder one another
spero can die in the catacombs without ending the game as long as one of your characters survives
you can level up pretty fast this way
even if your characters are the same level you can still level up faster by just murdering one another in the catacombs than just about anywhere elseif your levels are five or more higher than the bosses strategy is no longer required
youll pound on emall in all a poor effort
one stari agree
dont buy this game
it is not a original rainbow six
not even  close
all the key are different gun sound are crap
graphic is ok no mission planning
come on ubi what happened
please do not fool people change a title name instead using rainbow six
this will make the rainbow six friends very disappointed
dont buy this game if you are thinking this is a rainbow six  this title not even worth one star
trash i dont even own this game but i have seen demos and videos of this game
i have the original rainbowsix game and roguespear with the urban operations mission packand i also own rscovert ops essential i also have rsblackthorn and both rsravenshield and athena sword
but this one here looks crazy
did redstorm entertainment hand over copyrights to ubi soft or something
im very shock and disappointed i notice the new ghost recon game has also falling in the same death trap in someways
is this the way rainbowsix games are going to be like from here on out i hope notif so i will quit here on buying rainbowsix games
all i know is that redstorm did a great job with the original rainbowsix games and i will also be a fan of the original ones and redstorm tooi agree with most of the other people that posted
this game is a straight run and gun game with no planing or strategy
hell most of the time your team seems to be there to serve as another target for your enemy
the ai sucks badly most breach bang and clear strategies seem to fail most of the time
also you only get one squad instead of  no mission planning and the weapon selections blows
they probably took out the mission planning since they want the game to be a run gun style game
i would probably given this game a higher score if they named it something other than r for the reason when i think of a tom clancy game i think of strategy teamwork and patience you dont need any of that here
dont get me wrong its a mediocre game at best but doesnt deserve the r titletrust everyone who bought gives this game a one star rate they are damn so right
this is not rainbow six at all
whats worse it has a worse ai ever second its a game that worse than counter strike
i am serious worse than cs
theres only one word can describe this game  shamefirst off ill say something good about the gamethe graphics are pretty good and the story line is okayistalling took a while but i got a chance to eat lunch while i watched it installafter getting it installed and seeing what looked like a great game getting started by the graphicseverything went downhill immedientlyi had a decent graphic card but the movement was jerkyworst of all were the constant hints telling me what to do and where to golarge blue arrows pointing to where ishould walk and bright yellow exclamation marks over the enemies headsduhall that was missing were nametags  i like to figure things out when im in a game and not be led around like a dumb idiotauto assault was an interesting experiment of a game but ultimately failed and did so quickly because it did not address the key interests of most mmo players
the game tries to be a hybrid between a true mmo with quests and character development on the one hand and a driving game on the other and fails as a direct result of that
most mmo players are not into car driving games and do not want the  twitchbased game and repeptitive blowing up of things and most car driving game players are not into mmos and want to play offline not worry about character development and crafting and not pay a fee to play
so the end result was an interesting idea and experiment but in the end only serves to reinforce the realities that  in mmos fantasy is king and veering outside that space is risky even most scifi mmos have failed the notable exception being eve online which has no meaningful competition in its own niche of spacebased pvp game and  twitchgame players do not like mmos where they have to play a lot to advance characters and craft and so forth over the long haul and pay a fee for the privilege to do so and instead prefer fastpaced actionbased games that can be beaten relatively quickly over the course of a few weeks or faster and then mastered for a bit and on to the next game
trying to marry these two ideas was interesting but failed because of a gross misinterpretation of the mmo marketplacethe servers are empty
there were less than  subscribers to this game at its peak a month or two after release
dont bother to buy thisthe game is not even playable single player its online only with  servers why do they sell broken games wasted time  money for a game i can ever use sadi liked the last rainbow six for the ps but i rented this one and i would suggest you do the same
right from the beginning its average at best and not a lot of fun
the controls are especially wack and will mess you up constantlyavoidthe games cover says it all
ugly
the worst cover art ive ever seen for a game
worst of any of the tom clancy series for the xbox
an extreme letdown
it should be noted that if memory serves ubisoft canada team did this one not the french but dont quote me on that
ubisoft promoted this game by claiming stunning graphics and ultrarealistic which is utter nonsense
a huge step downward in visual quality
also this is a minor gripe but the rainbow six team is supposed to be a counterterror unit i thought and they seem to be fighting in more warlike theaters and armylike battle grounds
leave that to the ghost recon team folkswow this game is like wining a million dollars and finding out the next day you dont have long to live because the rainbow six series has always been one to bring something new to the table and make you feel proud to be a fan but this game broke the rules all at once
whats wrong with it
everything but for starters the only thing that works in the game are your guns everything from nades to claymores just dont pack the same bang and are overall uselessthe flash bangs will blind you but not your ai enemiesthe stun grenades do anything but stun and just overall the explosives do nothingand the new hammer is anything but a cool way to enter a roomi mean if your gonna just hit the door so it will openwhy dont you try just pushing it lol the weapon you unlock which by the way in every rainbow six launches grenades somehow doesnt do it in this one or does it
i have had occasions where i switch the fire mode to its secondary and it launches a nade other times it just fires in single shots and doesnt do any damageugh this game is just horriblelets just think positive though it must have been that the staff were all drunk at the same time when they realeased the game and will be sober next time or in rehab for the next installment of the serieswhat a letdown  i enjoyed the other rainbow six games
but lockdown is horrible
the enemies are completly stupid 
i could stand right in front of them and they would miss me
graphics are choppy and blurry and muddy everything about this game really suxx
i highly recommend never playing this game
the rainbow six series was such a solid series  but lockdown was more of a letdown for me
lockdown renamed to thumbsdown
ubisoft
what the hell happenedfirst off your creature selection is next to zip
there are only  choices in this gamein the first game there were 
 starsyour influence is now determined by building outward on your influence ring
so rather then being nice to your people just start building
i usally build all way to the enemy city then threw fireballs at them
 starscomputer ai is terrible
kill the first few waves with fireballs then they quit attacking
you can usally just walk into their city and take it over
 starstrides  in the orginal game there were  tribes
now there are only  the tribes have different look but they are really all the same
in first game every tribe had a different bonus unique to itoverall the game play is just bad
you are no longer even competing against other gods
ends up being pretty boring
only reason id give them  star is for the graphics
they are pretty good
this is just a bad bad game
i dont remember the last time a company took an awesome game and made it so horrible
dont bother even buying this till its on the  rackjust a note about two technical problems i had with this game
first during installation it locked up my computer xp pro fullyupdated twice big red button time
the first time was on the th out of  cds
to work around that i copied all four cds to my hard drive and installed from there
that led to my second lockup
while merely copying the files to my hard drive xp locked up again
after that hard boot i was able to get all the files copied and installed
but that second lockup leads me to suspect the problem was with the cds themselvesmy second problem was an incompatibility with my microsoft wireless laser mouse   during the initial tutorial the game goes through a section on panning the view using the middle mouse button
the tutorial simply wouldnt recognize my mouses middle button clicks
after searching the web i found that people with the logitech mx  amongst others had the same problem
the solution was to use their mouse software to change the default middle mouse button to autoscroll or middleclick
for some reason doing the same with my microsoft wireless laser mouse  software didnt work
at that point i just said to heck hah with it and uninstalled the game
my son tells me that when he played the game he had the same problem with his microsoft intellimouse explorer
he worked around it by changing the options in the game to use the shift key instead of the middle mouse buttonits not much of a review but hopefully it might help others who are running into similar problems and are willing to fight with the game more than i was
i rate this game at  star out of although i didnt play it much i really did enjoy the first game
and this is not that game at all
the graphics have been slightly improved but have created a much worse problem than bad graphics horrible frame rate
the game lagged and i am running it on a amd  dual core with  gb of ram and a  mb graphics card
the frame rate was bad enough to make the game significantly less fun
it also doesnt let you fool around nearly as much as the first game did and from the moment you begin youll be bombarded with boring repetitive tutorials
but thats just the beginning
even without regards to the first game black and white  is simply put a disappointmentit plays just like tenchu  only harder
no rikimaru here but you get rin a young female ninja who is more like tatsumaru
story is not exciting but you dont have to deal with the undead
no player mode
using caltrops is a must to win boss battles
there are new items and abilities to gaini ordered this game throught togame seller
i got the package and it was new condition
but i found out that this game was made from australia
i tried to load this doom  resurrection of evil in my computer and it stated incompatiable because it is a australia version
i was so pissed off about
i had to sell this australia version to someone on ebay
never buy this game from togame
totally ripoffdont be drawn in by the fancylooking box with the beautifully rendered lady on the inside cover
the graphics ingame were only marginal when i first set to out to play this so i went to turn them up only to find them on high and very high
i told myself to just work through it but any hope of that was shattered by the hideous repetition of the single player mode
the weapons in pariah are ridiculous
i cant seem to find one thats suited for any situatuion
the main weapon the bulldog is somewhat accurate and thats stretching it
the only accurate weapon in the game is the sniper rifle im assuming
i cant bring myself to play any further
most of the weapons wont work if youre more than  feet away
im not even going to bother with multiplayer because i cant see it being worth my while
do yourself a favor and get something elsei wont waste too much time typing what the other reviews before me have coveredsuffice it to say nothing new or exciting
some nice graphics but linear gameplay and soso game ailots of hype here but nothing you have not played before
save your money for gta san andreas for pccoming june th and call of duty  and the other great games coming to pc this summer and fallbefore you buy this ask yourself if you mind air bubbles all over your psp screen
i like you didnt pay  to look at air bubbles
it comes with this squeegy thing to push out the air bubbles but no matter how hard i tried or redid it there were still air bubbles
i just took it off after one day because i could stand to see my psp that way
get a glass magnet and cut it down it will probably work better than this didscreen protectors are near musthave accessories for the psps scratcheasy screen
the intec offering however i would avoid like the plague
the pelican version  while not perfect  is a much smarter purchase at literally the same price as intecsi purchased both simultaneously to compare
within seconds of removing the intec product from its overpackaging produced a literal clear winner pelicanintecs screen protector is neither clear nor glare free
hold both sidebyside and the comparisons are obvious
the polish cloth provided with the intec version is roughand might even scratch a screen if used with too much vigor
their plastic squeegee however surpasses pelicans cardboard nonsense
although a simple credit card minus sharp edges can suffice for removing air bubbles
pelicans version is twice the price for good reasonyou receive twice the screen protectors
note however it took  attempts with the pelican offering thats  total to install one semilint free
these are some frustrating products and then somein sum if youre willing to go down this road take the pelican path
shame on you intec for selling a hazy sticker that pretends to protect lcd screensi bought one of these to protect the screen of my new psp  but it was a huge waste of money
putting it on the screen was easy enough but i couldnt get the air bubbles out from beneath it and removing it from the screen wasnt so easyi highly recommend buying hori brand screen protectors for the psp theyre of much higher quality or so ive heardas for these avoid themsure they practically scream at you from store shelves look at me
im cheaper than the other brands and i protect your screen
no inocent consumer run away
its a trick hes
yaaaaaarghthe idea behind this game is great
that however was the only thing about the game that i liked
early battles take a lot out of you and resting when you need to is not an option
ive seen references to a cheat code that allows you to rest but the instructions to enable it are not clear
maybe if healing was an option i would like this game
as it is its a wastesorry bigmike but you obviously do not know what a good war game is
i am a socom  player and i rented this thinking it may have been better
boy was i wrong
here let me go through the game for yougraphics  the graphics are blocky cheap and overall very bad
for a war game id expect a game with better graphics than this
and i also hated this the whole game all you see is beige
beige uniforms beige sand beige buildings everything is beige
ahh drived me nutssound  the sound is not too bad
good when there are guys talking over the comlink it sounds pretty good but its also very quiet when compared to whats going on around you
bad every guy you kill makes similar noises over and over again ahh
augh
ow
and wow is it annoyingcontrol  cant get much easier to control
x to get inonbehind something r to shoot o to prone crouch or stand and x to jump when in the middle of nowhere
 which is where you are most of the time anyways 
very easy controls but also pretty clunky and unresponsive at times
 the menu
fun  this game is just not fun
one shot kills anyone there is no recoil and the game is just overall repetetive repetetive repetetive if you like first person shooters i might tell you to buy this game if it was good
if you like rd person shooters buy socom   or wait for installed started nonfunctional exited started nonfunctional exited started nonfunctional exited uninstalledmove along nothing to see herei saw some footage from this game while it was still in development and thought it looked pretty nifty
then i read the reviews proclaiming it to be a thinking mans game and art and was further intrigued as i like thinking and i like art and i really really do not like most video games
having finally spent an hour playing it the only thing it left me thinking was how on earth could anyone think that spending money developing something like this was a good ideaimagine combining the esoteric and obtuse dialog of a clockwork orange with silent hill with a  year old roleplaying game that ran on a trs in which you could only move forward and pick new directions when prompted and there you have killer 
the control system is bizarre and awkward and offers zero customizability
the ingame hint system consists of a man in a red rubber suit suspended from the ceiling whom you are expected to talk to repeatedly
every time you do so he repeats some contrived catchphrase before spouting off a bunch of utter nonsense which makes no sense and then a slowmoving zombie will laugh and youll have to shoot it ten times and thats about it
i imagine im supposed to feel compelled to plod on and attempt to decipher the obscure vernacular in order to ferret out the narcissistic psychodrama that is meant to be taking place but it really just isnt interesting enough to make me want to bother and the graphics are about as artistic as your average threadlesscom tshirtmaybe im one of those people who never got past the first level but i honestly have no idea as i cant tell what a level even consists of
i greatly enjoy pretentious arthouse cinema but this game is really more of a testament to poor writing engineering and ui design than a work of art
i only paid  for it and i still feel rippedoffthis game has horrible story graphics and gameplay
music and sound effects are extremely generic
from the first moment you play it is just poor looking constant gratuitous violencewow is this game horrible
im a big rdperson adventureaction game fan and bought this on a whim when i saw it
bad mistake
i usually try to be balanced in my reviews but nano breaker is desperately badexcept for the cut scenes the graphics are really lowrent
the blood splatter borders on the comical and the map design is pooras for gameplay its the combo attacks that really bothered me
theyre easy to set up you gather crystals plug them in to a combo flowchart and then the combo is available to use
problem is i had to try dozens of times before a combo would execute
the button flow is commendably easy r and square then triangle for example so i was baffled as to why the combos wouldnt executethe game is kind enough to have the first miniboss hover there harmlessly while a screen tip suggests using the finishing combo
i added the combo and tried over and over and over to make the combo work
no luck
then on the umpteenth attempt it suddenly worked
a little while later i tried the same combo still set up so it wasnt that i was trying a deactivated combo and again it refused to executethe guidebook is unclear and doesnt provide much information
theres some vague notion that the wings on your back have to be deployed before a combo will work but they only appear when youre battling a hoard of enemies
so what about facing a single boss
i didnt notice them appear when the combo finally worked on that first boss
plus those wings look kinda like fairy wings which is both kinda funny and kinda stupidto add insult to injury you have to battle your way through huge sections before the game will save
then the next time i tried to play i chose continue but there was no saved game listed
thats the point where i pulled it out and threw it in the trade at my local eb games pilesimply avoid this game or at least rent it firstthis game is a real insult to gta grand theft autothe grafics are horible the gameplay is crap
have you seen the ai
they must have dropped out of special ed class in elementry
they shoot eachother and set themselves on fire
the game just plain sucks
oh did i mention sterio types
a bunch of white wanabe rapper develapers try to act like they know street lingo which they dont
the game is just full of bing blingf words and poor voice acting
for exampleyou better get flowers and a funeral because im comming
what the hell was that
you call that voice acting
well the point is dont buy it or rent it
do yourself a fave and buy a gta game
trust me you will thank yourselflego star wars is a pleasant surprise
dont be turned off by the kiddie lego graphics because its a great and entertaining game
the only reason ive given this a poor rating is because the gamecube version is a prettier and much better playing game than this one and its cheaperthe worlds most successful film series meets the worlds most successful toy in the epic video game lego star wars
this brilliantly conceived alliance blends the unique world and designs of lego play materials with the unforgettable characters stories and vehicles of the prequel eras of the star wars universeplay the most memorable and exhilarating scenes from the phantom menace attack of the clones and the forthcoming episode iii revenge of the sith including pod racing on mos espa the repelling of the droid onslaught in the genosian arena and obiwan kenobi and quigons fatal fight with darth maul
besides controlling the likes of obiwan kenobi yoda anakin skywalker and rd notorious dark side enemies such as jango fett darth maul and count dooku appear in thrilling showdowns
as you progress through the game you unlock many new characters including those from the dark side and you must switch between them to solve puzzles using their special abilitiesthis by far is the worst star wars game out there
the pod racing part is annoying and too long i gave up after about  tries its almost impossible to catch up with the main pod racer
there is way too much coin or what ever you want to call it collecting
there was no need for this the lego concept i thought was pretty cool but they could have done without the above mentioned and this game would have been alot betteri ordered this well over two weeks ago and had to order the other things like the adapter and plugs on the side is seperate orders after waiting two weeks i find out that they are going to refun my money
which i have not even seen in my account im furious and beyond disapointedi waisted my money on the other things and wont buy from them againthis has to be one of the less compelling games ive ever played
i tried to like it but no
it has atrocious graphics repetitive and repetitive and then more repetitive gameplay with same foesthe written conversations cant just be dismissed you have to go through them over and over if you get killed in a level
on top of that some parts are just too hard
not worth anybodys timehere you go folks another ds dud
d graphics old and tired gameplay nothing new to offer and yet somehow nintendo fans eat it up and call it candy
this game is pathetic and makes you wonder why nintendo even made the ds when all they are doing is continuing the gameboy advance graphics on a new system that costs more money
a dual screen that is constantly unsued and a stylus gimmick that is falling short of any expectations
lets face it nintendo is no longer innovative
the psp has the kinds of games that show real advancement and innovation in the hand held market
but youre a nintendo fanboy you wont care any wayever since i picked up gba i was searching for versions of classic board and card games as this genre of game is ideal for a portable system
minimal thought required to play but lots of fun
kinda hard to play an rpg puzzler while sitting on a crowded train anyway you can imagine my joy when i saw this compilation on the shelf for a bargain price
however i should have known with the  price tag came ill conceived game design that virtually ruins  great classic board games
first of all the most glairing mistake is the lack of a save feature
anyone who has ever played risk knows just how long a good game can take so the ability to save your game seemed like a no brinier but none of the  games allow you to save your progress
as i started to play risk i quickly discovered the reason they may have left out the save feature is because the ai is almost non existent so long games are a thing of the past
the lack of an intelligent ai is glaring in all  games
finally the graphics are sub par the music is forgettable and the controls are clunky even in a game where control should be virtually a nonissue
this game collection was an excellent idea that seems to have been slapped together and packaged overnight
pass on this one you wont regret iti bought this game because i love risk board game and clue
then i have great expectations with this game but risk is just an random numeric game after a few matches i been bored clue is very predictable is boring
but if you dont have nothing to do and you want waste time battleship is the answer is the most funniest game between the other two piece of crapthis is one of the most disappointing games i have ever played in my socalled gaming career
the worst thing about it is that it could have been a fascinating gameconceptbut instead you get a halfbaked ripoff of the matrix combined with simon says thatll drive you up the wall with its appallingly bad camera angles and controls worse than resident evil  if you know what i mean as well as a ridiculous plot lineyeah ill admit its good for some laughsif you find it funny to waste your money on a videogame that will literally make you scream for frustration after you get stuck in the corner of a dark hallway and cannot free yourself for all youre worth for the fifteenth time in the last hour
i repeat horrendous controls horrendous camera angles
i literally almost had a stroke during one of the first timed sections because the clock was ticking and i couldnt see where i was going half the time
when you cant even play a horrible videogame in the interest of ridiculing it then what good is itall of that being said indigo prophecy really is a low blow to the gaming world
the worst of it is that it begins with such an interesting idea
i was drawn in by the cover art initially and upon reading the back and a few reviews my friend and i decided to give it a runthrough bought it used so we figured it couldnt hurtlittle did we know
it took two delirious angerfilled nights and i have to say ive never felt so offended by the pure stupidity of the game i was playing
brief semispoiler the ending is positively ludicrous
i really truly felt that one group of writers in the think tank came up with the opening then disappeared during a vacation in the himalayas and were subsequently replaced by a new team that had no concept of either a what a good videogame is or b what a good or reasonable plotline isallinall a huge thumbs downin all honesty i can deal with the tedious micromangement of the game itself but the bugs are horrendous
after an entire day of constant crashing andor booting me to the desktop i decided to dump the game in the garbage
i have never been so frustrated with a game that has potential yet failed so miserably
no patches worth downloadingwhat little game play i got out of it was allot of micromanagement of your ships no custom default loads and combat that can actually take over an hour real timedo not waste your moneyomg
this ones a real shocker
who wouldve thought that a game could be so bad
the graphics are horrible
they wouldve been horrible on ps ten years ago
its one of those games in which you can see your characters back the whole time
the camera is able to rotate around you but youre unable to run towards the camera
the battle system is very incomplete
pressing the left trigger allows you to perform a cheesy combo
the graphics twitch when you fight or just perform an open combo when theres no enemy around
kiddie looking games with adult content are a great idea ill take conker anyday
however they often fail in the gameplay department
in this case the game isnt even nice to look at
all the main factors are not present
gameplay controls and graphics all need major work
sorry but i feel that someone needs to go back to the drawing boardeven at  bucks at odd lot was a rip off
incredibly stupid and vulgar dialog with no point other than to be gross cryptic clues so far from reality that only an online walkthrough could help boring and stupid flow
i have rarely played a game as bad as this
quarter of the way through i just had to uninstall it glue the box back together and ship it back to those morons at the adventure company
another company to ignore in the future
beware you will be disappointedi liked the demo for this game and was hoping for fun
everything was fine until the point i couldnt get into the morgue because my key card didnt work
after trying everything i could think of i had to consult a walkthrough
what annoys me is that there was no hint before in the game that i would have to use this method to solve anything or indeed that i could even use that particular method
im so annoyed by this it has tainted my whole view of the game
i see nothing like this in the indigo prophecy
while that game has its own problems that i covered in my review of it it did a better job at the type of things in this game
what is it with adventure game makers today
they just cant seem to get it right
people complain about adventure games dying yet no good ones are ever madei like the main character it has good graphics and the story seems good enough but it doesnt make up for the boring gameplaythis game was extremely disappointing for methe profanity is unnecessary and tritea forced use of the fbomb that fits neither the dialogue nor the atmospherethe lack of an endingthis game ended so fast i think i have whiplashim pretty sure it ended because i saw the credits rollonly the ending from a sking movie can abuse a person this badthe game play is linear but the story line didnt make up for iti think the only puzzle i enjoyed was the lockpicking
it starts easyso you can understand it and then became a bit harder in the endso you can think
the rest were either stupidly easy or impossiblethe cookies
i think if this game endedi could recommend it but i feel like i just got ripped offi wouldnt bother unless you are a diehard adventure fan and need a fixi really should enjoy this game
im a huge fan of brawlers and enjoy even the worstreviewed beatemup games out there
games like streets of rage captain commando and golden axe are some of my favorite games of all time and i play an awful awful lot of games
i also love sega products particularly their arcade games
i love the hardware they ran on i love the graphics and i love their quirky attitudebut spikeout just simply sucks on the xbox
the first thing you will be forced to note is the eternal loading time
the game employs horrifyingly stupid cg cutscenes while the game loads to make the wait seem shorter but it backfires and makes the whole experience awful
in addition to the load times being excessively longthe game loads all the time
you might literally play for three minutes and then have to load for another minute or two only to play a  minute section then load for a minute
its really badly programmedand the game itself is really a poor brawler
the graphics are pretty darn good particularly for the games agebut the camera angles suck the enemy ai sucks the combo system is horribly weak the controls are not intuitive the special weapons are stupid the stages are much more repetetive than even most brawlers and the characters are even more boring than expected from a game featuring a breakdancer named spike jr as its main characterand thats as much time as im going to spend warning you not to even waste the current going price of  on this one
its terrible just plain out not worth playing no matter what your tastes are like dont even think about itthe graphics seem dated and rushed
the gameplay was laborious and after  minutes i simply could not play anymore as it seemed i was wasting my time
i was playing with two player option but the second player wound up always having to be a robot
the second stage was having each character escape from the hospital and fight off robots and solve puzzles to open doors i dont rememeber any of that in the movie
i would not recommendi aint got nothin to say but graphics garbage gameplay garbage sound garbage
theres no way anyone can say this game  stars
i use the games case for a coaster
its garbagethere are many many things oh where to start that make this game horrible
first hmmmm i have to collect my thoughts this entire game is button mashing
you can beat the game just hitting square square square
except for the boring little minigames where you just hit and im not joking here x as fast as you canpeople praise the fact that you can switch between two characters but i never saw a need for this unless i needed one character to do one of those stupid pointless puzzles
but really i would just switch between characters because i got tired of using the thing and wanted to use mr fantasticthe graphics are incredibly horrible and choppy
the game is an eyesore
please please please dont buy this game
its for your own goodawful
those people that gave this game good reviews are making money in some way from the sale of this game
i heard it was similar to the xmen legends game which was great so i didnt think twice about picking it up
i could not have been more disappointed
graphics stink gameplay is awfuli cant think of anything nice to say about iti should have seen it comingthe commercials for the game have no actual footage or screenshots from the game
the animation on the commercial looks nothing like the game
multi player mode is even worse than single which stinksif you just feel the need to get rid of  bucksflush it down the toilet and cut your losses
youll feel better about yourself than if you actually spend money on this crap and then feel obligated to play ityou know i had hopes for this game
i really did
the hulk was certainly a playable adventure that delivered on the feeling of being the hulk
both spiderman games did credit to their source material
and ive heard that most of the xmen games translated well toothere are after all some constants in the comic book gaming universe
if the game is based on a dc character it will be the worst and most painful thing youve ever played
witness the many attempts to make batman and superman even remotely interesting
platform after platform have given us nothing with these charactersso what kind of world i ask you do we live in now where a batman game is arguably one of the best adaptations of all time and stan lee allowed thisabominationi have never been so totally disappointed so totally early by any game
everif you dont know by the first missionwhich comes mind you prior to the team becoming fantasticthat this game is gonna suck id argue that youve never played a good video game in your life
harsh words
yes
but true
oh so sadly sadly truei dont even really know how to qualify the problems with this game other than to say i cant really wrap my mind around anything good the game has to offer
voice acting
no
story
no
graphics
certainly not
clever realization of super powers
um again not so much
good online play
it doesnt even exist
puzzles that are satisfying once you figure them out
you try opening a door in the early part of this gameits just buttonmashing madness with a hint that maybe there might have been a good idea at one faraway stage in the games developmenti cannot believe i paid full price or indeed any price for this game
this game is about one thing and one thing only  release date
as long as the producers got something halfway playable out there before the movie premiered then they accomplished their central mission
this game is a blatant example of a company trying to make its money back off of people hyped by a film without worrying about any of those pesky details like graphics or gameplay
granted this isnt as bad as the notorious et game back in the sbut in  terms its pretty close
after all the strides that movie tiein games have made in the last couple of years to actually be good in their own right its just depressing to see that there are still some companies out there who see the license as a negotiated right rather than a privilege to be cherishedheck im no even going to comment on this terrible game
see my review on lego starwars and realise that just cause its got offical stuff from the movie doesnt mean that its better than lego starwars
get the better game out of the two and get lego as lego rocksthe last star wars movie was incredible and i was looking foward to the game
i borrowed it from my uncle and i was really excited
when i played it it was like an earthquake hit the designers heads
the graphics are awful and looks like it came out of the garbage
the game gets really repeditive after the second level
there is no originality at all in this game which is really bad
sure the multiplayer might be pretty good but it also gets repeditive just like the single player
on the bonus stages you get to play as different characters but they all handle the same way
the controls are pretty good but you wont need them because all you use is the x button
overall the game is horriblesince the sony fanboys have decided that now is the time to start some kind of flamewar about the supposedly lowly ds i guess i will stoop to your level
well maybe not that low
i will actually tell the truth
the truth says that the ds is outselling the psp in the us the uk and japan
the truth says that the ds has almost  games while the psp has only   by the way most of them are old ports of playstation games
enjoy
the truth says that no matter how much you want it to the movie spiderman  still looks like crap when viewed on a  inch screen
crowd in boys and girls this is gonna be great
the truth says that it sucks waiting  minutes for a gamemovie to load and then watching your batteries run out
and finaly the truth says that in the end specs dont mean jack
good gameplay equals longevity
sony thanks god that the world is full of stupid people
otherwise the psp would still be sitting on the shelves
remember
the truth doesnt lie
have fun with frogger guys
one of the cutting edge  dollar titles for the pspi bought this thing like many other fools on the launch day and mine had  dead pixels to alot of people this might not bother them but  is alot of money to me so i returned it to best buy and i had to lie about what was wrong with it to get a new one because if it has dead pixels they wont exchange it
well the one i exchanged it for also has dead pixels  in the lower right corner and one smack dab in the middle
so today i will try to exchange it again and will continue to do so until i get a good one
i think sony knew of this problem with alot of the units but desided to release them anyway in hopes that people would not notice the dead pixels
well good luck with yours peoplethe nintendo ds and the psp might as well be the next virtual boy systems
i mean both dont really have any point the games suck and are ridiculously overpriced
 bucks
what a rip off
the movie sequel movie to final fantasy  called advent children is going to be released for psp and not dvd which to me is a huge letdown
i refuse to pay  bucks just to watch a movie sorry
beside advent children this thing doesnt have much of anything
all of the games here are rehashes of old playstation games or crappy new games that dont really have any playing value
i mean metal gear acid  what the hell
i think these days developers will go to any extent to try and cash in
these days video game developers will seem to do almost anything to higher their profit margin
like other people have said the same games that are released for ps will be ported out to this system in watereddown versions highering their profit
i find this ridiculous
what ever happened to sitting down and enjoying good video games
these days video games are all about money and graphics and frankly i dont care for it any more
gba is the only worthwile portable system having classic snes and nes games available to play anywhere you want
the problem i have with portable systems is that the games are usually not that great to begin with and you add the fact that they cost  bucks and it makes it pointless
i mean the ps costs  bucksso why pay  bucks more than a actual ps for some stupid unimpressive portable systemi dont get it
people are just stupid and sony knows this so they are cashing in on the stupidity
i prefer to stick to console systems the games are better the sound is better the screen is bigger and it isnt as awkward to play and in many cases even the games are cheaper
all in all the psp is just a ridiculous waste of money and i would advise everyone to stay away from it
if you want to play good video games buy a regular nintendo snes or n and ps those systems have real games
i dont consider myself a gamer and i am not some lame fanboy but i do enjoy playing video games mainly old school stuff though
if you are like me you will not like this
if you want to dish out  bucks for a piece of crap go aheadmost of the people who youll find praising the psp for what it is now are nothing but casual gamers who have some type of image complex
look at me im so cool because i have a psp
psps are for grown ups you know
only little  year old kids play nintendo
its ironic how the mature gamers are saying such immature things
most of these mature gamers are in their teens oddly enough
i laugh at any loser who is above the age of  and says these kinds of things
lol losers
anyhow that was just my rant about some of the sony fanboys now onto the pspthe first thing youll notice about the psp is that its quite sleek and provacative
its an eyecatcher for sure buts thats about the only thing its good for show
here ill list of a few things that make the psp very undesirablethe screen
ok so you look at the screen and notice just how large and sharp it is compared to nintendos gba sp and nds
however there is a major drawback with it because its plagued with a lot of dead pixels
i cannot stand playing with dead pixels because they always divert my attention from the game of course thats not such a big problem seeing as how the psp has no games worth playing
also since it is so large it gets in the way of the square button making it unresponsive and making enjoyment an impossibilitythe design
again the screen gets in the way of the square button
the analogue stick is not designed well
and the whole thing looks derivative
it is also ver fragile
sometimes i feel like i could break it just by holding itcontrols
it may just be me but i hate all of playstations controls
they suck
i hate the dpad and the analogue stick give my hand crampsgames
sports racing puzzle and more sports
proof that the psp is for casual gamers
all the other games belonging to other genres arent worth playing either
not to mention some are rehashes of games already one the ps
come on now why waste time playing a handheld when you can be playing on a console or better yet a pcmultimedia feautes
they are crap and completely unnecessary
they just eat up the battery life and your wallet
there are other cheaper much better electronics that specialize in these arearscost
this is the big one
the value pack comes with crap and it still costs me 
rip off
and thats only for the unit
a game cost around  alone
i listen to about  gig of music daily so throw away another  for a memory stick
and if i wanted to get a umd like an idiot thatd be another 
so thats  and im being modest here for such a faulty product
ridiculousthere are other minor slights that i have with the psp but theyre passable
i truly do not recommend this to anyone
not now anyway
wait a few years until the price goes down sony fixes the mistakes with this product and there are games actually worth playing
so that means you can rule out purchasing this fiasco forever
dont give into sonys greedy exploits
dont buy the pspok you expect me to pay  of my hard earned money to buy something that malfunctions
then you have to buy the memory stick all the games and movies and a case
this is not cheap
the system is more than a ps the games cost more than a ps
give me a break
it looks fun but it isnt close to being worth what you have to pay
i like sony and i like the ps but cmon
this is a rip offlet me start off by saying that i do not own a sony psp
i do however know all the specs and so forth
i do own a nintendo ds and i could not be happier with it
because i do not own a psp let me just compare the specifications products available etc
screens
the ds has two
the ds has a touch screen
so what if the psps screen is bigger than either one of the dss
no matter how hard you push on that great big screen it just isnt going to do anything
except break
products
let me divide this into three categoriesa
games
while i admit the ds does not have the greatest selection of games yet it still has a better selection than the psp
i do happen to be a sportsgame person but if i wasnt i would probably be bored to tears by  of the psp games
and besides what good is a handheld game system without that beloved little red plumberb
movies
if you dont like spider man you probably wont find any good movies for the psp
if you do like spider man youll find exactly one
wow
go buy yourself a gba sp and a nice portable dvd player for about the same price  and you can watch all the movies you want and play a better selection of games to bootc
with your psp you can hold about six songs
whoopie
one for each day of thei meanwell maybe you can fit seven really short songs
buy yourself a ds and an ipod  and carry  songs and a great gaming system with you wherever you go
price
which is less  or 
this isnt rocket science people
durability
ok i know i said i was only going to talk about specs and products but an issue this major deserves at least a little discussion
an incredible number of the psp owners i have talked to read their reviews etc
have had problems with breakage or dead pixels
i dont know about you but if i am going to shell out  for anything i expect it to last for at least a week
this goes double for those with young children in their household if you expect your psp to not get broken you better chain it to your bed
or just save  and get the much sturdier and childfriendly dsin closing i would like to thank nintendo for an absolutely awesome ds experience
to all you psp people good luck with the pixel thing and be sure to save your receiptswell i bought the psp because the graphics are nice
but i became frustrated with the lack of games and the short battery life so i traded it in for store credit and got a ds
i thought it would be cool to watch umd movies and play music but i didnt end up using it that much as i have a portable dvd player and the umd titles arent that numerous
the clincher was when i found out that nintendo was releasing the playyan in late  which allows ds users to watch mpeg movies and play mps
plus the games are so much better on the ds with many more great ones to come
the dss graphics arent as good and im not too fond of the touch screen but with games like jump superstars castlevania nintendogs new super mario brothers etc
and the ability to play gba games legend of zelda the minish cap mario and luigi superstar saga etc
the ds is a much much better handheld in my opinion
and its battery lasts x as longlets face it the ds is a new innovative system
it may not have the best grafics but it will have some new fun interesting games
the psp on the other hand is just an upgrade on the gba just better grafics
no new content
nothin
zip
nadais the psp really worth that 
honestly why get a psp when you have a psand if you dont have one get one now cause its cheaper then the psp
devil may cry
metal gear
viewtiful joe
need for speed and tony hawk
havent i seen these game before
the psp is just sequalsrehashedremade games of past ps or ps games that you have a better time playing on a consolesony is just trying to rip you people off
plus the psp games are just way too overpriced
 bucks for a game
a portable game
get real
pspa cheap way for sony to get but hey this is just my opinion i could be wrong and please peopledont overract to my comment just because im speaking my mind
so dont flame me just because im being harsh on my opinionother then thatget or or dontin my mind its just mini versions of ps gameswhat a disappointment
the nintendo ds is something of a joke and now the psp comes out and its worse
the consoles setup is simply ugly
when you glance at it it looks fine but why must there be buttons up and down the system  with features that could just as easily be on a menu screen
and why is the system so fragile
and lastly why doesnt it work
i inserted a disc into the first psp i bought and the machine spit it out shattering the disc
i exchanged the game and the psp went home and experienced the dreaded dead pixels
with two broken psps i decided to cut my losses since i cant return the game and return the system
the psp did have potential but it turned out all wrong
if sony wanted it to work as an ipod they should have included a bigger memory card
does anyone feel like paying another  for memory after paying  for a console
if sony wanted to make a portable system they should have gone with cartridges or flash memory something the nintendo ds got right
if they wanted it to play movies the most unneeded feature ever seen in a portable gaming system  they should gotten out of the gaming business and went into selling portable dvd players bigger screens better picture and they play the dvds you already own
the proprietary game and movie discs  which are grossly overpriced the movies have no extras the games are  more than ds or gba games  burn the batteries out fast
i played for just over  and a half hours when the batteries died the pixels were dead from the beginning
sony  when are you going to get some quality control folks at hq
a quarter of the pss first released were broken including the first one i bought
the psp is deja vu all over again
id like to say the nintendo ds is a nice alternative but with its horrible ergonomics holding it with your left hand while trying to use the stylus with your right becomes painful after a few minutes and lack of decent games i just cant
right now id say hold off on both systems and stick to the gameboy advance
if you feel you must own a new handheld id take the ds over the psp being that they both pretty much suck but at least the ds is durable and isnt broken out of the box and is  cheaper and  less per game title
plus the stylus on the ds makes for incredibly fun gameplay when done right which it rarely is  if you can handle the pain youll be feeling in your hands and arms after a few minutes
for comfort i would have to give the psp a higher rating than id give the ds
it wasnt bad to hold onto
if it actually worked and had some decent titles it may even be a keeper
as things are id say wait until november when the new gameboy comes out rumor has it it will be able to play gamecube games directly and pick one up
if youre still set on buying a psp id wait a few more months until sony gets them working properly
by that point the price will have also dropped im guessing theyll be  to compete with the next gameboys  price tag in novemberi couldnt stand playing this game
the physics blow and the controls dont offer enough customization
ive played tons of racing and car combat games most of which use the x button for acceleration and the square button for brakes
there is no option in tm that allows the use of the square button for braking
because of this i never felt fully in control of my vehicle
couple that with terrible physics and you have yourself a really lame playing experienceif youre looking for car combat on your psp i highly recommend you crack your software and run the old vigilante  ps games
vigilante  has superior controls and physics compared to twisted metalplease save your money and dont buy this game
first of all the story mode is beatable in about  minutes
you could be playing and accidently enter a code
yeah thats righ  times its happened to me
near the end boss i was playing and i accidently entered inf life without knowing
and later on inf ammo and i had no clue about the codes
this game gets boring really fast and it takes wayyy too long to kill one single enemie on here
the game isnt worth the buy nor the rent
save your moneyfirst off let me explain i am posting this as a  review
that being said this game simply doesnt hold up to games as of now the acceleration is dependent of you pressing up on the directional pad and the targeting system s flawed to the point of being a targeting system of machine guns
sure there are homing missiles here and there but i think this game is better left as a distant memory of how fun it was on ps
i have fond memories of playing this on ps and playing with every character storyline no doubt by todays standards in the late s i wouldve received a platinum trophy for my achievements but sadly this game also shadows how far we have come in modern gamingif you must rekindle yesteryear by all means buy it but go into it with a very skeptical heart and not the newfound hope of rekindling yesteryear
i know ive used rekindle too many times so rekindle your bank account and buy need for speed on pspdo not get me wrong
i am never more delighted than when i find a fun actionpacked creative and intuitive platformer
any mario game will do
ape escape could not be worse
terrible graphics terrible control boring gameplay
did the developers decide thay were going to be creative by developing a game that threw out all of the core mechanics of a great platformerbottom line  skip this one
is it fun
not at all
will i keep it
nope
is it for kids
well it has monkeys but that is about ityes i wasthis is nothing new just so psp has something cause of the sony rockstar relationshipi am really waiting for the next gen gta
i have been pondering the posibility of what can be done on it for a while and im sure rockstar is ready to step the game up to a new levelits supposed to be the killer app for the dying psp
oops
i had hope for this one because vice city was the only good gta game gtaiii and san andreas very overrated and very poorly done
im afraid this one is quite disappointing although its graphics are almost as good as the horrible san andreass the worst ps graphics of any game
many people who held on to their psps hoping it would get better are now in line at their local video games store trading them in for the much superior nintendo ds and a pack of gum
the psp is dead in the water and the xbox  just might do the same to the ps and its hardtoprogramfor architecture
sony the new segai purchased it banking on that it wouldnt freeze like others said it did
damn just when i reach the rd inning it froze
it didnt let me even eject it at first i pulled the game out and it kept playing the music even without the game placed insidei give it  not because of the game itself the game is a classic but the people who created it for the psp really made it glitchy unplayable
darn shame for a great game like this onethis game is so bad it hurts
all you do is pop puyos whatever those are it has bad single player but good multiplayer
dont buy it it is not goodman this  game from the big corporation called electronic arts totally stinks
its got some of the worst car racing physics ive ever seen and the controls are totally userunfriendly
the cars handle like crazy and the ai
of the computercontrolled racers is totally uneven and takes away the last bit of fun from this game
dont waste your  on a crappy game like this
im already very pissed i wasted  renting it from blockbuster
even though i could have kept it for two weeks i returned it after less than one
this game truly sucks big timeif you want a good racer for the psp check out ridge racer which admittedly is a different kind of racing experience but at least its got good car physics models in it
or just wait for the release of gran turismo or burnoutno one paid much attention to the requirements operating system windows  windows xp pc and they mean it
wont run on new machines without jumping thru all kind of hoops
and even then its only a maybyewhile it does look like a really great game good luck getting it to run
and since its discontinued there is no support eitherslap my wrist for buying this game new
i should have waited  months
i couldnt find any support online for the bugs and when i finally got everything working i forgot to turn my virus software off plus you cant have a screensaver on either  you have to turn off background animations  shadows within the game and it jacked up my computer big time
wait awhile for them to fix this before buying it unless you like being ticked offthis game is ridiculous
a complete waste of money
absolutely no fun factor at all
everyone i know who has this game tells me there must be something wrong with their version because the graphics are all messed up and it only plays half the time on their computer
hmmmmmmmfour different people all with different discs complaining about the discs being defective
this game is obviously garbageive played prison tycoon for about two days now and i already want to break the disc in half
when the game does decide to work about  of the time its no fun whatsoever
you cant navigate the screen anywhere which makes it impossible to see anything  the other controls are just as awful this game ranks in the top five most boring games of all time
i cant even get the cheat codes to work
buying this game was one of the stupidest things ive ever done
do not waste your money on this lame worthless pathetic trashi totally agree with the guy before me
this was awful
i think the one part that bugs me the most is you cant rotate the camera angles
that is really irritating because it seems like you need to during game play
very boring game and the graphics could be betteri dont recommend this gamei enjoy some of the other titles from the tycoon set of games so i thought this would be as much fun as roller coaster tycoon and some of the others
i couldnt have been more wrongfirst of all this game does not come with an instruction booklet or anything that would help you learn to play or even what keys do what
i had to scroll through a readme file just to figure out some of the most basic things and then i had to search through online walkthroughs to learn how to play
very time consumingnext the game just isnt that much fun
if you are able to build and manage a prison at a low custody level without problems can be done then just make sure not to make even one mistake
thats all it will take to get a riot started that will go on and on despite any logical responsesin short this game has a good concept but poor designnot recommended to any avid gamerafter seeing it on various store shelves staring at me i figured id give it a spinprison tycoon sounds like a pretty cool concept build a prison your way making it as hard or soft on prisoners as you want while dealing with riots and other cool stuff
but the concept behind this game is where the coolness endsalthough its a budget title the interface and sound outright suck and the game gets repetative waaaay too quick
the graphics are passable but in no way compensate for the games other brutal shortcomings
the game has cool building and customization options but they are too few and too blandwhat could have been a pretty awesome budget title turned into a gigantic dud
dont touch this waste of time with a foot pole unless you just had a lobotomy and enjoy sitting at your computer with a blank stare
for a better budget tycoontype experience pick up rct or tropicopros awesome fresh concept for a tycoon gamecons gameplay graphics sound interface etc etcoverall an unfortunate waste of time and money on what could have otherwise been a potentially great gamewell first of all i have to give this game a very low rating because it seems to me you have to use the money cheat just to get started in the game
otherwise you will wind up not even having enough money to house the inmatessecondly all this game consists of is pretty much waiting for the next parole period to come up so you can decide who stays and who gets out based on length of time inmate has been there how many rehabilitation projects hes completed how many fights hes been in and what if any gang affiliations he has
theres really nothing you can do about the fighting that goes on in this game between inmates
i have yet to see a guard break up a fight
so to me this game is just long and boringthe graphics in my opinion are kinda cute but not  worththeir are bad gamesbut this is just crazy
its ridiculus
whats really cool about this gameis that people like it
i cant even draw pacman
you have to be absoulute perfect with the drawing
dont buy itits not worth itbeing a fan of light rpgs i picked up this game because the allure of having an rpglight on a portable system was just too great
i wound up regretting that decisionif you like the baldurs gate dark alliance game then you should ike this one too
other than that theres nothing to be said about this
while i didnt play far enough into the game to have a lot of the story uncovered it seems to be the standard generic rpg tale
the maps were also standard and generic
the monsters player classes spells etc
are also generic
in other words there is nothing compelling about this gameheres an example of how bland this game is
psp games have the ability of displaying an animated menu item in the psps home menu
besides an animated button that you can select to launch the game a game can also alter the psps background desktop so that when a game is highlighted the background changes to a theme relating to the game
lumines and dynasty warriors both have this design feature
if either game is in the psp and you highlight the button you get background visuals automatically
its quite remarkable and very appealing
with untold legends though all you get is a text button and no extra frills
the developer wanted to release something quick using a known formula and did not bother to add in any features to distinguish it from other gamesi really regret spending the money on this gamei am a huge metal gear solid fan and i have every metal gear gamei thought woah a new metal gear gameso i got it i didnt want to play it for an hourit is reduced to a card gamea pethetic card game and the story lines take you about  minutsthis is mostly reading not a gamejust bought this game an hour agothis game sucks
entrusting in the metal gear franchise i decided that this would be a good action game for my new portable system
wrong
its a card gamei wanted metal gear not yougeeo
this game is so cheaply made
this game does not at all take advantage of the psps graphical power
the cut scenes are nothing but pictures and text
no voices no animation
the gameplay is boring and not at all intriging
now i cant bring it back cause its software
i got ripped offmy only hope is if the company has a recall on such a horrible gamethanks konamithis is a very small game  something like  megabytes  and they want fifteen bucks plus shippingits not a very good game  the words you can make are necessarily very simplistic and consequently redundantmoreover a little web searching and you can find plenty of similar games for freeforget itsony must have thought people wouild buy any original platformer property to arrive on the completely nonoriginal gaming console of the psp
they were right
i bought it for that reason
this game is aweful
terrible camera dumb premise nonfun action monotonous gameplay
memo to sony quit rushing games out the door
take your time and put out at least an average gamebottom line  is it fun
if you like hacking and slashing in the most monotonous way possible
will you keep it
ebayed already
is it for kids
nope
too hard of controls and tons of gorepro stick duo sds for the psp can be bought at    and  gigs and probably higher and theyre all generally under  dollars
the only thing this piece of junk is worth is to save game data
the psp holds videos music entire downloaded games from psp network etc
i suppose if this was a dollar with free shipping i might suggest it for someone who only wanted to play games on their pspdont bother these things shouldnt even exist anymore at this data sizei liked the original tetris
not to complex pretty addicting
i even liked bust a move
so with all the good reviews of this game i thought id give it a spin
i did and regretted it immediately
this is way to complex to catch on in any similar fashion to tetris
your grandma could play tetris or bust a move
she will never get this gamebottom line  polarity blows this one out of the water on the ds
will i keep it
nope
is it for kids
nope
too complexthis game is basically a joke
its a puzzle game thats like tetris only much less fun
back in the gameboy era this might have been a good title but today its just cant keep up
graphics and sound are amazingly bad but much of that is the fault of the psp not just the game
psp is very underpowered
also the battery life on the psp when playing this game is just terrible you practically have to play right next to a power outletsome people are using this game to illegally downgrade their firmware
i personally know two people who bricked their psps trying to do this so i suggest you do not attempt this
just stay away from this awful game and the joke of a console that is the pspim sure this is a great game from the reviews but unfortunately it does not play on vista and lets you know it is only for xp
tried different modes but no go
hope they can update the game
ive been lucky and able to play older games on vista but not this onethis was not a good game at all
it is old and accomodates old graphics cards and drivers and not the ones used today
i think it is time for the seller to retire this throw it out and cut your losses before they get a reputation for selling old stuff that does not work welli just got so frustrated with this pos i just twisted the films into thin string and threw them away no way i can get my money back now because i just could not get rid of the damned lint
this thing attracts lint like you wouldnt believe
both films
im ordering somemore because im a glutton for punishment
next time im applying the film outside under a plastic tarp
i just have to give it  star because this stuff is impossible if you live in a linty home and if you shed skin and invisible body hair which includes all humansif other products are like this then these things suck and theres no way for them to get better since they rely on static electricity
gdi
i just couldnt believe it
what an instant waste of  i could have spent on food or somethingcome on
this game is bad
dont waist your time with it
heck medieval total war is ten times better than this and it is about  years old nowthere are much better rtstactical games out now
my advise try rome tw a great game no castle sieges but ancient cities are there
or wait until empire earth  comes out today
these titles will not disapoint as this title did
now if you will excuse me i gotta see if i can return this lemon to the store for my refundi guess when it comes to computer games sequals are always much worse than the original
they always take the novel fun concept of the original and ruin it by adding tons of complications to it
thats the case here more complex dosnt mean more funall the new features are ok in theory but of course very few of them actually work the way theyre supposed to
even after patching to  sometimes ill get piles of gong all over the castle while my gong farmers just stand around doing nothing
the only fix for this seems to be deleting all my structures and then starting overthe first stronghold focused mainly on defense with only a few attack missions
i found that to be a very nice change of pace i dont recall any game that ever focused purely on defense before
of course the second one seems to mainly be an attack based game
the castles arent nearly as strong as they were in the first one
most siege weapons can destroy even the strongest castle in a matter of seconds as well as your brave defenders now
but the gameplay and features of the game are moot points the big problem is the game flat out dosnt workthe d graphics suck lets face it
im not really picky about graphics but whats strikes me is that the graphics are very pooryet the game runs like its doom freaking  lots of waiting times and choppyness
in fact the game itself can take upwards of around  minutes just to boot up
this is on a high end gaming computer as wellwhat really upsets me though is i tried playing the game all the way through even though i didnt really enjoy it all that much
i got about halfway and then suddenly the game just started crashing every  seconds on a particular mission
i wrote tech support and after about a week of writing back and forth their only suggestion was to reinstall the game
i did that started all over enjoying it even less this time and when i got to that mission again i found it still crashed
as it is now the game is completely unplayable and ive given up
i really do feel as if ive been robbed of all in all im completely sick of companies that sell these games that theyre not even finished building
this sort of thing really has dissuaded me from purchasing any pc games anymorethis was a piece of total garbage and a horrid looking tumor for the sega genisis
the piece of crap requires its own large ac adapter etc just like the genisis it had crappy games and had a history of breaking genisis games
this is laughable to look at and this and sega cd added nothing to the genisis system but it was a worthy try to match nintendothis was without a doubtthe biggest piece of junk that ever put a stain on the video game world
i remember i had one of these tumors as the other reviewer called it lolwhen i was about  yrs old
i remember this thing would not workunless i pushed down on itpushing it into the genesis consolealong with pushing the x cart inas well
if i didint do thisit wouldnt work at all
i thought maybe it was just my x
but it wasnt
i knew six other people who had this piece of shand theirs did the same thing
i remember picking one of these nightmares up at a local toys r us store for twenty bucksthinking what a great deal i was gettingi only got one thingand it sure wasnt a great dealjust a junky piece of crap that hardly workedi remember even trying to get the metal clamps on the genesiswas a major pain in the a
they sure scrapped my genesis all upafter trying to get the damn things offso i could return it to the storeavoid this worthless piece of plastic at all costsi decided to write this review pretty early but only because i want to save some people their money
its not that i hate the game but it really just doesnt have enough substance to make it a reccomendable purchasesomebody has found something to complain about with each rpg maker
rpg maker  for playstation was excellent yet people didnt like spending so much time creating games
the game also had some weird problems
sometimes certain triggers would not work even though i spent hours inspecting them
still it was a fun game to play and it looked and sounded great for a d game
rpg maker  was way too complicated
i dont mind spending time having to learn alot to play a game but some things in rpg maker  were ridiculous
if you wanted your attacks to do damage in a battle you had to make a trigger for your items and a trigger for your items triggers and then an attack trigger
it was a little too advanced
still some people had fun with itrpg maker  has improved on some old problems
alot of people complained about having no character portraits and they put them in this game
some of them match up with the characters however   of them do not look like the character models
that is another problem
there arent that many character models in the game
it is ridiculous as to how few people there are and how many towns i plan on creating
you will see the same people over and over again
also alot of those models dont look good for the characters i have in mind
i just want some normal looking adventurers yet many of the models are too strange looking
even worse your party will consist of the most stereotypical characters ever
personally i wanted a thief who could carry an axe
however
the only male character model that could carry an axe was a dwarf
if i want my guy to carry an axe into battle he has to be that dwarf model
if i want some dude to carry a sword into battle he can either look like a gladiator or charlton heston from benhur
to sum this up the character models are too limited and probably wont appeal to what you likemaking towns houses and field menus is easy
you can create some interesting places pretty simply
heres the problem with this feature you can only create so much towns
you cant create an epic rpg because you are limited to how much stuff you can create
plus the game takes like  memory
this is the most i have ever seen on a game
the second highest was grand theft auto for  memory
the game takes  memory per game you create
memory cards only come with  or so memory
 is ridiculouscreating events is like rpg maker  most of it is easy and it isnt nearly as complicated as rpg maker  the storytelling feature is interesting
you can only create a limited number of storytelling stuff though so that sucksthe controls in the game arent that good
you can only select options in the battle menu with the dpad
in the terrain editor mode the dpad moves too slow yet the analog stick moves real fast
to look around your character you can use the right analog stick yet it doesnt move fast enough
the worst part aobut the control scheme is walking
i shouldnt have to complain about walking but it is alot like resident evil
you can only move forward and turn around real slowly
if you hold down the analog stick as far as it can go your character will walk so fing slow
in order to sprint you have to hold the triangle button down
this is awful
it does not feel comfortable to hold triangle down
besides the triangle button is pressure sensitive
if you dont press down on it firmly it doesnt work
they screwed up because they made it so that you have to hold it down as far as it will go otherwise you wont runthe most striking problem of all if you dont want to spend money on a keyboard for your playstation dont even bother buying this gamewait one more problem
many times in battle when you cast a spell your playstation will have to slow down and load for a second or two
you will notice this and say what the hell
i shot off a fireball and my system had trouble loading
it confuses me too but apparently this game cant even handle its crappy looking spell animationswait i found another problem
all the spell animations in the game look stupid
you can barely customize them and it isnt fun doing that
they should of used rpg maker s spell animation stuff because it was really fun and interestingto be honest this game just isnt worth  dollars
it can be good but it is so limited that eventually you wont care about how beautiful the terrain can look
if for  dollars you got the game a keyboard a memory cardbecause the game takes up a little over th of your memory cards memory a harddrivetheres a feature to use a hard drive because the game cant load up simple spell animations and a network card to download peoples games online the game might be worth itokay when i got this game i thought i know a story that wrote at the top of my head and i had the whole story wriiten out and everything problem was there was serouslly no chooes betwean like the faces hair body everything was messed up in that i thought okay they serouslly need to make a rpg maker on hopefully on pc or xbox  where u can create the chactrer u want to make and how u want them to look what ever u do dont get this game i would recomand rpg maker  if anythingffirst i love armored core but this omg waste of money no missons cant buy parts and costimizing leaves much to be disired very small maps ur outmatched dramaticly all they need is good missiles and ur helpless this game suxthe best thing about this game is that it starts with the letter a that way its near the top of the list when you go to addremove programs to delete it
i wanted to give it at least  stars for effort but i just cant bring myself to do it
im not a big fan of first person shooter games anyway but this one is pretty awful
the enemys aim is near perfect and you can get shot hundreds of times its cheesy and boring
after going a long way through it there is nothing at all that i can think of that makes this a fun game
the mutation stuff is stupid
the graphics are very good the sound is fair
its a very typical game reminds me a lot of quake  as far as the movement environment and all that jazz goes
all in all its a sad pathetic waste of timeim an orson scott card fan so i really wanted to like itbut its just a terrible game
the psychic powers are so overwhelming they feel like cheats
with several of the powers you can clear the entire screen of baddies once every two seconds or so for the entire game so the only way to have fun is to intentionally weaken yourself
the weapons are unsatisfying and a confusing chore to selectthe best thing about the flick targeting system is that you can ignore it
the baddies come in serious sam type waves to be mowed down by your double guns plus smartbomb psychic powers so precise targeting is pretty silly
navigating your character is frustrating
you can stand next to a platform youre supposed to grab onto and jump many times before your hands latch on to the edge
i died from that and the buggy jump controls more than from fighting the bad guysabout half the sound effects are flat out missing so many actions have little impact
overall the game feels very untested and buggy
the story is kinda cool but very lightweight next to cards novels
the characters maintain their same flippant attitude no matter how many of their own people die around them
if youre used to playing quality fps games like hl fear call of duty etc you will be disappointedapparently you cant play epic games anymore on pc because of windows  so installing this classic was a waste of my timebased on other reviews i had at least moderate expectations for this game
i was very disappointed
the voice acting was not good
i have played games with worse but not many
the plot was thin but acceptable
the puzzles were generally acceptable but often required going back again and again to old places and pixel hunt for objects that had become active since the first time or second or third you were there
the worst part was that the game play crawled
many times you had to just wonder around waiting for the game to decide that enough time had elapsed for a character to finish a task and allow you to interact with them againthis game is protected by star force
you will be unable to play this on most systemsout of control and outdated
i pretty much never throw a game into the garbage but this one was even cutup first then i through it in there so nobody at the dump can get sad from playin it
the warriors art work is the only good thing about the game
the control is what makes me hate it because you cannot move around easily when fighting like all the other gamesi was playing madden  and thought it was time to upgrade im so sorry i did
i wont repeat what everyone has said about the horrible new qb system but i found a number of other features very annoyingand absent
why cant we turn off the annoying salary cap
if we want to make a superteam let us
after all we paid way to much for this game alreadyikaruga is one of those games that comes along kicks incomprehensible amounts of ass but nobody notices because everyones too busy playing idiotic football games
i dont get it they repackage the same damn football games every year update a few stats call it a new game and millions of suckers keep buying them
whats the point
why not just go outside and play real football instead
or even better yet get bent
nobody likes football
maddoxever since grand theft auto iii came out the position of videogames in pop culture has gone up tremendously
games are about to topple movies as the leading form of entertainment
filmmaker uwe boll has made several absoultely terrible gamebased movies
what was once seen as a geeky hobby has now becomes one of the coolest things you can dothis in my opinion is a terrible development
one of the best advantages to being a game geek was that it got you as far away from the jocksprepscheerleaders as you possibly could and now those exact same popular kids are the ones buying psxboxgcs and popping games into itgames like the madden series along with  of all other ea games are the exact reason why this has happened
ea makes games that appeal to these lowlifes and as a result the preps now play video games
they are sure to load every one of their games with all sorts of prepfriendly devices such as mainstream rap soundtracks lots of glitter and bling and all sorts of totally pimp slang so that they look intune with the current pop cultureneed for speed underground ii and nba live are two perfect examples of this atrocity
however football games in particular are guilty of this because every type of popular kid can find something in one that relates to them in real life
jocks like football games because they play football
cheerleaders like football games because they participate in them even though cheerleading is boring to watch and it doesnt have any effect on a football teams morale
preps who arent associated with either of these like them because they go to high school football games because their sense of school spirit tells them to
you might be able to put marching band into this category except for the fact that they participate in that for their love of music not for their love of footballof course the real video game players will always look towards the japanese rpgs niche games and platformers that no prep would ever go near but thats not the point
what is is that the fact that football games inspire preps to get into gaming is just annoying and destroys individuality
why cant they just stay where they belongif you think that the music you listen to is the best because its the most popular buy this game
if you go to parties on the weekend so you can get drunk off ur ass buy this game
if you shop at abercrombie and fitch or hollister for your clothes buy this game
if youre a real gamer who agrees with this review then for the love of god do not buy this gamei waited online at midnight to get this madden
i tweaked the rosters adjusted the players numbers then started playing
the best thing one can say about the qb vision control is that you can immediately turn it off
too bad every time on defense you have to watch the computer use it
this madden is a clone of last years madden besides the stupid superstar mode and the useless qb vision which you might never even play because everyone knows franchise is where its at
oh yeah even the repetitive tony bruno is back to ensure you hit the mute button every time you go to your roster
ncaa for the last two years is so much better than madden its not even debatable
they fixed the small problems in last years ncaa but added the equally useless race for the heisman and all i can say is play ncaa then play maddenthen you like i did will be placing your madden on ebay soon afterwardswow ea really tricked me into buying this pathetic excuse for a game
wow i see alot of people have experienced the shutting down and the freezing of the game as well as i do
i completed  teams in one francise mode training camp and then the whole system shuts down blacks out and the system gets turned off
seriously what the fk
i didnt even get to save it
i had to do the whole thing all over again
also during gameplay when i was kicking a field goal the kicking meter turns transparent and when i tried to snap the ball the ball refused to snap
what is this
really how can i play this game when the ball doesnt even snap
commentary is awful and tends to be very bad
sometimes when im playing all you hear is al michaels and no madden
what gives with that
another thing is that got me pretty upset was no instant replay or a replay option so you wont be able to see any of the big hits or nice plays that you do
how bad is that
no replays at all
no challenges no hit stick no playmakers no qb vision cone
i mean cmon
its like a mixture of madden  and  broken to parts
also when you run to score touchdowns the game would freeze for a second then continue
and i thought mvp was bad this is horrible
ill admit the game is fun with the mini camp and the gameplay is decent but tons of bugs are in it and alot of the features that are in madden  for ps and xbox are not there
i bet you ea didnt even test this cuz if they did they would have experienced the shutdown and the kicking metertruely unacceptabledo not buy this game
the game will shutdown your psp at random times during game play
the kicking will not showup  of the time during kickoffs and fieldgoals
the game also will freeze right as you cross the goalline on touchdowns and turnovers
this game should have never been released with all these bugsthis game contains many bugs
the game will crash while you are saving it causing you to have to start over from the begining
the game will crash if you get a high score
the game will crash just about any time it feels like it
i have played this game for about  hours and have had  catastrophic failuresea clearly wanted to get this game out before the nfl season was over but unfortunately that means that they skipped qai was planning on purchasing their nba game but now i definately will notokay honestly if you are expecting a portable version of madden to play that is at all equivalent to the console version you have at home do not buy this game
it is not even close to the madden  available for console gaming
the load times are attrociously horrible
i mean horrible
the graphics are like stepping back to the last ps version of madden
compared to other ea sports games for the psp like the  nba basketball game madden is nothing close
nothing close at allnot to mention the freezingthe game freezes for roughly  seconds everytime the following events take placea touchdown is scoredan interception is madea th down is forceda fumble occursoh yeah and also literally  the time that you try to make a kick the power meter either fails to show up and you have to call a timeout in order to reload because the game frozeor if it does show up its only  way visible and it is darn near impossible to make your kick with any power or accuracy
this game is all around pitiful
exceptno its not i cant have pity on something that is inexcusably horrible
please do not buy this game
save your money for something else because this madden is absolutely no fun to play
no fun at allthe makers of madden the last two years need to be immediately fired and replaced with the makers of ncaa football as it has been a significantly superior football game compared to the debacles that madden has been
the xbox version of madden as we all know is x better than the ps version
if you are interested in buying madden just be forewarned and dont play ncaa football firstif you do youll be unable to play madden afterwards because its just not good enough compared to the dominating ncaa
superstar mode is dumb and will never get played because everyone plays franchise same mistake made in ncaa with the heisman mode
the qb vision thingwell dont even get me started
its that bad
and tony bruno shows up for yet another year making sure youll have your remote control next to you while playing madden so you dont have to listen to him repeat himself every seasonhey guys its yet another madden title
the same as 
yep
ea makes the same crap over and over
espn sold better then madden last year becuase  it was a better game also was rated higher in  of ratings
better graphics and acurate models
that is why they bought the licencse to the nfl
beecuase if they didnt espn would sell better again this yearif ea sees failure they find the quickest way out
they do not improve their game they buy a license so that they do not have to improve their game
pethetic
madden is lame and ea is a retarded game maker
all ea games are bad and cheap
get espn  becuase its better then this lame title
why spend  on the exact same damn game as the other yearsthis game sux period point blankthis game is for little kids it is so poor the graphics are bad the running is bad the passing is bad it looks very unrealisticbring back nfl k series please those where so much better madden is for little kids who want an easy game to play its the most unrealistic sports game next to all of the new basketball games which suck tooi mean honestly were the develporers high when they made this
i mean please tell me
you do  levelscityruins and i cant even remember the other one because its so stupid
the graphics are okay for a handheld but wow you do the same thing over and over and is fun for maybe  minutes
dont buy this game
everyone likes different types of games so if theres nothing else at the rental store then rent it but do not buy it because this game sucksbuy this only if youre crazy for fps gameplay and cant live without it for psp
awkward controls no matter how theyre configured and difficult but incredibly repetative game play make this a loser
wait for doom or another welldone gamei went out and watched the narnia movie and liked it
so i thought i would like the game too i was wrong
this game is really lame and dumbhere are some of the reasons i dont like this game
many of the missions stink
for example the first mission you run around your house in london and break down doors to try to find your family
it also goes so in dept it is dumb
like it take about  minuets to get to the beavers dam
its just not fun
you dont use the mouse
normally you use the mouse a lot
in this game you never use the mouse
you have to use keys on the keyboard to attack ect
it is also very hard to move around because your view keeps changing
the game comes with the discs only
no installing help no game info it comes with nothing
that is really lame
you cant even get weapons for a long time
you cant even fight you just run around and hide from ms macredy
it is really poorly disined
the view of your character keeps switching and zomeing in and out
one minute you will be right next to your character the next youre be a long way away and can beraly see you characterrating it each sectiongraphics  the garphics can sometimes be bad
most of the time there finesound  awsome sound
thats the only good thing about the gamecontrols  just awful totaly terrible
you never use the mouse so its close to inpossible to move around even with a gamepadgameplay  wow its hard to describe how bad it is
let me put it this way there are gamers who like fpf first pereson fighting fps first person shooting and cc comand and conquernomater what you like of the three listed types i bet you will hate this game
just awfuloverall  sound awsom
graphics okay
everything else is terriblei strongly suggest that you save your money and buy some other game
if you like fanticy sword fighting i suggest that you get lord of the rings the return of the king
that is much better
i liked the movie i liked the books
but the game
this is the worst game i have ever played
i you may have noticed not many other people liked it either
do not buy this gamemikey lamb wiinstalling this cover is really hard and found itimpossible to remove the air bubbles on the screeni ended up throwing the protector away because ofmy finger printsbuy a nice shammie because this product is a waistof moneyi recieved this cover in a damaged condition and after emailing jr about this they have yet to respond to my email about a replacement or a return
i will never do buisness with them again
maybe ill try to get another hori from a differnt retailerthis is worth  or  if you pay more than that like i did then you are loosing your moneythis just arrived in the mail and i applied it to my sons psp
after applying the protector i was shocked to find out how easy it was to scratch this screen protector
not with my finger but with the actual cleaning cloth that came with it
this screen protector isnt even worth  bucks
no joke right out of the gate it was smudged and scratched and was entirely from wiping it with the cloth
now heres the catch with the psp turned on and while my son was playing a game you couldnt see the issues with the screen guard
dark scenes in a game show it but overall  you cant see it
its only when its turned off that this thing turns into an ugly ducklingi would avoid purchasing this protector unless you totally dont care what it looks like while turned off or dark scenes in a game
its not resistant to scratches or smudges at allthis was a decent game at one time
there were a slew of bugs and there was a lot of boring stuff to deal with but there was something unique about it all
it was just amazing fun
the breadth of the planets the professions the experiences was great
it may also have been what killed swg
the developers never seemed all that competent and were certainly badly understaffed
but it was still a great community and i had a lot of fun playing every night for a yearnow i cant stand the ground game
one of the things that made swg so unique was the real focus on noncombat characters
you could make money have fun talk with friends and spend all your time working in a variety of professions without killing anything
you were an important part of the swg world
combat classes were a little stale and repetitive but after s few weeks of grinding you could defend yourself against most things and engage in the highend content which was survivable with a groupnow combat classes have been all screwed up
some sort of weird arbitrary system has been imposed that looks more like magicthe gathering cards than the multiprofession blends we had before
in other words if you are class a you can defeat creature b and c but not d  you have to be class e to kill creature d but creatures b and c can easily kill you
its stupid
and unless you are a bounty hunter or rifleman your goose is pretty much cooked if you try to solo  which you will because the servers are so dead now there is no one to group with some nightsand the noncombat classes
completely wrecked
doctors had a number of roles
true they had become glorified buffbots but that was just a balance issue buffs were too strong
instead of a minor fix wham
down comes the nerfhammer and doctors are useless except in combat where they are dead ducks unless they also take the time to grind out a combat class or two
entertainers
the devs couldnt think up anything good for them so they became true afk buffbots
rather than tweak that system wham they are useless now
crafters
absolutely vital to the economy
someone has to make all this junk that gets used
instead of doing a little tweaking to armor and guns making them gated like spaceships are and some other things wham
they still craft though a lot of their goods and resources are now useless costing millions of credits but the cu has had the i am sure unexpected effect of making them as helpless as babies outside their doors where they have to go to collect resources
so now instead of a crafter specializing in a couple of crafting branches for variety and more fun they can only do one branch and must grind a few combat roles just so they can go to their mineral resource collector without getting killed by a pack of wild rabbitsconsequently people playing crafters are gone
doctors are gone
entertainers are gone
even some combat roles that got seriously nerfed like teras kasi are gone
smugglers and creature handlers and bioengineers have been long gone
there will be nothing but bounty hunters and riflemen and jedis soon
and the jedis really got borked in the cu as well
they are extremely weak early yet must make themselves very visible  and with all the bh classes they dont last for a day
so jedis will leave
then bhs have no targets
will it be a riflemans galaxy when all is said and donethe only thing that kept me in so far and i have cancelled my account it runs out in  days is jump to lightspeed
the missions are boring unrealistic and repetitive the ai is dull and simplistic the ship movement is slow and kludgy and the physics are astoundingly bad even for a reasonably intelligent high school grad
but its still fun to fly around with a few mates and blow things up
and the multiplayer ships are cool
completely useless and unplayable in any sense but still a cool ideaand that is the moral of my long story star wars galaxies was and is if la will fire soe and make swg ii a great idea with lots of cool original and unique ideas tried in a halting fashion
but so much was poorly designed badly implemented untested and never fixed correctly
the entire emphasis of the dev team has been on maximizing shortterm profits by working on expansion packs instead of fixing issues by adding inane graphical geegaws instead of fixing issues and by ignoring the customers
the result has become over  months an unplayable messif you want good roleplaying alternatives some people say everquest ii or world of warcraft though friends tell me the bloom is off those titles as well and eq ii seems to be on the same path as swg
if you want spacebased action and an interesting economy try eve online which is where i have switched my money
its complicated and starts a little slow but the graphics are astounding the gameplay deep and the dev team very interactive with the customer fanbasethey took a very fun game with tons of depth and turned it into junk
not even worth playing nowi am not veteran of the game and have only played it for two months so i cannot criticise the cu as i have no experience of it before that
however i found the game rather enjoyable with its vast scope and addictive complexityonline gamers vary from really helpful giving advice etc to complete sink plungers who arent helpful but this is the case for most games on the netthe game can be quite frustrating at times being killed by a butterfly long dull tasks etc however the game was enjoyable enough to warrant a monthly feehowever the revamp on november  or around that time has made the game unplayable literallybefore the game lagged slightly in places crowded environments but was bearable
now the player angle has changed so it is halfthird person and halffirst person not that i minded too much but now the game is unplayable in that it not only jerks but resembles a slow slideshow
i have a geforce  fx patched uptodate amd   a gig of ram
not the best pc on offer but it can play all my other online games really well
i am still in the same galaxy but now since the revamp it has made the game sour i cant even play it long enough to know what else has changedmaybe i am a oneoff and other people have no problems
but if you are not too sure download the  day free trial a sure sign by developers and producers that things are not going well and see for yourself
if you like it buy it and enjoy it
if you dont then you have saved yourself a tiny fortunetry the free trial first and see for yourselfwhat was once a great game has been dummed down in a completely pathetic attempt at enhancing the gameive been playing this game on and off for the past year
generally i have been satisfied with my gaming experience
there have always been problems with the sony online entertainment development team introducing game patches which have altered the game to a serious extent
however nothing in the past compares with the new game enhancement introduced on nov  before nge players were able to pick up to a mix of three professions out of over twenty possible professions
many professions would complement each other and others would be completely different
the whole idea about hybrid professions was to perfect your character to your liking
you could be an architect and a marksman if you wanted
my character was a mix of a master bounty hunter master caribener and part combat medic
the twenty odd professions allowed for every character to become unique
every person who played was different and it added an insane amount of diversity to the gamenow there are only nine professions
in the old system you were able to pick the skills you wanted to learn by picking them from a skill tree
now with the nge you can not pick what skills you want to learn you must follow a predetermined path similar to that of a console game
there is no longer diversity everyone will be one of  professions thats it
of course with the addition of the jedi to a starting profession it can almost be gaurenteed that the new players will almost always start off as a jediproducers of the game have gone to extereme measures to let the public know that the players have been asking for such changes and are greatly excited about their new experience
julio torres one producer who has published a letter on the star wars galaxies website stating the player base asked for this
if any of the producers took a moment to see what their customers wanted ie
the forums they would realize the public outcry is against their new gaming experiencethe user interface is also one of the worst ever made
usually people will type messages to tell their buddies what to do during an attack while their attacks are in queue with the old toolbar
now you had to continuously point and click the target to attack them
this makes the game more action packed
this way of attacking prevents users from easy chatting during an attack and also gives you a headache withing minutes of running around or in circles
if you get motion sickness i recommend you take dremimineif you were a previous player looking to continue most of your items will be useless as the stats have changed
one weapon i paid one million credits for is now work just about two thousand credits
the states have beenwell it is no longer an adequete weapon to fight a level  npcplayer run economy no longer exists as the item decay has been removed from the game
so now if you have a weapon it will never be damaged and you will never have to seek out a weaponsmith to repair it or to buy a new weapon
many of the items worth millions prenge are now worthless and entirely uselessthis game was pushed live with little preperation and the game experience greatly displays this
the game was buggy to begin with now the entire game has been rendered almost unplayable due to little prep times
if i were ever to recommend this game to someone i would recommend it only if they had extra money they didnt care about and if they had nothing left to do with their lives
other then that i would not recommend this game to anyonesony online entertainment has a lot of work to do to bring this game out of beta tesing
the people who are paying to play the game deserve a real game not a beta testcu killed swg
subscription numbers dont lie
the only people still playing are people who are riding out the remainder of their subscription periods its really that bad
i managed to overlook soes total bungling for a long long time but the cu even did me a hardcore star wars fan in
very sad to see such a strong franchise like star wars that was once a promising mmo swg get absolutely devastated like this one was by those idiots at soethe swg we loved even with its quirks and total lack of helpsupport from the morons at soe has been totally demolished
f you soewhat a joke
the cu killed this game
trust me save your money
people who love mmos left a long time agothe cu finally did in all those who love star wars and kept up hope that one day soe would get their act together
but unfortunately they just ensured the death of swg
well hopefully some time in the future a competent company can do a good star wars mmoyou can find the new game the star wars galaxies starter kit which was released after nearly  years of development time and nearly  years of that spent on live servers being paid for by subscribers to the game on amazon alsofrom alpha to beta and then back to alpha
maybe back again if enough myrmidons stay subscribed to finance soe through this rocky perioda very nice pistol the trandoshan hunting pistol which was a quest item included in this expansion as a special quest item that could be used until it decayed was broken or was sold made for a very nice jedi hunting weapon for bounty hunterswhat has the new patch changed in the previous statement
the trandoshan hunting pistol is no longer useable by bounty hunters but instead now by spies
since it was a biolinked weapon you cannot use it unless you want to be a spy instead of a bounty hunter
its irrelevant anyway as the pistol now does the same amount of damage as every other pistol in the game negating the    minute quest that it takes to get the pistol
the pistol no longer decays so you can use it forever  negating the crafting economy in the game
you can no longer hunt jedi in the game  and jedi are now a starting profession that  of the players are playing asi described a single quest item that i received from a quest i completed in the rage of the wookies expansion
ive given you  things that were immediately negated about it by the latest patch called the nge or new game enhancement   of my collected items had these new features that ruined them and the time spent collecting them
the insulting thing is that soe has gone back to the drawing board with swg trying to make it a copycat of wow in order to they hope compete in the longterm
they hope that you the paying customer is such a star wars freak that you will continue pumping money into their alphatest of a game in order to finance the development of what they hope it will eventually beasis things are horribly broken
medic is the strongest class in the game and a level  medic can solokill  level  player jedithe game is upsetting to many because the original dev team working on swg had a vision and many people knew that vision and stuck with the game for so long in the hopes that it would be realizedsoe seems content to head in the direction of what their wow playing focus groups tell them they need instead of what the players have asked forto get the same effect slam your head into your computer desk repeatedly to the tune of john williams opening star wars theme and flush  down the toilet once per monthsoe has ruined the potential that this game had  and is running in the opposite direction from where they should have been
they blame everyone but themselves
its captivating as a car wreck to watch  and upsetting for those of us who knew the games potentialweve still got our memories fun was had in spite of what they did to the game
its not worth playing any longerrun away from soe products
run fast and far
they have begun to take swg down a path that is guaranteed to alienate their playerbasei see a few people here making the ridiculous claim that everyone who is upset about the combat upgrade are exploiters or leet dewds
this is untrue
the majority of people upset are noncombatants of all kinds
crafters entertainers doctors  in swg if youre not a dual mastery combatant the devs are essentially saying that you dont matterthere have been plenty of reviews here that tell the truth about how deeply messed up the game has become because of soe horrendous design policies
do not be swayed by the occasional glowing review
the majority of swg veterans detest the cu because the game used to be much better
it used to encourage different styles of gameplay and now it does notif you enjoy mindless endless grinding to no real end then this game might be for you
if not run fast and far
put your money into anything but this gamethis was a great game
i spent a lot of time playing it and did quests visited star wars locals and saw star wars characters
i liked this game i really did now they are going to dumb it all down in the name of  playability
no more class trainers and leveling up just got insanely easy
it looks like  of the game will be jedi in about  months of this update
its going to be boring and the game will lose much of what made it star warsyou can read all the other terrible reviews on the page for the vanilla version of star wars galaxies to get a good idea what is going on in the community
i wrote one myself
all i have to say here is that if your going to buy this package for this amount of money then have to sacrifice fifteen dollars a month to play you might as well know that your not getting whats advertised
the box implies that you can be pretty much anything in the star wars universe profession wise and this is definately no longer true as of april  unless your into paying for a buggy game with now generic combat and huge expanses of no population ingame i wouldnt waste my money on this sham
soe is perhaps the worst gaming company ever put into being and their exploitation of a vulnerable star wars community is sickening especially when they dont even deliver a percentage of what they advertisesony has ruined the game with the combat upgrade
they put it in beta and refused to listen to their clients before bringing this to the game
they have the worst customer service on the planet and have ruined what was a decent game alsothis game just blowsit is neither a first person shooter nor is it a role playing game
yet it tries to be both and does so in an absolutely disasterous way
examples you cant shoot through things that get in your way but the enemy can when they shoot back through those same things
everybody in a class is exactly the same so yea you can be a smuggler and you will be exactly like the other level  smugglers in the game
oh and by the way smugglers do not smuggle in this game
if you are an entertainer you have no purpose in the game
it just seems they forgot to program anything for entertainers to dothis game is mind boggling buggy
you cant finish a quest
hey no problem you get an automated ticket back saying we are aware of the problem and working on it
really
do you want to pay  a month for a game that you cant play owing to problems they are aware of and working on
the condition of this game is little better than an alpha state it certainly isnt even in a beta state alpha and betas are conditions of games before they are released to the public
however get the picture
this game is not in a playable state as a gamelook there are some very fun star wars titles out there
this just is not one of them
please please dont waste  dollars on this garbage
besides the hand writting is on the wall this online game is closing in the febmay time frame according to many sourcesstay awaystar wars galaxies an empire dividedsigh where to beginthis game could be better namedstar wars galaxies a development team vs a player basenever in all my life have i seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar
its truly sickening
i was a month veteran of the game i had been playing since week one ive canceled my account and will never do business with soe again
please read onin the beginningthis game was alright it was fun it was unique and it was totally bugridden and unbalanced
over the course of the last  months the soe dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game
they in fact did very little if anything at all
they milked us
they exploited the star wars name to make a buck
they made promise after promise after promise and never delivered squat
dont believe me
just ask any smuggler in the game for their opinionthey strung us along and led us to believe that the fixes to the game were right around the corner
instead they were hard at work on an expansion pack to sell us
and then once again promised us that the fixes weve all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us just hang on this game is going to be great
they promised us that they were going to do this combat upgrade and do it right and it wouldnt be released until its ready
we all had a lot of hope we thought that they had finally figure out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse
god how wrong we all werewell much to everyones surprise they made the announcement that the long awaited cu would be coming out along with the rage of the wookiees expansion pack
uhhhmmm did i miss something somewhere
the alpha test for the cu was supposed to begin in january it never happened
beta testing began in april  whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live
we all rolled up our sleeves and dove in
i think after the first week or so the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink inthey went and copypasted eq code into the swg game so they could streamline their operation by having one dev team work on both swg and eq
the cu was supposed to go live on may th
soe decided to push it to live a whole  weeks sooner than that
honestly with all the bugs that were still in beta and now in live beta could have gone on another  months
i guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it
why am i not surprisedthe cu itself is unplayable
it has become everquest in space or everstar galaxies questwars as we call it
there are just too many things to list
there are a lot of other more technical reviews which go into much more detail over on the page for the standalone gameas you all can imagine the player community was totally enraged
we went to the swg forum boards to voice our concerns
the only response we ever got back from soe was thousands of deleted threads and players banned from the forums
facing futility a large portion of the player base has left the game permanently this timethis is just not how you do business
i personally will never deal with sony online entertainment soe ever again
i do not pay my hard earned money to be lied to deceived ignored strung along censored and banned for voicing my concerns
i do not pay money to folks who treat me a paying customer in this fashionstar wars galaxies is dead
servers are emptying
people are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons
if you are a fan of star wars and this is the only reason i ever started playing this game to begin with you will be sadly disappointedswg is nothing more than an exploit of a title a milk machine
i for one am tired of being milkedyou have been warnedwell first off to soecongrads boys you finally shot yourself in the foot over this game
the combat upgrade was bad enough but to change this into a first person shooter and you have the nerve to claim that customers want thisso where is your data
naturally you idoits will not show the data
so what is the use of putting up polls on the forums only to be ingored
the players who are leaving new you screwed and you know you screwed up
to us i gaint favor for xmas either  turn off the servers or  simply go out of business
i am sure that will make a lot of people nice and happyspeaking of the forums i have noticed that as an explayer that my station name nor password work anymore
why hmmm tired of the negative feedbacker whose fault is that not the players since you never never listen to us
just had to give it the personal touch
patchnerf dumb down and repeat
so whats instore for the game over the next  monoths
you are now going to have be concerned that dd online coming out in march of  warcrafts first expansion july  or the yet to be released star trek online for yes i seen changes done doing my time with wow but nothing has crazy far fretched as the changes that was done to galaxies
nobody in there right mind would even make  major changes in under  year
so what form of crack you smokingto anybody who is even a fan of star wars
i dont have to go into the problems again
save your money and trying something else
the only soe is good for is making a game and later wreckingfrom what i gathered they fired there old rep to the players tiggs there seems to be a new person there now and she is now more a companymanpitching the soe wayas for soeif you have common sense you better fix this farce soon or dont even bother releasing any online games in the futurea lot of people are going simply remember this and avoid your future products like the plagueafter this you couldnt pay me enough to play this trash even say nice things about itthat would simply be a lieto anybody still active in this gamegood luck god speed
you may see a star wars online role player game some day
sadly not by this company soe they only know how to destoryand thats what they do best destory destory destorythis video game reeks of an attempt of creating an atmosphere of chills thrills and intrigue
first i despise games that have ordinary bullets that can rip monsters to shreds
second the graphics were crummy and the game play was awkward at best
i hated the camera angles and could never get used to it
the story made little sense but i guess one doesnt play games for the story
the music which should be good for horror and suspense games stunkhow this became a cult hit and a crummy movie starring a crummy actor is beyond me
not worth the  i paid for back when it came out if i had kept it i wouldve ebayed it or burned itget the travel case instead it really doesnt protect it that much althoug it is confy for handling more confy than the travel caseid get it if i dont really take the psp out of my house because i dont feel it protects it from a fall or rough handlingthis is a great case for an old psp
the psp  not only fits loosely in it but the cut outs are different so that you cannot access the headphone port while its in the case
i have this case that the psp  does fit in i guess its the slim version that isnt available and its wonderful
i bought this one for my kids psp and lost my money thinking it was the same case  bought from a third party and threw away the wrapping before checking
dont buy it for a new version of the psp  youll regret itwell
if you dont have any paint to watch dry then go ahead and play it
otherwise save your moneythis was a complete waste of money for me
i guess if you have nothing but time on your hands maybe you can figure out how to fly this thing
for those of us who have enjoyed moderately complex flight sims this is a real disappointment as the learning curve is precipitous
how many commands do you want to learn just to do some basic stuff
if youd answer less than a dozen then dont get thisi hate the other harvest moon games
i dont like that you have to buy one girl or boy version
besides there is only  characters to marry
buy harvest moon magical melody
its much betterthis game has to be one of the worst games i have ever played
the controls are wonky
you can go to the car door and press the action button and nothing happens
the car chases are pretty bad too
you could be close to catching up to a car only to have it disappear
or you could be far from a car and it reappears
the outofcar experience is just as bad
you could be coming towards an enemy and he will just stay put like he doesnt see you
overall this game is pretty bad
it feels like they rushed up to put this out
if you want to play a decent driver game you should try driver parallel lines
i found that to be a big improvement over this gamethis game is so bad that i had to put my two cents on it
the controls are so bad that i found myself ready to throw my game boy advance down
it was frustrating
couple that with the trialanderror design of this game and i was left a frustrated man
the other review i notice is supposedly from a child
isnt this game rated m
this game also has the worst computer controlled ai
you can drive right past the police cars
i have played other games that this game seems to be trying to compete with like grand theft auto and this game is a laugher compared to thosethis game is alot of fun
i know what people have said
the graphics are terrible the control stinks  blah blah blah
this game is a lot of fun
bullet time fast gunning action cant be beat
unless you have some assemblance of a soul
you can not honestly play this and feel like everything is ok  though i had fun i felt guilty the entire time i played it
every single level requires you to bust down a door and begin completely obliterating about  people
this cant be good for the soul can it
so though it may be tempting
avoid this one
i can not recommend a game that glorifies so much blood and gorebottom line  is it fun
yep
will i keep it
you will finish it in about a week
multiplayer is terrible
is it for kids
you should be huung if you let your kids play this one
and whats bad for kids is rarely good for parentsbought it used for  at a local game shophard to controlnot very entertainingand just kinda boring overallit was a waste of  at even usedlost in blue is one of those subpar games that want to be so much better than they are and the fact that they arent is such a tragedy that you almost feel bad for the people who have to market them
dont get me wrong there are fun aspects to the game spearfishing for instance is a hoot and after spending days in gametime on the brink of starvation the opportunity to finally see a full hunger meter is truly satisfying
i should also mention in all fairness that the game does make good if limited use of the ds touch screen and microphone mostly through the aforementioned spear fishing and through fire building
unfortunately these bright spots are too few and far between to add up to a game worth playing or at least paying fullprice for and i spent much of my time feeling angry and frustrated at the games nonintuitive and often downright illogical gameplay
bowhunting for instance is almost impossible without the use of snare traps and even then its irritatingly hitormiss using snare traps essentially entails watching an animal as it walks making a guess as to where its path will take it and placing the trap and hoping your prediction was correct
if it was correct great if it wasnt and the animal changes direction at the last second youre screwed because traps cant be reused once set
you can also capture and domesticate a goat for the ostensible purpose of obtaining milk but even though i did everything i was supposed to do capture goatcheck bring homecheck provide partner with bottlesdouble check the goat went unmilked until it finally keeled over dead in the night
but what really killed the game and what made me lose interest and leave it unfinished is the fact that halfway through the game youre required to leave your partner behind at camp and strike out on your own for a few days making sure that she has enough food and water so that she wont die while youre gone and the game offers absolutely no explanation for why you cant just take her with you even though shes perfectly capable of making the trip with your assistance
worse yet at the cave which serves as your homeawayfromhome there are two readymade not to mention unexplained sleeping pallets only serving to underscore the question
and worse even than that she proves time and again to be so wildly inept at taking care of herselfflatly ignoring the barrel full of fresh water and letting herself slowly die of thirst for instancethat you may well have to abandon your quest midway through and run home to stop her from killing herself
she also has an unfortunate tendency to wander away from the cave leaving you to search for her before she dies of exposure
you may feel tempted to just let her go and be rid of her but the game wont let you do that if she dies the game ends
youll most likely end up running home a few times anyway as the game only lets you stockpile a few days worth of provisions for her to live off of and exploring the ruins will almost certainly take far longer than that
i cant imagine why the games designers would intentionally include such a flawed puzzle but its there it cant be avoided and it frustrated me to no endsince ive already rambled on far too long ill only mention in passing the games thinlydisguised sexism in the form of a male character who does all the hunting and gathering and a female character who hardly ever leaves home as well as the sudden jarring digression into tomb raider territory that comes with exploring the ruins
once youve beaten the game you have the option of playing it through again from your partners point of view a page clearly taken from the book of resident evil  fortunately thats where the similarity ends
 but since i gave up on the game halfway through the first playthrough i cant offer any opinions on that particular aspect
honestly though the fact that the first half of the game is so hard to get through with your patience intact provesto me anywaythat it really doesnt matter if the second half is enjoyable or not
all in all while lost in blue does offer a few innovative and fun gameplay elements the aggregate experience was so overwhelmingly negative for me that i can only recommend this game if youre not the kind of person who is easily frustrated and even then you should probably look for a used copymicrosoft should have released this as a free download on their website the way they do for other games
they essentially are milking you out of even more cash
booooo
hissss
find a friend that has this and have he or she install it on your xbox your xbox will remember the new maps  you dont need to keep the discthe new maps are just plain horrible save for sanctuary and warlock
they are nice looking but the funness stops therethe way these maps are set up are horrible
elongation is the worst of the bunch
the treamill style floors the horrible boxes and the dual sides are just plain annoying
no cover and way too much going onrelic is a horrible map for everything especially sniper matches
same thing with gemini and backwash
terminal is tolerable at times as long as its a slayer or sniper matchthe only other decent map is turf
its actually somewhat fun to play ctf or bomb assualt but anything else is just annoyingthe new maps i think are just not fun
the way they are set up just scream leave game
its funny because when elongation comes up everyone groans and complains about what a horrible level it is
thank god the new levels are now free they should pull this from the shelves cause whos actually going to pay for ityou are nuts if you spend  for nine measly mp maps
console gamers are getting ripped off if they put up with this
on the pc this map pack would have been a free download along with countless other fanmade mods
thats all i got to say on this matterin a review submitted below and prior to the release of this game somebody raised a concern that it might turn out to be little more than a cheap copy of gta
well that reviewer neednt have worried as the godfather doesnt seem like a cheap copy of gta or even a rd rate copy of gta
in actual fact it seems more like an abysmal copy of another game somewhere else that had already copied grand theft auto badlyand thats about the best thing i can say for it as digging further the pain just doesnt stop therewhile the both the page turning novel and epic film adaptation of the godfather had intelligence style and a reasonable degree of depth the game has zero intelligence zero style and no depth whatsoever
it is moulded in the style of throwing zombielike pedestrians and aichallenged enemies in your way while you go about the business of  unrealistically forging a career in the mafia
you can basically steal cars as already mentioned  just like in gta grab people and then waggle the left stick around on your control pad to beat them up thereby either intimidating or icing them you can shoot some badly textured guns without any danger of feeling like your have ever been near a gun or a gunfight and you can watch some utterly rubbish cutscenes that stitch the thing together with all the grace and subtlety of a punch and judy retelling of the original storywhile all this is going on of course there are other treats to lose yourself in
marvel as your character gets a haircut or buys some clothes again just as in gta or become steadily overawed by the addition of a skill points system that allows you to increase your ability to waggle the left stick around to greater effect or to shoot your unrealistic gun even faster
also you may love the truly ridiculous driving missions that are occasionally thrown your way  in which you get to pilot something that looks like a badly drawn brick around the dull and uninteresting streets while further aichallenged enemies swerve at you like metal lemmings in an attempt to irritate you to deathto be as blunt as possible the godfather is probably the worst game i have ever played and that is really saying something
like eas previous fiasco of   black  it seems as if a fantastic idea was somehow given a lobotomy checked through a series of mediocrity assurance committees and only finally then released when it had been proved itself dumb enough not to confuse anybody with an iq matching their shoe size
for myself i could just about tolerate that from black as who cares if there is one more moronic video game to avoid but when it comes to dragging the godfather into the sewer then i have really had enoughto trash the memory of one of the best movies ever made by plastering a ropy narrative and a generally lacklustre game onto it is unforgivable and i sincerely hope  whoever you may be reading this  that you will feel the same
please dont buy the godfather as it deserves to be a black eye for the company that made it and then perhaps the idiots responsible will be taken out of the loop for future releasesif you have an xbox  do not buy this game it will not work on your unit
it looks good in the promotional material but it just wont play on an xbox nba live  is crap that game is just all about dunking and the super powers of the players the physicas are totally unrealistic
any time you post up it usually leads to you getting the ball stripped
for some reason and i really really hate this teams have a very hard time getting defensive rebounds in this game
theres nothing like getting a rare possesion in this game where you actually play solid defense and force a missed shot only to have the offensive player slam dunk it back in your face while the defensive player just stands there like an idiot which happends every timenba live  was way way better
im already passed nba live  but nba live  is a classic i still play
theres no real flaws in this game
if you have a dominate big man then you will dominate the paint and have a good chance of scoring if they double team you can find open guys for shots
you need to have an offensive plan and know what kind of team you are
sloppy offense leads to steals and missed shots which lead to fast break chances for the other teami have to say when i saw screenshots of this game i couldnt wait to get it
the games graphics are much better than prisoner of azkaban which looked rather rushed
but that turned out to be the only thing that i really like about this gamei mean this is not harry potter
this is just another action game
the three previous games while they seemed rather childish were fun to play because they werent like every other video game
they made you use your brain to figure out what to do next something that harry ron and hermione do all the timebut this game really doesnt have a plot
its like you go to one place kill all the enemies there go to the next place kill all the enemies there and so on
i dont know about you but i dont think that killing is very fun
in the other games the whole of hogwarts was open to you but in this game you have a choice of only ten locations and thats it
you cant freely explore hogwarts like you can in the other games
the games controls are horrible and the camera is always zoomed very far away and you cant adjust it very much so its very easy to lose track of the character that youre playing as
also the game is very frustrating
the game does include images from the movie which you can unlock and i think that they are more interesting than the game itselfim telling you harry potter fans this game is not worth playing
ill probably just put it on the shelf and forget about it its so bada dud of a game the voices for the characters is terrible and the gameplay is awful
a failed attempt at adding multiplayer to harry potteri agree with the second reviewer  if you liked the other harry potter games this latest one is sure to disappoint
however unlike another reviewer i wont be so callous as to completely spoil a books surprise endingone of the more disappointing features of this new game is the inability to see more than a few feet in front of you
that is whereas in the other game you had control of the camera with the joystick you didnt use to run by the way harry cannot duck or jump in this game either in other games you used the joystick to look up down and all around the town
when harry ran through the game you saw where he was going because the view was from behind
here the view is aerial and you have no idea whats aheadthe card system is indeed confusing and the booklet doesnt explain much
i miss roaming around the entire school entering into the classrooms running through diagon alley and looking for secret items
you cant go roaming anymore you must follow an prearranged order
the bertie botts beans you uncover for points now fly away from you and you must chase them down if you want points
if i had the chance to offer an opinion to the game designers i would say do overif you like racing games get but i thought this had freeroam so that really sucked its was  lolthe good play if you dont get bored with it first with all your favorite marvel super heroesthe bad repetitive arenas there are only choose a marvel heroe and youll fight all the imperfects same order same arena same thingchoose an imperfect and youll fight all the marvel heroes same order same arena same thingcard system that god knows what it does and you cant even really choose your cardsrepetitive turns to boredomdont buy it trust meblack is a perfect example of a game that looks cool but does nothing above subpar
theres no story you hear militarysounding dialogue over your radio that doesnt mean anything oh yay the weapons are cool enough but nothing new  most of this could be overlooked if it were a fun shooting game but alas its not not at all
the controls suck aiming isnt done well especially compared to a game like urban chaos riot response and it takes too long to move your view around
really id rather play pretty much any fps game over this onei know this review is going to fall on deaf ears but im going to write it anyway
i know that the majority of reviewers on amazon are drooling fanboys but still i will write this
if this review prevents one person from buying this godawful game then it was worth writingblackthe storyline is youre some government agent type who was on a mission and needless to say it went bad
now youre telling your story from the beginning to save your butt from a life of prison and blah blah blah its probably the worst aspect of the entire game
at the beginning of every level youre forced to sit through these horribly acted live action cut scenes and by forced i mean you cant skip them even if youve already passed the gamegood points sound graphics andwell thats itcons ai gameplay overall enjoymentit does sport some of the best graphics for a fps these days however that is completely overshawdowed by all of its bad points
the enemy ai is comparable to goldeneye for the  there is virtually no stealth in the game whatsoever
you enter the enemys line of sight and he will now follow you until he kills you or you kill him
doesnt matter how far you run from him his esp allows him to know exactly where you arethe gameplay is go in guns a blazing and kill everything that moveswhich can be difficult when it takes practically an entire clip to bring down a single person
black is famous for explosions
this is pretty spectacular the first time you see something blowup but it wont take more than five minutes before every explosion starts looking like every other explosion
its almost as if youre fighting terrorists and evil foreign types inside a fireworks factory
in fact during the beginning of the game they tell you to shoot the red objects because they explode
the ai of the enemy seems to have been set up with that in mind as you watch enemy soldiers firing and slowly cluster around these little dynamite packs
convienent huh
it got to the point where i was firing at a single guy in a log cabin shot the predictably placed red keg of generic explosives and watched as the cabin was reduced to rubble
all that to kill one guy
one reviewer complained that the game isnt long enough and im going to complain that it could have been a lot shorterblack at its core is a fluff game a lot of show and no substanceif  youre looking for a fps that doesnt insult your intellegence i would suggest feari have this but its so not memorable that i cant even remember enough about it to review iti purchased this item for a child who is an intense video game fan
a lot of time searching for this specific game
although we were able to find it it was delivered timely and packaged well the game disk was blank and would not play at all
very very disappointed and a waste of my money
not so sure i would purchase from this seller again
i have purchased a fair amount of video games from amazon and this was the first and only time this happened
i feel cheatedi would agree with anybody that the  soul calibur on dreamcast was a masterpiece
i really loved that game
but that was  years agothere is nothing new about soul cabibur  its just the same old stuff that you had already played for hundreds of hours years agothere are a few new moves and combos but the new moves just turn the game into a button masher
which means you can easily  beat the game by rapidly mashing the attack button
the previous games made you think a little about your strategy but now there is no strategy or real skill involvedplus its on playstation so you know what type of graphics your getting the worst graphics out of the  systemsdo not buy this product for the gamecube this av cable is incredibly cheap and looks nothing like the picture
when using it there are static lines across the screen that appearit looks like ea games put too much stock in reviewers of the previous moh series
medal of honor rising sun was badgered by complaints of no strategy and stupid enemy ai
even still it became a playstation  greatest hits
many of us who like fps games arent interested in stealth tactics etc
we want guns bullets and more guns
rather than more complicated game play this game could have been helped by
more  intense violence
bigger better explosions
more gunfire
better graphicshaving to keep other troops alive is just a pain in the rear imho
the european theatre is getting old as well
id like to see a bigger better version of what rising sun tried to accomplish
that is fighting in the wwii pacific theatreokay so the graphics are descent but this game irritates me because of the historical inaccuracy
since when was there an american in a british comando unit
and in the africa campaign they would be no way they would ever let an american in to the desert rats
they were completly british
and in russia they didnt even trust the americans never have probably never will
and the game posts no dificulty i beat it an two hours
okay before you say i have no life you should rent it and see how easy it is
its too simple
if you like games where you go around killing things and games that have no point this game is for yougame is horridmultiplayer is only fun thats because its  game  loling  how much the game sucksi fault amazon and myself for not emphasizing that this game is for the xbox and not the xbox   i did not realize that there was a difference between the twoi really like this game it can be frustrating at first to figure out how to control a constantly rolling ball but its fun and not too difficult to figure out
that said i had collected medals and moved on several stages when the saved file disappeared
i didnt erase it or save over it i just turned it on one day and it was gone
nintendos return policy for its own games states that you must have the receipt within  days to return which is ridiculous why would you keep it
you cant return new games
i think it would be also ridiculous to spend  on a used copy on amazon or  for a new one
and have the same glitch happen
i am very dissatisfied with nintendo right nowgame cases  nothing fancy they do what they are ment to do they are not fun  they are not games  so why ask me to rate these items as suchanyway yes these are great gba cases lets start out by sayingthis is not the sega cd version with updated graphics
this is an almost new version of the original
i say this because i have the sega cd version along with the sega cd strategy guide and the levels have been changed completely and the difficulty has been amped
random encounters have been eliminated completely which in this case ends up being a very very bad thing
once you kill the visible enemies on the screen in a dungeon swamp or mountain terrain the enemies disappear completely
even when you move up a floor and then go back they are still gone
this means to level upand you will have to level up
you have to walk all the way back to the entrance then all the way back to the town and then all the way to the statue to heal
then you have to return to the fighting scene and kill the enemies all over again
this is very bad as there are only  different types of enemies per area which makes things mindnumbingly monotonous
i spent  hours leveling up my characters near the city of vann to only barely avoid death with the following boss
it will be that way the whole game
no matter how much you level up you will barely escape death with the bosses and thats only if youve dedicated  hours of grinding for each section
also the enemies  hours in the game give you the same amount of experience points and almost the same amount of money as at the beginning of the game
thats what makes this game so damn frustrating and boring
you have to run through an area to kill  enemies and then leave heal and reenter when the enemies only give you  experience points per fight and you need to build up  experience points to move on
also im using the same magic  hours in the game that i used at the beginning
the new spells you learn on the way are total crap and are weaker than the spells you start off with
how is it that im granted a majic spell at level  thats weaker than the spells i had at level 
i wouldnt be griping about this at all if they would have just left the random encounters in the game
atleast then the makers could justify the unnecessary new and improved difficulty level
it would have made grinding so much more tollerable and far less time consuming
this game was so much fun when i bought it back in  for the sega cd
now im so bored with it that im quitting
its taken me over  hours to get to a spot that only took me one evening on the original
i will give it this if you want character development this is the lunar to get as they have beefed up the story and have vastly improved the translation
this leads however to this lunar being completely completely different from the original
i know because i have both
if you need proof just look at the sega cd strategy guide and then look at the manual for this game
totally differentafter all the grinding and needless walking doing nothing i feel like i have wasted so much of my life
i could have practiced the piano or guitar or read books with my daughter instead of this endless grindathon
ive played rpgs for  years
never have i had a grinding experience ruin a game as it did for me here
atleast grinding in the final fantasy collection and phantasy star    was fun and tollerable
this crap is just rediculous
if you have to have the whole story i guess buy this version
if you want to have fun with a great rpg buy a sega cdx and then get the original lunar for  complete on ebay or amazon
that package together will be the same as buying lunar for the psone
then you can get lunar  the phantasy star collection and vay for the sega cd and your collection of great sega rpgs will be completei found this game to be boring and the graphics were not the best
if you like little green men go for itthe game has decent graphics
destroying building with your flying saucer is fun at first but gets tedious
the stealth based missions are frustrating
with no mission save points if you make a mistake then you may find yourself forced to start the mission overthe hardest flaw in the game for me to get over is the blatant pushing of liberal politics
it takes cheap shots at president george w bush with sayings like i should have joined the texas air national guard
now that would be some easy duty
both nixon and sen joe mccarthy are mocked
communism is treated like an imaginary threat or a conspiracy theory
when you scan the brains of many pedistrian npcs they have homosexual thoughts
who thinks that is fun
who is the target audience herethe developer is located in australia
i think they have a flawed  image of the united states of america
they certainly have little idea what is funohhhhhhhh jeeze where do i begin
this game is just so horribly done that i cant believe anyone would actually enjoy playing it
holy cow
but being an opptimist i have to find good in everything and there is good in this game
i loved the hillarios things people say for example they eat with their mouths
i think im going to be violently ill
and moooooooooprimitive yet profound
haha but the rest of the game was horriblethis x sucked and this game is a prime example of why
its total garbage the graphics suck the controls are god aweful and the gameplay is nonexistantat first glance playing this game doesnt seem like an experience that feels like tanning directly under the ozones hole
but dont be fooled
underneath the sunny exterior lies a sinister insidious force that leaves you burnt to a crispthe graphics are gorgeous
watching the first few cutscenes left me with a slack jaw and the ingame graphics are head and shoulders above most everything else ive seen
character models are incredibly vibrant colors are bright and everything seems bathed in a soft glow
if these visuals could somehow be transplanted into a completely different game we might have something herethe battle system earns a solid meh
at least its not the mess that we bore witness to in star ocean  but its very mindless hack n slash
i just wish i had something more to do than mash the attack buttonas all rpg fans know though exploration not battle is the heart of this genre
in my opinion a successful rpg must somehow get the player excited about exploring towns and talking to npcs
however this is the area in which rs emits an endless unforgivable stream of greenhouse gasesif you believe the pr there is supposedly a realtime system that lets you recruit characters and complete sidequests as the day passes
but there are not nearly enough sidequests to do and time passes veeeeery slowlyand the only way to fill it is with what i believe is the stupidest implementation of this generation dueling the townsfolkin order to be of proper level to proceed you must provoke npcs into fighting you
the problem
most of these npcs are as strong if not stronger than a boss and you must fight them without the aid of your allies
this is extremely frustrating
i felt conned nowhere in any of the reviews or other coverage of this game was this mentionedoverall rs made me feel stymied
too much frustration too little to do and the added fact that you keep feeling like you should love it
additionally the games muchtouted humor seems like it was aimed at braindamaged chimpanzees although i admit that this is a matter of personal preference
i advise you to avoid this game and all others by the developer until triace gets its act togethereven without having any expectations for this game i couldnt help but to be disappointed with a story littered with cliches and a plot that seemed more like an outline than a finished product
after the initial start up screen and the typical prophesy as prose intro i am hit with a barrage of cliches in a matter of minutes
boy whose father was a great knight boy sets out to surpass father girl who beats boy in a battle boy and girl hate each other well fifteen minutes into the game and i can already see where its going
however i still wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt after all cliches are a standard part of rpgs
then however came the split where i was forced to choose sides in a war that was completely avoidable between the nonhumans and the humans
having a momentary lapse of judgment i chose the nonhuman side not fully realizing that when they said that all humans would become my enemy that they meant it
thats no problem i thought these are my friends surely theyll stick beside me because im fighting i think for what i believe in
sadly that was one cliche that was not forthcoming
my friends list was wiped out basically making the first ten hours that i played null and void
after fighting alongside of the fairies i began to wonder why i even bothered siding with them
it definitely doesnt help their cause when youre in the middle of battle and they start spouting taunts such as humans are weak
oh really
then why are you letting me do all of the work while your terrible ai simply tells you to sit therecharacter development is nonexistent
i kind of liked jack at first and hated ridley
unfortunately jack goes from a thrill seeking smart aleck to a typical i just want to protect you hero and ridley simply disappears into the background
plodding through this disappointing game i eventually came to the realization that i didnt care what happened to any of the characters or even how the story played out it was simply unenjoyable and insipid
perseverance or a mild case of masochism kept me playing until the end where i was greeted by the frustrating get to the top by dumb luck board of the city of white nights
i cant tell you how much time i spent going up and down ladders running to dead ends and getting knocked down by sand or dust or whatever it was that fell from nowhere sending me back to the beginning
my hours of frustration were rewarded with one of the most uninspired lackluster endings that i have ever witnessed in a rpgto its credit however i have to say that at least it wasnt difficult to level up unlike some other rpgs that ive played and jacks on screen model reflected the armor that was currently equipped on him which was nice
there were a few laugh out loud moments but not nearly enough to make this atrocity enjoyable and i dont see myself playing through it again to get the human side of the story
im certain that this review wont detract anyone from playing it who wants to after all there certainly seem to be enough people who enjoyed it
as for me the disappointment was too great for me to recommend this to anyoneif you want to grind for hours this is your game
if you expect things like story and great graphics find another gamewhile this game was colorful and pretty easy i stopped playing it about the time  your party ends up going to the king and the king checks out the female in the party
the screen focuses on her bust area and her bottom area 
there are other comments up to this point that are inappropriate for children and teens 
i just thought really
dissapointed since this was the first dragon quest that i had ever played even though i often saw them on the snes in japan
i sold my copyi finished the game and had to write a review on this game because it was so bad
the game is basically a buttonmashing game with no excitement
i found myself trudging through the game just so that i could finish it
otherwise i would have spent a lot of money for nothing
if you are a novice gamer you will get bored with this game
if you are a veteran gamer you will stop playing in ten minutes
dont waste your money on this game
it felt like a game the company rushed to put out in order to cash in on the super hero craze andor holiday spending
there are many games out there that are super hero games out there that are a whole lot better like xmen legends i and ii
they even came out way before this dudthis is simply a secondrate game a pretender a wannabe
it simply reeks of rush job made to cash in on the superhero craze
you battle through hordes and hordes of robots
it feels more like a chore rather than fun
the superheroes themselves blend in with the other enemies so that you cant see them amongst the hordes and hordes of robots
then the game ends
no special cutscenes
just screen credits
that after working hard to clean the screen of robots
to add insult to this whole thing the game is very short
dont waste your money on this rubbish
take it from me once youve played the other superhero games you will see how really bad this one is
save a little bit more and get the real game
dont waste your money on this game
show the game developers that you dont like being ripped off by games like thisneedless to say i am extremely disappointed in this game
i was really looking forward to it having played all the others
i havent even finished it  have gotten to noloben  its so boring
all you do is walk around  look at the scenery which is not much in my opinion  work a few puzzles here  there
there is no neat stuff like previous myst games no opening drawers or making things move no cool rides on trams etc
the story line also sucks
you dont care about any of characters or rather only two
at least sirrus  achenar kept you wondering what theyd get up to next
the yeesha character is ugly  after being such a cute wonderful little girl in myst iv  shes now an ugly woman
esher is boring  ugly too
im getting tired of him being the only character i talk to
the dinebo resting land is stupid nothing to do except open gates the other ages are either cold  forbidding or have palm trees  big whoop
nothing really to explore like in other games
this series has gone out with a whimper not a bang
maybe thats what they wanted so we wouldnt bug them to make another one
if they were all like this one i would have quit playing years ago
however they should redeem themselves and make another to make up for this one
someone said they lost money on uru well this one sure wont help them anyokay look here i dont know if it was a sh problem but this game did not work well i mean it did work but it would freeze up in the middle of anything i tried to dooverall this was terrible i am never buying from you again good dayhalf the time it doesnt even turn on and no not finally there are no ds cheats on this pointless rubbish
your better off paying  bucks for the gba gameshark and holding out for a ds gameshark
and whats the point of using this on pokemon games anyway even if you have infinite rare candies they still wont obey you till you get the prospective badges
and no they do not have very many games and the only new games they make codes for are the ones that have preexisting ones like pokemonalthough i thought i would enjoy this game i found it rather unenjoyable
while the landscape was beautiful and riding agro was fun there wasnt enough in the landscape to keep me occupied
in other games i love exploring the territory but i found myself shutting this game off before i even found the first colossusi just dont get it
i played this game
i trudged through it
i sat and endured the cutscenes the long repetetive gameplay and such and i just dont see what was so great about this gamenow im an artist first and a gamer second so i didnt go into this game looking for something to do with my hands
i went in looking for a compelling piece of art
what i got instead was a cryptic frustrating tale about selfsacrifice corruption and foolishnessfirst off the idea of fighting multiple enemies of absolutely enormous size and complexity is a good one but its been integrated much better into much better games before it like jak  and kingdom hearts
secondly sure the graphics look spiffy when you first see them but it doesnt work in the end because they drag the framerate down pitifully
sometimes the game slowed up so much that i could barely even tell where i was anymore
it got so horrible that i didnt see more than three frames of animation in some seconds which is a dreadful shame given how beautiful some of the monsters would otherwise have beenaside from that this game is like one fifth of a good game
by this i mean that it has intense enormous boss battles and thats it
better games would also include other characters with whom to interact minor monsters to slay on your way to the big guys a back story of some kind for the characters you play as and on behalf of and a decent control system that wasnt clumsy stiff or frustrating
these are all failings that this game has
every single one obvious and damaging
from a basic design elements point of view this game is terriblei just came off playing the jak and daxter series and this games character plays so stiffly and moves so stupidly by comparison that i could barely stand it
the controls are frustrating difficult to master and in many cases unresponsive as well and the characters tiredmeter was conceptually a good idea but executed poorlyfrom the beginning of the game you play as some nameless dude who went to a forbidden land to restore the soul of some dead maiden who were told virtually nothing about
not knowing anything at all about either of these characters i as a gamer had little motivation to play
additionally the vast expansive surroundings might be pretty in a movie but they were too easy to get lost in since the socalled map this game provides you with is no kind of help at all and getting lost was no fun either because there werent any secrets to find and no music is played at all in this game except during the boss fights and even then there are only about six different music tracks in the whole game
basically in this game you start at a temple in the center of the land follow the light of the sword to a boss
defeat the boss and wind up back at the temple
repeat sixteen times
thats pretty much all there is to this game
disappointing ehi think i should also mention that even if you do have the stamina and selfabusive tendency needed to reach the games ending the ending of this game is really more like a punishment than a reward for winning
i havent been so disappointed in a video game since the legend of zelda the wind wakerthe controls suck especially the camera angels i got bored with this after an hour
one of the worst games i ever boughtfor starters the main character looks like a chick
hes poorly developed and extremely lame
this game follows the same pattern after each colossus kill you go back to the castle and a voice tells you a stupid riddle then you ride for  minutes looking for the colossus
then repeat again these people saying that this game has a storline must have created it out of their own imagination
all in all this game is crapthis game is the biggest waste of  that ive ever seen
stupid boring slow pointlessanybody want minein the groove is one of those selfproclaimed dance games made by dance game fanatics for dance game fanatics
the result is a challenging game that also lacks any form of good taste style or classokay i dont know much about the in the groove franchise but apparently it is dead
konami killed it when they bought the name
though supposedly the last game featured a patch that allowed users to insert usb drives on the arcade machine so they can play ddr songs on it whooped dee doothe game itself is a blatant rip off of dance dance revolution
the game uses the exact same format same arrows same stomping gameplay
in the groove virtually does nothing to make itself stand out which is why the game is at best only has a cult following behind it
but these same following insist the game is the best stepping game out there
well no it isnt
even the crappiest ddr titles us versions any of the mixes made for the xbox and xbox  out perform this game from production values to the musicthe game is poorly presented and developed rather crudely on the ps which i wonder how this amateur got through sonys qt
if you turn on a lot of modifiers the game slows down
load times are long
and the menu ui is laughable at the very least
the worst offender of them all is the horrifically bad music
none of the artists in this game are assigned to any major labels none of the songs sound good and none of the songs will leave you wanting morein the groove is a terrible game with really bad music tacky style and zero originality
only folks who love terribly hard songs will enjoy this garbage even then theyre only playing it for the step designs not for the quality of musicthis is a lamentable game
laughable graphics repetitive language and foul at that
generic characters populating the streets as in previous games and a unwieldy targeting system
missions dont mean a thing if youve done it all in the previous incarnations of this gamestill stealing taxis and cars  ie boring
its gta again and again nothing innovative or new
talk about milking a franchiseive got so many projects on the burner that occasionally i buy a brandnew game and dont get around to taking the shrinkwrap off for years
this is such a case
but i finally finished it
though i enjoyed vice city tremendously i wont be playing the next installment of grand theft auto
heres whyhave you ever noticed that in the words of margo timmins livings mostly wasting time
well i have
a very small percentage of your time actually goes to doing the thing
most of the time youre simply getting ready to do the thing
youre standing in line for the thing registering for the thing arranging payments for the thing stuck in traffic trying to get to the the thing struggling to get the thing working on your computer etcwell video games have reached such a level of graphic realism that when youre say driving a car down the street in grand theft auto  san andreas it really looks like youre driving a car down the street
it even feels and sounds like a car
same with the bicycle the truck the motorcycle etcthe problem with this game is that driving a car through traffic is boring
so is walking down the streeti dont know how much time i spent in this game simply covering distance
at first i didnt mind it but after hours and hours spent this way the video game is far and away the longest ive ever played  really epic you find yourself putting your ipod on to stave off the boredom
the boredom of a video gameyes folks
this game thinks nothing of having you fail a mission then leaving you in the middle of the desert with no way of getting back to town
the programmers must have thought it was funny but i dontthis could have been fixed easily with a restart mission function but i believe the programmers deliberately neglected to include something like that because they thought players would find it amusing walking hours through the desert
i certainly didnt
i mean video games are the thing that you spent hours in traffic so that you can play
when they themselves are tedious and repetitive theres something basically wrong with the cosmosnow due to the variegated entertainment herein i was on the point of forgiving the gamemakers and pronouncing the game tolerable after all
that was until i got to the maddeningly pointless mission flight school
you can read more details about that particular one elsewhere
but that held up the games progress for days so difficult was it
by the time i finished i forgot what my character was doing and had lost any emotional connection to the game
its not that flight school was particularly difficult though it was it was that it was like the rest of the game a recreation of everyday life that was a little too convincingheres my guess for what happens in the next outing  your character has to brush his teeth launder his underwear and get his cholesterol checkedthis game is unplayable due to multiple crashes despite my updates of graphic sound and directx drivers
the game has not been adequately tested
this is despite six calls to customer service who recommended multiple various audio and graphics setting downgrades deleting settings files and shutting off every other program i have
i also had a very difficult time returning the game once it was opened dont put yourself through this
i loved gta  and vice city and was really looking forward to this game
trust me at least wait until upgrade patches are made before buying this gamecrap game nothing but trash do not buy this game unless you have issues rock star is complete and utter trashi guess i didnt have the right system well it didnt download to my computer
so i wasted about  bucks whatever i dont know if anymore games are gonna come out for psits not worth this price  dollars really you can by it probably for  bucks used at gamestop i really hate when people try to over price things just because they are old there isnt a huge market for video games
its called gamestop the sell ps and up gamesfor wayy cheapgeez oh geez
if your reading a review of this game and have never heard of magna carta please dont mistake all the bad reviews of this game to magna carta  on xbox that game rocks
anyway on to the stinkthe grafics are awful maybe im spoiled by xbox and hd but its hard to make anything out too well you cant turnanywhere so moving is very linear and wierd your thrown magically into this big battle after a quick and horrible battle tutoral
the battle system is the worst and i mean the worst
its over done and complicated theres all this stuff on the screen that you have to pay attention to along with trying to push the right buttons at the excact time they tell you and its next to impossible no room for error to make matters worse when you move around you loose chi when thats gone you cant move anymoreand the big kicker you play completely independent from your teamates i dont mean that their on auto i mean they do nothing they stand there and get hit because you can only control one player at a time and have to switch to get the others to moveswitchswitchswitchcrapcrapcrap
plus a mound of other stupid stuff
i couldnt keep playing this game i would rather die seriously
whoever made this battle system should be drug out and shot
please dont waste your money
but do get magna carta  they got all of the kinks worked outi got this used at gamestop because my friend thought this was really good
hahahathe voice acting is awful the story is trite and uninteresting
the combat is really bad too almost taking advantage of the fact that the developers knew the ps wasnt powerful enough for what you wanted enemies appear faster or slower based on if youre running or walking and repetitivethere is an honor system where you can woo your comrades but its implemented very poorly
you have to talk to them and listen carefully to give them an item they might like
if they dont like the item you lose it and gain nothing
like theyre specific of what they like and in a very long game this can get pretty frustratingcould have gotten somewhere but they relied too much on fanservice and hoping that jrpg junkies would buy into it
hey at least they made a  version which i hear is just as badatlus having ruined stella deus now turn their attention to publishing magna carta a game with a huge number of irritations and flaws
lets take a look at how the game is ruinedthere is a horrible beep at the end of every dialogue press and every time you move the cursor on the screen
its absolutely horrible and serves no purpose at all
so many people have complained about these silly beeps they were in stella deus dds etc yet arrogant atlus did nothing to change this before the american release if you want to turn the sound effects off you get rid of that sound but you also get rid of all the voices and all effect sounds in the game
sound effects and voice are stupidly listed under one settingthere is horrible subtitles spread over  of the screen in every in game dialogue sequence
it ruins them and it cant be turned off
you can turn them off in all other rpgs why not this one
 the battle system is awful and very badly designed
 people take part in combat across a free moving terrain yet there is no ai you must control all  characters
imagine playing star ocean while all the other players stood still as one character moved
laughable and frankly embarrasingafter every kill the charcter repeats a stock phrase like it was over before it started again and again and again
you cant stop this
awfulhitting the opponent requires you to have perfect reflexes and perform a  button combo any miss and you will fail the attack its very awkward to learn and makes combat unenjoyable and dull
think of shadow hearts with a faster ring and the need to be  perfectno widescreen no prog scan only stereo sound
banpresto are way behind the pace nowdays the graphics are below par and some characters are blocky and dont resemble the anime portrait that is in the dialogue boxes
it feels like a game not a living breathing worldatlus used to make great games like smtnocturne and now they publish this
their flagging sales surely signal the end of their foolish publishing decisions
and it was all going so welli wont even grade this onei have been an rpg fan for a long time
i like new and old games alike
this is a review for magna carta tears of blood
though i havent wrote many reviews so im kind of knew at this
im starting to now because i have a solid collection of rpg titles that i would love to write reviews for
i actually just recently played this game yes i am a retro gamer and i play old games when i get around to it
this just happens to be one that i wanted to play so i can get my hands on magna carta  for the xbox  which btw i will be writing a review on that game as well
anyways lets startthe story line of magna carta is bout as generic as you can get
most of the first  hrs of playing involve rescuing this girl named reith
she ends up becoming so under lvled because she is constantly kidnapped through out the game which is really agitating to me
the story does evolve a little bit and gets a little more interesting at around the  hr mark
close to the end of the game
but if your really a die hard jrpg fan you may find some fun in this
because it does have those traditional jrpg elements that most jrpg games have such as exploration of towns taking to npcs etc
i will say the game follows a very straightforward linear path
there is a map layout in which you can select where to go much like most games now a daysthe battle system can be challenging which for people that like a challenge may find it interesting to an extent but it does have its share of problems
you can use up to  characters on a battle field your able to see the monsters on the field before you fight them
so you can execute a preemptive strike which gives you bonuses and an advantage in battle
or you can be surprised by the enimes and your stats and stamina charisma gauge ends up being reduced
before i get ahead of my self let me explain this charisma guage this is basically your gauge to determine when your able to attack
each of your allies and the monsters both have these gauges
like wise if you go into a battle with a higher lvl monster then there gauge will be higher over lapping yours and you will get your ass kicked
when you have a higher charisma gauge you can perform alot more attacks before the other monsters get to have a turn
the combat system relies on using different arts to perform special attacks
its very different system then your average turn based strategy system
well you do have to wait your turn before your charisma guage fills up you can freely move around the battlefield
think of eternal sonata
its very similar to that type of style
the difference is though though when you attack a ring appears on screen you have to press the corresponding buttons at the right time to finish the combo
some of these can become a nuesence because the combo chains are pretty difficult to pull off
also when the other opponent gets to attack it can completely throw off your combo chain
i have ran into more then a few glitches with this type of combat system
this is probably the only thing in the game that like the most thoughthe graphics and art style are very unappealing to me with very little coloring most of the dungeons towns all have the same similar look to them
for a game like this i would expect something more along the lines of ffx or even wild arms would be pleasing to me
but this games graphics almost have a very dark pix elated look to them
like its from one of the older ps one games
one of the most annoying things in this game and probably everyone aggrees with me here
is that battles dont respwn
once you clear an area you cant go back to grind with out hitting certain mile stones in the story this kind of creates a very linear experience
another thing is the use of quests that you can get from weapon smiths that tell you to go out and gather materials so you can upgrade weapons
sure this is a very fun experimental aspect in rpgs that have been used so many times like the star ocean series tales series etc
i swear to god i hit like  hrs in the damn game and i have yet to be able to gather the mats needed to finish those quests
i mean that is just ridiculous
why put quests at the start of the game when you cant even finish them
considering that monsters dont re spawn and you cant backtrack as much
this becomes a real hassle to keep your party strong
whats more is you cant take on two quests at once your only limited to one quest at a time
so i actually found my self stuck in the game to where i could not backtrack to a town and cancel the quest so i can take on the new quests of which i did have the mats foranother thing is the voice acting is absolutely horrendous ive played alot of games but i dont think any game comes close to how bad the voice acting is
maybe arc rise fantasia but thats bout the only game that i can think of that has worse voice acting then this game
in short though the cut scenes dont really make you feel immersed in the story line as much because the voice acting is just down right terriblelike i said if you are a die hard core rpg fan that wants to get there hands on every jrpg game out there you may find some fun in this game and its a bit more challenging then most run of the mill jrpgs
but trust me if you looking for anything remotely close to series like tales star ocean level  games like dragon quest
look else whereim not going to even go into how much this game sucks
just listen to all the reviewers before and after me who wrote negative comments and opinions about the game because they are absolutely  right
i only played it for  hour and it was the only time in my life that i ever felt that  hour out of my life was truly wasted
glad i kept the receipt and got my  dollars back when i returned it to the store the same day i bought it
whewthis is pretty much the worst and most overhyped game of  and made a lot of bottom  lists in many magazines last month
and it bloody deserves itthe problems with this game begin before you even lift it off the shelf in the store
i mean take a look at the cover
its  cent one of the few african american role models around these days in a defencive pose with a stereotypical angry black guy look on his face oh please dont hurt me mr
cent
now i am not a fuddyduddy conservative who blames people like marilyn manson for corrupting kids or whatever because i know kids are more intelligent than adults give them credit for
but america is a very racist country and when  cent misrepresents the black community and backs up the xenophobic myth that all black people are evil or killers or gangbangers in some way i cant help but get very annoyedsecond of all is the fact that this drivel game is no more than a laughable male fantasy
yes i know mr cent has been shot  times but it was all at once with low calibre bullets
its not as if he goes out and gets shot at every day and is immune to all lead fired in the direction of his person
i know  cent has had a really really reeally tough life that i would not wish upon anyone
but when violence and death have haunted you your whole life the last thing you should do is capitalise on a game that glorifies gunplay and gang warfare
thats just disgusting and perverse and if mr cent truly kept it real what a ridiculous meaningless phrase he would treat his demons with respect
using music as a way of working through them is fine but starring in a video game where the main enjoyment comes from blowing people away certainly is not
as i have said there are few african american role models and he should set an example to those following behind him
while his innovative music may have made him a huge success this game smashes any credibility i feel he may have hadthird
well the story to the game is childish and stupid anyway
its not even entertaining accidentally as its just way too dulland fourth
well dont get me started on the horrible targeting system and awful controls
itll make you want to smash your control pad into your tv screen
what a horribly cheaply programmed gamefifth
well that would have to be the bland graphics and tedious environments
it all adds up to a pretty read very unsatisfying experience
mere days after being released most stores had zillions of copies traded in as those foolish enough to buy it blind quickly discovered what a rotten game it is as well as a hideously overindulgent and grossly misjudged vanity piece
beware
graphics csound bgameplay dlasting appeal dthis is one of the worst games ever created
it deserves zero stars
talk about pointless
the graphics are substandard the storyline is nonexistent and the game is solely based on violence
now dont get me wrong i usually dont have a problem with violence in video games but when there is absolutely no other point to the game dont act like it has some story line
mowing down cops and street thugs is not a storyline and it becomes so boring so fast it will make your head spin
youll have more fun throwing your controller across the room after about ten minutes than youll ever get from playing this piece of junk
if this game didnt feature the name  cent it would have landed in the bargin bin immediately
its not even worth the bag it would come in if you were fooled into buying it
dont waste your money on this piece of garbage not even for a rentalfor the record i dont listen to rap  im not into the hiphop lifestyle
maybe people who are into those things might like this game betterim just going off of the gameplaythis game is just horrible just like  of game releases based on a movie or celebrity by far one of the worst releases all year
the character movements are really clunky  the levels are extremely repetative
absolutely nothing original about itthis game wasnt even worth the rental on my gamepass
i feel really bad for the people who got suckered into buying itbottom line if youre into action shootersstay far far away
not even a worthy rental
dont waste your time unless you are into bland gamesinitially this game was really fun
good graphics good team interface with voice chat and good storiesa cleric in our guild hit level  in the first  weeks of gameplay and was capped on xp and he stared alts
my guild had over  players most of which have dropped ddothe reason
content or lack thereof
you can do every quest in this game in about  month
after that youre just repeating the quests for xp to get your character leveled up
and after youre capped at level  theres nothing more for you to do but start a new tooni like the many many people who are dropping ddo are disappointedpros  its fun initially
thats about it
little content compared to almost any other mmorpgcons  turbine seems not to care
they shouldve started witht he red dragon and expanded from there
due to many complaints theyve just added  new quests for low level players wow an extra day of gameplay
nerfing  every update the developers seem to think it necessary to downgrade everything do they this will keep players around
for example a begining level quest used to have an item that anyone could get that would cast  webs per rest now its only   theyve made spells weaker and the enemies more resistant to everything from every class
theyve downgraded the items you get in chests etc
theyve downgraded vendor items as well
you used to be able to get  or better enchanted items for the highest level vendors now it is  stuff that the lower level vendors used to sell
good items are near impossible to find now let alone buy
they change gameplay often making it not as fun
once you get used to a spell or a fighter move etc
working against an enemy they change it so it doesnt
whats the point
they should just give us no powers or skills thats where its headingi cant be more disappointed with this game
its just boring after youve done every quest in the game  times in less than a month
this game sorely needs content
any other mmorpg has at least  times the content ddo does
youre better off getting the day free trial thats about all youll need
after that its a waste of money
 for the game  every month for what
they seem not to care that people on most servers are switching to other games with more content
maybe their happy with always having newbs and losing the hundreds of lvl  playersfun for a while then youll be looking elsewhere with more content
you just dont get your moneys worth with this gamelet me start out by warning potential buyers
this game is not a persistent world mmorpg
i was like many people who had very high hopes for this game
i received a day beta pass with the preorder
lets just say that the box for the retail version never got opened
to loosely quote another reviewturbine made a gorgeous game but forgot to make it fun
i will reiterate what other review writers have stressed as well
this game should not require a monthly service fee
it is ridiculously lacking in game content
if what you are looking for is a dd experience with a group of friends online i highly suggest that you steer clear of this game and its monthly charge
the neverwinter nights series may be a better choice for you
if youre looking to pay  bucks a months to stare at pretty graphics and be bored out of your skull stormreach is your kind of citydungeons and dragons online promised to bring the pen and paper version of the longlived role playing game into the digital world
on all counts it has failed its fans and its namesaketurbine was granted the unprecendented luxury of being able to develop a lost continent region of the eberron campaign setting
it was really a golden opportunity to create a massive multiplayer game that would truly have broken the mold
however turbine instead offers up what is best termed a sterile and infantile version of both the dd game system and the eberron game setting
in fact there is next to nothing about it that you can interact with from the setting outside of a single race  the robotic looking warforgedstormreach itself the sole city on the lost contient is supposed to have been the outpost and colony like city perched on the tip of the new world a  mile sea journey away from the old world and sporting a vast and unexplored landscape available for players to forge their own way
not only that but the city itself was originally a pirate outpost now turned trade center for valuable products eeked out of the nearby jungles to be sent back to khorvaire the old worldas a player in dd online however you wouldnt have the foggiest idea that this stormreach  turbines vision of stormreach  actually had anything to do with the one mentioned above from the campaign settingits literally set up as a clean even pristine city that strikes one as extremely well developed sterile underpopulated and without any sort of intrigue as the powers that be struggle to gain footholds in the only outpost on the whole of the continent
in fact you have absolutely no idea that vast jungles are at the city edge creeping their way into the players gaming lives with threat and mysteryturbines presentation of stormreach is so totally contrary to the campaign setting and so vanilla and sterile even beyond that it fails to draw interest or awe at any point
at its very best its a quirky and oddly colored city that lacks any motivation toward immersive game play
its a place where players drink yummy milk in the taverns you think im kidding
in between their zerg fests to rush to the end of a dungeon that almost everyone has memorized and could play through blindfoldedand as mentioned nothing from the campaign setting other than warforged are included even aside
there are no spells no feats no skills no races no classes  nothing whatsoever that is not related to warforged to find as part of the players involvement in the gameeven what you find for the warforged race is slim and almost trivial
it leaves the impression that turbine believed warforged were what constituted the campaign setting of eberron and that the inclusion or additon of anything beyond wasnt necessaryfor the world of eberron itself it is summed up with a few important and central themes exploration the allpresent influence of magic on society and the world and dynamic high adventurevirutally none of these themes have been given a chance in ddo
there is no exploration not even in the brief amount of dungeon adventures above or below ground
nothing is dynamic about the adventures  they are all utterly static in virtually every sense you can think ofthe content is limited and wholly linear
there is only ever a single way to finish a dungeon they are always filled with the same monsters and the same puzzles and the same traps always in the exact same locations there is very little or no plot or module like game play involved just pure static zerg like dungeon crawlingthe dd rules have been implemented in an extremely slim and haphazard manner
turbine house rules are the order of the day
there was little to no attempt to stay close or true to the original game system
for example all characters at level one receive an automatic  hit point increase
the concept of flatfooted has been eliminated and rules for turning undead have been notably modified
a multitude of other game mechanics and concepts they just dont exist yanked or excluded from the game because well i dont know really
certainly someone will defend it as necessary but i dont see why  surely not on the scale or in the fashion turbine has gone about thingsmany spells and feats do not work all the time or at all on some creatures because the balance has been so out of wack due to an insistence on house rules that they had to make boss encounters difficult by crippling players and buffing creatures in innane waysthere is virtually no ingame or outgame information on what spells feats skills or even many items actually do
how much damage does a magic missile in ddo cause
dunno
they dont want you to know
referring to your dd sourcebooks the phb the dmg the eberron campaign setting will give you little confidence that turbine has implemented them in a similar fashion  chances are they have not
pleas for turbine to include this information has fallen on deaf ears and no reply from the staff there will touch the subject among other thingscurrently there are a mere  dungeons to adventure in across all levels of play  from st to th level
many are brief very imbalanced and not worthwhile to bother with
some are simply broken and unable to be completed they have removed at least  of the major adventures to fix them so far
players are expected to run through dungeons roughly  to  times  on normal  on hard  on elite
huge content imbalances appear across the varied difficulty levels including combat imbalances experience and treasure rewardsmassive parts of the dd game system have been left out entirely or modified nearly beyond recognition
two core classes didnt even make it into release the druid and the monkfree content updates are promised but their first will not even include the much hyped level cap increase purportedly they would be raising the level cap by  or  levels every month or so
a whopping  dungeons will be included in the first content update for april
keep in mind we were told all through beta that they had many many dungeons that were near completion that would be released within the first month of release
do the math   dungeons  levels of play  new dungeons per level that you will still have to run again and again with the same exact contentkey things missing from the game that should have been included on releasedruids and monkshalforcs halfelves gnomeseberrons changlings kalashtar and shifters playable raceseberronss key character class  the artificerdragonmarkscleric domainswizard specializationfamiliars and druidranger animal companionsliterally dozens and dozens of core dd featsbrew potionsscribe scrollscraft rods wands rings etcthe intergral artificier related crafting and skillstoo many spells eberron and standard to even think of namingevil alignmentsdynamic content of any sortmountsany sort of overland adventureexploration areasanything from eberron for players beyond warforgedtrade systems chat channels or auctions of even a minimalist sortspears and polearms of any kinda decent user interfacea decent inventory systema decent encumbrance systemmore than  basic dungeon tilesets if there are more youd be hardpressed to think such a thingactual plots with any meaningi could go on and on about what a dismal failure this game is but if you dont have the point by now nothing will probably convince you
its simply not worth the moneyalready there are some complaints on the forums that server populations are dropping and are scant so grouping on some servers is growing difficult
very bad news for a game with zero solo content yeah yeah you can solo if you dont mind blowing a ton of cash and equipment in the process  but its completely counterproductive
at a minimum a server merge may be called for down the line as a resultin the end the game will end up appealing only to a very small niche of players dedicated not to pnp dd or eberron but specifically to ddo itselfddo does not have a very bright future ahead of it
my urgent advice is to stay far very far away from this gamei tried the free preview of the game which lasted a whole weekend but it never lasted past the update screen before crashing
my system is in great shape and beyond capable of running it by the way with parts made by mainstream manufacturers and i have a broadband connection  so it was the game not anything on my end
i spent the weekend begging turbine for advice on what i might do to actually play the game on their sites forum but got no replies
when the free weekend ended with out even getting to see a pixel of the game i complained  while remaining civil  but got flamed from all sides and my topic was pulled from the board
friendly community
p that weekend was all the impression i needed to give me a sour enough distaste for ddo that ill be hesitant to even give another free preview a try
youd think i was playing an early beta version as bad as it was not the last preview before release
that doesnt bode well for the early days of this mmorpg
to those of you who plan on buying into it anyway good luck
cross your fingers when you get to the update screen
the screenshots are beautiful though too bad i wasnt allowed to see anything like them in motion
maybe in a year or two ill be willing to risk looking into ddo again whenif theyve managed to iron out some of the more basic bugs in the game
meanwhile ill be playing neverwinter nights  nwn online and not having to pay a monthly fee to do it
imagine how much better this game would be had it been made by biowarei am not new to the mmorpg scene
ive most recently played world of warcraft and guild wars i was looking for a similar experience in a more ddbased world
i hoped ddo would be the game for mea mmoversion of neverwinter nights
it wasnteverything about this game is substandard and disappointing
the graphics are very dated and the animation isnt terribly smooth
beyond the first few quests there is no possible way to solo
characters only get xp from completing questsas boring and repetitive as they are
monsters rarely ever drop items
the game does not explain the skills or spells well at all and this coming from someone not alien to the dnd worldin addition to all this i have problems staying connected to the server
it seems like every  minutes i get disconnected and this is something i dont experience in any other mmorpg i play
the technical supportcustomer service is especially poor as welli truly feel like this game was a waste of money
i urge anyone considering this game to try it before purchasing it
in the meantime i will wait for neverwinter nights  since the original was the best ddlike rpg ive ever playedi have played only a little pen  paper pnp dungeons and dragons in my life but this game is nothing like it
i have been searching a long time for a computer game that can come close to the depth pnp providessadly i have come to the conclusion the only way to really enjoy dd is to play it pnp the way it was intened
i wasnt very happy with the baldurs gate games too hard in pnp or in a neverwinter nights multiplayer game a dm can adjust the difficulty on the fly too linear poor graphics poor multiplayer
however the baldurs gate games came a lot closer to dd then this game does
the baldurs gate games were a lot more than just dungeon crawlers alingment played a big part in the game
this game is a dungeon crawler thats it
this game completely ignores other vital parts of dd that even baldurs gate and neverwinter nights included such as alignment
that is what seperates dd from other games is how important alinment is
actually neverwinter nights sadly while not an mmorg is a lot more funner and closer to pnp in multiplayer mode then this game
especially neverwinter nights custom content where players tweak the game to include extra stuff in there such as alinment dieties food and rest rules added roleplaying rules
neverwinter nights while the game itself is not that great the custom modules dms create make the game very close to pnp
unfortunately a side effect with any game that players have to pay a monthly fee to play dms cant be strict about who they allow to play the game after all that would be a stupid money making decision
so you are not getting the best  roleplayers and in turn it ruins the game
at least with neverwinter dms can be picky about who they allow on their server require players to actively contribute to game content kick out antisocial solo players there is no such thing as a solo pnp game and write a bio about there character that must be well written
this is the heart of pnp and this game completely omits this
characters on some neverwinter servers must roleplay their alingment well or else be punished
alignment is completely out of the picture in this game
in dd players need to pray to a diety to gain favor and in turn the diety will help the player out
again many neverwinter nights servers include this aspect of gameplay but stormreach completely omitted it
other online games do a much better job of including a lot of added details about characters lives in the game than this game such as star war galaxies world of warcraft ulitma online and everquest
the  a month is not justifiable for this game save your money play a different online gameafter reading some of the reviews ive decided to stick with what i know is a great dd title
for those who are hesitating to purchase this game or have and found it disappointing try neverwinter nights by bioware
it still has a community that is alive  well
new content is being released by bioware  its community frequently
there are still active open servers  plenty of guilds to join for a more tailored to your liking experience
nwn diamond has  stars from its customers
i purchased it as a preorder and after nearly  years im still having a blastplus unlike ddo nwn is not a paytoplay game
it has provided me with truly limitless adventures and countless hours of enjoymentmicrosoft strikes again
amazon had this game for  cheaper for xbox than ps so i bought the xbox version
what idiot wouldnt
well as it turns out im the idiot
microsoft has struck again as this game is not and i repeat not supported on xbox  which is probably why its so much cheaper than the ps version on this fine site
my  informed me to check microsofts site for an update list of playable xbox games which hasnt been updated since november bill gates you owe me i hoe i will be abli to figyre this gane out
i am quite sure or at will tyry to figure this game outgrey steinkei cant believe this game got released in this present form
the graphics are some of the worst ive ever seen on the ps
the frame rate is horrid
ive seen smoother frame rates on the nintendo 
the visuals are so bad and the controls are so jerky that i cant even begin to get into this game
thank goodness i only paid  for itthis is the last time lucasarts steals my money
so much expectation and publicity fot this piece of trash
they say it was going to be much better but it isnt
the graphics of battlefront are much better than this one the graphics for part two are graphics of pc or nintendo are graphics of pc games of the mid s for example dark forces
the resolution its terrible a child can make them much better
the missions are easy and the ai isnt as good as they say
i dont care if there are new planets and troopers and if you can control jedis the game is boring and repetitive
the sequel is the end for this game
i want my stolen money backit started fine but was dim
then it shut down completelyi thought it was the telly at first because it was so odd
but it wasnt
i dont care i dont like that style of game anywayokayits like this ive been playing video games for almost  years now and xmen legends ii has secured a special place in my hall of shame as the most problematic bugridden game ever
and this is a darn abominable shame because the game itself is actually a lot of funfirst of all the game loves to crash on me when i least expect it
when i visit beastforges shop and choose the see equipment option the game will sometimes kick me out to the title screen
and if i havent saved my game in the last  seconds byebye unsaved progress
the same thing tends to happen when im using the danger room computer or using an xtraction point to change my team the screen will go black and ill find myself back at the title screenthe hero stash is another source of frustration
youre allowed to keep up to  things in there but ive discovered that anytime i exceeded  all the equipment from beastforges shop that was for sale would just vanish
thats right beastforge would suddenly just stop selling stuff to you except for potions and the grab bag and i could not get the shop to start offering stuff again even after i got rid of some stuff from the hero stashalso you probably noticed that defeated enemies and breakable objects often cough up tech bits and more rarely armor and equipment
ive noticed that all this stops right around the end of chapter  i cant get any money tech bits from that point on no matter how many enemies i beat
how the heck am i supposed to buy potions and armor and equipment without any moneyall these bugs have screwed up my save data permanently several times already and ive had to start the game over from the beginning each time hoping that i can do something differently each time to avoid the bugs but no such luck
frankly im now sick of tryingwhat was raven software doing with this game
did they even have a quality assurance department
hey raven you guys need to come out with x men legends  and you need to address the bugs
thats the only way youll make up for releasing an unfinished game onto the market
and you guysd better make sure this never happens againi played and enjoyed xmen legends i but i am terribly disappointed by this sequel
ive encountered many glitches in this game
in fact this may be the worst game ive ever played as far as glitches go
its as if the developers didnt even care the glitches in this game couldve easily been detected and fixed if they had tested it adequately
for a game with so much hype and anticipation there is no excuse for putting out a shoddy product
i know im in the minority here because most people on the web are enthralled by this game because it does have many playable characters mutant powers etc
and the game mechanics are reasonably sound but for me the game is frustrating and unplayable
i personally dont like playing a game with so many bugs
i wouldnt pay more than  for this game because the only thing its really good for is to be able to run around and bash things with xmen skins
there are many other games out there that are more polished and are a better use of your timethis is one of marvels more pathetic attempts at a video game
and probably one of the worst games out there as far as playstation is concerned
why
because while the gameplay and controls are fun the actual game itself is filled with glitches subpar graphics and some levels are almost impossible to get through unless you have a stroke of luck and find out what exactly you are supposed to be doinglike marvel
like the xmen
well buy the game based on the movie instead of buying this
this is just pathetic
even the first spiderman game was betterbehold the awesome power of the sega cdsonic cd is regarded as the best game for segas disastrous early s system
personally i think the best mega cd game wasumthere were none
the console was an enormous flop which hurt sega badly
but if sonic cd is supposed to represent the system at the apex of its powers then just how bad were the truly bad gamesill answer that question in another review if i ever get to play them
but for the moment ill focus on the abyss of disappointment that is sonic cddevelopment began in  before the release of sonic  thus the general appearance and level design is very close to that of the original sonic which dates the game badly for those of you who are more used to the polished slicker quicker feel of the sequels
sometimes youll go slow youll begin to wonder why it wasnt called chronic cdthe levels themselves useless timetravel feature aside and boring and unengaging you just breeze through them with little effort and no admiration
theres nothing that stands out and nothing truly define each level with its own personality or style
the boss battles are also so easy a blind gamer could do it no sweat
and dont even get me started on those awful awful special stageswhy this is regarded as being the mega cds must have is beyond my understanding and im a man of noble intelligence
for a system that charged the consumer   youd expect to have your mind blown by the content but sonic cd rates even lower that sonic still at least the music is pleasantgraphics dsound bgameplay dlasting appeal fbefore i write my review i want to share with you all a review written about this game by reiner of gameinformer magazine to prove to you that i am not the only one that thinks that this game suckswait this game is mislabeled
this isnt shadow the hedgehog
its that miserable broken the hedgehog
with the scent of a dirty diaper permeating from his speedy wake this killer of classic gaming franchises does what he does best
he sucks
not since bubsy have i seen a mascotbased action game corner the market in unresponsive controls disastrous level designs inconsistent framerates traumatizing character designs and my personal favorite just being flat out broken
at the very least this game has its place in the history of gaming for that
shame on you sega
now for my review if you have any sense of selfworth or decency dont buy this game
if you do its just a waste of your money
you ask why isnt this review longer
frankly because reiner already said what needed to be said
listenthis was my first time ordering anything from here
the delivery was great
i received a defective game after the description about the product stated that it worked
i did get my refund for it but am very disappointed that it did not workit seems that ever since segas mascot sonic the hedgehog entered the d adventure world the series emphasis on speed has been lost in translation
shadow the hedgehog is no exception but where previous d sonic titles were at least fun to play shadow the hedgehog is absolutely horrible from beginning to end
the first thing youll notice is that the frame rate is choppy and it mars what would be otherwise solid graphics and the games camera seems to want to work against you
the platforming elements are clunky and are made clunkier by the godawful controls
also sega seems to want to inject an edgier story with shadow including adding some minor curse words in the dialogue as the mysterious hedgehog takes on evil aliens
not to mention that the ability to use guns has been added as well but this element isnt just unnecessary its mind boggling
i can remember when sonic games were fast and fun even the sonic adventure games on the dreamcast were great but ever since sega has transformed into a third party developer and publisher theyve dropped the ball on making a truly great sonic game
all in all no matter how much of a fan you are of the series avoid this title at all costs
shadow the hedgehog isnt fun and its one of the worst games sega has come up with in a very long timelets list whats wrong with this game as there are so many thingsawful voice acting that ruins any sense of atmospherevery cheap production with events happening in a d storyboardvery childish with horrible dialogue such as sheeesh now hush up young man and the main character being patronised constantly
dreadfulawful setting up with the female lead as the girlfriend from the very start
even though there are much cooler and better women in the game
the hero always gets the pluckey tomboy cheesydull combat with a single attack button as bad as shining tears
did sega not play star ocean  when they decided on real time combatnot great graphics
no widescreen no prog scan it looks like a game not a living real worldbad status screen that has the main character blinking constantly as if he were having a fitforget this game and dont give sega your money and encourage them to produce more generic nonsenseits all too easy to draw parallels between mario and sonic the hedgehog
the classic mascot characters have endured the years to become videogame icons recognized and loved by millions of game addicts around the globe
nintendos fat italian plumber helped pioneer the platformer genre and segas blue hedgehog transformed it completely placing a new emphasis on speed and rollercoasterinspired level designs
in the old days mario and sonic stood on even ground each taking lead roles in an impressive selection of critically acclaimed titles
but as the years passed and consoles become more and more powerful marios inevitable jump to the third dimension faired much better than sonics
case in point super mario  is remembered even today as one of the greatest games of all time
sonic adventure for sega dreamcast is conversely thought of as a flawed but still enjoyable sequel by hardcore fans and an altogether broken platformer by everybody elseit is more than a little puzzling therefore that developers sega studios usa and sonic team continue to draw upon that archaic clunky design for various hedgehogbased sequels
sonic adventure  for instance hit dreamcast and was later ported to gamecube with the same fundamental mechanics and shortcomings that blemished the original title
and now the software house has created shadow the hedgehog for gamecube playstation  and xbox a game that looks and plays like it was designed for dreamcast a full six years ago
sonics darker half occasionally shines in the same way that its predecessors did  namely with an impressive sense of speed and dazzling stages complete with trademark twists and turns
and its solely for these reasons that anybody who defends the original sonic adventure will probably like shadows one
alternatively though players unimpressed with sonics dreamcast outings will find more of the same here and unlike a fine wine age has not improved the formulaidentity crisisshadow the hedgehog seems to be sonic teams unofficial attempt at aging up its platformer games and as a result the title regularly deals with slightly darker and more convoluted themes that center on the balance between good and evil
the story is kickstarted by a gorgeously rendered fullmotion animation cinematic that introduces players to the troubled hedgehog who has recently lost his memory and is struggling to come to grips with his place in the world
the tale picks up after the events in sonic heroes and consequently shadow can only vaguely recall in flashbacks that there was a girl named maria he may have loved her and she was murderedshadow isnt allowed much alone time before his thought process is so rudely interrupted by the sounds of war and destruction
an alien threat called black arms explodes onto the scene and demolishes everything in its path including nearby city skyscrapers
this is again all illustrated in impressive fma cutscenes that seasoned sonic fans will undoubtedly appreciate
shadow observes this phenomenon with a level of indifference before he is approached by a demonlike figure known as black doom who leads the extraterrestrial forces
the menacing entity acts as though he knows shadow and commands the hedgehog to retrieve the seven powerful chaos emeralds located throughout the land
the antihero begrudgingly agrees but only because black doom promises to restore his memory immediately after the artifacts are collectedthis oddball setup is supposed to extend into and become an integral part of the gameplay experience
shadow is out for himself and therefore he can and in fact does switch allegiances depending on the preferences of players
the hedgehog can be made to carry out black dooms commands or he can switch sides and team up with sonic and friends or even dr eggman
changing teams is as simple as tapping the dpad during gameplay
one quick tap and shadow will find himself being guided to various goals such as destroying gun
troops for black doom
another tap and sonic and friends will appear at his side to fight against the black armsthe concept itself is intriguing primarily because it enables gamers to choose different paths for themselves as the hero advances through the adventure
the choices made will have a direct bearing on the stages that follow thanks to a branching storyline that allows for several possible paths and endings
this is a clever way to extend replay value and were confident that completionists will play through the title several times switching allegiances so that they may see everything that there is to seehowever observing the unique goals per different allegiances is a messy undertaking marred by poor design
the fact of the matter is that any level of serious planned strategizing is wholly unobtainable in the intensely frantic makeup of the game whose mechanics perpetually dart shadow forward with both limited visibility and control
in turn even when gamers are trying to fight alongside sonic and friends they will accidentally dispose of hordes of allies and even zoom into and activate switches or complete puzzle components that they should ignore
this truth renders the entire operation of choosing sides more or less uselessspeed loops and guns but very little fundreamcast owners will already have an unfortunately accurate idea of how shadow the hedgehog plays and for that matter looks
to be brief like sonic adventure before it
what this means is that speed and forward momentum are emphasized over control puzzles or to be frank depth
honestly that isnt always a bad thing
shadow like sonic before him has his redeeming gameplay moments
were referring to the rollercoasterlike stages complete with loopdeloops corkscrews and pinball bouncers that send the hedgehog zigzagging up and down environments at remarkable speeds
because these scenarios are still plentiful undeterred supporters of sonic teams efforts will undoubtedly find something to like about shadows questthat noted these thrillride fundamentals have outworn their welcome as far as were concerned
just because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that sonic team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome
admittedly shadow is at its best when the character is zipping through s and or skating a rollercoaster track
but its also during these moments that the game plays itself
it is in fact possible for participants to put their controllers down for seconds at a time and simply watch what unfolds
how is relinquishing control for what amounts to watching shadow tumble through a scripted corkscrew a rewarding play environmentunfortunately for sonics darker half there are allnew problems exclusive to his adventure
the very first level in shadow the hedgehog is a shining example of spectacularly lackluster game design and probably one of the worst single stages that weve played in any title for many months
the reluctant hero is thrust into a drab environment and immediately nudged forward  right into a progression of objects including obstructing walls and enemies
disappointingly the platformer also features a horrendously malfunctioned camera system that catches on environments or even occasionally runs amok for no particular discernible reason
the result
commonly frustrating undertakings where the goal is to burst forward and gain speed but before that can happen shadow crashes into enemies and loses rings or simply goes careening off a ledge
these impossibly trying outcomes are worsened because shadow moves loosely through the worlds he explores which at times makes precision navigation an insurmountable hurdlethe character can unlike sonic wield a number of imposing weapons from massive swords to explosive projectiles
but in a move that again harkens back to the days of dreamcast there is no lockon system in place and therefore what is a simple process in other titles is overly complex and cumbersome here
successfully targeting and unloading a bazooka shot at an enemy may as well be left to chance
sonic team has positioned shadows gunplay as a primary selling point to the platformer but in practice the mechanics are really not that enjoyablerecycled technology and replicated production values have ensured that shadow the hedgehog looks and sounds almost exactly like its sonicbased predecessors
to sonic teams credit there are more than  levels in the game and each is varied in design
some areas have a futuristic look to them while others feature large metropolis backgrounds and more still take shadow through lava and forest settings
meanwhile the game engine draws long stretching locales populated with a moderate number of polygonal characters
and on gamecube and xbox the fluidity usually aspires for the  frames per second mark with some dips
the playstation  version is noticeably more sluggish despite the fact that it is visually lacking compared to its counterparts
and yet these are small graphic victories especially when held to todays more robust standards
shadow oftentimes looks like it could have been designed for dreamcast simply because the worlds and characters lack polygon numbers which leads to a generally square presentation void of curvy shapes
worse is that many of the games textures are downright muddy especially when the camera malfunctions and pans up close as it consistently does
and overall character animation is primitive and incomplete when compared to the majority of todays gamesshadow the hedgehog is proof that sonic team needs to get with the program if it plans to compete with legitimate current and next generation software
this is sonic adventure with guns and less polish and players today are far more discerning than they were six years ago
diehard sonic fans will cling to the fact that the title still conjures up corkscrews and loopdeloops as well as an impressive sense of speed when shadow really gets moving and this is all true
but this doesnt make up for the games long list of shortcomings from stupid level design unrefined controls and useless gunplay to disappointingly outdated graphicsbefore i write my review i want to share with you all a review written about this game by reiner of gameinformer magazine to prove to you that i am not the only one that thinks that this game suckswait this game is mislabeled

shadow was supposed to be this awsome character but in this game hes like an evil overlord or something the story was terrible 
eggman dies in multiple endings 
and shadow curses 
the only reason this gets  stars for fun is because the levels are okay and the sonic x voices are awsome 
shame on you segasonic the hedgehog was a big favourite of mine back in the  bit days but since the move to d the series has taken a serious nose dive
first we had the flawed bug ridden mess that was sonic adventure on dreamcast then we got the sligthly impproved nd adventure game which appeared to have suffered from dodgy camera sindrome
you would think after all that things would start to improve well you are in for a big supprise because they actually manage to get worst with sonic heroes
that game suffered from appalling controls a horrible camera and terrible new characters
and now we come to shadow the hedgehog a game so awfull youll find yourself crying at what sonic team has done to this once great series of games
a sonic character with a gun is not something i want to see and im sure the same goes for every other true fan of the blue hedgehog
shadow is an appalling mess horrible controls dull unsonic like graphics and a sad attempt to make sonic mature by giving the lead character a weapon
do yourself a favour and avoid this drosssonic the hedgehog on the playstation  and xbox  has gotten arguably the worst rep of any sonic game out there but theres one game i can easily recall that deserves as much negativity
that game is this monstrosity
i was at least able to find sonic  to be a guilty pleasure of some sort but this game is just bad
theres a lot of questions raised that shouldnt even be here in the first place
why does shadow have to have weapons
why do the characters curse all of a sudden
to make the game edgy
give me a break
arguably the worst offender in this is why do there have to be branching pathstruth be told i bought shadow the hedgehog via featurepoints for amazon gift cardsdidnt exactly use real money just to play through its neutral pathway in the game which only requires me to get to the end of each level and nothing more
there was a bit of fun to be had in fact the gunplay isnt too shabby but that fun was bombarded with tons of unnecessary thingsthe level design is bad
in the first level westopolis dont be surprised if you run straight into several inexplicable explosions while just trying to get a move on
other levels dont exactly have as much frustrations but there are still general problems like not being able to get a good view of where to jump at certain points and control that feels slipperier than in sonic heroes
instances such as the shadow clones to fight in one of the later levels though get very tedious
playing through the game would really suck if you do not grab a gun to shoot with because shadows homing attacks dont deal damage nearly as quick and you can forget about his punchkick attacksif you thought the voice actors in sonic heroes were too cringing for you then youre going to be absolutely annoyed with the new kidssonic x voice casts work done here
at nearly every turn in a level a character shadow meets earlier in the level feels the need to say something
and if youre not doing what heshe says you should do the character will just complain or scold at you for not doing so
leave me alone npcs
either way the voices here are awful with the lone exceptions being sonic and dr eggman
yes i even disliked shadows new voice actor
he didnt even sound much like shadow in the gameyoud think at least the music would be good right
welllnot really
shadow the hedgehogs soundtrack is mostly crappy with few exceptionsif all of that wasnt bad enough you apparently are not supposed to be happy with the ending you get after playing through the handful of levels youve chosen to play through
yep
in one playthrough you just have to play six levels but for the sake of replayability doing a hero or evil mission will lead you to different levels entirely but each and every mission in this game with exceptions being to just make it to the end of a level is a boring dull painful chore
most of them consist of nabbing excessive amounts of objects
ill leave it at thatoh did i say for the sake of replayability
oh im sorry
what i meant to say was for the sake of unlocking the final story segment
yeahlike sonic adventures and heroes theres a final story segment
they really shouldnt have done that for this kind of game
it completely throws the whole premise out the windowughi believe ive gone long enough here
just stay away from this title if youre looking for an even decent sonic title
whether it be the adventure titles heroes or even recent ones like sonic colors generations or unleashed theyre all better than this game
steer cleari dont get it
why the heck did segaor sonic team made asonic game with bad words in it
if they were no bad words this game would have been better
thats why i gave the rating  star
its fun but too many bad wordsare you a longterm sonic fan
would you like to feel like sega shafted you in favour of casual gamers and gta fans
heres your game
a transparent cynical coldhearted rushed cashgrab an inferior version of existing sonic games with a blatantly tackedon  gun system to sell to the omglolgunzrcool crowd
buy sonic rush instead thats a sonic game
im not offended by the language or the violence im offended by the lack of respect this game shows to the sonic franchise
