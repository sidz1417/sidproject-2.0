if you like rally cars get this game you will have funit is more oriented to european market since here in america there isnt a huge rally fan party
music it is very european and even the voices from the game very english accentthe multiplayer isnt the best but it works just oki had dirt  on xbox  and it was an okay game
i started playing games on my laptop and bought a few new games to build my collection
this game is very fun to play
it is so much better than dirt  if you like racing games you should check this out
the graphics are perfect on my compteroverall this is a well done racing game with very good graphics for its time period
my family has has enjoyed playing it a great deal
i personally think a steering wheel controller is almost a necessity for this game but an x box type controller would probably work
the keyboard would be almost impossible and not very fun
the windows live system detracts greatly since you must log in and be online to play or save game progress
there was a mees up with my live log in and the game would no longer accept my activation code and i had to rebuy the game if i wanted to play
there is no customer support at all
dirt  suffers from this serious flaw as well
  star game  star windows live featurei initially gave this one star because it was crashing on me constantly but i recently narrowed it down to a plugin i was using for my porsche wheel
game plays well and looks gorgeous when image spanned across three monitors
i would have given it five stars if it wasnt for the annoying microsoft games for live application that makes you go through hoops to set it up and causes problems of its own occasional crashesin todays game market its easy to miss racing games that arent part of the licenseheavy forza or gran turismo franchises
dirt  for pc is in an even worse boat than most since its been a giveaway for a couple years now with every dx compliant ati video card
as a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to ebay and most people who do play it have not bought it newthis is a shame because dirt  is a fun little game
theres a great assortment of multinational tracks and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from
as a rally game dirt  ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns
dirt  wears a veneer of noisy fun arcadestyle game play but under the hood it calls for quick reactions a good understanding of road surfaces and nerves of steel
sadly it also calls for a gamepad or wheel you will almost certainly find the keyboard too allornothing for serious racingprosvisually stunning engine that makes full use of directx  effectssoundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely european and not too intrusivesuccessfully models an arcadelike complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handlingincar camera gives a stomachchurning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and wheel hairpinsprobably the most realistic depiction of driftingpowersliding to appear in a video game its frightening nauseating and usually a bad idead supportconslower difficulties arent much fun highest difficulty is brutally hardsmall fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers dirt  players seem pretty nice thoughessentially requires some sort of analog inputmay confuse players who arent familiar with the rules and conditions of rallystyle racingother thoughtsyou need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to youtube
i dont think codemasters wants to rip you off but if it makes you uncomfortable create a new google identity for use with dirt  easylearn the tracks
learn the tracks learn the tracks learn the tracksif you want to win employ a finworks good however is not like a new with a little not important defect in appearancereally good and works fantasticso its definitely original and true to formula but there are a few aspects about this game that just dont make sense to me
the cellshaded graphics take some getting used to but i like themmy biggest complaint is that sometimes id be sailing somewhere and could leave make a sandwich eat that sandwich and come back and still not be at my destination
also not including the sideobjectives its a relatively short gameis it better
no
is it a zelda worthy of the title
yeah
i recommend at least playing it before making judgments or assumptionswhile the product is what it is described as it unfortunately will give me no signal whatsoever
i believe it is a fault of the av cable side as plugging that in unplugging it blowing on it hissing at it calling it names then plugging it back in seems to make it work again
i did check and have the problem across more than one tv so its not the tvs fault
i have no way to determine with confidence if it is a fault of the wii but i doubt so as the wii has no problem with its standard definition cabling that it came with why wii did you not include componenthdmi cabling by default
hd isnt that rare
ah but it is the most inexpensive version of this cable i could find and the picture is markedly better using this than the original cablingthis is a nice little arcade game with good graphics and some good chatter
its fun to play with after spending time with dcs blackshark
its a good shootem up
enjoyableanyone who has ever played a flight sim can tell this is not like awarthog just by reading the info on the gamethis is an arcade type game with some sim stuff add to make it sell more and be kind of fun and fast to playsometimes we all just want to blow the blank out of things and unwindthis is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it isa gameif you want a real flight sim this is not itif you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is itthe target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a simthis was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for its timeyou will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx or betteryou can max out all setting with one evga gtxti gb video cardthe install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first timethis all takes min or so counting the install of the gameit is what it is and thats a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and theni have a solid system and have had no issues running this at allif you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits this is not for youtry awarthog or wings over europe or wings over vietnam or ilthese are flight sims and run well on any solid sysetm with xp or windows  runningi love this simulator it is a lot of fun controlling ships and boats
i only wish the color was better because all the water is usually grey
but other than that you will have a great time if you love shipsthis silicone cover has a very nice feel to it
dont use this with dirty hands dirt will stick to it
this is a ok product for your  controllerhave had this skin for almost  months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good
its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so
it protects the controller fairly well
keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controlleroverall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods
the only problem i have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides
its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it
not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since i plan on cutting it off anyways
plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart
will update my review if it doesnt last longthis is not the first one of these i have had in fact this is about my th
there are many different skin types and different skin makers so you have to judge each on its own merit
my controller skin arrived today well ahead of expected delivery just as described solid black and silicone
fit is just perfect and installation had no problems
good comfortable smooth texture while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic
i like to clean my game equipent regularly and i always clean even new items before using
this is a great way to test the quality of the item i cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol no gumming like you get with lower grade skinsand no color bleed onto the rag this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff
once on the controller grip is good comfort is good feel is natural
i am very pleased with this controller skin i have been needing to get one for my extra controller
i will definitly be ordering a few more later a friend has a birthday coming upmy lady dug out her kids old gamecube and games and started playing her old favorite harvest moon titles
she quickly discovered the memory card wasnt there anymore when she couldnt save her games
so in search i wenti was surprised to find these were still available and not too expensive
this one does the trick has room for quite a few saves
she is happy so i am happythis allows me to preserve whatever precious space i have left on my console for other stuff
i may purchase another one in the near futurethese things work really great and can be combined for even longer cable lengths but be warned that the rubber shielding seems to slip around the plug head
not a big deal but could lead to eventual shortmy living room is fairly large so these chords make it nice to play games which require the old controllers
my family can play video games from the comfort of our couch rather than sitting on the hard floor close to the consolethis is eaiser than the first one but its pretty fun i liked it
you get to play some original characters like bad mister frosty taffy the blob  bonker ickybodclaymy favoriteif you liked this game then check out clayfigter c judgement clay clay fighter extreme clayfighter   sculptors cut clay fighter tournament editionwhy do so many people love to hate the clay fighter series
okay even ill admit that the genesis installments were far from masterpieces
but this one gets almost everything righti first read about this game in an old back issue of nintendo power from  it mentioned numerous characters that eventually got the axe some like lady liberty and the zappa yow yow boys were remolded for the sculptors cut released to rental outlets
another hobocop was gone for good
however since i only had molassesfast dialup i was unaware of these facts
when i saw it along with a nintendo  in a game store less than a year later i knew i had to have it
as the first n game i ever owned it may not receive a totally objective evaluation but ill try my hardest to be fairthe one thing that immediately jumps out at the player is the selfmocking sense of humor
the moment you see the p in the interplay logo fall apart into a c you know what youre in for
during fights the characters themselves spew out oneliners and funny quips almost as much as they do punches while this gets repetitive after a while it still brings on a chuckle or twoas one would expect the fighters are all made out of clay and animated via stopmotion
while a few namely ickybod clay are a little uninspired the rest are a joy to behold and all are animated smoothly with nary a hint of pixelation
unfortunately the polygonal backgrounds while often funny in their own right dont hold up nearly as well they range from decent to horribly angularthe selection of characters is slightly limited at the start giving you nine clay combatants but three more can be unlocked
numerous characters return from the previous outings including mainstays bad mr frosty the blob and taffy
ickybod clay and bonker return from the first game and hoppy from c judgement clay not making that up comes back as thoppy
the other fighters include kung pow houngan and interplays own earthworm jim
the characters are balanced well for the most part and their moves are just as funny as the fighters themselvesmy favorite aspect of this game is the control
the ns controller has its share of detractors who say its not ideal for fighting games they couldnt be more wrong
the sixbutton scheme works in the same way as other oneonone fighters but here each level of punch or kick weak medium and brutal has a noticeable difference
the combos are also easy to grasp and easy to execute something that few fighting games as of late are able to get rightthe story as with most fighting games is so inconsequential as to be vestigial but its slightly humorous nonetheless
basically dr kiln who took control of the clay meteor in judgement clay is now trying to take over the world by spreading the clayified state to the whole planet and then he can somehow control it
i dunno but you fight him as the last bossoverall this game is certainly the best in the series
anyone who likes fighting games at all should grab this as its certainly worth clayingi have been a fan of the whole of the clay fighter series and i have to say that i am slightly disappointed with this one
the graphics are okay there are plenty of characters to choose from but i think that it is far to easy and that the game had been rushed
the price is excellent and i recommend to everyone that you get this as the price of this game wont be around for long
if you want the best fighting game on the n then i wouldnt recommend this but if you want some fun then this is the game for youwith the genre monopolized by the the final fantasy series it is not suprising that this game is absent from most peoples top rpg list
to clarify it is not as good as an ff game but it is nonetheless enjoyable and funthe story is pretty linear the characters are well developed and part iii offers much of the same fun that was the original bof for the snes which was produced by squaresoft not capcom
the only drawback is the clunky controls which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners
and while the graphics are not on par with final fantasy ix or chrono cross this is still a great looking gametry it
i think you will like itbasically breath of fire  stole a lot of ideas from its predecessor this one
its kinda like a degraded breath of fire  actually but still truly brilliant and well worth buyingafter defeating xenogears i was looking for a game that was fun to play and didnt require me to do much thinking
xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic yet confusing plot that really made you think
breath of fire  is a complete change of pace
instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like ff and xenogears breath of fire  continues a simple but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like xenogearsbreath of fire  doesnt have an overly confusing story
once long ago there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan
after gaining enough power to destroy the world the dragon clan suddenly disappeared
you play as ryu a young boy who suffers from amnesia
he soon befriends two thieves named rei and teepo
after he gets into trouble with the authorities he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan
so he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious pastsound original
sorry but if its originality that you want you wont find it here
even the battle system is painfully unoriginal
as you play it it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it
the story the battle system everything feels like it was used many times before and i hate to say this but the ending is very disappointinghowever with all gripes aside breath of fire  is a fun and engaging quest
my favorite part of the game was the characters they are interesting and very funny
i also liked that the plot never once got confusing
even though it was unoriginal it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seatwith all the complaints aside breath of fire  is fun game to play through
after playing through a monster game like xenogears it is refreshing to play
unfortunately dont get too excited about the endingthis was the only breath of fire game ive beaten
but i must say that it was fun
the story and side quests kept me goingone of the downers was that you cant hardly change your anglea big thumbs up going to the fact that you dont have to change screens to get into a battle like chrono trigger
this saves lots of time and makes thing more dramatic
fighting in narrow hallways and thick forests was greatim not going to spoil it for anyonebut the ending sucked badly
but not enough to stop me from buying the next sequelbreath of fire iii arrives almost three years after the funbut strictly orthodoxsuper nes title breath of fire ii
although bofiii isnt a radical departure from the earlier games in the series dont let that turn you off its reassuring to see that sprite graphics havent given way entirely to origamistyle polygons
sporting a quasimedieval european setting a heroic story line and turnbased battles bofiii will appeal to fans of squares final fantasy series and working designs lunar titles
an epic journey breath of fire iii starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before its captured
the dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named ryu who is befriended by a pair of delinquents whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people
ryu is left for dead but his dragon powers revive him so he sets off in pursuit of his friends captors unaware that hes about to be drawn into an everdeepening pool of danger deceit and death
like earlier bof titles ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey
nina the princess of windia makes another appearance in the series although in this game shes apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations
ryu too shares the name of a character from the series but hes also unrelated
however gobi from the first bof game makes a cameo appearance
nostalgic graphics graphically bofiii is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors
texturemapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds terrain and buildings while sprites are used to compose the various characters
more animation colors and special effects have been added to this version but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the bof games
the threequarteroverhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles but not to any great extent
battles are fought directly on the field map with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions two are seen from the front and two from the rearsolid craftsmanship the battle system is turnbased with some consideration given to quickness characters move in sequence to their speed parameter
for example in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down
also certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting
beyond the usual manual magic and item attacks characters can transform into dragons
initially only ryu has the power to transform and only when hes far into the game but the other characters gain that power later
transformation though requires crystals called dragon genes and ap magic points for the genes chosen
by combining up to three genes different dragons can be created the more genes you use the more powerful your dragon though youll use more ap
ap is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle
finally you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells
the construction of breath of fire iiis battle systemand of the whole game for that matteris very polishedthanks to excellent controls
you wont be moaning about the way this game handles
sound bites however all isnt well in bofiii
the sound effects are fine if not particularly inspired
in battle the characters emit rudimentary shouts screams and spell names but not much more
and even though the sounds can get annoying theyre not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack
the music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz and more often than not it doesnt add to the atmosphere of the story
the music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy rpg
aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack bofiii is worth a long look from rpg fans
although it doesnt possess the visual and aural magnificence of final fantasy vii which few games will ever accomplish breath of fire iii holds up as a very enjoyable rpg in which sure craftsmanship is easily evidentforgotten amidst the blood of mortal kombat and d presentations of virtua fighter and tekken the street fighter ii series initiated the fighting game craze
whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws street fighter iis strength was superb wellbalanced uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master
street fighter collection accurately reproduces that gameplay making for an excellent anthology but not a flawless onefirstly the omission of the first three iterations of street fighter ii is glaring
given the lack of complexity of those games one has to wonder if capcoms developers were too lazy or their marketers too greedy to finish those titles for this release instead leaving them for street fighter collection ii
graphically the games are preserved admirably although cd audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up unlike in the arcade games
the long load times are excruciating as is each title requiring its own memory card block when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single blockthe inclusion of street fighter alpha  gold is nice but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection
perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original street fighter alpha  to market and tried to save face by placing the more polished gold version in this compilation
and since this third title requires its own memory card block street fighter collection actually requires three blocks in all not one as is advertised on the packagingstill all three games have withstood the test of time and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value
but the aforementioned drawbacks of the street fighter ii games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a wholefinally after years of seeing mega man in d shooter sidescroller gameplay capcom began to realize the video game scene was changing and realism was becoming more important than ever
so in  capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old mega man games and bring mega man to an entire new d world
i finally got to experience the d mega man adventure a few days ago in july   so it took me nine years to finally play it
what can i say
im slowi have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall im happy to report that the jump to d was a good one not to mention a necessary one
mega man spends the entire time in legends jumping and shooting through a unique d environmentim surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game
theyre quite wonderful if you ask me
sure the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly  years old and walking around in mega man legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of fun a game provides
mega man legends provides a lot of funi really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where i had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me
the first time i completed this battle it took a good  minutes only for a bigger badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds
at first i was angry because the game wouldnt let me save before fighting this fourth boss
a half hour of work flushed down the toilet was the thought that went through my headthat led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle but it turned out i just didnt have the right upgrades for my xbuster equipped actually i didnt have anything equipped
so when i went back to do the battle again i defeated him her actually rather easilymost of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat including the boss fights
many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes though
the strategy to defeating many of them is to keep running and only turn around when the moment is right and blast them
the only boss who isnt easy is the very last boss who sounds like michael jackson because he has two forms
the first form you can figure out with practice but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and then the challenge increases
but its possible to find enough money to carry up to  subtanks to help you out drastically
if you were to carry  subtanks he would be a very easy boss
despite that the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a lot of things
you have to go here you have to go there
you have to collect this you have to collect that
youll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the start button and see everything in your inventory
its borderline insaneyou see to help make the game easier what you have to do is go around searching for things things located in treasure chests or holes in walls and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend or sister i forget who she is will be inside
she can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use
she must be smarti think i explained myself correctly there
its kind of confusing because theres so many things you have to collect and thats the main reason i cant give the game a perfect star rating
too much
in mega man legends you will find so many weapons and so many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone like me whos normally not exposed to this much activity in a video gameyou have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game
when youre lost he can also help you by telling you where to go unfortunately many times he doesnt provide enough information
so you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you outthe music in the game is nice
its usually played quietly which is odd because most mega man music is right in your face
if you can actually hear the music its pretty much what youd expect from a mega man gamelisten to those sound effects
sound familiar
think south park
one of the children or pirates sounds just like butters and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like kyles mom
some of the animation looks like south park too
when did south park come out
hmmm makes you wonderonce again the graphics
they arent as bad as i thought theyd be
sort of blocky of course since this is playstation one were talking about here but i cant bring myself to really hate the graphics because theres a certain mysterious charm about them
mega man legends looks like a childrens game but its not really
most children wouldnt be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a childthe play control goodness
its definitely not easy to figure out at first
to make mega man walk straight you have to hold down the l and r buttons this rotates the direction mega man is facing while at the same time you have to use the up down left and right buttons to make mega man walk forward
so because you have to do a lot of running in mega man legends when an enemy is chasing you and right behind you you have to turn around use the l and r buttons to face him and then hit him
in the middle of hitting the l and r buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits
it may take a few hours to properly pull off but you should become better at it with practicea trick to help you when an enemy is chasing you run as far away from him as possible and then turn around
usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control mega man so hes facing the enemy directly
then simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away
i wouldnt blame you if you couldnt figure out the controls its not the greatest way to control a character
im not sure if capcom improved the play control in mega man legends i find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall many times a very small amount of money will be located there
small enough to not be able to afford anything
its funny because capcom made it like wow you found money
only to insult you with sofa cushion money
to find a lot of money you have to run around shooting enemiesjust running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny money is a lot of fun not to mention addicting
a pretty good game worth picking upthis was a very chanllenging game for me it
took me about three months to beat the even old original  verison way back in mid  i think it was when back when i was about and was midway through my final and last growth ssuppert
i belive i later when i was about   got the newer playstation version
i unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe  to  hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe  to   hours maybe more or less
this game will be fun once you get used to some changes
one megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou  to  six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about   to maybe  pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made
once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake
to beat jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo
with this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny you cane beat juno easily
just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers
as long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon
pushbed the out fire down and  keep shooting them of at rapid speed
even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe  second   minutes maybeless
this  is a fun games i hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic and rusha and beta no longer exist
if you like this and want a really challange to test your patience and enduranc eplay the insanly hard megaman legends  also avilable in playstation formatto me mega man legends is one of those games youll remember years after playing it
the game itself doesnt break any new ground and has its share of flaws but the overall experience is definitely rewardingmega man legends pretty much plays like the earlier tomb raider games control wise
unfortunately there are a few problems with the control scheme such as a lock on system that doesnt allow you to move while locked on an enemy which was fixed in mml and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your marklegends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as tomb raider as well complete with all the flat d scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of playstation gaming
unlike tomb raider the environments in mega man legends are much brighter and colorful adding to the games cartoonlike feel rather than the dark dank deathtrap ridden tombs that lara croft raidsthe pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well
considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience this isnt an error so to speak but older more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing
thankfully capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge oh and is it ever a challenge
add to this capcom increased the difficulty on mega man legends  a few notches and all can be forgiven hereso with all these problems why is legends such a good game
heart and lots of it
mix in a good story a wonderful cast of characters and enemies and throw in some of capcoms more respectable forays in voice acting department and you got a winner
while some may claim that legends carries a kiddy tone i actually find this to be one of the games charms and strengths
honestly if you dont laugh when one of the lego men err i mean servebots messes up and angers tron there is something wrong
seriously it isnt anymore kiddy than a mario or zelda game or most of nintendos gaming library for that matterthe other thing that makes the legends series so great is the fact capcom decided to quit while they were ahead
while i myself still wish they would churn out a mega man legends  considering some of the unresolved issues in mega man legends s ending at least capcom didnt make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all its fun and respectability of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and x seriesin the end mega man legends is not a game youll remember for amazing graphics razorsharp control or challenging quests
instead youll walk away with a overall memorable experiencemega man legends is a great new series for mega man
the story takes him to an island searching for energy crystals on his dig adventures
game play is fun and easy to learn
the game has plenty of secret goodies for you too discovery adding hours of replay value
easy and fun to play but not easy enough that youll only spend ohone week or so one it
loads of fun a most have for hardcore mega man and new mega man fans of all agesi will never forget the first time i played this game
a friend of mine had been talking about it for months when i was finally able to borrow a playstation and rent a copy of this game
it is really a fun action rpg with elements of mega man indiana jones and zeldagood game overall
its fun and easy but rewarding
the voice overs are so cheesy that its actually funny and enjoyable to listen too
if you have not played this game yet and you enjoy mega man get this gamei personally like many types of fighting games and fun is the thing that keeps me coming back for more
a game can have pretty graphics sound great and have all the bells and whistles in the world and still play like 
this game might not be as pretty as the saturn version but who wants a saturn
one of the biggest flops since the future flop of sonys ps
a few frames missing and slowdown which i have not experienced personally are by no means reasons to dismiss a game that combines xmen with streetfighter very well
one more thing to mention about the price
not to insult anyones intelligence but simply supply and demand
it is discontinued there are fewer and fewer copies available thus causing those on the open market to raise in valuex men vs street fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the st the saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation  still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to bernie stolar we in the us didnt get x men vs street fighter nor the  mb ram cart so those of couldnt get the saturn version got this st on the playstation which is bad on d it didnt have tight controls it didnt have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh no tag team mode
i remember renting this version  thinking it was terrible its just this game wasnt made for the playstation
now the action replay that bypasses region coading  uses a mb  mb ram function i would also require a ascii saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of the sega saturn should get that version its a great fighting game that plays like the arcadei wasent as inpressed with this game as i thought i would be
first of all the load times are forever
second  this game has cartoon graphics
theird  i hate the street fighters in this game
forth i love the xmen they are absolutly fabulusthe playstation version of riven is definantly not as good as the pc version but it still adds up to be a great experience
solid gameplay crips graphics and topnotch sound
but still falls short in some areas
disc changing can get very tedious
thats one reason why i recommend the dvd version for the pc
but its no doubt this game will suck you in and keep you sucked for a long time
get ready to experience a whole new worldi liked this game alot its challenging and it took me awhile to beat longer than most other games
i do recommend buying the strategy guide because its easy to miss alot
anyways if you like the original myst youll love this
great graphics only flaws was there was a glitch here and there but nothing majorback in  a little game called myst appeared
everyone went crazy for  it  it featured amazing graphics addicting search and explore gameplay  and it was actually educational
a main part of the game was reading so it  figures that many parents were so supportive of it
it was also though  terribly spooky at times
you could be anywhere in the world of myst and  still feel a general sense of well spookinessbut myst was in    and even though it held well throughout several years which is  amazingly good it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technologyso how well can quotriven the sequel to mystquot hold up  against quotcurrent technologyquot and the original classic
by simply  making the adventure more intresting more long and with more  quotspookinessquot  an original mystcliche that adds drama to the  gamequotrivenquot is even more rewarding than quotmystquot so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless
theres five cds to the  game  thats clearly enough for anyone to buy this game
even as it  starts out you better look for clues
the developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information you could go from one disc to  another in less than  minutesthe graphics while nice arent the  best in the world
even the control using the playstation controller is  sometimes sticky
but believe me youll get used to itits definetly  worth a buy from any fans of the quotmystquot eraexcept for having to switch discs all the time
i know its a fact that this game was so big you had to swap discs thats the only reason i didnt give it a 
other than that the game is completely immersive
it puts you right in the world of riven
this game inspired me to purchase myst
part i in the series
i hope that they make more of these games for the playstation  and  coming out
myst iii exile was the last game to be ported on the playstation   come on cyan put more out for the playstationswhile the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles i cant fault this game because this is where it all startedon its own merit in  it was a smashbox hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics d environments and the musical score
back then we were used to super mario world and final fight
this was something completely different
no one cared about the flaws the game had back then
it was par for the coursenow in  a whole  years later really
that long ago a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay sound and playability
sound effects are lofi almost like comparing a cassette to a cd
the soundtrack is still amazing though as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format
playability there is one overall mode  the p arcade mode unless you count options and p
every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose  the same one you fight in round  after that you have all of the characters and theres not much else to do
theres no team battle no survival justp arcade
so it works for  the ending movies are pretty bad all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly cgi
of course in retrospect this was the movies never got better in the series until much later but they did improve someoverall tekken deserves a place in your psx collection right next to  and  you wont play it often because tekken  covers all of those bases and more
so to me at least this game is merely a collection piecethe first time i played this game i was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game
the grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world
this was all in  now that tekken and tekken had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland
back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them
and know that games like tekken tekken and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue
all i know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken
if tekken had never come out then i believe with a  that none of the existing games that i have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance
despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstationworks well for me except i cant get my championships to show at the end
im not sure if that is a glitch or notwell i bought it because i wanted to collect all the tekken gamesi did d and it brings back alot of memoriesthe cd worked for about  days and thenbam
it was skipping like crazy it froze wen i picked jack or kunimitsuand now it wont come on at allit was a pretty crappy copyfor the quotace combatquot initiated this game is a lot better that the original quotace combatquot for its graphics and play although i have to say how much i enjoyed quotace combatquot too in the beginning
not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing  a must for the correct deployment of missiles
missions are plentiful and in addition to the possibility to select a wingman or indeed wingquotwomanquot as sexual equality aware namco has included you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission or do the mission without support as you wish
there are the usual night missions and canyonruns and plenty of planes to choose from
game action is very smooth too
the planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great
an enjoyable gamemy first ace combat game was electrosphere or number  in  so  years later i decided to give this one a go
its a lot of fun and after you configure your controls to how you like it becomes even better
compared to  this one is a bit more fast paced but the graphics are noticeably lower in qualitythe one quarrel i have though it is a given for all pre ish i think playstation games is you cant use the analog sticks which i always used in the third ac and even though its just a little stick not having it really takes away from the flying feelif you love castlesgoblinsmonsters demon vixens and skeletons swinging swords this game is for you
i thought the graphics were excellent and solving the levels wasnt difficult
some may fine the dismemberments a little to gross but my kids enjoyed itmaybe i just am a mediocre gamer but this game is a challenge from hellmessage me if you have beat this onei would recommend getting this game for many reasons you have  characters to choose from you can pick the route you want the levels are well designed along with the chaacters  the fighting style are also great you get to pick up weapons  use tit against them the playstation version is the best one to buyfighting force was the wannabe streets of rage for playstation
if you grew up in the s and owned a sega youll know what im talking about
the game had tons of flaws such as the lofidelity sound effects sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm and the blocky pclike design of the characters
heck it looked like a windows  platform gamethere are four characters to choose from  two chicks a big giant and the handsome one
they each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings
smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too but hes slow as a mule
hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits
alana and mace are both quick alana moreso but are weak and fragilethe game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the games engine
back then games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly
the load times on this game tell you theres a lot of extra space here
an obvious pitfall is when there are many enemiesitems on the screen it evokes slow command response but only from players controllers remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an air grab  second after you press the button
this resulted in getting beat up from  or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head
not fun
items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first
then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and youre spinning through the air
fun
yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot
and for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the faceyou eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it
the game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though ive learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way
the game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue which by the way starts you over on the leveltotally bogus
when you finally do finish the game it seems underwhelming
youll see what i mean when you finish itall in all despite its obvious and frustrating flaws the game is still a classic
if you dont own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time
relive the polygonal loadingscreen gloryfrom the ruins of rome to the futuristic setting of atlantis tomb raider takes the gamer through a variety of wonderful worlds
unlike its sequels it stays in the tombs and out of other settings
i believe that it is one of the best games ever made and it certainly is a classic
however i believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow itthe scenery in tomb raider is better than most games although it is mostly cubed and flat
the game play and plot are wonderful and the graphics and sounds are acceptable
however the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles
lauras moves are limited and the weapons supply is less than perfecti would recommend this game to any fan of the tomb raider series and to the average gamer
however i do feel that other versions have better qualities
tomb raider ii offers wonderful ai and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat
tomb raider iii combines the better aspects of the previous two and tomb raider the last revelation offers the best plot and character mobility
if you are looking to stay in the tombs or if you are not into puzzles stick with this game
however dont miss out on the other great qualities the tomb raider series offersbrought this game for myself it brought back memories when i was  playing this all summer long
game came as described and fast alsothe original tomb raider was a landmark game for the playstation and the start of a very long running series
it holds up well but is a definite acquired tastetomb raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress lara croft being hired by business woman jacqueline natla to search an ancient cavern in peru for a piece of the scion an ancient talisman of great power
however after finding the piece lara is betrayed by jacquelines men
now its a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the scion before jacqueline attains its mythical power
tomb raider is an early playstation game and unfortunately the graphics havent aged very well
although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey
despite this the games length is impressive
there are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game
lara moves in a very stiff fashion
her controls are tanklike and you have to hold down a button for her to walk
she takes very long jumps but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases
fortunately there is a training mission where lara instructs you on how to play in her home
the game is primarily a puzzle platformer
each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skillsscattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress
this is where combat comes into play
lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo
through out the game you will find a variety of firearms however these weapons do have limited ammo but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battlethe last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game
the pc version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted
the console versions of the game on playstation and sega saturn do not have this luxury
you can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow
unfortunately once a crystal is used it is gone
this makes it really difficult when youve got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health
some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you savethis game has many flaws but it is a very rewarding experience
i would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge
the later games in the tomb raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here
if youre curious about the beginning of the franchise you wont be disappointed but maybe a little stressedfor classic pc gamers id recommend tomb raider unfinished business
this is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piecethe story line for both the orginal tomb raider and tomb raider anniversary are the same
i would consider the old tomb raider is more harder then the new tomb raider anniversary
if you like better graphics and such get tomb raider anniversary
if you like harder challenge get the old version
either one is both good on game playthe first installment in the series turned many heads and imaginations of many
a good flick if youre bored and looking for an adnventure
can tend to be frustratingthis is my th review  i really cant believe the past  or  years have gone by so quickly
i mean almost  years ago i came on here  started with video game reviews then i ranted on movies that i hate which turned into reviewing movies i love
the  months on this account i have been reviewing old wrestling show i reviewed a lot of the old nwawcw s pay per views i have just started with reviewing wwf ppvs this past friday i reviewed survivor series  im going to review in your house  seasons beatings soon
wwf warzone released inj july of  for the playstaion  nintendo  this game i feel gets undeserved flack its not as good as the thq games on the n like the wcw games or the  wwf games or any of the thq games on the playstion or ps
but this game is better than most of the wrestling games put out by akklaim previously
this game  wwf attitude were the only good wrestling games put out by akklaim
i have the playstaion version which was the version i played the most
i bought it again recently cause my n doesnt work anymore
so getting into the game you have challenge mode which is a career mode where you go after the wwf intercontintal championship  the wwf championship
when you play through it you have wrestlers challenge you to a rematch it will be either a normal match a weapons match or a cage match
thankfully when i as stone cold i didnt have to face ahmed cause the playstaion check out fun with ahmed on youtube
if you do win the wwf title you can keep on defending it  opponets become harder  can evade your attacks
then you have normal versus mode where you fight a random opponet the wrestlers you can play as are stone cold steve austin shawn michaels who retired for  years before this game came out due to a back injury
ahmed johnson who left the wwf before this game came out
the rock who was in between being rocky miavia  the rock
bret hart who as we all know was in wcw when the game came out
but it is fun to play as bret hart the most easy wrestler to play as
owen hart
farooq goldust undertaker kane mankind ken shamrock the british bulldog who left the wwf in late  due to what happend in montereal
mosh  thrasher
so this is more like the late  roster but no wrestling game ive played had a totally up to date roster
you have tag team mode it wouldve been nice if you couldve went for the wwf tag titles
you have weapons match which is a no disqualification match
cage match where you face an oppent in a steel cage match
you just have to beat your oppent up until there health meter is in the red  climb over it
the nintendo  version had royal rumble  gauntlet matches
you have training mode where you can learn the moves come up with stradegy when you play as whoever you want
the only problem is you cant do your finishing move in training mode
look online how to do the finishing moves  there not really that difficult to pull off
you have create a wrestler mode back then it was neat now its just not that great
but you can listen to the wrestlers enterance themes you can listen to them in the bios as well  the playstaion version had the real themes while the  had chip tunes but they really werent bad at all
you have options mode where you can save the game adjust the difficulty set the time of the match
you have the basement where all the unlockables are at if you want you have to play through on medium or hard with a certain wrestler to get stuff unlocked
i enjoy playing through as austin bret hart is fun to play as cause of all the ways he has to work the legs
i mean if youre just getting started playing this game then guys like bret hart owen hart the british bulldog  shawn michaels would be the best for beginners
undertaker  kane are also fun to play as
there is an option where you can check your stats that shows how many wins  losses you have
i do like that if you or your opponet repeats the same move over  over again the crowd will boo you
but when you do different moves  bigger moves then they will cheer you
although i dont think akklaim knows what a pump handle slam looks like cause a belly to back suplex is called in this game
you get commentary by jim ross  vince mcmahon
warzone is a great game when you learn how to play it it is pretty fun
the only problems i had was tag team mode feels like its broken at times
like you partner will just stant there  let the pin be broken sometimes the opponet wont break the pin  let his partner be pinned
i wish they wouldve included the royal rumble in the playstion version
more wrestlers couldve been put in the game the road warriors who returned to the wwf in  guys like dlo brown kama from the nation of domination  i wish brian pillman couldve been put in the game
if i ever get wwf attitude then ill review itthis wasnt widely released in america though those who have played it swear by it as being just as fun as mario kart  i agree with this comparison
however this has some fun twists that mario kart  lacks
one such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift
this can cause for some hilarious chaos
if two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over
i love this dynamic
because it makes it more than just your average mario kart racing cloneother features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash
money earned during a race can also be used to buy weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course
i also ought to mention the music its wonderful
it features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dancepop groups like aqua
youll dig the energy the music providesif you are a fan of mario kart  style crossfires i think youll find this is a unique addition to your n collectionsnowboarding games are a dime a dozen these days so its nice when a good one comes along
although its rare to see a snowboarding game play out like mario kart it makes for a really fun game
you play as one of  grade school children collect items and weapons knock off enemies with these items and weapons do tricks and get money while trying to win the race
even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game this still is a great game
the game looks pretty nice for n standards the controls are tight the sounds are good and the music is very catchy
this game also uses great ideas such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky but really enjoyable courses
in fact some of the courses have no snow on them
but thats the fun of this game getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain while at the same time hitting your opponents with piepans bombs rocks and other items
it releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that i just cant explain
but its not all fun and games though
there are some problems
first is the games image
many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game though i liked it so much i didnt care
the biggest problem is that you need a conroller pak to save your data
the real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the controller pak use and since the game requires  of the  pages in the controller pak youll need to spend more money getting more controller paks if you have other games that require it also mystical ninja starring goemon rugrats in paris or games where you want to save data for safe keeping wave race  perfect dark
but even with these issues the game is still really fun and worth playing
if you like it and still want more try its sequel snowboard kids  but try the original first to see if you like the style of play
ill bet dollars to donuts that youll enjoy it though
great job atlusi have to admit something i love the way this game looks
it is spectacular in the graphics sense but the story just left me out to dry
the orginal command and conquer storyline was way better
the gdi missions  are a joke in this game and i have to say itnod rulez
the nod missions  are very fun to look at and play especially the evil hal computer that  talks to you in the cool voice
the game play units are completely  unbalanced
on gdi side all you have to do is amass a huge army of tank  mechs and you can destroy any base no matter how fortified it is
on the  nod side amass a huge army of  mobile artillery and nobody can stand in  your way
the game is worth buying to see how it looks but the gameplay  is horrible and some of the missions are close to impossible which may  frustrate some novice players
ok westwood you have provided the  interface now quit slacking and give us a good storythis was the first campc game i ever purchased
i got this game when i wasnt playing much else apart from everquest upon a friends recommendation
i wasnt to familiar with the campc franchise of rts games from westwood
now i am a fan of the seriesif you dont know tiberian sun is a rts about two military forces at odds with one another
the evil nod that wants to rule the world while the honorable gdi wants to protect the world
the single player missions are on two discs
one is gdi and the other disc is the nod single player missions
both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay
i cant say i liked the fullmotionvideo sequences but they are quite funny in an unintentional waythe online multiplayer is where the real fun of tiberian sun is at
there just is no way to describe winning a long  hour match online and not getting booted offthis is a good value for the money
it may not be as great as age of empires or starcraft but tiberian sun is fun nonetheless
enjoyokay i admit it the two main reasons i bought this game are james earl  jones and michael biehn whom i believe are bloody great
however the game  in itself is lots of fun
im making my way through the gdi games at the  moment and having a good timethis pretty good it has a good story great ingame movies and adequate gameplay
however most of the marketing for this game has centered around it being a sequel to red alert
this is simply not true
the two games have  almost nothing in common and red alert is a far better game
in saying this  i mean that tiberian sun takes a huge step backwards in terms of gameplay  from red alert
gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring  helicopters and cheap quothover unitsquothowever this game is  not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics  featuring performances by several hollywood stars well maybe not stars but  close enough
the graphics are pretty good but other games have done  bettersure its a classic and if you really like the series go  ahead and buy it
but if you want the true best strategy game of  go  and check out homeworld its a far better gamewhen i first got the game it was quotwowquot thinking it would be the best
i have to admit it is better than some games i have already played but it just didnt have the zing of the other campc gamesthe computer stinks
i could beat them playing as gdigood guys which is hard because nodbad guys has all the best vehicles units and structures
i love the missile silo
talk about blitzcrieg on your opponent
if you want to have about a  chance of winning stick with nodi wouldnt recommend the missions because they are all too easy or all too hard
i stick to skirmish and internet games myselfi might venture to say that it is worth an inexpencive look
maybe even borrowing it from a friendallinall i would have to say that the graphics are superb stories are bad  sound is soso and gameplay is dependant on which side you choosenod being betterfinal fantasy  is yet another gold brick in the shimmering castle of squaresofts frequent triumphs
you will fall in love with the characters youll wish you could jump right into the world
the games events are structured very wellexcept for the everpresent level up before the final boss stage of the game
the graphics are wonderful in their own right
its just as deep and enthralling as any final fantasy should bebut to be honest its a hassle to bother with the pc version
its best to get a playstation and play it that way
ffs system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the playstation even if you have a good computer
and keyboard control is no fun at allironically i used a gamepad that resembles the ps controller
and otherwise this is a striaght port so youre not missing anything if you go for the ps version
but if you refuse tocant buy a playstation this version is better than nothing and you certainly wont want to miss outgrim fandango is best described as a detective story in the film noir tradition
the hero of the piece manny calavera evokes the private eye of the s or s melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking  into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and  corrupt conspiracy which may do him in
the difference here is that at the  beginning of this story manny is already dead and the events transpire in  the land of the dead the place where according to mexican folklore  departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafterblending  mexican folk mythology with the film noir genre grim fandango is  ultimately respectful of both traditions and the striking art design is in  keeping with this approach combining art deco and precolumbian elements
the dialogue refreshingly witty and literate draws the player in to the  characters and the story as does the varied musical score which includes  mexican folk melodiesthe characters are for the most part vividly  drawn and due to the superb performances by the voice talent particularly  tony plana as manny and maria canals as meche are fresh despite their  mostly formula roles
one character which may provoke mixed reactions is  that of glottis mannys driver
a cartoonish jar jar binkslike figure  glottis skews the story in a younger direction at odds with the mild  epithets employed by other characters in a few instances and while my  children liked glottis i expect most players will find him either  endearing or irritatingthe interface in this game is unusual
rather  than pointing and clicking with a mouse the player controls mannys  movements with the arrow keys waiting to see mannys head turn to an  object he becomes interested in and clicking quotenterquot to see what  happens
this approach takes some getting used to and can be cumbersome at  times but it places manny at the center of the action and increases the  players identification with manny ultimately serving the storythe  puzzles many of which are multistep involve crafting rube goldberg  solutions to various problems
some of the solutions are thoroughly  counterintuitive i wont give anything away but lets just say that  objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre  ways and are best solved through aggressive trial and error
clues may  pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process
that  aside the lucasarts team especially writer tim schafer deserve high  praise for this highly original and literate adventurethis game is definitely a hundred steps past quake and others of its type
the ai is great
the evolving story is great
the fight against the special forces team is nerve wrackingly great
however all this greatness became  stale i never bothered to finish the game
the game just seemed to grow  old after a time
maybe it needs something more to carry the player  throughthe good game holds up  years later one of the best told stories in gaming history a lot of memorable moments tons of mods availablethe bad graphics look hideous these days newer gamers will hate this due to all the flaws that stick out to many mazy levelsman o man does this bring back a lot of good memories
i remember almost dying because my moms computer couldnt run hl
i begged her to get the computer upgraded at the time not even knowing how this was possible or the cost she just wouldnt do it
all i could do was stare at videos and screenshots until i thought would be forever dadada
 until i heard about the ps port
i was so excited i babysat my bratty sisters for a whole summer and laid down  smackeroonies on a used ps but to my luck hl was no where to be seen
it turns out not many copies of the game were made so they were scarce
settling with a rental i finally was able to play the game but it was starting to feel old because i didnt get ahold of it until late  realizing that i was missing out on a lot at the time i wound up losing my save and being so angry never touched the game again
four years later i can finally play the game again thanks to steam i actually ordered the hl anthology off of ebgames for  and i definitely realized what i missed now that i have finally been able to finish the gamehalflife used the quake ii engine at the time which was fighting against the unreal engine technically
while halflife never looked as good as unreal valve pulled some strings and did some custom stuff with the physics water and lighting effects that wasnt originally in the q engine
hl isnt just your regular run  gun shooter the story is told all in real time by running into certain characters and by just progressing you get an idea of whats going on without much dialog
this was revolutionary at the time and so were the weapons graphics sound physics and enemies
the game has your usual weapons like machine guns with grenade launchers pistols revolvers etc
but hl has some weapons up its sleeve that were never seen before
those such weapons happen to be a laser guided rocket launcher you guide it with your mouse
i remember people buzzing about this weapons back in the day and its still pretty cool
you also have the bee gun which is a weird slimy thing that shoots killer bees you have some strange electricity guns mines laser mines satchel charges etcthe enemies were also something never seen before like the head crabs head crab zombies the ichthyosaur the vortigaunts etc
the game also had huge bosses which was amazing back in the day and seemed very epic
the game was dark creepy and very hard as well
most shooters back in the late s were just run  gun nonsense in dark tunnels military complexes etc
halflife is not innocent and does do this but there are other places to see like climbing a huge canyon and looking out over the ugly vista that looks like the grand canyon
today it looks like someone slapped a lowres jpeg image in the background but in the late s things like this seemed like you were staring over a grindlift in gears of war  halflife was just so real and so amazing back in its day that it really kind of shocks you how such an old game can still make that kind of impactthe game also consists of a lot of maze like halls that you can get easily lost in and i found this the main problem with hl
some of the puzzles were a bit confusing to do and navigating the endless halls calls for a much needed walkthrough
while the level design is excellent and you pretty much know where to go there are those occasional moments that make you wander around the whole area a few times and look in every nook and cranny wondering what switch you missed or what do you need to go through
some neat things back in the day was being able to have the blue shift men help you and ask scientists to open doors for you
while this is standard these days this kind of ai was unknown to the late s pc gamers
this added to the realism and made you fee like you really are stuck in black mesa trying to fight off the alien invasionyoure probably wondering what the story is right
well its simple really gordan freeman thats you arrives in anomalous hazards as a regular employee and an experiment goes awry and gordan must escape the facility and figure out the source of the alien invasion
the story as ive already said isnt told through cut scenes but rather in real time while you play
this helps add to the experience but of course may bore most younger pc gamers who are used to fear crysis cod etc
halflife is for the hardcore old school pc shooter fans only and really takes cunning skill to finish
the game will give you less and less health as you go and youll have to figure out how to take out a room of  bad guys with only  health
while this isnt impossible it can be done and requires precise skill thus only for hardcore fansmost of you have probably played hl already and these games are pretty much completely different besides the content
you still have your hazard suit most of the weapons are the same but there is more stuff in hl
about  of the weapons and enemies in hl arent in hl
hl is more realistic while hl is more of a scifi type game
thankfully you can play hl without even touching hl which i did but hl explains a lot of things that arent explained in hl and there are bits in hl that are for fans of hl that you normally wouldnt know about unless you played this gamenow of course hl has a lot of flaws like floaty physics being able to run mph cheap deaths poor graphics but these are flaws seen from age
if you were to warp back to  the game was almost flawless
now when it comes to upgrades and mods there is an endless ocean
there are a ton of amazing multiplayer and singe player mods available and i have spend hours and hours on most of them
you must go to fileplanetcom and download these mods because they are super fun
hl also has a free hidef pack that you can download to update the graphics a little bit
if you want to go even further pick up halflife source which uses hls engine to make things look more modern
i highly recommend the source version for people who just cant stand old graphics but old school shooter fan should just get the hidef pack just for nostalgias sakefans of dedicated singleplayer first person shooter games whove never played this game before should definitely not pass it up
hl takes an utterly unoriginal idea for either games or movies and crafts an utterly unstoppable gaming experience
you play gordon freeman who works in the bowels of an ultrasecret underground research facility called the black mesa
having played the game yet im still not sure whats supposed to be going on in bm  its what happens that matters
oozing hightech the facility is host to another dimension when youfreeman accidentallydo something that tears a whole in the fabric of our own  allowing beings from that other world to enter oursnow if you think that these otherworldly denizens are peaceful beings intent on fostering crossdimensional love or that your fellow human beings will enter the black mesa unarmed intent on warmly welcoming these beings to our world im afraid youve picked up the wrong game entirely
for in the bowels of black mesa youll confront howling dog things flying crabs alienzombified versions of your colleagues gigantic aliens that breathe fire through their fists aliens that hang from ceilings and entrap their victims using these vinelooking things and squads of human special forces troops intent on killing everything that moves
if the above attracts you because you think it may be the setting that elevates the nobility of the human existence i should warn you to look elsewhere  for in half life youll find yourself acting indiscriminately with a mm automatic a submachine gun grenades and most regrettably of all a nasty crowbar youll make few friends and find yourself for the most part alone and not infrequently exiled to ventilation ducts again with the ducts
to avoid getting shot at by humans or burned bitten bolted or tonguebathed by aliens
complex problem solving skills as much as marksmanship or bulletsaving are crucial in this game  in which your enemies have aboveaverage levels of ai
there are unfortunately times when a level may be hung up by the failure to achieve some specific missiongoal but this is on the whole a game in which the goals are sufficiently complex to make you feel cool for achieving them yet not so complex as to be impossible to solve
the settings are fantastic  from the vast to claustrophobic
the game is long  uncommitted gamers may find it tedious  but the scope of design here rewards those who keep up with iti ran this game on an xpequipped p with a mb agp card and had no problems other than those involving the evil aliens and homicidal fellow humans
graphics and sound were smooth and i suffered no ctdsalright already
its a great game
good ai graphics
runs well
atmospheric
great story and dialogue
comedy
blah blah blahwait a minute
i got a complaint
that movie in the beginning
you cant escape  it
it just goes on and on babbling while youre stuck in a stupid tram  car
sheesh
what a bore
that kind of nonsense will cost you a star
later i went thru that ride a few times because i grew to like the eerie  understated music
still i think i should have been able to skip the intro  movie
ruined the whole game for mei didnt like this game when i first saw it at e but when i went back  and played it it turned out to be pretty good
not too many boss monsters  i hate those things some of the monsters are rather agile the weapons  are new the graphics are extremely pretty nice colors great water you  can configure all sorts of things there are some good guys to help you out  they show you hidden goodies and the game makes a lot of effort to be  stable
hey they even have a story and little logs you can read to get a  feel for the storyits not as storyscripted as halflife but then it  doesnt have the awful xen world either and many people prefer the  realistic weapons of quake to the unusual ones of unreal
i like the  builtin bots in multiplayer i think this was the first game to ship with  them but im told the net play is really slowunreal is one of those games that has stuck with me ever since i first played it
in fact i cant think of any game that i actually like as much as unreal
the environments are beautiful and compelling the ai is fairly clever and the atmosphere is simply masterfulin the singleplayer campaign you are prisoner  your prison ship has crashed and now you have to escape
when you leave the ship you get slapped in the face with awe inspiring environments excellent atmosphere beautiful skies and inspiring music
instead of having cutscenes or cinematics unreal tells its story through translator messages
i prefer it that way  cutscenes would have gotten in the wayunreal is also great for the fact that it supports coop  up to  players
the environments vary but all of them are generally very well done
aside from coop unreal also has deathmatch and team deathmatch modes and a variety of others such as darkmatch
unreal also comes with the unreal editor
in it you can make your own levels
admittedly its difficult to get used to but nevertheless is an excellent addition
it is marred with quite a few bugs howeverunreal is a truly brilliant game
the environments music atmosphere and story have made it last a very long time for me
it may have aged but no game since has managed to grab my attention the way unreal did and no game has stuck with me for so long
my advice buy the game
its brillianti played unreal when i was  and beat it in a weekthe game is just plain awsome
unfortenutly that was  years ago and i doubt this will work on xp but when im at his house i always play this amazing game
the begining is friggin scary when youre in the abandon space ship and all you hear are the lives of the sapce crew screaming and beging for there liveslater you soon find out that they are being torn apart by these disturbing creatures or aliens i might say
more games should be like thisthe only game to be like this would probably be the suffering cause you here the voices of the cos getting torn apart by weird disturbing creatures
maybe not the only game but there a little few games that are like unrealthe begining parts were the best for me
the scream the horror
i think this is suppose to be a survival horror game
i donno but get this game but i think they dont make this game any more
any ways get this and unreal turnement
awsome gamesin my humble oppinion this game is better the quake ii
the graphics is better and the sound is so much better
if you have a sound blaster live
card then get this game because it was designed to run on this cardthis was a pretty good game but not a great game
id probably rate this closer to   stars
you are agent craig wilmore
scully amp mulder have disappered and its your job to find them
you have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search
a couple of the features i really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location you have to do a real time search to catch the quotbadquot guys towards the end
most of the cast members from the show are here skinner the cigarette smoking man amp the lone gunmen but they werent used nearly enough
there were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier like being able to get a password for your own computer
why was this so hard
overall a good game but just a few more additions and changes and this could have been a great gamethis was not the best mysteryadventure game ive ever played and im not even a big fan of such games to begin with but i am a serious xphile
despite the seven cds full of full motion video than make up the game it wasnt a whole lot like being in an xfiles episode
instead it was more like being one of those quotother agentsquot who make brief appearances two or three times per season
you actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break
of course the up side to that is a more immersive believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial cluefans of the series will find plenty of references to themes conspiracies events and trivia from various episodes as well as the familiar faces
while its not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery it does add quite a bit to the gameif youre not a fan of the xfiles there are better mysteryadventure games out there
if you find mysteryadventure games frustrating you probably wont like this one even if you are a fan
on the other hand if you do enjoy both this type of game and the series its based on youll have a lot of fun with this gamewe stopped watching the series lack of time and so this was a nice way  to keep the excitement going
the game is good perhaps a little  disorienting at first
i spent the first hour sitting at craig willmores  desk doing nothing once you get the hang of it though it follows  quite nicely
because you have so much freedom in navigation you decide  where to go but things wont happen until you come back to the right place  at the right time it feels like the game is nonlinear
in fact it is  rather linear although you have a few variations
i wasnt disappointed in  the ending but not thrilled either it didnt blow me away
we got stuck a  couple of times but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a  weekthe rule of this game is save often
and organize your saves
keep  the last save before you change cds they correspond roughly to major  developments
you might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial
or because you died i got killed a lot too
you  need lots of frequent saves and a few less recent and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game
but overall the storyline is quite  intuitive and youll be fine if you make connectionsbuy this game if  you like the series but youre not a fanatic youd be disappointed
and  youll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn  it into a challenge rather than into a frustrationi have had this game since  i really enjoy playing it
i have been playing it again and again off and on for few years now
i just recently decided to play it again
so i installed it on my windows  professional  bit version computer
after doing the following compatibility for it works just fine on windows  professional
install the latest quick time do not install the version on the cd
also during install it looks for hard drive space since this was during a time that hard drive was not very big it will say there not enough hard drive space just hit ignore it will continue with the install
if you have windows  professional  bit version all i did was click compatibility run under windows xpservice pack  and run this program as an administrator was all i checked
however if you have the windows  bit version you will need to enable to run at the bit version level most likelyi used to love this game but now its dated and now that i look back on it its not as fun now either way heres my reviewgraphics 
this is a more realistic snowboarding game so there are very realistic colors unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors
 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated
anyways the graphics i remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow
i liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy
for that this game got what it got in this categorysound 
whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice theres a different noise
there is a different sound for everything which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the n there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the gamecontrol 
very very realistic and solid but its frustrating for that reason
it is really realistic so you really have to land flat to get land which can be frustrating for little kids
there is also damage so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the racefun 
nice and realistic great events and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any  owner of an nthis game definitly fits the thought i had of a snowboarding game when i set out to buy one
the graphics are moderately realstic the control is ok and the sound is mediocre
i think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this but this edition sufficesit is one of the only snowboarding games on the n which was one of the reasons i bought it
another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination
i bought this as soon as i played it at a friends house
you unfortunatley play with only  players at a time but it is still fun to play your friend head to head
there are  courses and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make
there are  characters that you can use to race and more of which you can unlock
since there are only  head to head course combinations there are other things you can do like trick or time attacksthis can take a bit to get used to as it can be boring for the single player
if you have a will and a friend however this game will surely be worth itin comparison to other n games this piece is a worthwhile buy
the single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters
two player mode gets pretty boring pretty quickly because there are only  tracks to race on so theres not much variety
the stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours
however it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points
given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day
so buy this game and spin in circles to your hearts contentthis is the best snow boarding game you can get but you will get tierd of it soonhard to find game most anywhere and only had the opportunity to rent it a while back and wanted to play again
a lot like d and d i was toldive had this game since way back when it was released i just never got the chance to write a reviewthe story banjos sister tooty was the most beautiful girl around and grunty the witch wanted her beauty so she pulled an amber alert and took her to her lair
banjos lazy bum the whole time was sleeping
its up to you to get jiggys and notes and whatnot to stop grunty and get banjos sister backgraphics 
awesomely different and creative worlds
from a sewer to a pirate ship on an island to a desert and into an icy snowland there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through
the graphics are stellar for the n with bright colors and cool characters with good animations
this is one of the best n games as far as graphics go next to games like donkey kong  and legend of zelda majoras masksound 
there arent really any voices in this game just kind of sound effects that are different for each character
blubber on treasure grove cove sounds like hes burping or throwing up kazooie sounds like a gagging bird banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear and so on
the music in this game though is some of the catchiest and the best music ive heard in really any adventure game
the music doesnt really get old and whoever created it is brilliant
overall the sound is really really goodcontrol 
being an adventure game there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves
and since the n controller is the way it is  pretty annoying  its easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end just because you go brain dead
the controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks but you will get used to them anywaysfun 
a great game from beginning to end
get the jiggys move on
get the notes move on
that simple
no
this game is challenging and is for all ages even if it does have a kiddy approach
the game lasts maybe  hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game
great characters great level design and fantastic music makes this a must buy
this is one of the best games on the n and imo the best adventure game
pick this game up now it is better than its sequel and the game boy advanced ones even if all three are fantastic
buy this gameif you own a n and are looking for a game to play go to your local game store and find banjokazooie
in my opinion this game is simply amazing
the main plot throughout the game is that banjo the bear and his faithful breegull sidekick kazooie are attempting to rescue banjos little sister tootie from the evil witch gruntilda
enjoy the game as you explore  exciting worlds collect numerous puzzle piecesopen worlds and rescue your sister from the evil clutches of gruntildadeveloper rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations
this isnt a knock against them
william shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces
rare is gamedoms shakespeare in that regard
banjokazooie is obviously influenced by super mario  although its always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece
while banjokazooie lacks super mario s magic and ingenuity it has its own magic that sets it apart from nintendos behemoththe good a fun story an imaginative use of its characters creative worlds to explorethe bad too easy and short the few parts that are too hardthe ugly
why is kazooie so insultingstorythe first thing that stands out is the dialogue especially of the evil witch gruntilda or grunty who speaks in clever rhymes
its refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny
the game begins with her asking her mirror who is the most beautiful of them all
of course it couldnt be gruntilda
theres nothing even remotely pretty about a fat green hag
the most beautiful of them all is banjos younger sister tooty who looks similar to tiny kong of donkey kong fame
so grunty sets off to kidnap tooty and succeeds leaving only the mole bottles as a witness
bottles must survive a downpour of kazooies insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to banjo and kazooie
the question becomes can banjo and kazooie save tooty before grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herselfgameplayhere is the games bane and boon
everything else sets it up wonderfully
the soundtrack is great the visuals are very nice and the opening story sequence is funny
the game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout
the levels are varied with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover
but these levels are so small so short so easy
i never spent an hour and a half on any one level and most of them took less than an hour to complete
in that time i could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces one hundred musical notes and numerous other items such as the mumbo jumbo skulls extra lives and jinjos
compared to super mario  i cant help but say is that allthere are a total of nine worlds as well as a main hub world which is too labyrinthine for its purpose
rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather
unless you use cheats it takes  out of the  jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world including the final fight with grunty
thats not too difficult as id say about  of those jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake
more than  of the  music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with grunty you just cant count on rare to make a strictly childrens game see diddy kong racingthese are mostly criticisms but they comprise a small percent of the game
you will spend most of it enjoyably
despite the very easy difficulty it isnt boring
theres plenty to explore in the levels and as they go on they become larger and more complex especially the sprawling final level
rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level revolving around the four seasons and even includes a few semistories with some new characters
not that the other levels are clunkers but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyablelongevitya game should only be as long as it needs to be but i think banjokazooie needed to be a little longer
considering what nintendo did years earlier in super mario  its no excuse that rare couldnt match that level of magnitude
but its unfair to compare any game to super mario  most gamers will complete this all  jigsaw pieces almost all  music notes in less than twelve hours
after finishing it theres no reason to go back
the cheats only give you infinite resources but whats the point when youve already finished the game
the only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longerbanjo kazooie is a game ive played many times since i got it in the early s and while its fun its not the most entertaining game ive played
theres two main objectives in banjo kazooie hunting and gathering
you hunt for these jigsaw pieces called jiggys to help you complete jigsaw puzzles to open worlds
you gather all sorts of items within each level like musical notes jinjos mumbo tokens feathers etc
this concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole
id recommend the sequel banjo tooie instead as its  times more entertainingi am shocked and very pleased to report that crash bandicoot  warped is a drastic improvement over the original crash bandicootas you may have heard i am definitely not a fan of the very first crash bandicoot game released for the sony playstation in   i am however incredibly surprised to find that crash bandicoot  warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly neverending amount of wonderful games released for the playstation in just so you know i cant compare warped to crash bandicoot  cortex strikes back because i havent played that one
i can only compare warped to the original crash bandicootbefore playing crash  i was almost certain that crash bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to crash was the very first game
i thought for sure crash bandicoot was either a mario or an earthworm jim ripoff and didnt deserve all the attention it gotfor  years the original was the only crash bandicoot game i knew and truth be told it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentagesimply put crashs very first outing was boring
it desperately needed variety
walking through islandjungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring
the creators of crash bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because warped does just the opposite warped features nothing but creativity
in warped every stage certainly does not have the same feel
you will encounter something drastically different in every stage
i like thatthe main objective of crash bandicoot  warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the  stages of the game
you have to find all  purple gems otherwise the game wont allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world youre in
for example if youre in world  and cant find the purple gem in stage  you wont be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world
youre stuck there until you find that darn purple gem
once you find the gem and face and defeat the boss you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss
by the way theres  worlds total and  stages in each world
that comes to  stages totalthe amount of creativity that went into each of the  stages is simply incredible
unlike the first crash bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground warped offers a lot more in the way of variety
in warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages where youre required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem a couple underwater stages with very neatlooking backgrounds and deadly puffy fish swimming about a couple levels where youre steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes and not to mention those tricky tigerriding stagesoh and i have to mention the ultracool futuristic robot stages which require nearperfect jumping patterns in order to complete
the jet ski stages are really fun because youre located on top of the ocean and i guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs
yup its awesome
this is what makes crash bandicoot  so great you wont know what to expect until you enter the levelprobably the worst thing about crash bandicoot  warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge
thats not to say the game is a cakewalk either
people who think warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two crash bandicoot games
if you compare warped to say i dont know spyro the dragon its not such an easy game then
its definitely not a hard game either
you will beat it
i think the challange is comparable to super mario bros  the old nes classicthe one thing i find challenging in warped is the boss battle in world  where youre required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction
this is one case where practice doesnt necessarily make perfect
also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you dont bother shooting down the enemy planesone thing about crash bandicoot  warped that is incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems
most of the time you can not miss those gems because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage
i mean they are always right there
right in front of youafter you complete a stage you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time
finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard
it means you really have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spinattack an enemy or anything
it means you have to run run run
just so you know completing the stages under a certain time is not a requirement
its entirely up to you if youd like to accept the challenge
im too much of a wimp to accept it personallyi like how you can save your game after you complete a stage
you can actually complete one stage and go to the save room if you wish
very convenient
oh and get this if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the playstation when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will still be there
i cant think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect
speaking of lives they are so easy to find in warped that you probably can collect up to  of them
thats a lot and you will probably need them because even though the challenge ranges from low to medium your first time through the game wont be that simplewhen crash gets hit or smashed by something i think its funny the way he yells whoa
it reminds me of that comedian carrot topthe reason crash bandicoot  warped isnt going to receive a star rating from me is because of the same problem found in spyro the dragon in the flying stages in this case the airplane stages when you hit down on the dpad the airplane flies up and hitting up will make the airplane go down
the game company made the direction the wrong way
oops
at least when you steer the airplane left it will go left
the same with right
unfortunately many game makers have made and continue to make the same mistake
it needs to be corrected once and for alli realize having your airplane fly up when you hit down on the dpad is an example of realism since thats more or less how real airplanes operate but the thing is crash bandicoot isnt supposed to be about realism since its just a platform adventure game and furthermore it still doesnt change the fact that up and down are reversed
this adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwardstheres a toxic underwater stage in donkey kong country  where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge and in my mind at least having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challengei hope you buy this game for your sony playstation and experience a fun timeonce again crash bandicoot takes a big step up to greatness
crash bandicoot  warped was fantastic
it was even better than the second one
better graphics story music and gameplaythe enemies were fun just like in the first one and the new vehicles available were awesome like the biplanes space fighter pura the tiger and the jetski
also it wasnt as difficult to gather the crystals and gems as it was in the second part
the environments were better and the new powers that crash bandicoot acquires are totally awesome the super bellyflop speed shoes deathtornado spin attack and the totally awesome fruit bazooka
this is definitely one of the best of the games in the crash bandicoot trilogy
you crash fans must get this gamecrash bandicoot warped  orange cool creative fuzzy neat great graphics awesome design introduction of secret levels for the series powerups new bosses including a big boss and a new playable character
these things are what make this a major improvement on the two previous games
crash  was a breakthrough crash  opened up a new world and this game completely blows it all away
this was how i got hooked on crash bandicoot
i played this and loved it
i recommend itafter passing the second and then the first i was attempted to do this one
the graphics are much better than the previous two but the story got very boring
the adventures too became very uninteresting
regarding saving and hidden place this one is by far the simplestthe story here continues from where it ended in the last part if you have won that is
as oppose to akuaku we see the evil ukauka who is the big boss of dr cortex
and we see that crash is forced to fight them
why
why to save the world of coursein the previous  parts we had gems
now this was not enough for the overactive designers
they introduce trophies in this new part
for a trophy you have to finish a level within an allotted time
this is not that difficult but you cannot achieve it in every levels
some levels are extremely difficult to finish fast
i picked all the gems and all but on trophy and imagine my frustrationif you are a crash fan you might like this one but you cannot help being disappointedthis game is great
you go through  different time portales
each one has five different levels in it and at the end you face a boss
what you have to do is collect the colored gem and the crystal
guess what
its not as easy as it sounds
this game pits you against tons of different enemies appropriate to the level
the only thing that takes a star away from this game is the fact that level ideas are repeated
for example there are two different water levels with not much difference
oh
one more thing
press up up down down left right left right square at the title page to get a playable demo of spyro the dragon
this is a great game for anyone who likes playstationthis is a more than ok gamenot the bestbut goodif you like the quotspyroquot seriesyoull like this for surethe gameplay controlsoundetc
are all like the first the only problem is its easyreallyreally easythe levels are about  minutes long eachand the total gameplay span is about  hoursbut still thats better than it being hardits still pretty fun and stays true to the first and crashs little sister premires in it
heres the reviewgraphicssoundmusicfuncontroldpadanalogoverallhould you buy it
yepi came upon this game in the late searly s
me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and i must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game perfect dark if you havent had a chance to play that is the superior shooterthey both are fun in their own right though
they were both made by rare which did wonders for the n gracing us with the aforementioned games and also diddy kong racing which i played for hours on end with friends alsofun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too
like i said i liked the characters natalia being my absolute favorite and i kept coming back to this gameeven the singleplayer mode was fun
just not nearly as fun as the multiplayer modefun singleplayer c multiplayer bsound bcharacters bcontrols aoverall bi have to be honest normally im not into these first person shooter games
theyre just so clunky most of the time you cant tell where youre going you dont know if an enemy is behind you or at times even in front of you if you get a weird camera angle and plus might i add that you cant see your character which does not really for me most of the time give that whole imaginative feel that you are that characterwell goldeneye is an excellent and well made gamei dont know why people complain about the graphicsits actually kind of cool and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think theyre real
the scientists in the facility level are well detailed and most all the characters are animated incrediblybesides you take on the role of james bond
james bond
the hero that defined action
this game is not dull and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small roomthe multiplayer mode is of course wonderful
you can choose from power weapons sniper rifels dostovals shotguns pps proximity mines hand grenades laser guns and basicly everything else that you can think of
it is an entertaining game and it is well worth the moneythe camera angles rock
you never get lostso why didnt i give this game five stars
read below and find outthe bads of the gamethere are some major glitches
you can see your enemies literally walk through walls not completely but almost thereat times the doors when i command it to open with the b button it still wont open even if i already did get an access card for the door in the first place
the reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well but how am i supposed to know that
so i stand back the enemy comes in and oh guess what it turns out that there isnt just one of them theres thirty so they all shoot at me and i die
you can easily die in this game just due to glitches which makes it very difficult and frustratingif you forget one thing on a mission just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story then you have to start the whole mission over again
you dont just do the thing you forgot either you have to do all the things that you did do as well as the things you did notthe game is predictible due to the fact that it follows the movie although when it does not follow the movie which it does a lot then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happenthe puzzles can be frustrating
im still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility levelthe game is also very gory
i dont know why they gave this game a teen rating instead of a matureit should of been rated maturenow for the goods of this gamegoodsuse an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponryprepare to save the world its gonna be a rough rideit follows the movie really well most of the time anyways and if youre a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game
even if you arent youll still enjoy ityou play the role of james bond which is worth it within itselfthis game is the greatest first person shooter game for the n
the controls arent so difficult that youll get lost and forget which buttons to use while youre losing but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun
and even if you dont like the controls you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screentheres nothing that you cant shoot or destroythe cheats are funny
i mean honestly try the invisibility mode
you can shoot a near bye dashboard when a gaurd is near and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that
this makes the game easier also and the invincibility mode is good too although i tried and realized that you cant have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time
you can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff which is really funny to seethe way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the moviethey look exactly like the actorsat the end of every level it tells you how many kills you did how many limb shots how many head shots and how many body shots you hadthe artificial intelligence with the badguys arent all that challenging but when theres a whole crowd of them watch outthis game is excellent
did i mention that its excellent
let me repeat it again this game is excellent
excellent i tell you excellentthe game is overrated
dont get sucked into all the hype
its more nostalgic for the people who played it when it first came out
the graphics are honestly really bad and the controls make you feel like youre drunk
i guess thats where the fun is though because honestly i really did like the game
i played through it and although the gameplay schematics were a bitstrange it was oddly addicting
multiplayer is a lot of fun though when you have friends sitting down in the basement all hooked up
it can get pretty intense on split screen seriously
 stars for the split screen
 stars overall because the gameplay was repetitive and the graphics were vomit
they could have been better for the time period and the n was capable of handling better than this
still worth the buy
get itthis ganme was very entertaining i really enjoyed it im not to fond of these types of games but goldeneye was awesomegoldeneye has to be one of the best multiplayer games ever
i still play this game against friends even though i have a ps now
the graphics are still ok to look at even though i have seen far better on dc and ps
it has excellant replay value and is very challenging to defeat on all difficulty settings
pick this up if you want the best fps on nthere were a few stickers on the cartridge but its alright because the game worked fine and its such a fun game when youre on multiplayer modegood graphocs multiplayer mayhem secret levels of which the first is kind of like a part of the movie quotmoonrakerquot earn this level by beating the game on secret agent and the second of which is where you have to beat baron sameidei with the golden gun earn this level by beating the game on ooagent
the game is not overly gory
if you shoot someone a red patch appears on there clothes but it is hard to see on most of the d characters
with twenty levels in all and ten or so multiplayer areanas it is no wonder this game was voted game of the year in quotnintendo powerquot magazine
the music is excellent and can really get you excited and it can also get you scared
the ai is pretty dumb on the agent setting it develops about a fifty percent intelligence upgrade on secret agent setting and on ooagent you had better find some cover
the game can take a while to beat if you want to get all the secret levels and secret codes for the game by beating the main game missions in a certain time with all of the objectives met
have and watch outeven though this game was released over ten years ago i still have fond memories of it
this game really pushed the capabilities of the nintendo  with its d if somewhat still pixelated surroundings
there were enough options and variety to make the game interesting  you could go through the levels in easy normal and hard mode and beating the levels in certain difficulty levels within certain time limits would unlock cheats
some of the cheats were silly like donkey kong mode but others were cooler like invisible or infinite ammo modeplaying the levels in easy mode was a great way to prepstudy for normal and hard modes exploring the surroundings knowing where to go so you could complete the extra requirements that came with the difficult mode the save mode allowed one to explore the levels at their leisure  sometimes i played a level i already beat just for fun and exploration ignoring the time
moltiplayer mode was also a lot of funthe graphics in this game were not as refined as the wii and ps because nintendo  was a groundbreaking console when it came out and the d graphics ability was not quite fully mastered yet so for those of you used to the smoother graphics of todays current consoles you might notice a bit of clunkiness and the characters had blocky hands and limbs and their faces looked painted on their heads
but the d was welldone in terms of setup and surroundings as far as movement and exploration of the world went so two thumbs up
even now i prefer this game to many newer ones because the plotline and play was very good
a for a wonderful overall gamethis game was okay  it couldve been better
i like the story its way different than it is in the movie  its more fun
but like i said before perfect dark  is the new bond
the main story is fun and so is the multiplayer combat
theres a crap load of bond characters to unlock and levels too
but im not a bond fan in fact i hate bond
but this game is funthe movie goldeneye was a boxoffice hit and now it comes to nintendo
every wonder how james bond found natalia how xenia died or how bond killed trevalyn
now you get to do it yourself
you travel to siberia to recover blueprints go on a battleship to save hostages launch a space shuttle and shoot all the bad guys you want with over  weapons from gernades lasers all handguns machine guns and rocket and nuclear bombs
try out the game to see what you would do if you were bond
heres your chance to be great game but perfect dark is way better
if you really like bond or you can find this game cheap somewhere you might want to pick it up but if youre just looking for a good first person shooter or multiplayer game skip it and get perfect dark insteadi had to use a gameshark to get the extra levels on this game
its tough
it shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agentthere are two features about this game that i really like
the first is what id like to call maimability
if you shoot someone in the leg theyll hold onto their leg same with the arm the head and even the groin
before this game the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when theyd diestill maimability doesnt mean that when you shoot them in the leg they wont be able to run again
theyll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new except take a lot less shots to killsome of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before theyre even to the point of getting to maimability
you have to shoot the boss of the game  times in the head before he even shows signs of weakeningthe second thing i like about this game is the spy feel of it
you go on missions and you work with gadgets although some are indeed lame
but the cool thing is on some missions youve got to be really quiet and sneaky
you sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with wellaimed shots
of course if you get bored of that you can always make a lot of noise have a bunch of guards come after you and blow everyone awaythis game is pretty realistic
there may be better games now but during its time this game was cuttingedge stuff
its worth remembering even though it was hard as heck
i usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietlythis is the very first gran turismo game made
it is very fun and allot easier than the others
there r so many different cars in this game not even close to the amount as the newer ones but it has allot for the first game
the graphics r good for the ps but i have seen better
the cars slow down every time they hit a wall so that is one thing i hate and most of the tracks r only ment for a couple racers not six or more
that makes the track very hard to race on
in the quick race it lets u get better but it only has about twenty cars and ten tracks but it is fun if u play it on multiplayer
that is the reason that i like this game so much it has a great multiplayer
it does get boring after awhile but it is a fun gamethe original grand theft auto was a classic for the pc but its gleefully unabashed violence simple graphics dark humor and addictive gameplay garnered the game much appeal and controversy
eventually take  interactive now theyre called rockstar published gta on as many systems as it could the ps dreamcast and even the game boy color
these days anyone and everyone are gta nuts but only when it comes to gta  or vice city
the original gta may seem simple enough but it is undeniably fun for the most part no matter how simplistic the graphics seem
the missions can get rather tedious and the fact you cant save your progress in game a problem which would be corrected in gta  and eventually youll lose interest but for the most part the original gta is still loads of fun
those who have only played gta  or vice city will not like this original installment but its a great ride while it lastsand you just became part of itprosbrought violence and profanity in videogames to a whole new levelvery good sound effectslong enjoyable levels and misionsa short but destructable arsenoalvery useful cheat codesdespit i usally dont cheatpretty good musicconsthe graphics are plain out horribleone shot deatha bit too realisticwell unless you have armorcant save until you beat a leveldefinitly not for kidsthe game suffers from slowdowns if too many things are on the screenin  this game was jst a instant classic despite being overshadowed by loads of gamesespecially metal gear solid and zeldaocorina of time
its definitly unknown since gta  and vice city overshadowed it by a loooong mile but yet i still play this game from time to time
in this game you could even say  the police and let them eat the gat take out a squad of them with a machine gun blaze them up with a flame thrower or just blow them away with almighty rocket launcherthat was propably the main reason this game got a lot of heat form contaversy
if youre used to gta  or vice city then this game will hardly be interesting to you but if you have this game then im sure you appreciate the joy the classic burng to you and took you on the crazy ride from this all the way to vice cityfinal wordsspeaking of vice city that was one of the levels in this game and so was liberty city and san anderess is the last city
could san andress be the next grand theft auto
hmmmmpeacethis is a musthave for your n
it is fun to play by yourself but the most fun is when you play with  friends
  the graphics are not the greatest but it usually doesnt affect the gameplay
a classic n gameahhhh
i love this game
its so great
my friend gave it to me and i fell in love with it fast
i played mario kart for the snes and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread
when i found out mario kart was for n i went bezerk
this was the first game to my n collection
you choose between  characters
you can get over  different powerups including the legendary star which makes you invincible banana peels which make opponents skid out of control lightning bolts which makes characters small so you can smush them mushrooms that boost your engine and  kinds of shells
a green shell will go and bounce off anything a red shell will do its best to find a character and smash them and a spike shell with automatically find the player in st place and destroy them without fault
the reason it is  stars is because they didnt go the extra mile
if you play  or  players you can do a grand prix but not with  or  in player  mode you cant do a battle or do a vs with the cpu
battle only contains  tracks
i guess what im trying to say is that i wish it was more open
taking shortcuts wont work because lukita drags you back when your at the top of the mountain
this game would be the best if you were allowed to do morewhen i had this game i did not stop playing until i got to winning the game
its fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you
it has a four player mode which is not bad but sometimes gets a little confusing when youre watching other people racing
the split screen should never be included
although that it is which is easy to get distracted
but mario kart is fun and it should be in one of the handheld games too
i wouldnt mind playing this
oh i have the one on gameboy advance which is cool but not like the one from nintendo  now that confused megraphics   eyecatching bold and pretty mario kart s graphics are fulfilling and nice to look atsound   lots of bells whistles engines and dadas in this game
they are just small sound but bring out some sort of livelihoodvalue   even though i dont have a nintendo  if i did i would probably buy this game because it is lots of fun to play
it can also be very strategic at times which is good for a racing car gameoverall   nothing too memorable but its delightfully entertaining to play when you are actually using the controls
mario kart  gives you things to do and stuff to work out
its the first game i played on nintendo  and as far as im concerned its well worth the timethis game is really fun but i honestly enjoyed crash team racing for the playstation a lot more
one thing that annoys me about this game is that you cant look behind you
i pressed every button and i cant get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming
so nine out of ten times im going to miss my target
how did nintendo screw up this badly
and the racers are prerendered much like how donkey kong and diddy kong were in donkey kong country for the snes
i was wondering why wasnt it computer generated like super mario 
its still a nice little game a little pricey but still nice to have in your n collectionmario kart   it is such an improvement from the super nintendo version
the graphics are quite detailed in comparison to the other  games out
i would say above average
however the graphics is not what sets this game off above the others
it is the enjoyment levelnot only is it fun to compete with others like your family friends or even the computer player ai but its got a great grand prix mode in which you can compete for a gold cup
get all gold cups and you gain a bonusthe only complaint i have about this game reason why i gave it a four instead of a  is that the ai are too smart
races sometimes seem to be unfair
you throw items at them knock them to the side speed ahead of them and it seems like whatever you do it doesnt matter
this can be frustrating
though the controls are way improved over the super nintendo version it still is hard to control the carts karts around cornersoverall this is an addicting gamehave a super nintendo
buy mario kart for super nintendohave a gamecube
definetely buy mario kart double dash for gamecubeand finally if you have a n mario kart  is one to deeply consideri got this game in  and it is still fun to play
unlike the original mario kart for the snes or the new mario kart super circuit for the gba both of these games you have to use a control pad to driveyou can use the control stick on the n controller ot drive your gokart which is a hundred times easier than a control pad
the game is easy in the begining but it hets much harder as you get closer to finishing it
the graphics are spectacular and so is the music
in one course you can go off roading and drive around and look at princess toadstools castle form super mario 
the tracks are cleverly designed and all to often youll find yourselft barely winning or completing a race
the game does offer a good challenge with eight drivers to choose from which onclude the following and their speed mario average luigi average peach average toad fast yoshi fast donkey kong slow wario slow bowser slow
the speeds come to play in the later levels where only toad and yoshi are your best bet for first place
again with the gba and the gamecube which launched today as i am writing this mario kart  is a must have for n owners who cant get the gamecube or the gba for now
also each character has his or her own course and the game has race and battle multiplayer modes where in the battle mode each racer has three balloons arround his or her gokart and everyone has to try to knock out everyones balloons
have funmario kart  is one of that games that is hard to find but that effort has a very good reward cuz this is one othat games that began the real player madness you know its also considered as one of the best mario kart games ever better than mario kart double dash
 and maybe as good as mario kart wii
the only thing that i didnt give the  is that this game is a bit tedious
yes i know that graphics forget about the graphics cuz first its the n and second graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun
if you have a  and you dont have already mk you must find it now
everybody with a  must have this crazy great game
dont forget four controllers for the real madnessthis mario kart changed all mario karts in the future
this is the first mario kart that has mini games and computer generated graphics
i mean the  as u can tell the graphics have changed allot from the snes
this mario kart has many more features and great graphics
the sound is great also
if i had a choice of which mario kart to have for free if i did not have any of them it would be this one
i dont know why but for some reason this one is really fun
it has a great multiplayer especially on mini gamesid recommend buying it used to save some money
the tracks are nice and the game play is all right
its just not the same as playstation racing games thoughwhen i first heard of a mario kart game comming out for nintendo  i was overjoyed to realize that they would keep up on such an awesome super  nintendo game
to my amazment the game came to the  with nothing but  crisp graphics and prerendered characters abound
however where there  comes the good side of all this there is a bad side some of the  characters in the game in fact cheat to win
now im not sure why this  little feature was allowed perhaps to make it more challenging or give us  more reason to throw the controller at the wall when mario suddenly jumps  out in front of you
however you can master there cheating ways by  learning how to outwit them at their own game
find shortcuts and other  things that can aid you in your race for the finish
from cheating to  graphics and music i must say that the graphics are quite impressive for  such a game made so early on
the music is also amazing with hummable  tunes that will get you in the mood to race or the mood to hit wario off  the side of a moutain just to here him scream
the sure thing to do now is  to buy the game because it is a classic and always will bethis game is defanitly worth the time and money
you can choose from either mario grand prixvsbattleor time trialin mario grand prix you choose from a wide selection of characters wich one you want to beyou can pick from four different cupseach with four different race tracksthen its time to race as you play against the  other charactersup to  people can play mario grand prixin vsyou play against one computer character or  family members or friendsyou can choose any course is the gameup to  can play vsin the battle mode up to four can playyou get  balloons and the other players try to pop themthe last one standing winsup to  can play battle modefinallyin time trial only one person playsyou can choose any courseyou try to make a good time and if you wantyou can try to beat itonly one player can do time trialmario kart is a great game and if you have a nget iti was never a really big fan of scifi and star wars just wasnt my thing
i couldnt really care less about those darned rebels
obviously my expectations for rogue squadron that summer day were not very highbut you know what
i played the first mission and i was pleasantly surprised
the game actually wasnt that bad
it was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky
the game really isnt that easy to learn especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet
there are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that i have yet to figure out like what rightc does or how bombs work
but the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy
however the gameplay got to be quite repetitive
i mean you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky
yay
there are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do and it gets boring
maybe i could have moved on to the third missioni also realized how visually stunning the game is
i have an expansion pak so i really dont have a clue what the game would be like without it but the graphics are just so crisp at least certain features
the buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great almost to the level of halflife
but the graphics for the peoplestorm troopers leave more to be desired
they are obviously sprites
the music does have a star wars feel to it and thats growing on me
i sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head and i dont mind
most of the music is in the menus though
 minutes of speech is nice if only i could understand half of it
rogue squadron has no multiplayer which is too bad
it would have been fun
oh well
overall i actually kind of enjoyed this gamethere have been many n games to brighten up the new generation of gaming
this game not only has sharp graphics but it also has great gameplay and is very challengingim not really a fan of n
ive always been more of a playstation one fanatic but zelda is undoubtedly the best game that i have ever played
if you think that final fantasy is good then zelda will make all of the installments in final fantasy look like junk
theres only a couple of games on the nintendo n console that of which i liked and that was gauntlet legends super mario and donkey kong
but this game beats them all by a longshotthen why did i give this game four stars instead of five
the reason is because of theproblems listed below
this game is hard
i dont mean hard as in challenging im talkin about the whole youpossiblywillneverevercompletethegamewithoutastrategyguide hard
the type of frustration which can rack your nerves big time
there are a couple of glitches in the game
example i dare you to cut a sign with your sword
then play zeldas lullaby with your ocerina of time
the piece of sign which you had just sliced and diced will float
thats just one of the glitches
a little confusing as far as the story goes
its better to play the game twice and see if you still understand it
replay value isnt very high
once you complete it thats it
its so hard that i wouldnt ever want to go through the same frustration again as to the fact that it was very difficult even if you do know what youre doingokay those were the bads
here are the goods
the graphics are outstanding
wow
the whole world of termina reminds me of middle earth only a lot less dark and ten times more exotic
once you beat the game you feel satisfied with yourself
sure this game is a little short but it will still take you a long time to beat it no matter how experienced you are with gaming
the plot is good and twists a lot
i know that i said it was kind of confusing and it kind of is but its still fun and the things that of which i did understood surprised me a lotits sort of a mystery
fluint and absolutely excellent cut and fmw sequences
its true
like i said above the graphics are wonderful
and plus exploring a small portion of termina which you do through out the game is an experience that you dont wanna miss
the bad guys are challenging but not so challenging that youll be ripping your hair out
once you beat them you feel satisfied
highly addictive gameplay and plus you wont stop until you beat the gamebut theres one major and i mean major problem with this game
this game is so addictiive that you might forget about everything else in life
remember your family
you wont when you get this game since youl be wanting to play this game even more
a anyways get the gamei was always a fan of zelda when it first came out for the original nintendo
this is a fairly challenging game and i got bored with it quickly
there isnt a lot of violence in this game but i think its too advanced for kids to playthere isnt much you can say that is bad with this game
for its time it  had excellent graphics excellent game play and sound
this game is truly one in a million that i am sure any person can enjoy but if your a zelda fan and have played all if not most games from the beginning youll notice some of the things in oot are recycled
for example the kakariko town music is completely recycled from zelda a link to the past
in fact this game borrows a lot from zelda a link to the past though they do manage to change some things in oot here and there
still for what its worth zelda oot is still a pretty darn good game though i think the story should have been more originalwas a good purchase dont get me wrong
but i had a minor problem with it saving
at first it wouldnt save for the first  or  times
but eventually it did
other than that it worked great
awesome condition
came as describedthe game was awesome
zelda has always been an addicting mindblowing and fun game
many people like it
the game features a great d world in which there is night and day
the game also has many different enemies and dungeons and the famous ocarina where you can play different tunes that you have learned
a really good game if you like action and adventure
the frustrating thing are the puzzles
they may take some time to solve
this is not why i gave the game  stars
i believe  stars means the game is perfect
and this game is not perfecti got this on the gamecube collectors edition and really its confusing how they didnt make this the best game of    and  they did make it the best game of  and  but anyways theres a master quest version out there for gamecube
the sites are beautiful
and when u get inside the deku tree let the actionfantasy beginzelda quotoccarina of timequot is much like the rest of the zelda series it doesnt disappoint
with really cool items to collect and using your songsspells to warp around the entire game offers whole new dimensionsthings such as a horse you can call and run about the world play carnivallike games to win powerups collect hardtofind items such as the twohanded sword which is better than the master sword but you cant use a shield magically powered arrows and morethis game is fairly easy to beat but finding everything will take you much longera good game comes along entertaining millions of fans worldwide
then a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place
ever since the beginning of game history every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year
since sept  that cycle has been broken stopped by one game that never got replaced even by its sequals nothing ever ended out better than zelda ovarina of time
this game has revolutionized d gaming with its ztarget system
it has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline
it has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the sidequests and collectible items in it
this game i am predicting will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out the one after gamecube
its ztargeting system makes link the main character look at an enemy within this looking he can circle around it in stategic patterns accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks
many games even nowadays imitate this system but fail to get it as correct and perfect as zelda diddoes
the storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many nevergrowing children in it
all these children have one compainon fairy with them except one boy who does not
right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time you know your in for an adventurous complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month
and this game has many many side quests to do
there are  special spiders to defeat and get treasures with  magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas  heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with  masks to sell and play around with  empty bottles to collect a chicken to rais and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game
and much more
this game also has the perfect sound to it
the cheerfull happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in its background music
the adventurous wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in its background song
the fastpaced and actionpacked lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in its song
everywhere you turn in this game you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place and transations perfectly with whatever the playerlink might be doing in that place
this games sequal majoras mask suffered horribly from the lack of this
and the prevous games in the series didnt meet this either
one more thing though ill admit it to the world i hate the main zelda theme
im glad its not in ocarina of time in a game that so clearly stands out with its music one old sounding bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouvdv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time
oh i forot to mention that part too the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it
the places are designed very well and when mixed in with the fabulous background music gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game whatsoever
the first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest which actually used to seem so big onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild the sun will blind the screen for a moment and as rising reveal this spectacular wide open feild with a tuft of trees a monstor here and there a ranch in the middle and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun
along the feild a rise in elevation starts as you climb the hill you can see even more than you could before a magestic huge catsle a winding clear blue river a deep valley a menancing volcanoe and a huge lake along with a tuft of trees and a monstor here and there
as you travel to new places you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too when seeing the towering windmill of kakariko village above the small humble houses of the village below it with the perfect backgrond music for example
with this great feeling of adventure huge enviroments much huger than even the ones of nowaday games and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack ocarina of time is the greatest game of all time until a greater game will come out wich will probably take a very very long time
if you dont already own this game shame on you you should buy it immediatly and while waiting for it to ship download an emulated version
now
or elseclassic game
a favorite when i was a kid
still fun to this day i just wish the graphics were better
got to remember this game is from  and one of the first d games of its time
great gamethis is still a great game to own especialy if you missed it but the graphics are dated
if you have a gamecube find a way to get it on there and be happy you didthis game was a tad on the easy side for the most part but it was still great fun
one of the best zelda games
cool places to explore and neat items to findi got this game because every person said it was the best game ever
for  it is but now its just good
not as good as wind waker or twilight princess
the level design is good
parts are d others are resident evil camera
in short it works okay but i screwed up many times becaus of it
the graphics were good several years ago but now they are muddy and polygonal
aside from that its zelda
nothing new
if you buy it dont expect it to live up to all the hypeok alot of people hate this game  but i cant complain with italthough some of the levels are annoying i hate the nd level of india with a passion at least it held mostly to the name of tomb raider the nd and th onwards should be named city raider the graphics are kinda yellowish
the lighting can be harsh
but its a lengthy game  took me almost months to beat partially cause i jumped triliogy installmentsbut its an ok game
its better than the nd and way better than all the others afterwards  but doesnt messure up to the originali own a playstation but i hardly think its that great a console
blame it on the n for their exceptional games but i do believe that the playstation may have some hope left in itwell tomb raider  is a good  example
this is a huge game with a lot of d explosions and gunfire and  lots of jumping
also if you have something against people and animals  then you wont be dissappointed eitheryou also get to blow uo raptors  and a trex by the way
despite being a solid title i beta the game long  ago and have since went on to other pursuits like zelda
im not gonna  compare the two mind you but lets say that while tl is a really good  game and somewhat long its not gonna make a classic or give mario or  sonic a run for their moneysimply put all the tr games are long and  filled with adventure
laras cute and i like this game but its just not  gonna be what im looking for longtermits also tedious to have to  play through it again
i think its a moodgame youre likely to bore  through the whole thing when youre in the mood and that sounds  extremebut as you can tell  stars is saying alot cause this game  definetely restores my faith in the playstation and its overrated gamesif lara were to make the jump to the dolphin i wouldnt be surprised  tomb raider always had the potential to be a great game its just that  sometimes you need a lot of patience and perhaps this will fit  nicelyfinally the graphics and the sound are passable
levels are  detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at  timesbut given any new lara croft game ill be excited and im looking  foward to the new game after the last one last christmasyes tr is a bear so to speak 
eg theres a particular spot at the very outset of the game hiding under the leaves which you have to make a blind leap to find and would never guess is there if someone hadnt told you
but that is in the grand old tradition of adventure  the one point remainder a postage stamp usually in the old days or dropping the magazine in a particular place when youre at your wits end
the impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life and ask real people for the answer
very legitimate
same as dont kill monks at barkhang monastery tr and dont kill monkeys either tr
this game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels other than gameplay
its full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of tr and i enjoy everything about it  except playing
the game part is tedious unfair and annoying beyond belief
but its a real collectors item especially on playstation  be sure to keep your ps memory card
 and in our family its in its second generation of total immersionfor a few reasons new people of the tomb raider games should not start out on this one unless they are really skilled at video games
seriously i beat tomb raider one and two and even four with a heck of a lot more ease than i did with part three
so no i would not recommend this to new gamers but people that want a challenge this is the game to getone of the biggest reasons this game is so hard are the secrets
they sometimes put the secrets in places you would never even notice
so i advise if you want the secret level at the end of this game to get a strategy guide cause  of the time you cannot find all the secrets on your own
the secret level though is not neccessary to beat the game at the end and not truly worth the bother to me
i was so happy and exhausted to just finally beat the game that i could have cared less about a secret level and wouldnt have wanted to play it anywayand that was another problem
how hard the ultimate boss at the end was
i thought the dragon in part two was difficult at least when it hit me i didnt automatically lose
with the ultimate boss in part three if you get too close he will spew this stuff at you and right away you drop dead
it was difficult and frustrating and took me forever to beat
yet i cannot say it is impossible for i did at last beat it but it is nearly impossible and will take you most likely a long while like i what i did was the best i got out my rocket launcher and just kept blowing away at him while jumping around and around that platform
i definitely would not stand there or get too close make sure you are as far away as possible for he will not spew that stuff at you unless you are closethen i guess the next hardest part of part three was just the levels themselves
some parts of the game were very difficult and without the strategy guide next to me i would have encountered many many dead ends or stepped into a place that just ended lara
it grew pretty frustrating at times and the worst part of it all is that you cannot save anytime you like so unless you cheat and get a load of crystals you will do some backtrackingworst part of the gamenevada in this part all the medi packs you saved up all the ammo you saved up before the guards take it all away from you so you have to go through the levels finding your guns and picking up as many medi packs as you can
it grew to be very difficult and i hated that part of the game
the only good part of this level was at the very end when you got to see a few alien bodiesbest parts of the gamesouth america for its lovely scenes and it wasnt impossible to beat
i also liked the dinosaurs they put in it reminded me of tomb raider one all over againand london london was fun as well i enjoyed playing there with what looked like the same sphinx like statue placed in this part as was in tomb raider one except this time you dont go into this oneso so levelsindia sometimes a challenge that got on my nerves but then the rest of the time it was just normal tomb raider stuff a little boring of a level compared to the others
the statues coming alive were pretty scary thoughanartica creepy part of the game
at the ending part of all tomb raider games there is some breed of creatures you have to fight in part one it was what looked like animals turned inside out in part two she fought what looked like action figures and now in part three she has to fight mutants
creepy definitely
got a little scary sometimes
and this part of the game was not too hard but indeed i was always kept on alert with those mutants
one problem i hated in this part though was the carts those mine carts drove me crazy i was always dying in them
just keep working at it though eventually you get around those corners without dyingoverall i give this game a  to a  star rating
it is definitely not as good as the first two just a heck of a lot more frustrating but indeed it was a challenge and lara croft is still a fun character to play with so i cant hate this game but i definitely will not play it again for a long time
it is just too stressful and hard of a game to play all the timedo not think tomb raider four is just as stressful and nearly impossible part four is a lot better and i recommend it highlynever played this when i was a kid but decided to purchase a classic game as im trying to build my own personal ps collectionlove this game
so much fun
it is even better with the cheats
one of the best games for the n
i can play this for hours apon hours
i love this gameturok  seeds of evil has a lot to love about it
the music rocks
the graphics are still quite good for n standards especially if you have the expansion pak
it controls just fine get used to the cbutton controls
theres some good multiplayer
its a bloody gory mess
and the weapons are freaking awesome just wait till you see the cerebral borebut theres a big problem with it designim not talking about the art direction or graphical look
turok  is still a goodlooking game with gruesome enemies and solid lighting effects
but these levels are confusing as all hell with the exception of the st one
if we had a better story to go along with it then maybe thered be a reason to plow through
but for whatever reason acclaim  iguana decided to force the player to scour every inch of the  levels and if youre stuck youre stuck for goodyou will be required to light beacons find keys and rescue children
again level  isnt so bad but levels  are gonna be a pain in the butt if you get lost
the map youre given sucks
and to make matters worse you cant leave or quit levels once youve selected thembut if youre not too proud to grab a strategy guide or go online then turok  will be more fun than perhaps some of us had back in   the combat is still a blast although the final primegen boss is impossible without cheat codes
the presentation is sharp
and the turok world is still very unique from todays overload of militarywar shooters
turok  was one of the ns most criticallyacclaimed titles for the console rightfully so
but be warned itll test your gaming logic more than you expectthis game is not receiving the credit it deserves
its a good quality game
i had a blast playing it
far more than i did with twisted metal  and  the whole series is awesome and to me theres not a bad twisted metal gamea lot of people dismiss this game because of the different developers but i personally thought it was a good game
it was the first twisted metal i have played and when i played twisted metal  i thought it was a little better but not muchnot terrible like the other reviews sayits solid just not as good as parts  and but at this point in time you should be playing the newest version released look it upi always hated the wcw
i was playing warzone attitude and wwf titles for a long time
then i somehow ended up owning this game and i inteneded to dissmiss it but i found myself playing it more and more every day and eventualy loved it
i was happy to hear thq got the rights to wwf and went from this to wrestlmania and then the best game on the  no mercy
however this is the foundation of where it started and i respect it for that
it brought a lot of awsome memorys and entertainment on hot summer nights
i recomend no mercy over this but this original version deserves your respecti should probably review some modern games while im here but ive been kinda gtaed out recently so i decided to put the ps away for a minute and bring up some old games from the past to see if theyre just as fun as i remember them as
one of those titles was wcwnwo revengereleased during wcws heyday and roughly a few months before wcws eventual downfall the game showcases an astoundingly deep roster for game that came out in the s
a total of  wcwnwo wrestlers were divided up into different factions  wcw  mainevent wrestlers wcw  midcard wrestlers wcw  opening match wrestlers wcw  cruiserweight wrestlers nwo white nwo red and ravens flock
further there were roughly a dozen or so other wrestlers listed under the imaginary ewf and daw leagues included in the game these wrestlers were modeled after japanese wrestling stars but had their likenesses changed to avoid copyright issuesthe controls of the match are simple enough for anyone to jump in and learn but you have to understand the psychology of wrestling and use the controls accordingly if you want to go deep into the championship modes of the game
players use the b button to strike a button to initiate a grapple the dpad to move and the joystick to either taunt or execute a special move
the player can differentiate between a weak strikegrapple and a strong strikegrapple by holding the respective button down until the move is executed
the more worn down your opponent is the better chances you have of successfully hitting them with a strong attack
yet if you try to initiate a strong grapple on an opponent whos not worn down theyll likely reverse the attack and counter with one of their own
so much like real wrestling you have to wear your opponent down with the weak attacks until you move up and hit them with the strong ones and also like wrestling its a good idea to generate a response from the audience by letting out a taunt while your opponents down
once your spirit meter is full you can strike an opponent with a special move by initiating a strong grapple and then moving the joystick or alternately using the joystick when on the turnbuckle if the finishers an aerial maneuver
the controls also allow you to run leave the ring blockcounter an attack dodge an attack and set your focus on another opponent if youre involved in a handicap or tag team scenariothe game has several modes  championship exhibition and special modes
the exhibition mode is a singles or tag team match where the player can face either the computer a friend or a few friends since the game supports up to  players
the championship modes allow the player to compete for the wcw tv championship the wcw cruiserweight championship the wcw tag team championship the wcw united states championship and the granddaddy of them all the wcw world heavyweight championship affectionately referred to as the big gold belt
while the path to the television titles and the cruiserweight titles arent terribly challenging you will need to bring your a game when competing for the highertiered titles or you can dial the difficulty down to easy either or
the special modes essentially allow the player to engage in specialty handicap or battle royal exhibition matches with the former allowing for on or on battles while the latter will have  competitors fighting each other in the ring until ones eliminated with the option to allow up to  contestants to enter the match
youre also given a mode where you can customize the given wrestlers to either have different names or to have them wear different costumesthe upside to the game is that its still fun to play even  years later
as i said earlier anyone can pick up the controllers and jump in while the subtle nuances of the game dont take much effort to figure out as you go along
the soundtrack is limited but i dont ever think anyone confused wcws entrance music with the music that jim johnston of wwe fame has released over the years with the only exception being goldbergs theme
the graphics were a work in progress considering where the franchise was at by the time wwf no mercy was released but it was still leaps and bounds better than what most expected from the gameplay of other systems at the time as a reminder this game was released for a console that is three generations removed from whats available today
if there was one drawback from the game its the limited gaming options that exist
once you beat the championship mode that was essentially it as far as beating the game was concerned
there were no steel cage match options tag teams were limited to on action and the createawrestler option wouldnt be introduced until thqaki began releasing titles for wwf
other gripes i have are that you cant seemingly control whether or not someone interferes on your behalf and the fact that the cpu can hulk up their spirit meter rather effortlessly while the player has to do all the little things right to make that possiblewith all that said however the games fun factor makes it a legitimate must have for wrestling fans and should be considered by n fans who are looking for a beatemup buttonmasher where the top prize is the wcw championship
i recommend this to n gaming fans wrestling fans and people who watched wrestling when it was cooli had purchased quite a few games trying to find the one i remember
this game is fun and has a good roster of  characters
the moves are simple and the game is fun hours on end
a good way to relax after a tiring daytomb raider  is the hardest of the tomb raider series at least in my opinion
it has a very complicated plot decent graphics and a moderate amount of actionalthough i have not completed it myself
it could use more action and less puzzles however
the biggest problem with it that ive faced is that it has a lot of bugs and errors throughout
some errors can be fixed without a lot of hassle others can be fixed but with a lot of hassle and some cant be fixed at all
myself i dont have a lot of patience i just play the game because i love challenges
so unless you have a lot of patience or enjoy tough challenges like i do tr is not for youbetter than tr for sure
it has some brain taxing levels filled with puzzles secrets and some enemies
im glad to see they have cut back on the enemies and focused on the puzzles and scenery
they have definatly picked some good locations for the game with brilliant details that are authentic in style
unfortunatly that is where the authenticity endsthe level makers should have done some research on these locations and made them more like they are in real life
ok i know its an adventure game that is meant to be fantasy but i do feel they could have checked things out firstexamples india dosnt have pyrannasbrazil does the ganges dosnt end in a pond stpauls cathedral looks nothing like thatthat must be the worst rendition of it yet the british museum is not next to the lloyds building and area  is more spacious than thati saw it on a tv programme i swear
i wont judge the pacific levels though i dont know enough about them
they realy do need to watch their locations moreenjoyable game thoughyes i did find this a bit cumbersome
i wanted a more puzzle oridented game
i kept getting stuck in seemingly absurd situations and go to a walkthrough forum to make progress
one of the comforts is that a cheat code can take you to the next level if you get frustrated through not being able to figure out some trick to advance
lara is a great character
but in this game she is faced with too many obstacles and impossibletodiscover secrets to make the game truly enjoyablethis game is so much fun
ive always been a big fan of mario since the beginning
the graphics are great and the sound is pretty good too
there are many different goals to reach in each level
whether you have to collect coins or stars to open new levels i know youll love this gamefor anyone who was a fan of video games they remember the year of the playstation made waves and drew many nintendo fans away with its bit graphics and cd based games
for the first time nintendo was being challenged on its own ground and they had to answer sony with a console of its own
after they put the super nintendo system to rest they went to work and released the nintendo  to the public
the odds were against them because with only two launch titles to choose from early adopters had to either pick pilotwings  a good game or super mario  this game was the reason nintendos console immediately flew off the shelves and showed that mario can make the jump to d and it was fun doing soill make my review short because other reviewers had covered the basics and importance of super mario  it stars mario in an open world where each stage is contained within various paintings scattered through princess peachs castle
the storyline is pretty typical by now king bowser kidnaps the princess and you jump in to rescue her
the graphics are colorful bright and were a breakthrough in video game technology at the time
the controls are perfect and take almost no time to get used to
its a pretty challenging game so expect to replay certain stages over and over again
so why did i give it  stars
the camera is not perfect but back then getting the camera to work in any open world style game was difficult to program
it always centers behind you but sometimes gets a little wacky when you go up ledges or around corners
it gets annoying after awhile but you learn to tolerate itwhat made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal
super mario  exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication
those who say didnt like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly
while gaming has changed tremendously since  this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play
and now you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the nintendo ds
so if you havent played this take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game
i highly recommend itim not very good at video games so this game is pretty tough for me
i only have about  stars right now and ive had it about a year
however other than the notsogreat d graphics and the silly camera angles it is a fun though challanging game
i look forward to someday getting all  starts
hahawhat can i say
this game is fun and funny at the same time
from mario flying around with the magic caps to mario burning his  cheeks on the hot lava this game is great
my only problem with this game is the freakin camera angles
ahhhhh sometimes i feel like i could just kick the lakitu that controls the thing
angles sometimes get soooo akward that it makes it difficult to make a jump correctlyor so you wont go flying down to your death
other than that i give it a  would be  if the camera was betteri bought this game in  over a year after it was released
the first few weeks i played it i was amazed at the beautiful d graphics
honestly  i had never seen d graphics before this game so it was awesome and  inspiringi love this game so im writing this review
there are some  memorable moments from this game like when mario ventures into the haunted  mansion or when he goes on a rainbow ride in the skiesall in all it  showcases the n incredible d graphics and the sound isnt half  badthe levels are interesting and sparse  i beat this game with the  nintendo power guidebook and should take some time to crack the puzzles
basically the game is quite easy and not surprisingly it has enough  miniquests and puzzles to keep you occupied
as for level designs i think  its excusable considering its first generation stuff but still deep  enough to immerse you again after a long absencemy gripe is while  this game is really good i mean im a bigtime mario fan from the first  mario game its only as good as it lasts
i found it hard to go back to  this game after a while cause it was like having discovered everything and  it made it hard to play through the whole thing againmy advice play  selectively
you need to get into the mood
while i say that its without  doubt that i have never regretted buying this gameeven if i never play  this game again and leave it to collect dust not likelyill always  remember this game as one of the finest moments of the n lifetime that  is anyway every super mario game is groundbreaking smb  created the sidescroller smb was queer and fun smb is the greatest  platform game ever smb was one of the most replayed game i ever played  and this game is mario in d without luigiwhich is sadbut cheer up  people the next generation is almost upon us
but i know that when we look  at d graphics today we will know that this game had a part to play in  making this our reality todayi remember when i was in high school and this game was brand new and just came out
i played this sooooo much i got an ache in my hand
ive only beaten it once but ill tell you what in that one time it took me  to  months to beat iti could knock a few stars off by going on and on about what they should have put into this game a playable princess animal costumes fire flowers etc but such negativity could foolishly ruin such a great game
super mario  isnt perfect but it has the best damn gameplay of any action title
the worlds are massive with lots of vibrant colors whacky enemies catchy music and most importantly gameplaythe only downsides to this game are marios horribly annoying voice an occasionally fussy camera and the possibility of graining your n control stick when you fight bowser
these minor neusances are mild though and they dont really hinder the gameplay
all other downsides merely point to the characters themselves mario speaks with a bad italian accent voiced by charles martinet instead of his old brooklyn one from the cartoon series
i also dont like the changes made to princess toadstool
instead of the spunky redhead from the cartoon series she seems more like a dumb blonde with a weird voiceyes this game is old but like fine wine games can get better with ageone of the best mario games ever made it was such a huge jump from the previous consoles looked and played amazingly hours of entertainment for anyone that enjoys adventure type gamesmario was always kind if a hard game for me
i unlocked a lot of stars but a lot of the game went unlocked
i never did beat the whole thing
there are some cheats you can look up online for this gamesuper mario  has some of the best graphics ever shown on a home consolebelieve it or not but i like the graphics in super mario  more than the graphics in super mario sunshinesure the levels look great and have snappy tunes to match but the game is way too easy except for bowsermario  is overrated but still one of the best games ever madeit isnt the best game of all time but it packs a powerful punchlets hope super mario  is even better with harder challengesbetter graphics and more levels
i mean mario  was great but the sequel should be harder because i dont really want to own  mario games that are too easy and not long enoughthis is wat made me love mario
mario this is the biggest game crammed into a cartridge ive seen its musically awesome graphically it shows age and the camera isnt as good as it could be but i still havent beaten it since then
thats how massive  how much gameplay there is to iti remember sliding down caves  smashing boulders back in the day now that a friend sold it to me im in love with itone of the launch titles for the n back in  super mario  had only a small band of rivals at the time
the most prominent being star wars shadows of the empire and star fox  the game has stood the test of time in several factors
one you can still find it brand new
two the previous games mentioned are almost impossible to find unused
three for a launch game the graphics were great but they are not as good as late comer banjokazooie
the story line is interesting and the levels are big but not as large as banjokazooie
you have to find  power stars that bowser stole from princess peachess castle and if you get all  you can go to a cannon near the castle hop inside shoot onto the roof of the castle meet yoshi marios dinosaur friend who will give a super new jump and  lives
the games levels are challenging espicially the last few levels and the levels where you fave bowser you have to beat him three times are dangerous especially the last one
from the sea to land to desert to snow covered mountain and to the desert and beyond mario must battle enemies in d and collect six stars on every level
five stars are attainable by completing tasks while the sixth is attainable when you collect  coins on a level
the music is hummable and the characters are nice and mean
this is still marios biggest adventure and with the coming of the gamecube and the fall in price for the nintendo  and its games super mario  is a must have
ive had my  since christmas  and also received super mario  which is still a great gamesurprisingly when nintendo created the n game system they had absolutely no idea of how succesful it would be
the first game that the system ran on was also a scream
it just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on cdrom like the playstation  and the xbox may have faster and better graphics but not likely with the actual loading timenintendos super mario  remains as the most dynamic staple of any n system to date
the graphics are just completely amazing and so strong from one angle to another
in super mario  you guide mario through  terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner
the object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game
each star is very vital inorder to help you save peach whom is still known as princess toadstool from the vile bowser
each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom from sea to the firey sky and even in a spooky ghostfilled house
the load up time for this and every other n game is much faster than the cdrom games for the pc and the other cdrom console gamesit is kind of sad nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this and traded it for a cdrom gaming factory with the gamecube
nevertheless super mario  is still the most superior game of the th century and that is not even a pizzafaced liei enjoyed this game
it was very fun
it was the very first game i owned for the n so i didnt really understand how the controls worked but this game was really easy to figure out
i love it
when i walk by it in stores and see it  im speechless
it is a great game and by the looks of it the price it down too
this is definently worth your moneywell i dont acttully have  stars but that is how much you are suposse to get
but i have  stars
i am onyy  so please awnser my revies for mewhat a great game i like it alot
the only problems i found were it gives off way too many hints to how to complete a puzzle or beat a bossexample on the first time you fight bowser he says can you get behind me and grab my tail
i think not
 moving around is kinda stupid because mario cant move to the different direction fast enough and he slips on the floor when he movesother than these flaws this is a solid title that deserves to be in your collectionthis game is fun but dont expect a classic super mario game
this one is way diffrent than any other mario game before it but still great in its own waythis is a great classic game that basically revolutionized nintendo  but there is only one problem
it is way too easy to beat
but i guess since its an old game i can see whybasically the mission is to recover all the  stars and save the princess from the evil bowser
its really easy and you can beat the game in about a month
even though i have plenty of nintendo games i still go back to this game once in awhile because its a classic favorite
many current nintendo games cant compete against it
if only this game was a bit more challenging
i think all new nintendo  buyers should get this as there first game because you can explore alot with controls and skills thatll help you out in more challenging gamesany fans of mario or nintendo genre would like this game
as far as kids there isnt much violence in this game
no blood or gorey actions
the price is pretty ok and the games plot is pretty ok there are many courses and places to explore so if you are a slow player itll take some time
after you complete the game youll still be going back to it
seeing that my brothers and i already beat it over  times were finally getting tired of iti found this game to be a challenge at first used to the old sidescrolling games of mario it took some time to get used to the fact its now in dif you like mario you will love thi d gamegreat graphics good gameplay
if you want a challenging game get this one
its kinda hard itll keep you busy for a couple of weeksi love this game
i have overall like i said  out of  highly recommend it to anyone who loves great games and platformersperhaps scks main problem is that it is far too detailed
even on a speedy topend machine the screen will fill with portions of white if you try to scroll at one of higher resolutions
perhaps this is also scks  main virtue  the fact that you can see down to the last person in your  metropolis
whatever you say despite the games vast graphical and  notsovast strategic advances it failed to do what the fans of the series  held closest to their hearts  personalization
the city develops  completely at random within your zonal confines  you cannot make a  candleshop district a downtown or anything of the sort
you cannot name  streets despite the fact that you place them yourself
the papers mention  you rarely and glancingly at best preferring to metion senseless rock  bands whose names you cannot supply either or some other uneventful  thing
the advisors are as helpful as ever  specifically useless
they  either take no notice of the trouble befalling your city or they take  notice of something very minor and blow it up to the size of a scandal
the   commercial tax is killing the city
remove the parking fines
all  the while industry fails to develop and a major power outage goes  unnoticedthis game is a cleaner crisper version of simcity   perhaps an update but in no way a new game in the seriesi enjoy playing this game for the most part
i have spent hours glued to the computer watching my cities grow
unfortunately as the cities increase in population so does the chances of the computer crashing  a very annoying problem
also the parades last too long the seaports are difficult to develop the terrain for some cities such as st louis are unusually hilly and the buildings look alike
the game is not that challenging
but overall a recommended gamemaking a city its a change for once
i like this game because it gives easy control and its fun to play
there are some downsides to it too like it takes too long to make a big city and sims complain tooooo much but its all good other then that
my favorite thing to do is save the city then rip it down by disteasters
the good thing is you dont have to save it after you destory it
this game can be easy or hard like if you want to make a big city it takes time and its hard but if you use codes likei am weak call coison vinnie i love red tape power to the masses water in the desert garage in garage out and nardz roolactually spelling its eazy 
graphics well it isnt that good on making small sims but good on everything else  fun a very fun game isnt has fun as some games but its cool gameplay well if you like making cities then it has long gameplay  sound i really like the sound because it makes me think more overall you would love this game but its fun isnt like some games  which is greatawesome and  stars for sim city first off let me clear up some misstatements about the features listed above by amazoncomrealistic d environmentwrong
the game is d it merely looks d
it is realistic however
there is far more detail in  d than could ever have been done in d and still hae it run on everyones  machine
view cities from up to  feeti guessyou have  zoom  levels
the above implies that you can zoom to any level
detailed  control over businesses and other facilitiesnone whatsoever other than  being able to zone blocks of residential commercial and industrial areas  along with other specialized zones
you cant micromanage any individual  businesses
everything and everyone movescars and simcitizens move  so do some animated buildings but certainly not everything
optional  loadin sets for customization and enhancementsthats handled much  better in sck unlimitedsimcity  is a mixed bag for me
i love  being able to play a fully updated version of  but whether it should  be called  or  is something of a dilemmagraphicswise  is  beautiful
no two ways about it
a lot of hype has gone into the fact that  you can now zoom in and see little sims walking driving around in  individual cars and so on
the building images are now fully sided  entities so that rotating the view yields  different looks at each  feature
five zoom levels let you choose the size youre comfortable with  to build on
some people claim that the buildings are blocky and pixellated  at the highest zoom
i dont have that problem but they are definitely not  the crisp renders that the other  zooms are
they are merely enlargements  of the th zoom
vehicles and pedestrians remain crisp and distinct at any  zoomgameplay heres the sticking point for me
if youve continued to  play simcity  until youre redeyed and guaranteed to be late for  workschool youll probably do the same with  given all the new bells  and whistles itll take some time to try them all and see how this affects  that
from this point however two camps emerge
one camp will continue  playing the game for years and loving every minute of it relishing the  freedom to create anything they want
i fall into this category
the other  camp once having seen everything and mastered building megalopoli at will  are going to wonder whats the fun anymore
so depending on your  expectations for the game itll be either a gift from heaven or something  you may well have wished didnt cost  to  bucksas for difficulty  its no harder really than  some of the new features like garbage  disposal ordinances and neighboring city dealings add depth and strategy  without making the game unduly complex
maxis should be commended for  thatoverall
its good
in fact its very good
they put a lot of work  into it making sure everything balances more or less
is it worth the  money
not now with sck unlimited out
get it instead as its much more  refined
if you havent played a simcity game before or if youre a diehard   fan absolutely
if you just sorta liked  and quit playing it  after a little bit you may want to wait until it hits the bargain rackone of my all time favorites for the n
in my opinion one of the best looking games for the system
if you like the genre and youre interested in playing older games pick this one up
i know this game wont make many peoples short list however if you are into spaceships lasers and are a huge nerd youll know youll like it
if you are not a fan of shooters dont pick it upthis is a little superior to its playstation version
the graphics are better the controls are a little better and its a litle more fun
this is a great game
and i think this should please all mortal kombat fans
if you still have your nintendo  and you dont have this game get it nowi had this game given to me for free years ago on the pc format
i liked it but for some reason it crashed on me one day and i mustve done something to the disc cause it never worked or would reinstall on any computer after thatall these years later ive just picked it up second hand for the n
and i must say there is not really any difference between the pc version and the  version which is a good thingthe only difference is in the movies
the pc and i spose gaystation version had the movies  ending in video form where as the  replicates them the same way using the polygons of the d characters themselves
i have no complaint about it i like it wether its video form or d poly form
they both still tell the same story
except reiko who just walks off into a portal the other versions show what happens when he goes into the portal he puts on his shoa kahn mask
shame thats not in itall the codes and moves where the same and i like the fact that the practive mode allows you to press pause and choose a list that displays all the characters moves fatalitys and weapens etc tho im really kind of sick of the combinations of move lifts which makes it great to just go into the options highlight continues  and hold down blockrun untill it takes you to the hidden menu where you can turn on auto fatalitys and stuffthe only bad thing i can say about the game is what it should have had included
it needed to be fixed so that the auto fatalitys worked like in mk trilogy all platforms except the n version where each button freformed a diffrent fatality  fats freindship babality etc that about itthis game is one of the best head to head fighter games
unfortunatly the team at crapcom decided to make a billion versions of street fighter for every other system talk about over kill but they didnt wanna make one for the  so thats there loss which means mortal kombat is the best head to head fighter on the  if you ask methis game is actualy converted to the  straight from the arcade and then extras where added in after that which makes it better then the arcade
like the fact you can play as goro  noobsaibot and a skinless character named meat go to gamefaqcom for the codesmk is the best head to head fighter on the n in this realmi picked this up the other day
it only took a few hours to finish the player mode but i suppose the fact that id previously played battletanx global assault on ps helped me out a littlestory some virus gets out of control and eliminates  of the females on planet earth
this dude named griffin is in love with this girl and then the government comes and takes her away
meanwhile gangster militias that are armed with tanks take over the us and likely the rest of the world
griffin vows to get his girlfriend back and save america from the various tank gangsgameplay you play the entire campaign through in your stereotypical mock abrams tank blasting through enemy defenses and rescuing or kidnapping
women
your tribal army needs women to stay in existence
different gangs have different types of tanks
there are a variety of powerups for your tank like swarmer missiles guided missiles lasers and gun buddies you can set down to defend areas
most of the missions remind me of a multiplayer session of capture the flag from any number of fps games
battletanxs singleplayer is unique in that regardcontrols they work pretty good
no complaintsmultiplayer theres no coop campaign
boo
p you can play through various types of matches most of which resemble the singleplayer levels against friends or the ai
you can use the tanks of enemy games in the multiplayer
thats all good and well i guess but i know i can blow my friends to kingdom come
what i really wanted was to be able to play it through the campaign on  playersgraphics theyre early n but they look alright
i dont like the fact that your main tank in singleplayer looks so cartoony
the comicstyle storytelling is unique and i think theyre way better than ps global assaults campy voiceactingif youre a fan of the battletanx series i suppose owning what i assume is the first entry is important
however if i had to choose between this game and its sequel i would choose the latter due to its better singleplayer campaignsouth park the video game is all right
i dont think its smash worthy but i really dont think its flush worthy either because it did probably one of the smarter things and totally copied  goldeneye and gave it a total south park twistas usual weird stuff is happening around south park like mad killer turkeys are attacking the city strange mutants are running around and crazy self propelled toys are out to get you as you take the baddest  year olds on the planet stan kyle kenny and cartman on this strange vulger and very gratuitous journeyi gotta say it the game was funny and it made me laugh all the way through especially if you ran across the terrance and phillip bombs
other than that i really didnt feel there was much else besides all the cool codes like all the weapons codes and stuff and that you could be so many people in the multiplayer mode like officer barbrady mr mackey mkay terrance and phillip and if you really wanted to starvin marvinthe story is really silly but then again when is there an episode of south park that isnt just plain out ridiculous
exactly
the controls are pretty easy too
you can set it to goldeneye style of control or for you advanced users you can use a turok type of controli still gotta say that i wouldnt play it for its story mode
personally id play it for its multiplayer mode because thats what the game is really good at
that and i personally thought you could do a lot more in the vs modes rather than in the story modesfor you parents most of the swearing is bleeped out but a few quotchoicequot phrases are in there so give it a thought before you buy it for your kids
for those of you that dont have to worry about that order a pizza call over a few friends and throw on some south park multiplayer
have funi used to play this game years ago lol
the funniest foul mouthed rd graders stick it to the turkeys once and for all
from dart guns pee drenched snow balls this game is a good laugh for south park fansthis is truly a funny game
it captures the feel of south park with its cartoony style
the weapons are funny like snowballs nd fire yellow snowballs to plungers
the voices from the show are funny
i recomend this game to any south park fan out theresure this games been out for alomost four years now but its time i reviewed it
the exceptionally popular foulmouth tv shows based on the fictional yet epic adventures of kyle cartman stan and the now removed kenny four innocent little third graders now fourth in the snowy mountain town of colorado
its a wonderful life you have a gay teacher a pimpdaddy chef a best friend who dies more than  times a week and all the cheesy poofs you could ever want
at least until killer turkeys aliens clones and toys invade your town and try to take it over
you and you alon must prevent these attacks or you could just leave the worthless town to be burnt but then the games no funlike all shooters i only enjoy this game with cheats
the master cheat for this game is bobbybird or if you break it down bobby bird
it unlocks every weapon level and everything else your twisted little mind wants from this gamein singleplayer you assume the role of either stan cartman kenny or who i always pick kyle
each comes with their own insults and comments
as you progress you find kenny cartman and stan and they come with you but you cant play as or with them
they just allow you to hold more weapons and item i guess thats because its four pairs of hands
your first mission is to destroy the turkeys and ultimatly the gigantic roboturkey
without cheats you start with a snowball or you can advance it and make it a yellow snowball and if youve seen jackass you know what that is
the other weapons are a cow launcher a toymachine gun and more
sooooo much morethis game is a good game but only if youre a fan of the tv show
even though it would be fun if some people werent theyd still annoy everyone complaining of bad language and foul humor
ignore them
if youre a fan get this or at least rent it
latercastlevania  offers you the experience of seeing a castlevania adventure in a freeroaming d realm
i have played every castlevania game right back to the nes days and this is a good addition to a fine series
this is a great game but not as good as castlevania symphony of the night for playstationto start on a positive note there is a lot of depth added thanks to the d graphics
you can roam freely battle monsters facetoface and search for hidden items without the constraints of sidescrolling
the control is responsive and the buttons are easy to figure out which is good considering the pace of the game
the d worlds are huge and are fun to explore
the sound is also excellent
you can hear the clatter of bones the snapping of jaws and the cracking of whips clearly without that horrible distortion that we all remeber from earlier installmentsthe cons of this game are mostly technical nothing to do with the graphics or storyline
first of all the camera can be a servere pain sometimes
it often lingers when you dont want it to and the response time for panning and scanning is pertty badthe control is good but sometimes it is clunky when you need to perform delicate movements
i remember the first level when i kept falling into the water and dying when i tried to jump from one ledge to another and missed by one inch
also a map would be helpful
certain areas look the same as others and sometimes i cannot tell where i have been and where i am going
but as i said these are more technical flaws
they dont exactly ruin the gameoverall this game is fun and gives a whole new depth to the longrunning series
but as good as this is castlevania sotn for playstation is much betteri have always wanted to play this game since its release
however due to money restraints and the negative reviews i heard about it i did not get it
years later i decided to finally try it out after watching videos of it on youtube
i was actually impressed and wished i had played it years ago
it is fun to play
although it is a bit choppy in control and the camera angle is somewhat annoying this is a fun gameextremely difficult to play unless youre an expert
great graphics
problem with this video game is that it does get old after maybe an hour or so
many levels to conquer
id only recommend this game to those who have plenty of patience
you know the same kind of patience you need to have while on ebay just waiting for a posted items time to run out while them other have nolife buyers often snipe the item you wanted so badly in the last fifteen seconds
that kind of patiencei used to own this game and while it is not the game i miss most i still do think about it from time to time
the visuals are very good for the ns graphics engine and the voice acting though there isnt a whole lot is pretty good
the control is a bit of a problem as is the camera
however this is not a big surprise for it is the first time the series of castlevania has been moved to the third dimension
then again other series didnt really have that much trouble in the third dimension zelda mario final fantasy breath of fire etc
 but you cant always win can you
the music is awesome naturallyits castlevania
the sound effects are also good
the boss design is highly unique as well and most importantly its fun
i bought it for a mere  and it was actually worth it
though i have sold it i might try and purchase a friends copy
if you are looking for a game that is a bit more simplistic in design than the classic castlevania titles then this is your ticket for sureim very reluctant to try the new spyro game for ps or to buy the spyro games available for xbox because spyro games have stooped to such a low quality im afraid to play them
but for the old spyro games on psone i have no fears because these ones were developed by insomniac ratchet and clank resistance fall of man the studio that made the good ones but sadly no longer makes them
the story is about how spyro has to rescue all of the dragons who have been imprisoned in crystal cocoons by nasty nork
the gameplay functions very well for an old platformer and never really gives you much trouble because of how smoothly it handles
the flight mechanic works well but you cant use it all the time
the graphics look nice for the time but are feeble by todays standards
the environments are bright and colorful and still have a great feel to them
you will spend your time defeating lots of enemies rescuing your dragon friends collecting jewels finding hidden locations getting health by letting your dragon fly buddy eat butterflies and have a lot of fun doing all this
as much as this might sound terrible to some gamers its actually not repetitive and boring but in reality a lot of fun
the biggest flaw of the entire game is the camera
the camera is a bit difficult to handle and will unfortunately cause a few cheap deaths
also this game in some ways feels a bit too easy because within a twenty minute period i located  dragons
plus this game simply isnt as fun as its sequels riptos revenge or year of the dragon
but this game is too much fun to really complain about and i can guarantee no matter what demographic of gaming you fall in you will have a lot of fun on spyros psone adventuresspyro the dragon the game that should have been sonys mascot instead of crash bandicootthe original spyro the dragon is probably the best platformadventure game you can find for the playstation
i cant give spyros first adventure a star rating though
lets get the problems out of the way before moving on to the positive things about spyro and believe me theres a lot of good things about this gamepeople have compared spyro the dragon to everything from crash bandicoot to banjokazooie to nights and who knows what else
well i think the first spyro game is just as good as all those games
in fact spyro the dragon is better than the first crash bandicoot game
now theres a game that disappointed me
spyro came out of nowhere and ruled right from the beginning
i never would have guessed back in  that spyro would have went on to become a classicspyros debut does have a few problems though
seeing as how this is spyros very first adventure i wont be too harsh
am i the only one who thinks the play control could have been better
its not that i have a tough time controlling spyro
well to be honest i did have trouble controlling him at first
spyro doesnt quite take off when you hit up down left or right on the directional pad
theres a split second delay before moving forward
maybe the creators of the game thought this was part of the realism since after all youre moving a dragon
a big creature like a dragon wont move forward right away
then again spyro is small compared to the dragons you have to rescuecontrolling spyro was definitely a problem for me at first
for example attempting to properly jump on top of the three round platforms you encounter at the very beginning of the first world was not an easy task
i kept sliding off
by the way i recommend you take advantage of these round platforms to get to know the controller
master the controller before exploring the world
this will cut down on any possible frustration you may encounter in the futurei have to consider that my inability to control spyro may have been due to the camera angles
even though the camera in this game is drastically better than many other games you have to admit it isnt flawless either
if you hit pause and go to the options you will see an option for a second camera view called active
this view is better because the camera immediately follows behind spyro at all times
the other default camera view is more of a hassle trying to figure out where youre moving and you cant get a good view of what lies ahead
you may want to change it to active if the other camera view is difficult for you
thank goodness for this optionsome people have a problem with the lack of challenge
while its completely true you wont have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game prepare to die  or  times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do and where you have to jump
i think the most challenging thing about spyro the dragon are the times you have to jump onto a faraway platform and many times you just barely make it
many times you will fall to your death
be patient though
the game never messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps
sometimes its about finding just the right spot to jump and glide and if youre off just a little bit you wont make it
the creators of spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating seeing as how its supposed to be a game for the entire family
good workthe biggest challenge comes at the very end of the game when you face the main boss
hes really easy to beat however getting to him is a whole other story
you see right at the very end before you face him you have to jump over a series of disappearing platforms and if you fall and you will fall the first few times because its hard you will land in burning lava and have to do the whole stage over again
not that the stage is really that long anyway but this is by far the hardest part of the game
the other  of the game only offers a slight challenge here and therewith that said dont be fooled into thinking the game will be a cakewalk because of all the easy obstacles found throughout world one
it does get harder
you see many of the enemies you face in the later levels can only be defeated by either smacking them with your head or shooting fire at them
you wont know which of these tricks will be most effective on them until you face the enemy and experiment
you also have to dodge fireballs swordswipes dogs jumping at you and tons of other enemy attacks while you try to find the best way to defeat them
so its not pathetically easy after alla minor complaint is that sometimes while youre walking or running the path will suddenly end and youll fall to your death
doesnt happen often but i thought it would be worth mentioningi hate the way spyro talks
he sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice
not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like
also when you rescue the dragons sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to
the problem here is that many times the important tips they say arent really helpful because they say them right after youve already had to do them
for instance in one case after you glide to a faraway platform and rescue a dragon the dragon will tell you how to glide
obviously since i needed to glide in order to rescue him i already know how to glide
so i didnt need his help
this happens a few times during the game
you just want to scream thanks for nothing bonehead
the music was done by a member of the rock band the police stewart copeland
people may not realize it but certain themes in spyro the dragon are very close to some of the songs that made the police such a legendary rock band
stewart copeland may have intentionally created the music in this game to match that of the police specifically the songs walking on the moon and message in a bottle
youll soon realize that the same guy who created the music in this game also played a big part in creating those police songs
the music in spyro the dragon is also very catchy and appropriate for the level youre in
no complaints
the music is fantastici think the creators made a mistake
when you hit l the camera rotates clockwise and r makes the camera rotate counterclockwise
it should be the other way around
another thing that needs reversed the way spyro flies in the bonus stages
when you press up you fly down
when you press down you fly up
strange mistake
this makes it harder to complete the flying stages however you dont have to finish themin fact despite what people may tell you you do not have to collect all the gems and all the dragons
finding and collecting all the gems and dragons will only give you a better percentage and open up a bonus stage at the end of the game
the gameplay in spyro the dragon can actually be compared to yoshis island you dont have to find everything but doing so will open up rewards and give you an overall better score
the creators did a fantastic job hiding gems and dragons increasing the challenge
more often than not you will see a treasure chest or a dragon statue up high on a platform and not have a single clue how to reach it
its fun to run around and think about how to reach it
some of them are cleverly located
one word to describe it awesomeanyway spyro the dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a d donkey kong country what with tnt barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on
spyro is much better than that overrated crash bandicoot game and you should pick up spyro the dragon todaythe is the first spyro game and it paved the road for all the other spyro games
the story when the evil nasty norc turns all of the dragons into statues its up to spyro a small purple dragon to set them free and defeat nasty norc
you travel with sparx your dragonfly companion and also your health gage as you collect gems and go through six gigantic worlds with over  levels in all
this game is great although its not very challenging it offers hour of entertainment
my favorite world is the beast makers world
its a creepy place and almost all the levels in it take place at nighttime which to me is the best type of level in spyro
my favorite is tree tops because it is a gigantic level that gives you that creepy feeling even the music is creepy in its own way
another minor flaw in this game is that it has no minigames in it
those always provide extracurricular fun but im happy to say that they are introduced in a later spyro release
id recommend this game today if you dont already have it
if you not into spyro this is the place to start atill recommend spyro to anyone fun enemies and worlds and awesome concepts
graphics arent the best of course but the gameplay is so addicting collecting gems and freeing your fellow dragons
musthave for a playstation  collectioni love this game
the characters are cute they make great noises and there are lots of worlds to explore
its really hard to die too so you could concievably play without a memory card
what i dont like about it is that spyro is a little hard to control compared to todays games and a lot of parts are highly frustrating
thieves have stolen a bunch of dragon eggs and you have to chase them down and get the eggs back but this is much easier said than done
i have spent hours chasing these guys on some levels
i mean i wouldnt want the game to be too easy but this is borderline ridiculous
but its still a really great game and i absolutely fell in love with it
id recomend it to people who love cute things and have infinite patiencethis game is a really good game
there is a good storyline to it and challenging
but isnt spyros best
its a good game in the endi got a great deal on this used ps game
my girlfriend plays this classic game and enjoys it a lot
shes not much of a gamer
the disc seems to be in great condition with no scratches and plays perfectly
theres a few tiny cracks within the inner ring of the disc but this is common and does not affect the actual disc itself
it seems like an alright game to me just not my style which is why i gave it a 
but a lot of people seem to like this game
its a great kids game as wellnot boring not geat either
i like how they have designed it and how good the graphics are but this isnt the best out of the three
i prefered the  nd most but really enjoyed the  rd too
if you are looking for a lot of adventure try out this
brillthat said the game is really fun
not too hard that you rent it and after a while throw the controller down in frusterationnot too easy that you breeze through it
no there are gems to collect and characters to meet
this was the beginning of spyro
he only got better and better in future games
check this one out first though or itll drive you crazyeverything improves so much in the next gamedid i mention how cute spyro iswhatever happened to the days when games were made to be fun
whatever happened to the days where replay value was through the roof and graphics were not as heavily emphasized
this game is well over  years old now and it is still fun to play
even in this day and age i see kids enjoying it
this should be one of those games that developers look back upon and say what made that game so much fun
what can we learn from this aside from improving upon the old school d graphics
spyro may not be the best game of all time but it certainly is a fun one for me that i have had a lot of fond memories playingi own all the spyro games that play station has ever made
i would have to say that this game has advanges and disadvanges
some good things about it is that this is the only spyro game where you free the dragons
in the rest of the games you help other people it is funny and very interesting
 sorry but i wont give the funny parts away
the disadvanges is that you cant swim
in the other to games you can but in this game if you touch the water you will die
another bad thing is that they dont have the cute characters like the other two games
i would buy spyro  first and then buy spyro  i think spyro  has more stuff to do and has a better story line
i even think spyro has a better voice
if you like all three spyros try buying the spyro pack
it is much cheaper than buying all of the games seperatly
then you can decide which one is betterspyro the dragon was the game i got right after its sequel spyro  riptos rage
i know its a bit too late but i just think that the spyro series are too fun
spyro  is better than the first but this game is still great
the graphics and sound is nice the gameplay will leave you hours into this game and the story is original
spyro is one of my favorite series and this game is great and fun for everyonethis games is one of those few titles where stealth killing is actualy fun
tenchu had competant graphics for the time though ugly by  standards
the controls definately had issues but lets face it this is the best tenchu game to date
tenchu has not alway done well as a franchise but this has its charming moments
years later the thing that sticks out most to me is the soundtrack
there are certain games you hang onto for the bgms
this is one of those games
the over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back
this games wonky graphics and play controls were never anything to write home about and only got worse with each consequential sequal and retread
the first one is the best in the series in my opinion
priority was never graphics or packaging
it was all about the fun and lovely soundtracki found another ninja game called tenchu stealth assassin
i read the back of it and it looked pretty good
when i tried it back at home i was blown away
this game was really sweet
and after i tried the demo of ninja shadow of darkness that was in my game fighting force i realized i was lucky that i didnt waste my money on iti would never trade this game in for that other stupid one
this game is incredible
going up to guys from behind and killing them with classic stealth kills like the throat slit and the stab from up front
not only that but the enemies that you fight in the game are awesome samurai ninjas bears wolves dogs and all kinds of demons
this game is totally awesome if a bit slow though
it the jumping and fighting action were more like it was in devil may cry it would have been just like playing in a japanese anime
oh well it was still a good game
if youre a true ninja fan you must have this game you wont regret itunlike the corny ninja titles of years past like quotninja gaidenquot quotninjaquot and others of that manner
tenchu finally takes the  ninja game to the next level
not just a run around and throw stars at  senseless weak enemies this game forces you to learn and master stealth  and the art of sneak attack
the different weapons available keep the  onslaught more versatile and the different sword attacks seem to stun the  viewer with there harsh and brutal images
a great game  a great story  line but still a few small problems
even though you have a large variety  of weapons they are very limited
some of the game may be confusing and  not very straight forward as to what you are supposed to do and you tend  to run into some very annoying camera views that seem to definately take  away from the game play
but overall its a very entertaining game which  i recommend to any action fanthis is a great stealth game and one of the first i ever played besides metal gear solid
i spent many hours on this just being sneaky
the main thing i liked about this is that its not your typical run around hack and slash game
you actually had to think about what youre doing and what the outcome would be
the voice acting wasnt that great but it was at the time when this came out
i think most peoples problem with this game myself included was the annoying camera angle at time but once you got used to it it wasnt that bad
definately a classic game in my bookmy first experience with the resident evil series was with code veronica x  i was severely disappointed overall with it and from what ive read the whole series is the same so i had little to no faith in it
i didnt feel the need whatsoever to play the other games and openly spoke out against the series even though i only played one game
but after playing resident evil  i got intrigued by the story so i decided to try out resident evil   i thought theres no way they can be worse than code veronica so why not
and good god was i rightalthough the first re was little more than a big laughable joke thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that makes what you find in code veronica x look like an oscarwinning performance that wasnt really scary at all until the hunters came into the picture the second iteration really blew me away
anybody who has known me for more than two seconds knows i dont care at all about graphics in a videogame so im not going to say anything about them because it is irrelevant which is why im not a gamecube or xbox fan
the gameplay is very good for a survival horror  there is plenty of puzzle solving adventure exploration and combat to keep the interest level up
thats what i like about survival horror its not just about fighting to stay alive but it is also about exploring and solving puzzles to unravel the plot and make sense out of mysterious circumstances
and while resident evil  isnt anywhere near as scary or intricate in story as the silent hill series it is still a topnotch game to play for any fan of the genre and i highly recommend it
the first one you can play on your own i just played it because i wanted to know what wesker did to get chris so ticked off with him and vice versa
the reason the title of my review is i was wrong is because i really was wrong in assuming that the resident evil series was a bunch of bunk and no worth anyones time
so i apologize for being a presumptuous jerkbut there is one issue i just cant stop from addressing the controversy over the control scheme
now i wont go into one of my trademark rants insulting everybody but i will state my thoughts from an objective point of view
the reason survival horror games have such awkward controls is because the game developers wanted it that way
this is a genre for puzzle solving plotlines exploration and thought not just about shooting things
they made the controls this way to render it in a way a sort of antiaction type of game genre
still though once you get used to the controls like me you will have no trouble blasting zombies torsos in two soon enoughanother thing that is cool about this game is the zombies and their creative death sequences okay so maybe they die a second time but this time for good
naturally you can blow their heads off but even more possibilities await your execution
sometimes you can fire at them and their arm will be severed by your bullets or with a shotgun you can shoot them at the base of their spine and they will be blasted in half the upper section of their body crawling on the ground with its arms alone to try and bite you
when you upgrade your shotgun later on you can actually blow their chest in half
and with a rocket launcher if you fire at them square in their torso their arms head and a good portion of their upper body will be gone
if you hit them to the right side most of said side will be gone as will their head and respective arm yet their left arm will still be attached
pretty cool huh
code veronica x didnt have anything like that which is rather too badthe only problem i had with this game and it really isnt a problem with the game itself is that it really made me shake my head at code veronica x  it almost seems as if capcom had taken a huge step backward in their videogamemaking abilities
heck even the first resident evil is better than recvx
for example in the first one the hunters had narrow sharp reptilian eyes rows of razorsharp teeth that protruded from their mouths and they looked pretty scary but in code veronica they didnt have such teeth it almost looked like they didnt have any at all and they also had small beady eyes making them more of a joke than an intimidating enemyyet another good part about this game is the titan
i must say he is really one heck of a bad guy
but of course hes nowhere near as badss as the nemesis or as terrifying as pyramid head
but hes cool nonethelessso in conclusion if you like survival horror games then i suggest you try this one out
but dont expect it to be better than silent hill if youre a fan of that series just as a side notethe game is now available for download via psn for only i spent  hours playing the game meaning i got my monies worthi played this before i played the original resident evil
i had just barely gotten the playstation and was renting a bunch of stuff
originally i hated this game because i couldnt figure out how to play it
i had been a nintendan with occasional defects to sega i own a genisis so i was unfamiliar with what has become a nearly standard control style for playstation games
i didnt understand the pivoting nor did i grasp the concept of holding r to aim and x to shoot
i got frusterated and set it aside
however my brother picked it up immediately after and managed to get me past the first screen
yes i got killed right away
i watched my brother navigate his way through the game until he finally got killed by the first licker
he begged me to buy it
so i did
after a while i decided to give it another try and once i got used to the control style i beat it
i have played this this resident evil and it many different incarnations across differnt platforms more than any other version
i have also bought this one the most times trying to get the ultimate edition and eventually got tired of it and bought the dual shock greatest hits version after the n versions fmv sequences were so terrible
although i will not buy the forthcomming gamecube port unless they imporove it as drastically as they did the original i still recomend re  as the most fun of the series
if for some reason there is someone out there who does not already have some version of this game do yourself a favor and pick one up
gamecube owners i recomend waiting for the gcn version as it is supposed to have all of the various enhancements that all of the various versions of this game had including the much desired analog control the n version featuredbeat the first yet
if you have then jump right ahead to the second masterpiece in the seriesits fun its scary and it is one hell of a ride
ultimatley resident evil  will give some nightmares
if the first one scared you get ready to be terrified againi see myself as a guru of survival horror games i likeem and i like what they make me feel
now lets get on with my review for resident evil i have to first mention that i did not and will not buy resident evil  or resident evil  for gamecube unlike resident evil remake they have nothing new to offer me or you which is sad after seeing what they did and what improvement remake was to the original resident evil
so lets just keep this review centered around the original resident evil  game for psx comparing re  to re or re directors cut is like comparing raw horsemeat to a young stallion
resident evil  had better graphics and sound by far not to mention the fact that it was on a bigger bolder scale than resident evil
simple bottom line folks is that if your looking for a good survival horror game pick this one upi had no real gripes towards the game and i felt that the devs of the game did everything in the better interest for the resident evil genre
as you can see by the score that i gave this game i liked it and i truly think youd like it aswelli rented this game when it first game out i was scared out of my mind
everything made me jump now i have sort of gotten over that i am  and although the music and soundzombie moaning and feet stepping creates this scary atmosphere it is not that scary
most of you can handle itanyways i needed a strategy guide for some of it
it just it just is unrealistic
yea to put out a fire you need a crank in a cabin
why was the crank removed in the first place
we need to make it so if there is a fire of some sort this hose we have hooked up will release some water
yea they happened to put a handy dandy hose thingy in the ceiling so just incase a helicopter crashed under it or there was a mass fire under it the hose would put it out
yea right
ok you need a cord just to close some shutters so zombies wont attack you
if the police were fighting they should of closed these shutters beforehand so less zombies came in
instead they decided to put the cord in an office about a mile away
wanna get into that room
you need the crest and key and plugs buddy
how did the police actually get around this police stationmoving off of that the game is alright
you have alot of ammo on easy although i fear i will run out alot of the time i usually find a pack or  to keep me going
the zombies themselves can take quite alot like  hits to kill them
however once you get the pistol modification for leon they become a whole lot easier
the story is nice
 people trying to escape a city full of undead living thingy creatures and such
theres alot of other characters though you arent the last  humans alive in the city
the game even though was known to have a sequel considering tremendous profits finishes great
it starts randomly but then ends where it should
it succeeds in making a good game
good story some action you get to kill some of those evil zombies and good packageresident evil   circa good an upgrade over the original which was considered a great game considered classic to many gamers good story with twists and turnsbad graphics look very dated voice acting is not that great controls feel datedwill it fit your taste slow moving survival horror game which is more about moving boxes managing items and unlocking doors then actually fighting for your life a scfi horror game set in a city over run with zombies huge snakes and all types of creaturesgame its most assocated too dino crisis silent hill alone in the darkadditional notes there is a remake of this game for the nintendo  and nintendo game cube both of which dont really upgrade anything the male playable character leon is also the star of resident evil  beating the game in a certain way can unlock two new characters hunk and tofu there was a rumor that you could unlock akuma from street fighter alpha as a playable character but that is not true in japan resident evil  is called biohazard resident evil  was one of the best psx games back in the mid s as it had exclusive rights to sony
the game was the sequal to one of the best survival horror game ever
does this do better then its prediseccoryes
oh hell yes
the game is a solid good game
the story line is really entertaining but it was more of a sci fi then a horror story
i wont spoil the story for you but the game is  discs and you control  charactersserpartly in the game
one is a cop named leon kennedy and the other is female after her missing brother chriswho was in reand the two end up meeting eachother and the rest you can figure outi really enjoyed this game it was fantastic
i loved the graphics for this game it was just wow
the game is pretty short if you play only one half of the character you play as
they both have  partskina
once you complete that characters game it opens up the second of half of the other character
the game is fairly lenghy if you play the whole game
the game has some great twists thatll keep you up all night
lemmi make it easier for youresident evil  was one of the coolest playstation games ever
it had an awesome story line sweet graphics and decent dialoug
it is also spooky in the scare factor especially when you see something crawl around a window in the beggining of the game
in other words the game is awesome and scarythe graphics for that time were just great and comparable to metal gear solid
the character model for leon and clair was amazing and the zombies looked even more creepy then before not to mention the bloody gore in this gamejeez
capcom did a great job making the graphics
kudosethe gameplay is what really made me love this game
gun n down zombies and solving puzzlemy type of game baby
the puzzle are not that hard but they are pretty cool
the gameplay never gets boring and the boss fights are really cool
the gameplay may turn some off in the beggining
mainly cause its just runing away from zombies but later on that will changetrust methe sound is incredible
the zombies sound so realistic and the music for the boss fights are magnifecentmy spelling sucks i know
the sound it self deserves a one starwhat turned me off was the kina cheezy sci fi story
it didnt have the same spooky feeling resident evil  had in storywhich causes me to take off one starwell yeah it was a stupid move just for that but hey thats my opinionthe games has amazing graphics great sound lots of awesome gameplay and is one of my favorite video game series
not only that it may possibly be the best in the series if not then its this game deserves a out resident evil series is a superb series and anyone who loves survival horror will love it
i personaly think its one of the best gaming series out but i dont have all the resident evil games the only ones i have are the one that go with the story like the ones i have areand for any newbie out there who is trying to get into the series if you have a gamecube and get the remake of the original and start with thatthen   then resident evil zero which is a really enjoyable resident evil gamewelllatesthis game kept me dreaming as a child back in the late s
i used to crave resident evil  and its so realistic graphics hey back then ps  was awesome graphics
its scary its frightening and its impossible to beat with just a knife
give it a shot only downside is poor voice acting like their captain obvious or something
but if you played re  this will seem like a downer game
re directors cut is where its atthis game is pretty good for its own sake
its basically about a dead warrior in a land of ghouls  zombies who attack him at every turn  it is up to you to find the chaos rune among other hidden treasures arrayed throughout this underworld of bizarre incarnationsthe animations are up to d par although i will remark on the variety of different angles
the graphics are japanamistic but nonetheless amusingthis game is interesting
my sister made me pick it up and it is fun to mess around with
if you are looking for a cute little adventure platformer then this is it
the graphics are good and the control isnt too tricky
it does get difficult in parts but not overly
i am not a huge fan of platform games but this one got me with its unique humorous tones
give it a shot on your ps if you havent
its a bargaincrash bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system the playstation
still i have never grown tired of playing levels which used to be challenges that now i pass with a breeze
the levels are awe inspiring
water is flowing without a crack the jungle is incredibly lush and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers
story is interesting tooyou have to save crashs girlfriend tawna from dr neo cortex
the only disadvantage is the limited controlsjump and spin
this game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games
no wonderthis is a classic game that i come back to every now and again
the graphics are great and the content is really satisfying
but i do have a complaint of the actual difficulty of the gamest island  the easiest to beat if you have all of the different coloured gems
the hardest level here is native fortressnd island  slightly harder but still fun
the hardest level here is sunset vistard island  the most frustrating
i spent half an hour to beat generator room with perfect and another half an hour with toxic waste
the hardest level here is slippery climbi dont get why a kids game can get difficult to beat
i mean i own mature games like jak  and oblivion and they are a whole lot easier by comparison
if you are looking for a challenging game this is your cup of tea
but if you want a kids game that you can just glide through i recommend spyrocrash bandicoots my favorite video game character and all his work is genius
im looking forward to his latest video game installment crash tag team racing
the games graphics are good the gameplay itself sounds amuzing and the trailer on gamespot prove how visually stunning its going to be too
but crashs humble beginning is not the same as mario and sonics were
it was much better more creative and biggermarios was just an arcade game
it was hard but it didnt take to long to master it and i dont even know if there was a boss
sonics debut was better then marios
a game you could play without spending money good levels challenging better bosses and a special ending you could view if you collected all the items necessary
but these debuts lacked what crashs had
most challenging best bosses better secret ending and most of all a d world to play incrashs world is not fully d in this game in fact up till crash twinsanity none of them have been but it is very good as far as it goes
the virtual world looks like the real world
thats one of the games strongest points
the controls are very solid and crash responds amazingly well to your commands
this spoiled me
id play a crash game and then go play something else with looser controls and be upset by the lack of response
i became versatile after a while though
crash lacks moves in this game but he has more then sonic andor mario had in their debut games
crash has  mario and soinc only had   crashs moves are running jumping and spinning
the spinnig move is an extremely creative thing
to make up for sonics spin naughty dog brought out the bigger and better guns
crashs spin is much easier to control and is much more effective
it also doesnt threaten you in a strange almost indescribable way
sonics spin reqired that you dash in the direction that you were facing before you started spinning
sega called this the spin dash
this could throw you to your death
not crashs
crash could move or stay still when spinning
note soinc didnt have the spin dash in his debut game
mario and sonics jumping ill admit was better
they were tighter then crash
their direction could be changed much much easier then crash when jumping
crash jumps higher though
crash runs kind of slow especially when you need to get something done
but hes slower in crash twinsanity
crashs camera control is hardly ever a problem
every once in a while youll have to strain your eye a little but its still a better camera then soincs
marios is best out of all though cause you could see the entire level all at onceas for the other features of the game theyre pretty outstanding
the levels are big and challenging
theres also secret levels in crash
ive never seen anything like that in sonic  or donkey kong have you
no i didnt think so
crashs biggest flaw is the saving system
in the game you must collect  tokens of crashs girfriends head hidden in the level to get to a bonus area
you must get to the end of the tawna crashs girlfriends name is tawna bonus round touch tawna whos just standing there and then exit the tawna bonus round via a warp pad in order to save
if you dont do exactly what i said had to be done in order to save you dont get to save
not fair at all
but its still better then sonic  or donkey kong cause you cant save at all in those games
there are also two other kinds of bonus rounds in the game the cortex main bad guy of the game bonus rounds and the brio cortexs righthand man bonus rounds
you cant save in these bonus rounds even if you get to the end of them without falling off the platforms
oh and get this there arent tawna bonus rounds in all the levels so you dont have a chance to save if your parents tell you to get off and youre in a level like hog wild where theres no bonus rounds
big flaw
the nd biggest flaw is the way you have to collect gems
in the game you must collect  i think dont quote me on that number because im not sure gems in order to see the secret ending
however its a little too hard to collect them all
i understand most people think the games not hard enough but i think its a little too hard
to collect a gem you must destroy every single crate in a level and get to the end without losing a life
im all for destroying every crate but i think you should be able to lose a life and still get the gem
it should only matter if you destroy all the boxesso if youre wanting to compare mario and sonic to crash id say crash all the way
and as you can see if youre reading this crashs st game was much better then mario and sonics
i say crash is best no matter what anyone else tells megraphics   these are often stunning but at times a bit murky
mostly they are really fabulous to look at though in every scene the makers of crash have put in a lot of effortsound   the animals couldve made some more sounds but the creatures that talk do it clearly and well
mostly the score is playing in the background so there isnt much sound to be heardvalue   value for money indeed
once youve finished youll want to start all over againoverall   great game with an excellent reputation
crash  and  surpass it slightly but this is still an easyonthebrain fun and original idealets go back in time to one of my favorite playstation icons crash bandicoot
for those who dont know crash bandicoot is a fictional eastern barred bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the evil doctor neo cortex who then escaped and set out to stop the evil scientist and his plans
crash would appear in many games but the ones i hold dear are the original three on the first playstation crash bandicoot crash bandicoot  cortex strikes back and crash bandicoot  warped
with that said lets take a look at the first one in the seriesthe first crash bandicoot game was released way back in  with naughty dog developing the game sony computer entertainment publishing it and universal interactive studios being the distributors
it was a playstation exclusive but would eventually get rereleased as a ps one classic on the playstation store to be played on the playstation  the game is definitely kid friendly and appropriate for all ages crash bandicoot is basically a mario ripoff but a very good one none the less who came up with several original ideas
the story goes that crash bandicoot was created by doctor neo cortex and his henchmen doctor nitrus brio
crash escapes the experiments but leaves his girlfriend tawna in the process and crash is swept up to an island and sets out to go rescue her and stop the villains
whats weird is that this is the only crash bandicoot game on the playstation in which tawna appears in i dont know why though its definitely unusual
but nonetheless lets continue with the gamethe first thing that stands out are the graphics the graphics for  looked fantastic they were even better than super mario  on nintendo  which was released a month later
it definitely gets an a for presentation
the game was a huge hit and was the first nonjapanese game to achieve commercial success in the country
now lets discuss the actual gameplaythe game is nonetheless a platformer in which you control crash bandicoot across three islands to defeat doctor cortex and rescue your girlfriend
the game is split into levels with one basic goal get to the end without dying
you start out with four lives and its one hit deaths from being touched by enemies or falling into water or a pit
yeah its weird how water kills crash even though he fell in the water at the introduction and was floating away to one of the islands and survived
why is it that these characters who are very athletic cant figure out how to swim
i hate games that do this because when you see water youre never sure if the game will allow you to swim
its stupid and whats weird is that in the third game crash does swim underwater with scuba gear
so really the game is a huge contradiction of itselfyou can get more one ups by finding them across levels or collecting  apples which are basically the coins of super mario bros but the apples are everywhere in this game so its really easy to get a one up you could literally get at least three lives per level
attack moves include jumping in the air and landing on an enemy or using a spin move in a tornado fashion to knock enemies offscreen i like that even if its a ripoff of super mario world
you also find this mask that helps you on your journey if you find it it gives you an extra hit point but you dont actually wear the mask it just follows you
if you get three masks without losing one you turn invincible for a brief time much like the starmans in super mario brosthe boxes are also a ripoff of super mario bros in which they have question marks on them and you have to destroy the boxes to gain prizes
but not all boxes are the same there are boxes without question marks arrow boxes that propel you in the air boxes with exclamation marks which makes boxes appear out of nowhere checkpoint boxes that act as a save spot for the level and tnt boxes which explode after three seconds when you jump on them whatever you do dont spin attack them because they will immediately explodea strange feature in these boxes is that you can get tawna tokens that act as a bonus level so you can get some extra fruit and one ups
whats weird is that tawna is in this level but she doesnt let you rescue her for some odd reason but whats even stranger is that completing the bonus level is the only way to save the game or get a password
i dont understand why early playstation games didnt allow you to save anytime you want
every video game that can support a memory card should do that i hate writing down passwords so i can continue
but the password is only eight digits and the main buttons on the playstation controller act as the characters so its at least not a long and annoying passwordif you complete an entire level without losing a life and manage to destroy all the boxes youll get rewarded with a gem this was a flaw with the game because it makes the game way too damn hard and every future crash bandicoot game let you get the gem even if you die as long as you break all the crates
some gems can act as platforms to help you get across areas that are impossible to reach much like the vine in super mario brosnow while this game has some flaws its still a good game overall its not as good as the second and third game but its definitely fun and enjoyable
the creativity is good has a good challenge and the graphics are fantastic
if you have a playstation network account give this game a chance its only  on the playstation store so its not expensive or anything
its definitely a classicfinal rating   out of i tried the crash  playstation game about  and it was delightful
it was in fact so delightful that i looked around for the first part to start from the proper pointwhen i started playing the first part i was disappointed by the difference of the story but still it was a nice gamethe graphics are excellent
the story is original
it speaks about a genetically engineered dog named crash that resembles human beings
this genetic procedure was done by dr cortex or more precisely by his degraded assistant
then dr cortex goes on the produce a new female version of this crash
of course crash falls in love with her
dr cortex being a wicked soul parts between the two and then crash needs to go through so many obstacles to reach his loverso many levels are divided into islands and each set of levels is followed by a bad boss
some are hard and some are easy
it depends in your skill in such games
the story is concluded by a battle between this crash and dr cortex
if you win then you got itand to complicate life even more the designers introduced the concept of gaining gems
if you get all the gems you can continue the game in a new fashion
i aint saying it cause i dont want to spoil things for you
to attain these gems is a difficult task
as for me i got them but after being kicked in the teeth for it
you should not even dream of getting the gems in order of levels
no mon ami some times you have to go to a certain advanced level to get a green gem for instance to get the gem in the say fourth level
you would have to check the net for the tricks dirty if i may and the hidden places
good luck in thatthere is akuaku which is a mask that is considered as an extra life if you get touched by any of the enemies
take  akuakus and you become invincible for some seconds and you kill any of the enemies by a mere touchof course there are saving stations
you do not get to save after every level
this is a drawback
saving stations are also level you have to jump crush step on dynamite and so on
if you fall down you cannot save you have to go to the next saving station
it is hare i am telling youthe game is great and if you win with a  percent then you are the mancrash   starsthe best game everthis game has everything the first part lacked
it has even better graphics
this was the first one of the crash series i tried and it was fun
before that i was hooked on fighting games like street fighters and tekken but they are not that fun after playing it a  times or so
in this game you can spend as much time without losing interestit is more or less like the first part
there is akuaku boxes to crash gems more difficult new bosses after each floor
and by the by this game is divided into  floors each floor with  doors each door with a different adventure
you can finish the game like i did the first time without collecting gems but it is not that fun
hint if you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem
there are hidden levels for some gems you would have to consult the internet for it
good luck in thatin this part you can save after each level it is easier in that respect
i find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game
the designs of the adventure is by far better than the firsthe story line is change a little bit
instead of the pamela anderson of a lover crash had he gets a more geeky meg ryan of a sister
dr cortex is still missing things up
the assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate crash to warn him from cortex
you want to know more
get the gems firstthere is also a sixth hidden floor
you would have to reach it by a trick and again check the net for thatthe game was the best i have ever tried
it makes my life harder since i cannot find better games to play anymore
it will make you look for other adventures of crashi remember when i first got this game with a playstation console in early  it was a great phenomenon then because the crash bandicoot series was able to bring some new life to the platforming genre of gaming with its d and d interchangeable levelscrash must go through  levels and  bosses in this game but unlike the later games in the series crash must tackle the levels chronologically by progressively going through  islandswhile the gameplay is fun and interesting the game has its flaws as well
first off you can only save when you either complete a bonus round which can only be access one time in each level or when you collect a gem for destroying every crate in the level
this gets frustrating because in order to get each gem you must complete the level and break the boxes without losing a life plus the fact that colored gems are required to complete certain levels
if i were you i wouldnt worry about the box gems just yet and just try to find the bonus in the newer level you are at if you want to call it a day
you may have to do the newer level again which tends to be a flawdespite this i highly recommend this for fans of previous platforming games like donkey kong country and sonic the hedgehog
while the series would improve this is not a bad startwhen i got this for my early birthdayi didnt expect that the character would be so cutecrash is adorablewhich will get you hooked on for about an hourthe fun for anotherand the hard for minus a secondeven though it is difficultyoull enjoy looking in those eyesand playingthis is definitely one of the best games you can find
crash a bandicoot as his name applies is out to rescue his girlfriend tawna from his arch nemesis the evil dr cortex
there are about  levels in the whole game to go through in which range from extremely easy to almost impossible
the game is probably the hardest of all the crash games so anybody who wants a challenge is in for a treat
the graphics range
in some the graphics will have you staring and in some you just plain will not be impressed but im not saying anything about that
this game has a high amount of replay value as well and for some levels you will need strategy
the only reason i gave this  stars is because of the horrible save system
you can only save if you get to tawna bonus rounds common and complete them not too difficult or collect a gem medium difficulty to almost impossible
if you can overlook the save system then youve got yourself a great gamealright so i just used naughty for the play on the company name but it got your attention aparently sothis is the oldest naughty dog title ive played as far as i know however it has a lot of the issues which ive noticed from their games in the past
nasty difficulty spikes the eight or so level should be closer to the end and the one path to the end of a platformer standard which super mario world truely broke when it came out take the one star out of this otherwise superb gamewhile the graphics are fantastic for ps and moderate at worst for ps sometimes i find it hard to tell where exactly crash is going to land
also this very much d platformer has side scrolling sections where i become convinced that pressing down will make crash duck not fall into a bottomless pit water or whatever else is in the foreground
saving can sometimes prove difficult although if you look in the right places you can find a way to save after every significant area
also often after completing certain difficult areas youll be able to do them again at any point you desire good for getting the games bonusesi havent finished the game yet im only half way through so anything in this review could change although its unlikely
most naughty dog games are consistantly good or bad in every wayanyway the bonuses are usually earned by getting through a level opening every box in the level without losing a single life
others are given through bonus levels etca very great game for a great pricecrash bandicoot  cortex strikes back was a large step up from the first part
this games graphics music gameplay and even story were much better than in the first
but its kind of weird how crash bandicoot doesnt end up staying with tawna bandicoot and instead ends up living with his little sister coco bandicoot
well at least coco has the ability to speak unlike her big brotherthe voice acting changed dramatically as well and for the betterdr neo cortexs new voice was much cooler and evilsounding
if you liked the first crash game get this one
although its more difficultespecially in gathering crystals and gems its really funcrashs st game as i reviewed is my favortie debut game but his sequel blows me away
theres one reviewer who says this is an improvement on the original with some sassy style
theyre  correct
the games best improvements and worst flaws are all i will list because you already know where i stand if youve read my review on the st game and go check it out if you haventbest improvement saving system
this allows you to save at anytime so youre not going to have to get off becuase your parents said so of course without saving all your hard and handy work and having to have to do it all over againnd best improvement you have  levels to choose from at anytime
you dont have to go in orderrd best improvement more moves
crash is looking good with all his new stuntsth best improvement vehicles
crash gets to drive some neato vehicles including my favorite the jet packth best improvement greater and better bosses including n ginth best improvement bigger better and more secret levelsth best new characters
im lovin the new addition of characters including coco bandicoot crashs sister whom i think shouldve been in the st gameth best improvement its easier to collect gems and theres a new addition crystalsworst flaw well it would be nice if tawna hadnt suddenly disappeared
i think she shouldve been crucial to the entrtie series not just the st gamend worst flaw you cant revisit bosses without a secret code
you should be able to revisit bosses without having to have to look for secret codes to do soso those are all the improvements and flaws
as you can see better the the st game by farwhen it comes to crash bandicoot ill be the first to admit playing the three main games on the ps in reverse order was probably a bad idea
the thing is warped was the only one i had on hand when the urge to play these titles struck and well it completely spoiled me
im sure people are probably sick of me gushing over it but warped was an excellent product and it was refined to the point of near perfection that i honestly wouldnt hesitate to give it a ten out of ten in conversation or reviewthe problem with cortex strikes back is it isnt as polished as youd expect
i dont mean this in a superficial way like graphic fidelity which is superb for when it was released but a streamline all the cheapshots out of the experience way
the level of cheapness ingrained in crash s gameplay is simply astounding and it comes from a variety of places
things like the hit detection on the belly flop are in dire need of work and the bonus areas are usually the furthest thing from fun when thats the exact opposite of what they should be
worse yet are the games hidden paths which are essentially sorry excuses to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the player
the kicker to is just when you think youre done and your guard is down  thats when they throw the kitchen sink at youthe above situation is a real shame because when you get right down to it cortex strikes back is a beautiful game
the level design and music are excellent as are the graphics which i feel even give nintendo  games a run for their money
but every time the game turns a corner and those memories of the games stubbornness start to fade something again there is always something shows up and makes it take center stage once again
compounding the situation is the fact there really isnt enough variety in the levels
seriously if i see another level with the words crash or bear in it i am going to scream and the same goes for the jet pack levelsannoyances aside if your a fan of the playstation having the three main naughty dogdeveloped crash titles in your library is a nobrainer
if you havent played them and want to do yourself a huge favor and play them in order so youll be able to appreciate the improvements each sequel brings with it
unlike some franchises the first three crash games get better and bolder with each step
as for the game being discussed here crash  leaves a lot to be desired to in my book but then i cant really say i dislike it either
i do wish it was a little better polished than where it stands now but then that probably a part of why warped is so good
so while i would definitely warn others of games cheaper side id still recommend it to anyone with an interest in platformersafter falling from ballon cortex will crash into a dark cave which cantains power now crash is heading into five warp rooms and new bosses like tinykomodo bros and ngin
now crash can even fly in the jet packthis game is great
it has so many improvements as opposed to the first game
in this game you can high jump crawl slide ride on a jetboat and fly with a jetpack
its a huge adventure starring the bandicoot
the main challenge of the game is to get  percent by collecting gems and crystals
the level isnt officially complete until you get the crystal
oh and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big
unless youre a really hardcore game then you wont need it but its recommended
in conclusion this is a fantastic game and if you love this make sure you get crash bandicoot  warpedthis game has everything the first part lacked
it has even better graphics
this was the first one of the crash series i tried and it was fun
before that i was hooked on fighting games like street fighters and tekken but they are not that fun after playing it a  times or so

you want to know more
get the gems firstthere is also a sixth hidden floor
you would have to reach it by a trick and again check the net for thatthe game was the best i have ever tried
it makes my life harder since i cannot find better games to play anymore
it will make you look for other adventures of crashwhen the first crash bandicoot came out in  i was amazed on an old game and game system could have great d graphics and such great game play but it was kind hard
but in this one its not as hard because you can crouch slide and crouch jump so you can jump even higher
but the graphics are more cartoonish then they are on the first one
but this one had some levels i liked better than on the first one
you should play this gamethis game has lots of advantagesthe last game was goodbut this one is betterthe reason i gave it a four star rading is because its hardits possible to do it without the guidebut impossible without a memory cardbut you can like ita good buythis squeal to the original crash bandicoot game lives up to its name
with great gameplay levels and new characters youll be setting in front of the tv for a whilethis game is a lot of fun
the environments are adorable and the gameplay is a lot of fun
there is quite a bit of stuff to do and the game is kind of challenging
my only problem is the movement is a little goofy feeling at first but you will get used to iti played croc  more often but i did play croc legend of the gobbos when i was young
these games were so fun as well as difficult i never managed to get  completion on either of them
the controls are a bit stiff but this did release in  so that should be expected
the game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple but the game is fun nonetheless and for me its a pretty timeless classic that i am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games
definitely worth the moneyi liked this game
in my mind this really isnt a kids game though
to beat the game  actually requires alot of time and effort
its more the type of game you can play and kids will watch
the controls are pretty easy
its basically mario but your a crocodile exploring diffrent levels theres really nothing groundbreakingthe game does keep your attention and you will have fun completing the levels
a good game if your a patient person if not youll wonder why its taking you so long to beat thiskids game and make you feel stupidi bought this as a gift for my girlfriend
she used to play this game all the time when she was a kid so i figured id get her a new copy
she loved it
now im not so keen on platforming but i promised her id give it a shot
its not terrible but the controls are poorly designed
the most fun i had was using the side step buttons to make croc dance which is freaking adorable and hilarious
side step animation is perhaps the single best reason to play it unless youre into kinda bad old platformers
as i said im not a platformer guy
she loved it though so if platformers are your thing and you dont mind super retro design give it a shotdoom for ps is a great game
almost every level from ultimate doom  doom ii is here plus some new levels never before seen on the pc
this game is dark scary as hell and can really get in your head
the soundtrack is totally different from the pc and creates a very eerie atmosphere that few games ever do
the controls are easy to learn thats a good thing
however the only reason why i gave this game  stars instead of  is because of the graphics
yes as you may have already read the graphics are a bit sluggish especially when compared to the pc version
in my opinion the best version of doom is the pc version period
doom doom  and final doom are the best video games ever in my opinioni had this version in the s and played it while a teenager
i now repurchased it and am playing it in  as a  year old
it is still visceral brooding and epic in its dark atmosphere
in some ways the minimalist d of the original doom particularly in this port lends itself well to the overall gloomy atmosphere
it creates a certain menacing bleakness in the landscapeone thing that really makes this a doom to remember is the totally bent epic dronecore dark ambient soundtrack
playing doom on my modern computer despite the incredible graphics just isnt quite the same without that haunting soundtrack
seriously the soundtrack to this particular version of doom is so totally harrowing and visceral as to be nearly a moving life experience
you will never quite forget it after hearing it
the soundtrack is certainly one of the best of all time for a video game
it is profoundly moody unrelentingly heavy and completely out there
it sounds like something steve roach might create after surviving a journey through hell and then having trent reznor as the music produceroverall this is quite a good port over to the original playstation
original doom is an all time classic with brilliant level design and awesome action that set the standard for years
pick up this version used and fade away into that crazy soundtrack from another level of existencethis game created a whole new race style
with the grapple system it really was unique
the rider profiles and teams really made it cool
brings back so many memoriesnamco museum  third in a series of five collections of old arcade hits hits some high and low spots but is well worth the purchase price for three games
the best of the lot is the translation of ms pacman  very faithful to the original
galaxian is highly addictive and equally faithful to the original
most people dont give digdug the credit its due  it is very entertaining  even for adults
i rather liked digdug in the arcades and this is a good rendition
on the other hand quotphozonquot and quottower of drugaquot are very forgettable quottowerquot the most worthless of the lot
still well worth buying just for the excellent ms pac mani have been playing video games since pong the s and i have change with the time bought a new system every year they come outand love some of the new play station games but its good to have some old favorites
when i bought vol  just for mrs pacmanit was like wow i forgot about pole position ya nothing like nascar  but that use to be my favorite when i was a kid  still is
funny thing is when i was yrs old i could never get past the nd screen in galaxian now  years later of playing video games i still cant get past the nd screen even though i master sypro a  game in  daysi have to admit druaga  phozon were never favorites when i was kid but there hoot to play now just seeing those out of date graphics yep the graphic may be pathetic  game idea may seem simple but they are still challenging and a good reminder of what the good old days of video games were likenamco volume  is a well rounded collection of classic arcade favorites
it features ms pacman digdug galaxian which became addictive very fast after a few plays
 alsofeatures pole position ii phozen which i had never heard of till this collection
its not for everyone
 and last but not least we havethe tower of druaga
obviously the best games are ms pacman galaxian and digdug which each of these games are worth having individually so having them all on one disc its hard to go wrong
but wait there is one slight problem
when you go to the screen that allows you to change the dip switcheswhen they pop up they cover the menu and you dont know what your changing until you get back to the game only to realize you have unknowingly changed your amount of lives to  and set your bonus on  or something to that effect
maybe its just me but i would have preferred a modern menu instead of the switches
nevertheless  starsthis directors cut is the only version of this game you should own simply because it supports the analogue joysticks on the playstation controller
the control in the other versions is impossible at times and a bugger to learn if you are a first time playerthe game by itself is excellent
lots of puzzles and lots of zombies to shoot down
there are times many of them actually where you much be careful how many zombies you shoot because you can run low on bullets very quickly
the story is standard for any survival horror game a group of soldiers are locked in an old mansion that is infested with zombies
an evil company has eperimented with a chemical that turns people into zombies and the fallout turns the whole town into zombies
to survive you must make your way through the mansion and solve all the puzzles
this is definitely a challenge and one that can be frustrating at times but rewarding once completedhere are the pros
the graphics are superb
the detailing of the zombies and the surroundings give you are real sense of dread and yes the blood flow is well detailed it sprays when you are wounded
the music is ominous and ambient giving just the right mood to the situations you come across
the story is also well put together even though anyone who has seen george romeros living dead trilogy and what horror fan hasnt
can get a sense of deja vu
all these elements make this a game well worth gettingnow for the cons
this game is not the toughest game for the playstation but it can be darn frustrating when you get stuck
sometimes a puzzle is very tricky and requires you to backtrack just to see if you missed anything
this adds much more time to the game but not in a good way
there is also the frustration of running low on bullets when there are three zombies coming towards you
each zombie requires about three bullets each to finish them off but bullets are so scarce that you must conserve
also the acting and dialogue is so hammy that it is comical and you feel compelled to just skip through it so you can get back to killing zombiesoverall this is a great game with a few shortcomings
but then again nothing is perfect
if the survival horror concept sounds appealing then you should check this one out
the resident evil series has become the benchmark of survival horror much like final fantasy has for the rpg genrecapcoms legendary resident evil series and i have never really seen eye to eye
though i own nearly every nongamecube title in the undead thrillers history id never been able to stand one long enough to actually complete it right up until this past week
id always found the series to be misleading disguising itself as a straightforward action title before slowing the gameplay down to a crawl and relying on endless puzzles and feats of memory to lengthen completion times
time after time id sit down with the goal of finally tackling these games and time after time id get bored stuck or distracted leaving the game behind
i grabbed resident evil  when it was relatively new and the title has sat unplayed on my shelf for years
that was as i said until this past week when i sat down with renewed vigor and vowed to complete the first title in the series even if it drove me to madnessill make it really blunt the story is absolutely terrible
the uninspiring characters meander their way through the events without a care in the world occasionally encountering plot holes large enough to drive an oversized bus through
nagging issues such as why somebody would lock their homes single shotgun away in a room thats only accessible through a string of unrelated tricks and puzzles arent even touched upon
what if somebody breaks in in the middle of the night
is the owner of the mansion really going to have time to roll out of bed run downstairs jog to one side of the house move around a couple statues grab a key run to another corner of the house open a door grab a fake shotgun return to the original side of the house unlock the doors and replace the real shotgun with the fake
i suppose the story does the right thing by failing to even mention these things but theyll still tug away at the back of your mind as you playthe graphics of the first resident evil really havent aged well
humans and zombies alike wander around stiffly and unrealistically each one looking almost identical to the others
polygon models are simple and blocky
textures are pixelated and undetailed looking more like a game assembled on the super nintendos superfx chip than a playstation title
the series characteristic prerendered backgrounds are poorly compressed and difficult to navigate in places forcing players to turn out all the lights and squint their eyes just to make their way through the room
merging still images with live polygons resident evil plays like a strange amalgamation of the pc classics myst and alone in the dark
the bread and butter of any console title its gameplay is the one area where youll really learn to love or hate this series
rather than bothering with camera angles and awkward environments capcom has instead sent players through a series of screens occasionally containing interactive elements of their own
youll control jill or chris from a series of dramatic angles never in control of the camera itself
theyll enter a screen on the left side mosey around a little bit kill a couple zombies and leave the screen on the right side immediately entering the next screen from another direction
though it was a somewhat novel concept at the time of its release this scheme brought with it numerous problems the most notable of which was your interaction with enemies on the next screen
its not uncommon to run full throttle off the edge of one screen only to find a zombie waiting for you right at the edge of the next
its a really cheap way to take a hit and can mean a speedy frustrating death in later stageslooking back the control scheme employed here is notably revolutionary
rather than applying a more traditional platformers control layout resident evil introduced gamers to a stationary rotationbased configuration
left and right dont serve to strafe they stop the characters movement altogether and rotate them left or right in place
up moves you forward and down moves backwards
pressing r draws your weapon and pressing x at the same time fires
its a scheme thats more appropriate for the kind of stationary gunfighting and marksmanship thats defined the action portions of this series since day onemany of the tricks and puzzles buried within the mansion arent so much brain teasers as they are time wasters
youll realize what needs to be done within moments but chances are good you wont have the piece needed to do so on your person
it took me about six and a half hours to beat the game for the first time as chris cautiously walking around learning the position of the zombies figuring out the puzzles groaning as i realized the piece i needed was sitting in a chest fifteen minutes away and repeating that process
the second time through playing as jill and remembering which random item i would need where i finished in three hours and twenty minutes
thats one heck of a variationthe soundtrack to the first resident evil is really something thats difficult to categorize
imagine if you can a blend of symphonic suspense the song that plays when you push demo on a keyboard and elevator music
thats resident evils melody
the composer tried to capitalize on the few jump out of your seat moments the storyline provided but surrounded by cheesy samples monotonously repeating tunes and quality that sounds more like something on the n than the psx there was only so much that could be doneon the large this was a different kind of game than what we were getting at the time something fresh
it wasnt a blockbuster ohmygodgetmethesequelnow mind numbing experience
i can understand why a game like this would deserve a sequel but even today i couldnt have predicted the amount of games it would spawnsince last night ive been waiting to do this review because ive been studying the exact differences from re and re directors cut
this review will really help for someone who has played re but is wondering what re dc is about
well youve came to the right place
first of all here are the facts each zombie takes  shots no matter what
with the beretta jill is a blonde all though she doesnt look like it a very dumb blonde barry has a magnum and hes proud
you have to kill zombies up to four times if you leave the room when you shoot them down
that means they come back alive once they are dead and you leave the roomthe just pop up
this game has hilarious dialoguewell speaking of dialogue the grammar is also very badand i mean very bad
examples are when you pick up the st floor map  quotyou got the st floor mapquot  re says quotyouve taken the st floor mapquot that makes more sense
quotyou got the acid roundsquotfunny sometimes
also what i found is that jill doesnt know what blood is
barry is inspecting a pool of red liquid on the dining room floor
jill comes over and has the nerve to ask quotwhat is itquot and she stays there and studies it
barry replies with quoti think it is blood
i hope this is not chriss bloodquot  and they have exaggeration at the completely wrong times
but when there is a big monster coming they just talk quotwow
its a monster
what do we doquot  and when there is like a door that doesnt open during movie scenes they say quotthis door wont open
what are we going to do
quot also a really hilarious part is when barry hands jill the acid rounds jill says that he should keep them for himself and barry replies quotno thats okayi have this
quot and holds up his magnumi laughed my head offhe sounded so stupid
no offence to the makers of re or anything but it is just so funnyanother fact is that the camera angles are bad but the puzzles are harder
hmmm
resident evil is a very very very good gamebut it is just the dialogue and camera anglesive been talking it down but now its time to tell you that it is definately worth getting despite its happy mediumsso theres a few final things i have to say here barry has a magnum  wesker has shades  and the three zombies at the top of the stairs above the m storeroom f sound like cowscheers
jonglesif only the movie was as good
ive missed playing this game so much glad to have it back in my collectionresident evil directors cut 
the psx rerelease of the  survival horror gameback when the psx was first released the system didnt have much in the way of standout games
of course there were a few noteworthy psx launch games like twisted metal doom and tekken but for the most part the psx didnt have anything outstanding yet
thus resident evil was made
taking influences from the earlier survival horror series alone in the dark resident evil took all of its aspects to the next level and eventually became one of capcoms most successful franchises to date ranking just behind the mega man and street fighter games
in fact the original re game was probably the first psx game to make the system worthwhile before other important games were released in the following yearsmost everyone whos played the games already knows the story but for those who havent heres a brief synopsis a strange murder occurrence just outside of raccoon city has caused police officials to be suspicious so they sent two special tactics and rescue squad stars teams to go investigate
you play as either jill valentine or chris redfield both of them surviving stars members
the teams end up getting stuck in the mountains so they eventually find themselves inside a huge mansion where the stars members discover numerous creatures such as zombies mutilated dogs giant spiders and other monsters
these were all created due to umbrella corporations disastrous tvirus
as the game goes along more important discoveries are madenow lets talk about the game itselfof the three psx re games this one easily has the worst graphics
were talking firstgeneration psx graphics here if thats any indication
the character models are all blocky and easily stick out from the otherwise highly detailed stillscreen environments
these environments are navigatably d but the camera angles sit at fixed d points which can be both good and bad depending on the situation
by bad i mean that some angles hinder the view of the action
the monsters especially the zombies have very limited animation and models compared to the later games and its limited engine prevents the game from having more than  monsters on the screen at one time not including the crows
so the only real decent graphical aspects are the rendered environments
but even they dont quite compare to the detail in the following gamesthe sound effects are good for the most part
however the zombies come off sounding more like moaning old men than actual monsters and the voice acting dear god
dont get me started
its so hilariously bad that its just fun to listen to
the dialogue doesnt help things at all along with the horrible acting which is bad even by bmovie standards
one of my friends almost died of laughter the last time i went through the game
the music on the other hand is decent and suits the mood of each area appropriately
its nothing special but it does add to the overall suspensethe controls are something that most people either love or hate
it took me some time to get used to them but now i have no troubles whatsoever
most people that hate them dont seem to realize that re isnt just an allout action game but rather an exploration puzzle type game with action segments
the controls were a bit rough here though they have been more refined in later releases
i do admit though that it does get very tedious backtracking to the item box again and again because you cant hold all the items you want to
between the two playable characters jill and chris i personally found jill to be the better one to control because she has more inventory slots and weapons than chris although chriss voice acting isnt quite as nervegrating as hers is
both characters each have their own subcharacter that helps them along game such as barry who helps jill and rebecca who aids chrismost people have said that this game was the scariest of all the re games
im not sure i agree with that but the atmosphere can be quite chilling at certain points
i suppose that the dogs breaking through the glass windows couldve scared newbees to the series but since i was introduced through re and the fact that ive already played the much freakier silent hill games the original didnt scare me nearly as much as it should have
to the games credit though it does present the most puzzles and a majority of them are real brainbenders
its something that the series started to get away from as time went on
plus i thought that the game itself felt larger than all the others in the series so it will take a while for new players to beat it
the challenge is also very high since there is very limited ammo to take out the creatures with
even veteran re fanatics still find the first game to be thoroughly challenging enough to come back for morethis version of the game is a directors cut edition but its really nothing special
all we get is an extra mode that is more challenging and features different outfits for the main characters but if you already own the original theres no need to get this version
apparently the japanese version also had extra cutscenes so we were cheated
so much for it being a directors cut huhalthough this game is extremely dated by todays standards its still worth checking out if youre a big fan of the series and want to see how the series got started in the first place
however its not really necessary now that a much better remake is available on the gamecube so i suggest looking into that game instead
recommended specifically to fans of the series
new fans should start with re  or the gamecube remake of the original firstthis is where the epic resident evil series began
the first adventure sees you tackle zombies snakes and dogs in a deserted mansion which is very atmospheric
dont be put off by the relatively poor voice acting and cut scenes bear in mind that this was made in  and so for the times its pretty good
this is a classic game that spawned one of the best series of games on the playstation
the only thing preventing this from being a  star game is the slighty disapointing ending
but this is only a minor flaw and this is still one of the best games on the playstationthis is a pretty good game except for the music gets annoying sometimes such as the b floor of the mansion however the disc had a few scratches it was in good condition soul edge  circa good gameplay is pretty balanced some nice unlockables different and interesting story for a fighter pretty good sound track for a fighterbad graphics looked pretty dated voiceovers are not so goodif it fits your taste play story mode to unlock new swords characters and costumes plays like tekken but with weapons medieval theme has ninjas and samurais fighting pirates and knightsgame its most assocated too tekken  virtual fighter additional notes this is the first game in the soul caliber franchise in the arcade this game was called soul bladeunlike some other reviewers i actually found that this game was enjoyable
the only complaint i have is that the graphics looked like they belonged to a super nintendo
besides that the game is awesomethe basic outline of the game is that you race the usa from california to washington dc
each level gets harder as you pass along but not to worry
once you get the hang of the game you will beat the level after a few tries
each time you complete the whole entire racee california to dc you will earn a faster carso all in all crus n usa is a pretty enjoyable game
buy and enjoyhappy gamingthe title is a quote from the final boss androssa more accurate rating for this game overall is really  stars but of course amazon wont let you grade in half stars
a true masterpiece starfox  stands as one of the greatest games ever created for the nintendo  and perhaps even all time
i recently got it as my first and only star fox title and though im normally not a fan of games with shooting and space ships like this this game succeeded in impressing
analyzing its features step by step its pretty hard to find reasons why this game shouldnt be lovedstoryline  the story is absolutely captivating
though it starts out pretty simple and generic the galaxy and corneria are being threatened by venom someone save us etc
the backstory behind it is pretty detailed the intro is epic and the story itself takes on a whole new life when you start playing
actually you are the one who controls the story to a degree you can pretty much decide through skill andor choice whether things go great or awful for the star fox team a heroic pilot crew you can manipulate
you control fox mccloud and only fox mccloud but you also associate with the three pilots of peppy slippy and falco why just protecting falco and doing certain actions on the first level can decide which way the story goes
this game does a great job of drawing you into its world and making you want to figure out whats happeningcharacters  i have to commend whoever came up with these interesting characters they make the game
even on your own crew each one is distinctive falco for example plays along the lines of the tough guy with a secretly caring heart
peppy is like the fatherly instructive type and slippy plays along the lines of a new school boy
finally fox the same character you control often takes on a reserved leadership role which makes sense
each one has his own quirks and though any of them can be annoying on a certain level you cant help but feel a degree of liking for each of them
their lines though perhaps epic for the time can be somewhat cheesy andor cliche peppys its quiet 
too quiet
is a good example but the cheesiness adds to what is oddly a funny and lighthearted game
you often cant help but think i shouldnt be laughing at this but youll laugh anyway
its just that kind of game
the ai
of each character on maneuvering is decent but until you get skilled enough it can be hard not to shoot at them or let enemies get them as they get in your way at the oddest times then fuss at you when you do hit them
peppy occasionally gives advice that doesnt particularly help either though it hardly ever hurts if you follow it
speaking of advice though the game can make you depend on your characters if youre newer at it as they can each do something useful peppy gives advice and often tells you where to shoot slippy analyzes boss health meters and falco often covers you
if someone gets shot down youll miss him
finally the characters are also pretty lifelike in behavior try shooting down enemies that falco is chasing on some levels and listen to his reaction to itgraphics  some issues with fog common for nintendo  games but otherwise absolutely beautiful
the fog itself even can be justified as you spend most of your time in the air
though many stages take either a purely generic spacial theme such as the asteroid field the planets are really intuitive
in this game you can find a volcanic environment which even mimics the wavy effects of heat an ocean environment full of fish and plant life a couple of cities a train depot 
the works
the most interesting graphics you could see however has to be the part of the asteroid field you can warp to
though it probably looks like youve taken a medication or something else you shouldnt have you cant deny the mysterious beauty of that point in the level
please note however that what levels you see depends on what paths through the game you take like the story its dependent upon your actions in the levelsmechanics  this covers things like controls ability to save and learning curve whether its easy or hard to master
the controls though they work well are pretty complicated to learn
this complication however is eased by the nice training mode they threw in a few rounds in training mode and youll pretty much have them down
the game can still be pretty tough to a degree though however i was able to nearly make it through the entire game on one of my first three rounds and im usually not too hot at games like this before the star wolf team finished me off theyre pretty tough if you dont know how to handle them right
make sure to master the somersault maneuver ive never seen a game force you to rely on it as heavily as this one
in terms of saving i was disappointed theres no way to save and unlike what some people say theres no password feature either
youll probably get sick of the first level for that reason
while its not a deal breaker this game isnt for the busy person whos looking to play for only an hour or less and quit
if you want to experience the true value of this game youd better set aside at least a couple of hours for it
the lack of a save feature is the biggest thing that kept me from giving this game a perfect score as i kept catching myself thinking this game would be perfect if only it had a save feature
music and sound  no complaints in the music and sound department
it pretty much captures the mood be it suspenseful hopeful dramatic or even rewarding
the character voices are also well done awesomely portraying the character personalities as well
i cant describe any of this justly though youll have to listen for yourselfconclusion star fox  is a face of near perfection if only a few small blemishes hadnt reared their ugly heads
multiplayer i hear is lacking but overall none of the minor flaws in this game are major dealbreakers
personally i recommend this game to people who are bored and have a lot of time on their hands the replay value is great with its various paths
the final boss can be downright creepy and 
well i think any critique could easily go on forever
long story short this game is an absolute steal at the cheap price its at now
a fond memory in many gamers hearts this star fox  still remains as a highly recommended game to playstarfox for n will always be a classic has fun game play only problem is that the game isnt overly challenging made to be winable by kids and isnt a very long game i remember winning it on several occasions in one sitting but still taking several hoursvery fun game thoughas with the first there is no save option but it is still fun to see how far you get in this gameits nice and challenging its just a drag there is no continue or save option hereyou can get extra lives thoughlike most games it gets easier the more you play itthe graphics are superb and the music is very good tooi just recommend you get the first star fox cause that game is longeryou should still get this thoughin  nintendo was on the cutting edge in the video gaming industry
the nintendo  proved that no mateer what a cdrom gaming system was able to do a cartridged based gaming system could do better
that june the case really proved the theory with the release of starfox  the game was the very first to incorporate nintendos rumple pak a forcefeedback device that lets players feel each and every vibration at handin the game you play fox mccloud a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy andross a inane mad genius that demands full control of the lylat system
there are  remarkable stages that let you encounter in the entire game alone over twentyfive different paths you decide on your way to andross
the graphics are so realistic and full of promise that you see the game so vividly you feel like youre a part of it
in starfox  you also have the use of  different vehicles depending on your course arwing landmaster tank or the blue marine sub only used in the aquas sea level
the game also has a fierce battle level for up to  players where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders peppy falco and slippyit took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game the exact same way nintendo did with starfox  the game is exactly one of a kind in the pilot seat
while nintendo stopped releasing the rumble pak with the game nearly six months later starfox  is still truly a nintendo gamers paradiseat first i thought this game stunk cause there was no save feature but there is a password feature and you can use other peoples passwords to start out on whatever level you feel
cheating has never looked so good
there are great graphics and action and the gameplay is very straightforwardall in all it deserves an a 
a great gift to receive in septemberi just got this game today and it is fun and very intensealso this game is from  and its still really funit can be said that this game is easy maybe the graphics is terrible but at the time i loved this game ive not touch this game in years however i can say i really enjoyed this all time classicfor the people who are true nitendo fans this is a classic that you can add to your  libary
i still have my  and it works great so does the games starfox is worth a try laterz folksive had this game basically since it launched in  i must say the graphics are rather impressive for an n game and the gameplay is great
the minigames are fun especially when playing with other people
the only real problem i had with this game is how it didnt last long at all
it has about  mini games but you can easily beat the game and unlock them all within about a week of good playing timewhen i first played this game last christmas for the first time i thought quotoh my goodness how do you play this
quotthis is a  mario game but at that time i wasnt feeling too well and the strange  appearance of the game made my head spinas a result i played tomb  raidertlr insetad
happy to tell you that today id rather play this game  than tomb raiderwell its like a board game but much more fun
lots  of minigames lots of chances to shout and swear not that im telling you  to but its all goodnatured funthe characters look kind of silly esp  yoshi and peach who look like circus rejectsbut i dont think the purpose  of playing a mario game or any decent video game is to see hunks and  babeshowever this game falls short of mario kart replay glory cause  the formula can get tired at timesbut if you want a solid firstparty  party game then this is it
i havent played goldeneye  or perfect  dark yet so as far as pure multiplayer mania is concerned this is number   next to mario kart yes its that goodill be doing the mario party games next and besides this one and  i have the entire series
 is the first one i played and still the one i hold very highly as one of the best ones in the seriesthe plot is very generic
toad wants to test everyone and see who can be the super star and thus the game that destroys friendships begin
the original mario party is known for its difficulty in terms of mini games as the controllers back in the day were either unresponsive or some were just way too hard and required luck
i might even add that some mini games like the tugowar required you to twirl your controller to the point that it might even break or hurt your hand
yeah some of the minigames are brutal
on the plus side there are some memorable mini games where you had to work together to win the game and personally we didnt see that until mario party  with the boss battlethe game overall had the most nostalgic feel and introducing the characters personalities through the stages
this game kind of set up peachs obsession with cake and luigi being the gadgeteer of the two brothers
the music for the stage is very cute especially in rainbow castle
i love how whoever gets th place gets the butt monkey treatment and attacked by the stage while st player achieves the mission neededoverall a good start for the series but good luck finding this game
this game never reached the virtual console because of the controls so its a rare find in any trade in store without it being at extremely high pricesthe days when people said quotwere having a party a mario partyquot  seems to be long past
when this game first came out it seemed to be the only thing people talked about
yet today with  mario parties in the collection this one still is wonderful for being the base rootsjust like any of the other mario parties you choose which character youd like to be mario luigi ect
the object of the game is to go around the board and collect stars
stars come at a price  coins
to get  coins you must win mini games or land on blue spots
this is like an advanced board game for the n but with a twist
in addition to the board game aspect of this game after everyone takes  turn a mini game takes placecompetitions in this mini game includeeveryone against eachother vs  vs this is where the intense fun comes on
you and your friends button smash spin the analog stick to your hearts content
as a matter of fact so much button smashing fast taps on the buttonstakes place that gloves came out for this game to protect your hand
be warned if youre too competitive with this particular mario party you may wind up with a blistered palm or sore fingersits overall pure fun
games can last for hours and hours if you really want
though playing a board game on a console sounds dull this game completely opposite of thatif you want a great n gamethis is a must buyif you are interested in this game but dont want to play an older console anymore or dont have a n i recommend mario party  and  for the nintendo gamecube
exceptionally fun with  quite a bit less dangerous button smashingthe first of the mario party gamesit really is an awesome game
i only played it at a friends house as a child really so now many years later i finally decided to get it for myself along with  and  the n games are classici really only play it by myself but it is so much funner to play with friends
you can get so angry when someone steals your star
this is how you get in fights with your friendsthe mini games are fun not as fun as  and  thoughnever going to regret buying this game when nintendo first made it onto the scene with mario  they had no idea of how interesting it is to mold and shape the format of the mario brothers industry for the nintendo  it became so big that every single thing had to be topped off to the next level of excitement and so on down the linewith mario party for nintendo  they had absolutely no idea of how successful it has become
the game features your choice of six characters to choose from wario mario peach aka
princess toadstool yoshi luigi and donkey kong
the object of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by winning several different types of games including tug o war where it is  player vs  players bombs away where you have to try stay on a floating island for  seconds without getting the shock from cannon shots coming and there is deep sea divers where you have to collect as many treasure chests as possible without losing your breath
there are also six different kinds of boards to play the game on as well as two very special hidden boards so look outit is a shame that most games didnt seem to be like mario party
although many people are interested in the newer ones and the gamecube version the original is always the best one to try for starters
if you really want it then roll the dice and take that very first chancein mario party you take control of one of six nintendo characters mario luigi peach yoshi wario or donkey kong and move around a board as if you were playing a board game
after each turn you play a minigame
at the end of the minigame the winners get coins
the coins can then be used to buy stars from toad
sometimes you run into bowser who does something random but never helps anyone
the winner is the character with the most stars at the end of a set amount of turns
a true original by nintendo
however there is a major problem with the controlsas you may have heard there are minigames in mario party that require rotating the control stick
doing this can lead to blisters on the palm of your hand
in fact nintendo realized this and was almost about to recall every copy of mario party
but instead nintendo released a statement to the public that they would send a glove to prevent blisters if you send them the cover of mario partys instruction manuali realize that there are many people out there that do not want to go through the hassle of having to do more than buying the game in order to play the game
specifically the people who usually lose the instruction manual to their games the second after they open the box
in this case how is the person going to be able to get the glove if they could not provide the object that nintendo was looking for
nintendo should have found some other way to distribute the gloves
a way that would allow anyone who has the game and cannot keep track of everything get there hands on or in a glovenintendo should have noticed this defect and corrected it before releasing mario party
but dont let that stop you from buying it
its still a great game just dont forget to buy a glovethe first mario party while not the best mario partyholds a lot of nostalgia for meif it werent for the stick spinning minigames id rank this in the top decided to start collecting oldtime ps games and this one is a must have
i remember playing this constantly throughout my childhoodif you want a well priced yet fulfilling few hours of destructive fun this is your game
i found the ambience slightly disturbing thats good
fans of the films will appreciate all the locales being included
the graphics are extremely dated but for fans of old school games who dont need extreme eye candy this is a solid buyoriginally released way way back a little after the release of the original playstation acclaims alien trilogy you can tell this game is old considering the film series stopped being a trilogy when the fourth film alien resurrection was released a year later on is a straight forward first person shooter in which you play as ripley going through all the xenomorph infested areas from the first three films
by todays standards the graphics gameplay and weapon options are all pretty dated but in its day alien trilogy was one of the better fps games to hit the ps
all in all if you still have your ps and dig older fps games you should give this one time gem a lookfor those of us who got a psx at rollout alien trilogy deffinately belongs in the list of all time psx classic games
sure by todays graphics standards its not so great but it has great game play
the best thing about this game is the ambiance  dark great music it is a little scarry
the game is simple to play and control
yes the doomunreal crowd wont like it  not enough buttons and weapons of mass destruction
no this is the first person shooter your girlfriend will want to play too
acclaim should remake this title for ps with more cg story cuts and cohesive plotthe graphics and audio in this game really leave more to be desired but the overall gameplay is loads of fun
mission objectives and dificuly are good although you wont find yourself in a lot of fullblown shoot outs
nevertheless it is a good game and i definitely would reccomend itthis is my first review ive done of a video game
body harvest is a game thats very much fun to play
although i read through the instruction booklet this game seems tough to figure out as to what to do next
its almost like having your own johnny quest cartoon to play
although you get just one life in your player sort of a futuristiclike space warrior you get plenty of chances to rejuice his power
the graphics in my opinion are good even though ive heard others quoting that they didnt care for them
also enjoy the music that starts up whenever the aliens start coming in for the kill
an hour can easily pass by when you play body harvest
a good game to ownrockstar games later went on to use the game engine and flight mechanics as well as the swimming and other parts of his game to improve what most of you would refer to as gtasa and gta one could be labored to suggest that this game allowed and was the father of said games
in the gaming industry it happens often that one game either spawns or helps improve the industry standards and this game thou over looked did more for the gaming world then most figure or seethis game is to gta as ultima underworld is to fallout  and that is to say they are the for runners that improved future games
i suggest if your looking for good harmless violence without human on human violence i recommend this one if you still use your n
i would point out that human deaths that you allow or preform increase a ticking total and once you get to many you fail the level
so the game even goes so far as to not allow it i will also add this game has one of the largest number of flying vehicles and ground vehicles and even boats and the likes of almost any game i have ever played in my entire lifei was very surprised with legend of legaia when i first played it
although the basic rpg formula is still basically intact there are a few  radically innovative bits that seem to work quite welltake for example  the amazing battle engine while turnbased at its core each characters  basic attack is instead a series of kicks and punches that you enter at  the beginning of each round
specific sequences of kicks and punches  unlock quotartsquot  combos that you can perform at any point in the  game
furthermore you can chain arts in combat if they share their first  and last moves and whats best you can perform any art at any given  time giving you total freedom in combat
most arts are learned through  experimentation while a few are taught to you by a variety of casual  mentors
to save you the trouble of writing the arts down the game keeps  track of the ones you learned in notes that can be called up either through  the status menus or directly in combat
magic in legend of legaia is all  summoning
during combat you have the chance of absorbing the powers of a  variety of enchanted monsters and thereupon summoning them to cast spells
if you summon the creature frequently it will increase in level making  the spell it produces more efficient and perhaps even add a side  effectseems as though sony threw this amazing thing in and then forgot  to capitalize on it
makes me wonder why they capitalized on the far more  restrictive battle engine in legend of dragoongraphically legend of  legaia isnt much to look at or listen to with ungainly polygonal  surroundings and fully polygonal characters who look like blocks on a  string
thankfully in combat the characters are realistically proportioned  and animate realistically
also their faces are very expressive and  welldetaileda diabolic mist has enveloped the world years ago turning  the enchanted seru into deranged monsters and their human possessors into  mindless zombies
it is up to you to revive the genesis trees spread across  the land in order to destroy the mist
if the story sounds offbeat and  unexciting it is still your formulaic savetheworld story we have come to  know and love in many rpgs
the plot is as unobtrusive as they come
there  is nothing unnecessary no confusing tangents no bland endless dialog  nothing to detract you from the gameplaynow to alerts this is a slow  slow s l o w game
travel on the overworld is very  sluggish
character advancement is equally slow
get ready for tactical  levelbuilding lots of it because the bosses are tough
if you like your  games to move at breakneck speed and halfblind you with glitter of many  explosions legend of legaia may reduce you to tears in under an hour
but  if youre in for a good oldfashioned rpg experience you will most  certainly enjoy this gamelegend of legaia is a relatively simple rpg with a new twist now you can customize the way you attack your enemies
this makes it look sort of like a tekken game but its still menubasedthe story begins when vagn the main character with blue hair is preparing to go hunting
of course like almost every rpg story that starts out with a plan things take a turn for the worst vagns girlfriends father gets killed by monsters in the mist then an evil entity invades vagns village
now vagn must go on an adventure to stop the mist permanently
the guy who was killed isnt especially important vagn is just sick of people dyingon his way vagn meets a young girl named noa and an akuma lookalike named byron if i remember the name correctly
sorry to cut off there but youll have to play the game if you want to know more
its worth it thoughwhat i especially like about legend of legaia is that it fits into the bit era without sacrificing bizarre hair colors
this is very essential to anime as it can somehow relax the nervesi dont think this game is as wellknown as other games such as the final fantasy series but its still a pretty good rpg
its not the best out there but its really fun to play and is a solid entry in the rpg genre
lets find out whygraphics score  the graphics kind of remind of final fantasy viis graphics although im not sure if they came out around the same time or what
they arent really exciting by todays standards but they work well enough
legend of legaia may not have the best graphics but it makes good use of what it has
in fact the enemy designs and area settings are pretty unique and inventive
overall the graphics arent too hard on the eyemusic score  the music is pretty good and somewhat memorable especially the overworld theme
there is some limited voice acting in the form of battle phrases most of which are in japanese
each character only has three moves that are voiced in english which dont even play every time you use that move it cycles randomly between that and the japanese phrases
to make matters worse the few english phrases like tornado fist sound a whole lot like butchered engrish
i wonder what happened there
were they not able to afford more than a few phrases voiced in english
or decent voice actors
they really shouldve kept it all english or all japanese
other than that though i have no complaints in this category because the actual music is awesomecharacters score  the characters themselves are not the best in rpg history
firstly we have vahn who never speaks and has no personality
yep its the old silent protagonist
the game even makes fun of thistheres a scene where vahn steps into some hot water and turns red then jumps back out all without saying a word
then this guy walks over and says if the waters hot you should say so
its hilarious
next we have noa who was literally raised by wolves well a seru creature attached to a wolfs head
because of this she is socially awkward and knows nothing of the world
unfortunately this leads to some pretty cringeworthy dialogue for example a scene where she broadly proclaims that suffering is bad
to make matters worse she speaks the most out of your three characters
gala is your last character
i actually think he is the best developed since he starts out being an uptight stiff but later becomes more openminded
overall these characters are not the greatest but they get the job donestory score  youd think a game about reviving trees to save the world would be boring but this game pulls it off
an evil mist has covered the land causing the normally helpful seru creatures to attack humanity
your small party of heroes possess raseru a type of seru immune to the mist and must save the world by reviving genesis trees which have the power to drive away mist
no this isnt arbor day propaganda
in all seriousness though the story is pretty engaging
its really interesting seeing how each isolated settlement of humans manages to protect themselves from the mist and who is ultimately responsible for the whole mist problem
the game developers have really done a good job of portraying a devastationridden world and keeping it engaging and believablebattle system score  the battle system is an interesting take on the usual turnbased system
you input a left right up or down button in a string to make an attack
certain combinations will be special attacks called arts which do more damage
if you get sick of inputting buttons the game allows you to use your last input as a default
this option can speed things up if you just dont feel like doing all those inputs
this battle system is actually more fun and engaging than a plain old attack command and i really enjoyed itgameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
now the best aspect of this game in my opinion is collecting seru to use as summon magic
if you have a collectors mindset like me youll really enjoy collecting them all
unfortunately this can be tedious and irritating since you odds of catching good seru are usually low forcing you to try over and over and over again
this really wears on your nerves after awhile
usually though it isnt so bad
lets see other than that no complaintsoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
its really a shame that this game isnt more wellknown because i feel like legend of legaia is a good solid little game
if youre an rpg collector then this game is definitely worth putting in your collectionlegend of legaia was the first rpg i ever played which started my love for rpgs
when i first played this game i could not put it down to eat sleep or go to work
i called in  days in a row because of how addicted to this game i was
anyways to get to the review part and after beating this game x since and played many rpgs it still holds as one of my all time favorites just under lunarsssc final fantasy vii grandia and xenogears for the original playstationstoryline i still after all these years love the storyline to this game
van gala and noa are the only members in your party which after playing other rpgs i wished you had a few more people in your party
basically there is a mist that turns people and animals into crazed monsters and you need to activate the genesis trees and destroy mist generators
it has some really good twists in the story and it stays for the most part intersesting and keeps you hooked
van is a quiet and just good all around guy noa is a girl who grew up on her own until she met van and gala is a monk who seems to be angry most of the timegraphics definitely for its time some of the best around but there were no cg clips or fmvs to help move the storyline on
with games around its time using cg clips like ffvii or anime scenes like lunar i think legaia could have used some clips as well
as far as graphics when your characters were fighting very nicely done a bit blocky but when you buy armor and the change is actually noticeable on the character its a very easy to get overcombat system probably the very best thing and most enjoyable part of the game even the random battles are easy to get over because it actually get you into the fight
you get to do whats called arts hyper arts and magic that is used through your raseru
magic is learned by killing monsters but getting the actual spell is random so it can be on your first kill or th kill
the power of your magic goes up the more times you use it and the kamero spell is easily my most favoritethe game can take anywhere from  hours to finish depending on how much you do
there are a few mini games but none that are noteworthy and i only have few gripes about the game itselfthe first is when roaming around on the world map van moves really slow
also money is an annoyance to get and armor starts getting really expensive so youll spend a lot of time money grinding if you want the best stuffthe money grinding lack of a few cg clips or fmvs to help move the story and long levels keep this game from being one of the greatest rpgs ever
it gets delightful  out  from this long time legaia fanonce upon a time in a land so far away that character names are nothing like they are today the seru came to the world of legaia
man discovered that he could use these benevolent creatures to wield tremendous powers
all was well
or as well as it could be in a world where war was a commonplace and sooner or later someone figured out how to pervert the power of the seru and turn them to evil
those who wore the seru became degenerate and the world cowered before the onslaught of the mistof course the powers that write games couldnt leave an opportunity like this alone and our heroes vahn the young hunter gala the monk and noa an eleven year old girl with the power of  were packed off to end the mist wearing special symbionts the raseru
their first task to restore the great trees of the worldthis is a classic psone rpg
not one of the greatest but with enough play in it to keep your interest for the  to  hours it takes to play
the story line is straightforward  the long story arc is broken into a set of subquests either the restoration of a tree or the destruction of a mist generator
the world is large and you will spend a lot of time walking about in perpetual battle until faster modes of tranportation become availablethe battle system is based on combination attacks which can be layered together in increasing power
magic is available via the raseru who can absorb powers when certain foes are beaten
like many systems fighting can be as complex as you might like but the truth is that you will find certain patterns that work consistently and those are what you will use
this is a flaw in most rpgs  power always trumps subtletythe games only glaring flaw is that it is entirely too much a money game
you start out poor and stay that way since no matter how many you kill your funds always lag the prices until late in the game when a variety of subgames become available to generate cash and prizes
there is something vaguely unsatisfying about putting saving the world on hold in order to go  round in a boxing ring to get the cash for that nifty magic grail
now every rpg has this problem but in legaia it is worse than usualmy other gripe is the characters
vahn and gala are extremely two dimensional gala has a slight sense of humor
noa who gets most of the story development time is a hyperactive bloodthirsty elevenyearold girl who is perpetually waving her arms and giving orders
she is also a stone killer
she may get my prize as the silliest hero to grace the playstationgraphics are decent for the games era but music is a washout
this is a decent game with fairly enjoyable play but dont expect final fantasy level quality
if you like rpgs as a genre then you will find the game entertaining for many hoursi remember this game a long time ago that i played for hours over and over again
this game was so much fun
i know that it had it faults but it wasnt that bad and it was pretty fun
i liked the drawings of characters and the animation
if you like ff kind of graphics than this is the same kind
i like the battle system
yes this game has a similar battle system as xenogears and thats why i liked it too
its not a bad thing that they used a similar battle system its a great thing as now i got  games that play the same with different people and story linesthe main story is that you control  characters and they all have a magic gem that attach to their arm
this give them the ability to use magicsummon spells
i remember as a little kid i loved seeing those spells come out
the fault in this game with that is it takes awhile to get the spells
you have to get hit repeatedly with the same spell for awhile before the each character learns itanother issue with this game is that their is a issue with money
i had to fight many battles before i could get enough to buy anything
its like this for the whole game
i didnt mind this as i had to fight monster anyways to learn those summon spellswhat i really liked about this game was the little mini games
i remember playing one mini game for a long time as the fishing game
i remember there was  or  places where i could fish and i had to get better rods to get better fish
i would keep on fishing for some reason i would get something for getting a fish that weight a lot of pounds
also i would get something for getting really rare fish
i remember one time i got the most impossible and rarest fish in the whole game
it took half a hour of reeling it in and even longer trying to find and wait for it
that sucker was so much trouble to get but i knew it was worth it
i dont remember the name but it was a really long sliverwhite fish that weighted a tonit game is worth it if you gave the time it needs to get really good towards the middle or the game and at the end tooill start with the goods first of all its nice having this little gadget for ur n for games like the legend of zeldamajoras mask that requires u to have it and perfect dark where u practically need it to get the most out of the gameplay now the few bad things its a little difficult to get out the original jumperpak with the cheap plastic thingy they give you and for some of the games there arent much improvements with it they have pretty much the same graphics as the jumperpak but with like hydro thunder then u can have  players instead of  or  i forget which  it is cause i dont own the game i just saw the reviews off of nintendo magazinesi just bought an n but ive played one before with and without the expansion pak
though the pak does help with the graphics the n still cant touch the dreamcast or ps with regards to  graphics
still the pak does let you play perfect dark so it is a must haveit works like the one for the n
its a little bit bigger that youre not able to put the cover back on the n
i havent tried it yet with perfect dark and any other games that require the expansion pack
its alright thoughsome of the coolest new games coming out are going to require this to play so you better get yourself one now
it will be well worth it
itll soup up some older games that are made to work with it as wellwhen i bought my n i really suffered for games it seem like no one had n the gameseventually i was able to aquire game like doom n  duke nuken ect with less than ordinary graphics in comparison to when i got my memory epansion then came games like donkey kong   perfect dark  zelda majaoras mask well  let say that i really was impress to see the full potential of the n i always wondered why
for the power that n had it was hard to see how ps was so much more popular than n i know n had some really great games and the graphic was superior to ps anyhow if you are a serious gamer the expansion pak is a must have and also you can experience the full potential of the n laterzzzz folks  gamersfollowing the popularity of metal gear solid syphon filter is a game that stands up very well on its own
it has enough that is different that it can be considered a very good game in its own right
sf has a very nice  blend of shootemup and stealth missions that it is never the same thing  over and over
however it does find a few things lacking
the save  system is horrendous
you can only save at points that are very far apart
the checkpoint system which allows you to restart at the last checkpoint  helps this a little but being able to save a checkpoints would have made  this game much better
also some scenarios are very difficult especially  if youve been playing it through and miss one detail
most likely its a  detail that you will miss everytime which can make a few missions very  frustrating
the cut scenes are good and the game control is good
the  wide variety of weapons is very interesting as well
all in all this is a  very good game marred by a very few flawssyphon filter is a good rd person shooter with stealth elements
people have to remember that this was one of the early d games that tried to incorporate stealth elements so it is not as smooth as some of todays games but it is still pretty well done in my opinion
the game has its flaws but was a very fun game and the difficulty was just right
not too easy and the boss fights were pretty sweet and did require multiple attempts on my part
i have the disc version for the ps so i cannot comment on the digital versionthe game is excellent
the plot is good
i mean what can be better than a deadly poison killing people
but the graphics could have been infinitly better
the faces are flat and have hardly any detail and that is in the movie scenes
the graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay
the guns well let me just say it leaves more to be desired
blood is extremly fake looking but there is tons of it
but the actual play itself is very funnow for the sound
music is okay
gun fire sounds are awesome
but the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs
as soon as one is finished speaking the other one cuts in right away
not a very big deal but it wears on after awhilegraphics sound gameplay blood content overall syphon filter is a notch lower than metal gear solid
i meanafter a masterpiece like metal gear solid there is no way you cant compare any espionage games to it
the plot is shaky and its missing that smart dialouge
but its a fun shootemup game
so by all means get iti got this game years ago for christmas i dont play it much but it does deliver what its supposed to a fun casual racing game
the stages and vehicles you unlock in the game are actually pretty cool and have many unique designs to them
the racing never really feels tedious and has the usual fun arcadestyle racing
it never gets old to watch your vw bug shatter to pieces when it flips over or goes over a cliff
there are numerous passageways in the stages which manages to keep things fresh and entertaining
why a  rating
the music is the biggest draw and flaw of the game because its very boring to listen toso just listen to your own music when playing this game and the controls feel a bit glitchy during certain segments of the game
but this game does offer a nice form of entertainment for an afternoon or a few hours of playing the game
if you like out of the ordinary racers beetle adventure racing is for youracing is my favorite genre and this is my favorite racing game
the controls are grab and go with no fine points of control
something about them all being vw bugs makes it appealing instead of boring
driving in the slush and snow here approaches the feel of real driving in snow ie planning turnselectronic arts was one of a small group of third party developers that supported the n with a decent amount of games
one of them beetle adventure racing was exclusive to the system and proved to be one of the best racing games to grace the nintendo  released in  it was an arcade racer with the physics seen in serious racers but poked fun at itself all throughout the gamein bar you pick from a variety of volkswagen beetles and choose from one player modesingle and championship two player moderace only and beetle battle mode two to four players
select from one of six tracks first one only available from the start
and youre off
there are tons of stuff to unlock and the only way to get everything is by playing through the championship mode and beating the four difficulty levels
as you pass each track it becomes available in the other game modes
as you beat the game under each difficulty level you unlock additional versions of beetles
there are number boxes scattered throughout each track
they count as points and need to be collected to earn continues and depending on the difficulty level you need a certain amount
you can earn up to  points collect them all and you unlock a multiplayer track for the beetle battle mode only one track is available from the start lastly there are flower boxes hidden throughout each track
finding them unlocks cheats that you can turn on and off under the options screenthe pros there is so much content packed in this game you get your moneys worth instantly
first off the graphics music sound effects controls and game play are impressive for a racing game on the n
then there is the satisfaction on unlocking the bonus content for you and your friends to enjoy later
this game shows how to give players an incentive to play through the game entirely and have something to show for it
each track is huge and there are multiple surprises and shortcuts that each lap promises you a different experience each time
the different versions of beetles are pretty damn cool and its worth unlocking all of them
the beetle battle mode is fun to play with your friends and is a game within itself the tracks are huge so getting  more players is the best way to go
this game will take you awhile to beat since its quite challenging and that leads intothe consright here
while bar looks and sounds like an arcade racer it uses real car physics so part of the challenge comes to getting used to how it feels and controls
the cars you start out with are slow and rigid while the ones you unlock later on control much better
also the ai
cars start off slow and dont pose a challenge but as you play through each difficulty level they go faster bump into you and rarely make a mistake so dont be surprised if you have to try again to finish in st place
this game is for those who want to put in time to unlock all the goodies here so if you want to pick up and play right away you wont have access to the entire game from the get gobeetle adventure racing is a great racer that while can be quite difficult at times can be fun and is a good choice for those who like the san francisco rush and cruisn games
its worth your money so those of you who like racing games and looking for a game to play with others grab yourself a copythere are six long tracks to race on
ive only seen four coventry cove mount mayhem inferno isle amp sunset sands
the tracks i have yet to play are metro madness amp wicked woods
my friends and i love this racing game
it is well made nice looking amp easy to control
you must beat the individual tracks on championship mode for them to appear on single race amp two player modes
i love the boost boxes the short cuts the camera options amp beetle battle mode
if your looking for a quaility racing game at a now affordable price quotbeetle adventure racingquot for your n is an excellent choiceif you dont have a dreamcast and you love capcoms vs games marvel super heroes vs street fighter for playstation is a decent alternative
there are some notable flaws as the playstation hardware is just not made to run these type of games
for instance the biggest let down is the abscence of tagteaming the playstation does not have enough ram to store more than  characters within one loading session
then theres the animationthere are definetly more than a few frames missing but once you get used to it its ok  however there a few gameplay extras capcom included to keep players interested a quothelperquot character for each match a healing vitality gauge and a combo system that allows you to chain hyper combos together
best of all though the gameplay stays relatively fast with minimal slowdown with the exception of extreme activity
this is another very noticeable improvement over the playstation ports of marvel super heroes and xmen vs street fighter
if nothing else capcom is to be commended for putting up with the playstations limitations to squeeze out the best possible port of this gamewhy is it capcom never makes the hulk green he is always the wrong color on capcom games
thegame is fun animation good just the hulks color is wrong  they either turn him pink or grey
good tagteam work i like the turbo and wolverine looks like the comicbook style not some asian styled version of wolverine
works well on the vibration sound is distorted but otherwise a fun gameive been a big fan of the street fighter series since its outset
and to be quite honest playing marvel super heroes vs street fighter only reminds me of how great the series used to be
sure the game is mildly entertaining but without the true tag team gameplay that the arcade version of the game had it comes off as just another street fighter game with marvel characters
the character roster totals out at  with nine from the street fighter universe and eight from marvel
there are five modes of play including battle versus training hero battle and crossover
battle and versus are your typical one and twoplayer fighting game modes
hero battle is an endurance mode that separates the groups to see which has the stronger stable of fighters
nothing special here
crossover mode however is at least somewhat interesting
you see in the original version of msh vs sf you could pick two fighters whom you could switch between at any time during the fight
this tag team style of fighting was first featured in the arcade version of xmen vs street fighter but couldnt make it into the playstation port due to the technical limitations of the playstation
sadly the tag team aspect of msh vs sf was also excluded for the same reason
sure you can still pick two characters but you can only play as one of them
the second character only comes into play when you execute a team combo or team counter
crossover mode tries to bring the games main selling point home
this mode allows you to pick two characters then the computer uses the same characters you picked
this limits the amount of information the playstation has to handle to two characters instead of four
if you are victorious in this battle the computer swaps one of the characters each of you have for another
this is done so that you arent playing with and against the same two characters each fight
it gives you the tag team experience of the arcade but having to deal with the rotating character thing and having to fight mirror images of yourself is extremely weak
visually msh vs sf looks good
but when you compare it with its arcade counterpart it simply fails
the colors arent nearly as vibrant and the game suffers from quite a bit of slowdown
it still comes across better than the playstation version of xmen vs street fighter though because not nearly as much animation was cut out
this is a major plus since frames of animation not only affect the games appearance but timing and gameplay as wellon the gameplay side street fighter fans will definitely feel the typical street fighter gameplay
but in the end its all a question of how starved you are for another street fighter game
marvel super heroes vs street fighter is all about the tag team mode and with the overall exclusion of this mode marvel super heroes vs street fighter is just another street fighter gameif you think that the quotstar wars episode  racerquot is an effort to cash in on the phantom menace hype you vastly underestimate the  talent at lucasarts
as usual they top expectations and deliver something  far beyond a merchandising tiein
this is a product which pushes the  boundaries of the racing genre
take this featurerich game out of the star  wars universe and you still have a thrilling easilynetworkable ridethe large number of different racers with different qualties is somewhat  pro forma nowadays in the genre but lucasarts takes the idea one step  further
by winning purses you earn money with which to upgrade your  racer
thus there are a number of useful configurations which are only  possible through victorythe number and quality of camera angles is  equally impressive
in fact the cockpit view is downright revolutionary
from this vantage point you feel the mph speeds and its  comparatively harder in this camera to complete tricky courseswhere the  game flags i suppose is in its surprising unfaithfulness to the film
theres no ability to eliminate opposition by quotdirty tricksquot and  you cant disable the quoticrashedbutnowihaveanewracerquot  feature
the pod racers are absolutely indestructible here though they  can be seriously damaged and thats a disappointment
i wouldve liked a  quotharderedgedquot versionperhaps one you could toggle on and  offbut its a small complaint for an otherwise stunning effortthe legend of zelda links awakening is quite the impressive gameit basically takes the gameplay of a link to the past and combines it with the original nes legend of zelda graphicwise especially and creates a fun adventure
you can charge your sword run with the boots pick up bushes and do several other things the same way as you did in a link to the pastnow truth be told a link to the past is easily the superior game in comparison because that game does everything rightlinks awakening is basically a watered down version of the same thing with a choppier framerate less than spectacular graphics significantly worse music and even the size of the land is much much smaller as well
expect less from an exploration standpointhowever for anyone craving a link to the pasts style of gameplay this is a great continuation of that legendary game
im not concerned about the timeline of the series i just know links awakening came out a couple years after a link to the past
considering this is a game boy game however and that we have to be understanding of a few shortcomings and limitations thanks to the technology at the time this game is awesomeyou have many of the same enemies making a return along with many of the familiar items that has made the zelda series such a spectacular source of entertainment
some of the boss fights in links awakening are fairly clever and it seems to be a trend for nintendo or at least it used to be for the boss fights to be downright strange in their game boy incarnations compared to their nes and super nes versionsmy only complaint and the reason im not giving links awakening  stars is because the dungeons have their share of boring moments from time to time especially when it comes to key searching which can be sort of frustrating and uninteresting
plus the dungeons appear sort of bland and uninspiring more often than not
this is a small complaint believe mealso another tiny complaint that doesnt affect the star rating im giving the game is all the mario references
you have goombas bomb ombs chain chomps bloopers cheep cheeps thwomps even those cactuses from super mario bros   this is total overkill
if thats not enough this next part will blow your mind
wart from super mario bros   bowser yoshi and even princess toadstool make appearances in the game
to me i hate when two very different games combine the enemies and pretend its perfectly normal
its not
i like to pretend the zelda and mario worlds are two separate places that should never blend together
just because nintendo created both of these franchises doesnt mean i like this ideaalso some of the enemies are sort of lame
you have pink bird creatures that smile and all the characters seem to have enormous heads
it looks silly
the characters in a link to the past are more sensible and presentableone thing i love is the ability to leap over empty pits which is probably the most underrated and useful item in the game
oh and i love the special triangle item that certain defeated enemies leave behind that increases the strength of your sword for a temporary period of time
its awesomethe game overall is pretty high on the challenge scale
this is mainly due to the fact you have to be careful how you manage your hearts youre not given enough of them compared to a link to the past
some of the enemies such as those shielded creatues from castle  can take forever to locate their weak point and dont even mention the huge pain in the rear end that is the worm fight that first appeared in castle  of a link to the past
you thought he was annoying in that game huh
hes back and more annoying than ever hereoverall pick up a link to the past first then the original legend of zelda for the nes then links awakeningfrom the very first game on the old nintendo i have always enjoyed the zelda games
i was very excited to find out when they released this first gameboy version so i could take the games with me
there are other zelda gameboygba games since which i have yet to play but i do reccomend this one for your librarythe level of play is very in depth way more than the original zeldas but about half the size of the super nes zelda game
the game play and style is also more similar to the super nes versionits a basic tale as link is trapped on an island of mystery
you collect items and beat different minimonsters trying to solve the riddles
there is also an owl you can call for help if you ever get confused on your adventure
there is also an onboard detailed map so there is no additional manuals or guides needed to lug around to play this gamethere actually was a bug in the system which frustrated me and stopped me from playing this game for a while
it involved a warp flute in a later level and i accidently warped onto a statue causing link to be stuck in some pixel overlap mishap
otherwise i really enjoyed this game and as long as you are careful with that whistleyou will toothe following is in reference to the downloadable version of zelda links awakening dx available on nintendo eshop for the dsds systema colorized remake of the original game boy game links awakening marks the beginning of our heros adventures in the world beyond hyrule leaving him stranded on an island filled with mystery and danger
playing this shortly after beating oracle of seasons and oracle of ages and finishing in half the time im tempted to rename it oracle of dreams
released before the oracle games la uses the exact same game engine same graphics same sound same mechanics
this basically laid out the groundwork for every zelda title in game boy colors lifespan
once i was fully equipped for the task i only had the most trouble with the seventh dungeon while i defeated most of the bossesincluding the last oneon my first try
add to that the exclusive color dungeon which rewards the player with a red or blue tunic that boosts hisher offense and defense respectively and beating la is a tropical breezethats not to say i didnt get my kicks though
there was still the whole item trading sequence to keep the player busy
and speaking of items the equipment acquired through your quest includes swag i wish couldve made it to later games like the hookshot the bow and arrow and a magic rod to light those hardtoreach torches
la also makes a bunch of fun references to other nintendo mascots and you even get to walk a flowereating chain chomp
youre also followed by a talking mouse not that talking mouse who shoots photos that can be printed with the game boy printer when hooked up to a compatible system
that should come as no surprise when you consider how technologically advanced the islands inhabitants are already having built numerous telephone booths where you can call a gameprotype hotlineon a final note a common problem among those who played la is the save feature which was fixed in later titles
to clarify you can save by pressing all the face buttons minus the dpad at once but only if you want to quit the game
all in all links awakening is an entertaining little diversion worth checking out at least oncethe product is rated e for everyone containing mild violencei never actually played the game just bought to add to what i already owned  im sure its pretty coolthe graphics are pisspoor but the game play and music rarely get betterbulbasaur is better than any other starter ever and always will be
charmander was cute but not as cool
and squirtle as adorable as he was was way too slowthe madness never stopped in my house once me and my bro  and  now got these into our grubby paws
we did next to no trading but tons of gaming pokemon that are in this title arebulbasaur starmie vulpix vileplume articuno electabuzz ponyta gloom tangela lickitung mewtwo chansey taurus jynx oddish golbat horsea dragonite and magmargame play  asound  boriginality  astory ctrading  afun  areplay  aoverall  b starsi understand that this is an original but there are some things i didnt quite like with this game
in the unknown dungeon i climbed a set of stairs and then ended up in a wall
i couldnt move anywhere except for out of it and back to the previous level
eventually i managed to get up without being forced into the wall
also most of the game is blue if played on the game boy color or advance systems
gameplay music and the story are all extraordinarily great for a game boy titleoverall good purchase
the only issue i had was that the battery had died so i had to send it back but it came back in due timethanks again for this i have been a pokemon fanatic ever since i was a kid
i couldnt ask for more thanks againlet us be honest with ourselves
this is an old game
and yet it rocks most hard say thankee
its also highly addictivethe point of pokemon is simple catch cute little animated talking monsters with magic plastic balls and use them to kick the living daylights out of the cute talking monsters of your enemies
so in truth its a lot like real lifeplus said monsters are fully changeable
you can give them a name teach them special fighting skills and even control how much they grow
this makes them much better than hamsters as pets goplus its got ninjas
im not only talking about a ninja master who uses pokemon to duel you i guess he never learned how to use shuriken or swords or stuff i also mean you can name you pokemon things like mifune or hayabusa or zatoichi or swordsman with an umbrella that probably wont fit
of course you can also name it winkydinkydo if it do please ya
but i digressyes pokemon shows its age among modern video games
but so does pong
and pong is still mildly amusing
but without pong thered be no pokemom
and without pokemon thered be no modern video gamage
and without video games id have to actually face my family friends and problems and learn actual skills
so play pokemon
its better than pong and many other video games
trust me
ive been therethis type of rpg was easy to master because at the start of the game i chose bulbasaur for this type of match
i used him in the first  stages of the game but sometimes the rest of the game
whenever you use a firetype attack on an icewater type it will either say quotits super effectivequot or quotits not very effectivequot otherwise this games a blast to play with  different pokemon characters to choose from
go buy them both
youll need them to link up to goldsilveri have no idea why i still play pokemon from time to time
i was into it before it became popular and i still enjoy the games not the cards  more than  years after the fad breathed its last
yes new titles have been coming out but no one seems to like them very much and they are not changing the game enough to make them worth buyinganyway about the game
you start out as a young boy living with your mother and set out to become the worlds greatest pokemon trainer
when you try to leave town professer oak will give you a starter pokemon the only real difference between this one and yellow is that in yellow you must start with pikachu
once you have picked one you must battle your rival and then you can leave
the rest is obviousthe main reason i still like this game is that it has amazing zeldaesque depth to it
many puzzles and  element types of pokemon
certain types are stronger against others while each type has its weaknesses too
there are a total of  pokemon to be caught
however some only appear in the red version and some only in blue
you must link to the blue version to catch all 
to make this easier some people buy a red and blue and a game link cable so they could complete the game on their ownoverall this game is surprisingly fun and amusing and has a great depth to it which will please many rpg roleplaying game lovers
great game so if you like rpgs or adventure games get this one if you dont already have italways have loved pokemon series and the games
this is definitely my favorite one
worked good but i bought collectible and it had the previous owners name in sharpie on it
i didnt like that but it works greatthis game in my point of view is better than the latest ones mainly because it was new and it was less tedious
the music is repetitive and annoying but that is what the volume controls for
after you beat the elite four it gets less fun but being sort of ocd about getting every last unlockable in the game i dont really mind that much
i think anyone under  would like this gamedont be a fool
play pokemon blue
ok enough of the word puns
this game is awesome
youll ignore the late s graphic shortcomings with your love for pokemon
only recomended for true fansby now every man woman andchild has heard of pokemon and its reputation
the cute little animals you catch in a ball and then force to fight eachother has captured the hearts of kids in america and the wallets of parents
many people hate this game with out even giving it a try
why is that the overly priced merchandice the barbaric card game banned in many elementary schools and pre schools nation wide and terrible tv show and average movies  when looking at all the stuff its easy to forget the concept and enjoyment of the game itselfthe game is an rpg meaning experience building and random battles all in a quest in this case to become the best
you have a rival who you name and the two of you compete through out the entire gamebecause this is on gameboy before color the graphics are dull plain boring
however after getting past that you have a very deep very fun and very addicting game
catching  of the creatures  through either gameshark or pokemon conventions and in these cases it is a little difficult to put the game downoverall the game is worth playing because it is a lot of fun forget the stuff that it spawned and play the first game if you are an rpg fan you will not be disapointedthis is a great classic game
you begin as a new pokemon trainer and soon select your first pokemon
the choices are charmander a fire typesquirtle a water typeor bulbasaur a fire type
interestingly three pokemon you choose from are like rockpaperscissors charmander beats bulbasaur squirtle beats charmander and bulbasaur beats squirtle
soon you rival chooses his pokemonannoyingly its always the one that has the type advantage like if you choose squirtle he will choose charmander
you are then given the task of completing a complete guide of pokemon by catching all of them
in order to beat the game you only need the first  pokemon however there is also a legendary number  mew
you catch pokemon by using one you already have to weaken it then catching it with a pokeball
once you catch a pokemon you may use it to fight others but you can only have up to  pokemon at a time
along the way you will encounter other trainers you may battle
there are regular trainers which you battle only for money fun and experience
however there are also gym leaders which are specialized trainers with stronger pokemon than regular trainers in their area have
there are  in all and once you beat them you may then battle the elite four who are much tougher than gym leaders and you have to fight all of them in succession
you also encounter your rival throughout the game
and he becomes pokemon league champion however once you defeat him you become pokemon league champion
there are also troublemaking team rocket members that you can and sometimes have to battle as well
their boss is also the leader of gym   i have found the gym leaders and team rocket members are actually exceedingly easy if you know what youre doing however the elite  is very tough especially since you have to face them all toghether
there are also legendary pokemon which are considered to be part of the  total and they are very rewarding but challenging to catch
also one cool thing is there is a lot of movesalthough some are kind of stupid and certain pokemon have strengths over others
for example fire takes out grass easily
however you can beat the game just by having stronger pokemon however this is actually harder than using strategy
because it takes a great length of time to level up while a skilled player can quickly catch a pokemon with a type advantage
and to the guy who said he beat this game in a hourif you think this game is easy than you should quit playing videogames altoghether because you obviously are such a great master of everything
also it is impossible to beat the game in a hour
at minimum you have to play it for at least like  hours for your pokemon to be high enough level too
oh wait you must have used a gameshark
wow no wonder you are so good at videogames
but if anyone tells you they beat the game in a hour they either cheated found a big glitch or both
or else their exaggerating
but the only way the game could really beat that easy is if you had a strategy guide
oh this game is so easy i only had to read  books on it to beat it on the first try
get real
if this isnt a challenge nothing is
overall its a great game but there are some annoying things
first off to get all  you must trade with freinds as neither red nor blue has every pokemon but they do combined
most pokemon are in both versions but some are exclusive to either red or blue
also as you level up your pokemon they evolvewhich is really more accurately described as metamorphises and some only evolve by trading them with the same pokemon with another player
another thing is there is only one save slot
finally in the japenese version by getting the first  you get number but in the us version you can only get them through nintendos promotions or by cheating
hmm giving americans a raw deal aye nintendo
you know we buy into your promotions instead of demanding that you make stuff available in the games
in japan gamers would be outraged but you know you can take advantage of us americans
okay go ahead
but despite the fact that it isnt as good as the japenese version or a perfect game pokemon red is still one of my favoritesthe phantom menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film
it features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view a la tomb raider
there are many puzzles within the actions scenes
each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete
the hardest of which is when you first meet quotthe mysterious little boyquot there isnt much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than rd
some of the camera angles are weird
other than that this is a very solid effortthis is a very good game in a way that when you has seen the film you just have to get as the play is just so like the film
the game play is very like the film in many ways as if you split up the film in to sections then this game has a level in each piece of the film
you can even follow the story while playing it
so you dont have to have seen the film to appreciate this game but it will help as you will know what is happening throughout
it is quite a hard game to get used to but once you do it becomes really good from there on and you cant get off of it as it is very addictive as you want to get to the next section of the film
the good thing is that it is not only just an action game like you would think but also very much a strategy one having to figure out where to go next
and to top it off you even play as queen amidala in one level
if you love the film like i do then you will love thisits a great game and really fun but also challenging at time
the game basically follows the movie with some extras here and there
the graphics are not the greatest but that is to be expected since its a playstatin game
but overall i would say its a fun game and replayablei love the three person tag teams the trios run togeather but you can tag the next leader by pushing circle
every character on each team has their own special moves but the teams are all pretty well balanced they all have a fast hero a strong hero and a hero that can flythe grapics are great fast and great
it has a great third person view the camera is behind and above the team you can move to either side you can jump up you can fall down its just a great d gameits soo easy and plays smoth my only complaint is it that it is too fast in some places like in the giant loops i easily lose track of the sonic with him moveing from side to side he will run off a cliff and i wont notice it until he is deadthis title marks sonics first launch on more than one platformthree to be exact
finally a sonic title is available on not only game cube but playstation  and xbox as well
the story dr eggman has devised a new plan to take over the world a newly reincarnated and upgrated metal sonic
thats right sonics old rival from sonic cd is back and ready for all new mayhem
it will take more than one hero to foil eggman this time itll take twelve
but when metal sonic gets enough power to change into the all mighty metal overlord will sonic and his friends be enough to stop him
heroes features a uniqe team based gameplay which includes four teams of three including team sonic sonic tails and knuckles team rose amy big and new comers cream and cheese team chaotix vector espio and charmy and team dark shadow rouge and new comer e omega
to add to the fun each team has their own themed challenge ie
rose is easy sonic is medium dark is hard and chaotix is mission based
also each member has their own affiliation speed flight and power
the game will tell you where you will need to use each characters uniqe skills
overall its a bit challenging for a sonic title but its worth checking outfor me this game is just about as fun as sonic adventure  it will keep you going for a pretty long time if you wanna beat the game with all  storylines
and who doesnt
the controls for the most part are pretty good
although there a times where you can accidentally be swinging a weapon and youll swing yourself right off a cliff and die
that will happen more than once to youmy biggest problem with the game is the camera sometimes
especially when flying the camera will be in a position where you cant see the ground below you so youll have to guess as where to land
and you will guess wrong at least once
and you will dieim not sure but i think the ps version is missing some textures
particularly when flying the shadow below the characters is missing
the shadow is critical for knowing where you will land
without it it just makes things all the more difficult
i think the shadow is present in the gamecube versionbut i love the level designs and the missions
i dont find them overly difficult
theyre a challenge but thats a good thingif youre a sonic fan this is a must havethis game requires the eye to play it you see yourself playing in the game
thought any one who never saw the game but thought it was just another sega game should know it requires the eye to playthis was a great buy for the n
i was inspired to buy this game after seeing the movie scene with the podracing
so all an all you start off as a noob and work your way to the top buying parts for your pod
you can choose from many racers
i give this game the rating that it got for its fun with some frustrating raceswell i love moving this fast in a vgame
i enjoyed playing in the tatooine course and the madeup levels actually seem like real star wars designs unlike rogue squadron  often youre racing through a level and you kind of want to stop playingbut you dont because you want to make the next turn or just love peacefully gliding over the land at that speed
i never got into tuning up the racers maybe theres something lacking there
you arent often right beside the other pod it would have been nice to implement an element of slamming into the other pod to have a fundangerous fight while performing the race if that option were here and was fun it would provide an allnew level of depthexcitement to the game maybe if you had to avoid subulba like the film
i thought i heard there will be a sequel to this game hopefully they will optimize it for the nextgen systems like xbox because they didnt when this was merely ported to sega dreamcast
a sequel would make a cool online game but make they could introduce aotc areas or make a  more tatooine levels
the graphics here are very smudgey i would advise getting the pc or dc version or something but its worth getting as it is so inexpensive nowi am not much of a star wars fan but this game is fun
i found it for  at a used game store
it was worth it
its actually more fun when playing multiplayer and with the steering wheel
i also enjoyed the star wars game shadow of the empirethis is a very fun game possibly the best racing game i have played
i normally find them very dull nascar  anyone
however as a racing game i enjoyed this immenselyhere is the flipside
this game is not near as good as say hydro thunder or need for speed
the best thing about this game is the multiplayer as the single player gets old fastmy reccomendation find a friend rent the game and have funthis is a great personal combat game especially for children
i much prefer tekken but this game is also fun
there is no blood or gore
you chose from characters that star in other nintendo games and each has their own powers
my sons ages   and  love this game
highly recommended for children and adultssupersmash bros  is one of the most fun n games
it has few problems which include not the best graphics and lack of replay value
you will have an exellent time playing though i recomend playing as donkey kong overall its hard not to like
a great game check it outok im really tired so thisll be a short review
its really great in adventure you get to fight lots of assorted people and in vs you get to pick your character to fight against an opponent
i played it with my brother for about  vs mode matches and now im bored with it
it lasts but once you unlock all the secrets and play vs a lot it does get boringone if the top  nintendo  games of all timejust as good as mario  to meit is one of the most popular toothe game is ok when i rented it for  days it got boring at the last day
my brother got jigglypuff using dk
i would rent it before buying it
if you like it buy itthis game is the one my kids play more than any other on their nintendo
they have other games they rent other games but they keep coming back to this onethey like the two player option
they like the challenge  theyre not teens yet
they like the many characters that can be chosen  from different games
they like being able to set their and the opponents  skill levels
they just love this gamei personally wish it were a  little less violent but compared to other games out there this is a  teaparty
so if youre a parent looking for a fun game that will give your  kids hundreds of hours of play and one they wont get tired of buy this  gamewhile melee is by far my favorite brawl and the original come close
one has nostalgic value while one is a good way to continue the series
i love the game whether i am alone or with friendsssb is an original fighter that is always fun to play
it has four unlockable characters one unlockable arena and some other secerets
the only bad part is it is a little to easyeven on very hard
but this game is addicitive
short version graphics  sound  control  fun factor  total okay there is only one bad thing about this game
so now there is meele and  characters
but there is only  in the other
i am best with captin falcon
i am worst at pikachu
please please please do not laugh at my reiview
i am only only the best fighting game ever provides hours of fun for you and you friends
pick your favorite nintendo character and start smashinmy brother and i rented this game numerous times and in the end finally decided to buy it
it is actually quite fun to play with many arenas and many of the famous characters from nintendo
each character basically has their own arena and all of the arenas have their advantages and disadvantages
this game is especially recommended as a gift for a childwhat i love about this game is that you can play with as many computers as you want and they can be against you or if you want to have fun they can be on your team
you can have timed battles or die from losing livespros fun multiplayer action computer feature is greatyou can set computers skill level good training level where you can control many things and add items and make the computer do things to help you train just great
cons certain characters are hard to get like ness less advanced than super smash bros melee controls are sometimes difficultthis is a great gift for anyone who is young especially and for anyone with a nwhat can i say
smash bros is just an awesome game
this is the only game you can get where all of your favorite nintendo characters come together on one screen and battle it out
i recommend calling over  more of your buddies and playing it because this game is nuts when  players go head to headoverall i give mario smash bros  stars
i took off a star because after you obtain the  missing characters the game is basically over
you can still battle with your friends but like most games it starts to get old after a while
i recommend it for ages   a great game for  or more players
when i first played this game it was really fun an challenging
after a while though it gets boring
if you play it alot it gets too easy and its not as fun anymore
if your going to play it you really need at least  playerssuper smash brothers is one of the most unique ideas to hit the gaming world since first person shooters featured deathmatch
for this game it features numerouse memorable nintendo characters such as link mario pikachu samus arron fox mcloud and more in basically a battle royal
the real fun is wehn you gather a group of friends and go into battle
the action is almost always intense
however i do have a few complaints about the game character diversity
on the primary roster three of the  basic characters come from one form or another of the mario universe donkey kong yoshi mario and then luigi as a hidden characeter
so basically after all the hidden charactres are unlocked a royal pain in the  one thrid of the roster comes from the mario universe story mode basically in story mode you go through variouse fights one on one an army of characters tag team handicap so on until you face the master hand and in the end it turns out your character is just a what you thought i was going to spoil the endingso overall this game is great if you have a bunch of friends over however i would rather own the gamecube version and that basically this is a rental for a weekend partygraphics   ridge racer type  is plausible in this area
the car designs are fantastic and the roads are clear and wellcraftedsound   fantastic
not too much of this comes from the cars themselves but the groovy soundtrack great commentator and crashing sounds give this baby a boostvalue   a fun car racing game that lasts a long time and challenges you to do better
but in this genre we have seen games done better and you might want to go off and play them insteadoverall   what can i say
i thought this was a blast
it was fun energetic and speedy
a good instalment to the ridge racer series
the cars were brilliant and the great gran prix is the best part
however ridge racer type  loses points because it is simply too much like gran turismo and you might tire of its sameold routine
still lots of fun and recommendedi purchased this game n summer  and everyone n my family was awestruck by the games intro video musicngame music and graphicsthe only flaw this game has lies n its player mode which has horrible draw backcant barely make out the vehicles both players r usingthis isnt bad i have it and it works great i think this is better then alot of older systems like game boy or super nt but still its a good systemi liked this thing
it played in color but used up batteries fast
the sound isnt all that great too quiet and the screen scratches easilythe system would be a bit better if it had a front lit screenbut it is still awesomeif you are going to get a game for this system i thing you should get zelda and pokemon silver or pokemon goldthanks for readinghave some old gameboy color games around
only have an original gameboyor super gameboythis is great for old games and is duruable afordable and lasts a long time on batteries but if you like gba games too the gameboy advance sp is for you plus is has a backlight
these last a long time and sell for about  on adveragealthough the game boy advance is on the way the original game boy here in colour form is still going strong and is still the only mainstream  handheld consolecompared with the sadlymissed neo geo pocket the  screen is slightly less vibrant and sorely needs a backlight although  adding one would decimate the battery life
technically although the ngp  was bit there doesnt seem to be much difference and in any case its  the quality of the games thats important
this is the game boys strength   it has an enormous evergrowing range of games some of which is  excellent the third wario game for example or rtype dx a faithful  recreation of rtype on a tiny screen
there are some more esoteric  applications too including a camera a sonar really productivity  software and a sequencer as used on alec empires we punk  einheitas a possession its highly desirable  its small stylish  and easy to hold and apart from the fragile battery cover it seems very  solid
its slightly bulkier than the game boy pocket but not  offputtingly so and keenlypriced too
only the high price of the  cartridges could put people off but with several million game boys out  there many of which are presumably restricted to playing tetris and  nothing else there is a thriving secondhand markettoday i saw this game at the store for  bucks and im gonna pick it up since i have a ps
i rented it  times after that the dumb stores got rid of their copies and it was better than the sega saturn version
the graphics didnt have the neat lighting effects but the game was a whole lot more like the pc version
if you have a pc get that version if you have a ps get this version or both
im probably one of the biggest duke fans in my area i have the origional duke d for pc the atomic edtion  the sega saturn versionmy st copy duke manhatten project time to kill land of the babes the duke nukem album all of the duke nukem action figures the duke nukem screen saver pack and now this
as the great duke would say holy st
any way if you are one of the few who dont have a ps yet heres what will happen to this game you know how these losers say the game looks flat
lie
you know how they say the n version looks better
they fogot to tell you the game is cut up no nude chix and the textures are superlow res
but with this vesion when you set up your ps for smooth texture mapping it will make all the d images get smooth edges and the textures will be nice and smooth
since the game is almost all spriteswhich isnt realy a bad thing at all easier to edit on pc every image on screen will look close to a ps game
the reason i dont give this  stars is because you cant edit it like the pc versiondo i really need to say anything else
classic duke nukem game
one of the first i played for the playstation
great fps with decent graphics for its time
and of course the classic duke nukem battle cries always make me laughgood classic imofor anyone who remembers the classic gameplay of the origional super mario bros for your old  bit nintendo entertainment system back in the mid s  rejoice its back
the simple nature of this game makes it so wonderful
its easy for players of all ages and skills to learn very quickly but will  take hours to master
super mario bros is a true video game origional
its simply was the first well executed game of its kind
a side scrolling  adventure game with tasks to be completed that require skill and paitence  not just mindless button mashingthe game boy color version is no  different
it is a perfect translation of this timeless classic so give  it a whirl and fall in love all over againstreet fighter alpha   circa good good balanced d fighter considered a classic to many hardcore d fighting fans lots of modes to unlock and lots of fighters to choose frombad loading times very short but still there graphics might be dated for some peoplewill it fit your taste not over the top like guilty gear xx marvel vs capcom or capcom vs snk old school type game play and not combo heavygame its most assocated too king of fighters  and up fatal fury mark of wolvesadditional notes last game in the street fighter alpha franchise as of  has all fighters from street fighters alpha  and  as well as a few from the old time street fighters like street fighter ii the world tour street fighter alpha is called street fighter zero in japan practicality same game on sega dreamcaststreet fighter alpha  is the best street fighter experience one can have on the original playstation
with well over  characters selectable from the outset classic street fighter gameplay and multiple gameplay modes this is one fighting game worthy of adding to any gamers library
there are a few faults though
some animation problems are present here and there some characters have newly animated moves that dont quite fit with their old set of animation frames the endings could have had more attention paid to them and some of the music is rather bland
also for those of you who may not know the alpha series is supposed to take place between the events of the original street fighter and street fighter   so why are we seeing characters appear that are from the later versions of street fighter  such as deejay fei long t hawk and cammy
even though capcom may need to work on the story a bit its still nice to see all of the street fighters together in one game so im not complaining
even though there have been countless versions of street fighter before it street fighter alpha  proves that you cant beat a classic formula and that the series is still very enjoyable
unless youre completely burnt out on d fighting games i recommend picking up street fighter alpha  for either playstation or dreamcastafter having tested several joysticks this is the one i kept coming back to
ive had a version of this joystick on my system for two years and have yet to find anything better
i dont at all agree with the   editorial review that says its got stiff joystick movement
quite to the  contrary its capable of very subtle movementplus its got lots of  features without being overengineered
i especially like the fact that it  comes with both throttle and rudder control within easy reach
the button  cluster on the stick itself is very sensibly designed with all major  buttons a comfortable distance apart
the hat is cleverly devised as well  being both solid and flexible
most importantly perhaps the software  now at least two years old is very stable and allows you complete control  over each buttonyet there are some people who might not find this  product enjoyable
as others have commented it is a very  righthandcentric design
since there are a host of buttons on the  lefthand side of the base you cant hold the joystick in your left hand  and access those buttons without crossing your hands
also the cluster of  buttons on the joystick itself are designed to fit the right hand
if  youre a righthanded person this design is ergonomically perfect
it  literally fits in the palm of your right hand
but a lefthanded person  has no business whatever buying this productneither does a mac owner
this products usb connectivity though convenient to windows users does  not extend to the mac
thats an unfortunate oversight that one suspects  wouldnt be all that difficult to correctstill if you only intend to  use this thing on a windows machine and if youre right handed youd be  hardpressed to find a better joystickbought this and may flash n controller adapter for pc usb for my laptop and after i installed it and googled how to set it up to work with games on my computer in a couple of minutes i had my new n controller all set up and ready to play games on my pc and ive used it many times and still works as good as the day i got itthis is an old fashioned rpg that may not appeal to those who have only known the likes of final fantasy x ffx and xenosaga
theres not a lot of cutscenes here to help tell the story
no fancy soundtrack
very little voice acting which is a shame considering the voice actor for ghaleon did a wonderful job
theres nothing like an elaborate prologue or ending that you got out of xenosaga
instead gamers will have to depend on lots of reading and playing to make the story unfoldbattles are quite challenging
basically you plan the moves for all of your characters and then turn control over to the battle system
there is also an option to have the battle system fight for you but this mode is not recommendedthis games story is very mild and shallow compared to the other rpgs mentioned above
lssss strong points are definitely fighting and solving puzzles
the story is a lightweight
and definitely not for those looking for something along the lines of quotepicquotok ill be honest here
i read couple reviews and sensing that this game is bit overrated
i sense people who wrote reviews frowning i did finish this game and trust me i had lot of expectation for this game
i havent played the sega cd version of it and actually blamed one of the reviewers from egm who gave  when rest of them gave  or higher
i thought this game deserves at least  i mean look at the animation the title animation is one of the most wellrepresented animated beginning ever and the music was just amazing
i was constantly humming the tune because it was so so so good couldnt help myself from humming it all the time
not only that working design did a fantasticexcellent job on putting in all the extra you are getting with this game its simply amazing im left with no choice but to give credit for that
however after i finish the game i realized that i came to conclusion too soon when i did play only beginning portion of the game mesmerized with beautifully animated movie scenei wasnt inspired or felt that heartache or anything like thati mean characters are adorable and the story is good enough to pull you in however it wasnt just strong enoughso when i read several reviews saying this is the best rpg for ps or anything like that i just couldnt agree with what they were saying of course everyone has right to their own opinion but in my humble opinion i just didnt feel it
it seemed to me that im more attracted to the games with more stronger theme like xenogear and lunar falls into mildthemed game which is of course enjoyablei didnt buy the sequel eternal blue which comes with more extra and whole box for the game looks great however i wasnt inspired enough to purchase eternal blue because it wasnt just there to hook me wasnt just therewell its definitely your call so if the price is reasonable for you and plenty of time then give it a try and see how it goes
its nice to have this game if you are a collector however i wouldnt buy this game if you are picking this one rpg to enjoy in your busy life because there are better rpgs out there for psone in my humble opinionif you are looking for story as the driving force behind an rpg then this is a game you will enjoy
lunar doesnt rely on graphics or amazing sound
it relies on the strength of its storyline
the graphics are the type youd find on an older system which makes sense because this game was originally released on the segacd
this comes with two bonus cds
one is a soundtrack which is nothing to be excited about since the music isnt something youd want to listen to outside of the game but is a nice touch
the other is a making of cd that was rather interesting because you get to see how much the people who made this game were into it and cared about the finished productone of the neat things about this game is all of the voice acting
its such a nice touch and really adds a lot to the game
the female voices can seem rather whiny and too high pitched which could be said of the males at times too but other than that its quite good
also there is a lot of pop culture references and innuendo going on that make you laugh
that may be the best thing about the game
the story is fun
the game is fun
you have fun playing the gameits not new
its not full of eye candy
but the game is very enjoyable and worth the money if you enjoy playing with a good storyi would say that lunar is a worthy rpg and definitely still worth playing if you have an appreciation for the classics
however it may not be worth paying the exorbitant used prices the cheapest i found my copy was  then one of the discs was all scratched up and nonfunctioning and i had to buy new discs for 
yikes
anyway lets see if lunar withstands the test of timegraphics score  well since this version of lunar the playstation version was enhanced from the original it looks really good for an older rpg especially when compared to the playstation ports of final fantasy v and vi
however the graphics are still undeniably dated
on the bright side anime cutscenes are interspersed throughout the game
theres also an anime portrait whenever they speak which adds much needed detail to the characters so you can see what they really look likemusic score  music is decent nothing that would make you buy the soundtrack or anything
there are a couple vocal tracks in the game which are also decent
thankfully lunas singing voice isnt too grating on the ears
i still dont understand though why everyone in the game keeps referring to her amazing singing voice when in my opinion she is only average
well anyway there is limited voice acting in the game during scenes and also a couple battle phrases
the voice acting is pretty good the only voice im glad we dont hear much of is nalls which i imagine would get really annoying its highpitched and squeaky
you dont get to hear much voice acting anyway since its really only present during cutscenescharacters score  characters are likeable and amusing
they do have a decent amount of depth to their personalities so you really come to be attached to them
because the story is so basic the likeable characters are really what keep this game afloat
also some of the npcs are downright hilariousstory score   lunar is certainly no final fantasy vii
the story itself is pretty basic
you start off as alex who sets off on a quest to become a dragonmaster person of status who helps keep things in order and peace
then the story falls into the old pattern of finding x number of things in this case  dragons and saving the world from a powerhungry wouldbe ruler along the way
this is sort of the formula for every rpg in existence but at least other games add in unique and intriguing twists on this old formula to keep things interesting
lunars storyline really has no extra twists or new concepts in it to keep things interesting thus it relies on excellent characterization
i really wish the game had explored certain concepts in more detail such as the why the vile tribe rejected althena ghaleons motivations and althenas personality motivations and origin
however given the age of this game the lack of story depth is forgivable
after all almost all games made during this time period were pretty shallow storywisebattle system score  battles are a basic turnbased system
the usual attack defend magic item commands
as an interesting twist you can move around the battle screen thus making position a part of strategy
the only complaint i have with battles is that there is an ai
command whereby you can have the battle automatically fought for you
i didnt really like this because the option is listed first in the menu which means youll spend some time accidentally hitting it
it wouldve been better if theyd put it at the bottom of the menu
well this isnt really a big deal since the cursor in the game remembers where you last had it and always starts up there
so once you turn on the game and select command the next battle will have the cursor already on command
this was quite convenientgameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
one thing of note is that the menu system was a bit confusing at least for me
i really felt that it was needlessly complicated and i never quite got the hang going through it quickly
its rather annoying having every party member have their own equip menu when you could just have one big equip option and then just select a character from there
i also hated having to physically put equipment in the persons hand before i could equip it
it wouldve been better to just let me select a person and then have every available piece of equipment in inventory for them pop up in a list
shuffling items from nalls inventory to each individual characters inventories is a pain especially if their inventory is full and you have to move items out first
well anyway also of note is the leveling system
bosses are always the same level as alex is but regular enemies all have their own preset levels
this means that you must strike a delicate balance between underleveling and overleveling
i really liked this feature since it kept you from having to level grind all the time
also enemies appear onscreenso there are no random battles which is awesome
overall the gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable especially for an older gameoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
overall this was a decent enjoyable game
even though the story isnt the best i really enjoyed the characters and they kept me playing
is this game worth playing
yes
is this game worth the eventual  i had to spend on it
definitely not
i personally dont think this game is worth more than 
if you can find it for less than that then go for it
if not then you might want to try the gba remake lunar legend though i dont know how good it is since ive never played it
if you dont happen to ever play this game then its no real loss since there are plenty of contemporary rpgs available that are much betteroriginally released back on the sega saturn working designs ports it over to the playstation very nicely
the original great game is here with a few good enhancments
the best one being the anime scenes
very well done and they help move the story along nicely
the games not up to par with the likes of most final fantasy games or many other squareenix rpgs but its definitely a must have for any rpg fangameplay ill start with the battle system
the battles you run into to arent random you can see them on the screen and avoid some of them if you dont want to battle
a lot of them are impossible to avoid though this is needed so you arent just running through the game not fighting
you have the usual attack run and skills during the battles
when you have your character do a physical attack he will move to the enemie hes attacking and stay in that spot while the enemies do their attacks
some of the enemy attacks will move your character a spot or two back
this way theres some strategy involved on the placement of your character
each enemy has a certain amount of spots it can move so if you want to stay away from some of them dont attack an enemy thats surrounded by other enemies because they all will be in attacking range and they will all get a good attack in on you
a lot of the times i didnt really worry about this but its a little added strategy to the battles other than the usual fighting
one of the more useful ways of taking advantage of this though is to defend on one turn let the enemies move close to you and then hack and slash away
this way you dont move in without getting an attack on your enemy and letting them attack you
be smart and you can avoid a hit here and there
the battles are turn based by the way none of that meter stuff seen in most final fantasy games
really either way is good to methe way skills are learned in this game is just your basic learn a skill at a certain level system
example learn a small healing spell at level  theres no custom way of learning your attacks
you have to realize that this came out in the early s where there was only a game here and there had a deep system to go along with it
it gets the job done but its not as advanced as some rpgers would like
i didnt mind though
dont let this turn you away from the game
you will miss out on a memorable experience if you dothe areas in this game are big good looking and fun to work your way through
your usual rpg stuff is here
caves villages castles etc
they offer up a good challenge too which you cant say about a lot of rpgs out there
its not impossible by any means but its not easy either
good challenge
the world you travel through is well designed and pretty big
as a whole you wont find a bad or boring level in this game
its an expansive rpg world with many fun challenges along the waythe characters are very good
they are pretty artistic
a couple basic looking ones but overall they have my pick as some of the better ones in an rpg ever
the character development is not too bad either
its not the best but you should soon care for each character atleast a little
especially the main ones like alex and lunai like the story a lot
you wont find a deep complex plot
you get a straightfoward hero defeating the villian type of story
theres a good surprise here and there but not many
you will grow to hate the villians and the story while not being too complex pulls you in and doesnt let you go until you finish the game
i guarantee you will enjoy iti take off the  because the battle system can get repetitive near the end of the game
the boss battles have you basically using the same spell per character each turn hoping you have enough left to finish him off
this makes the usual fun boss fights a little less fun than normal
atleast theyre challenging though since they always have the same level as your characters
i didnt take off any more for the semibasic storyline and not so deep skill learning system because of the time it came out
thats something you have to realize when playing this game it was one of the best for its timereplay value as with a lot of rpgs its not very good
i and many will play through again for the positives i mentioned above but theres really no incentive to come back and play through the  hour quest again
only for the hardcore rpger i guessmusic overall some very nice tunes scattered through out the game
its not mind blowing like some of the square soundtracks but its a good one
you will enjoy it for the most part i know i didgraphics im basing it on the year it came out
the levelsand battle graphics look stunning
with that said though the characters suffered and look pretty bland
thats the reason for the  point off
not a major problem at all though
especially when you play this one for the gameplay like all rpgsoverallnot an average for its time it offered a fun battle system great graphics a good story and clever fun level design
one of the best games in the genre at the time and rightfully so
it has taken a slight hit over the years but overall it has stood the test of time pretty well
rpg fans would be wise to not miss out on this
with the special package one you get tons of extra goodies well worth the money although its only possible to find it on sites like ebay
if you find it go for it
you will not be disappointed in the slightest at this classic rpgi recommend lunar  as well
it improves upon this game in almost every waythere are very few video games from over  years ago that still go strong in the second decade of the st century
myst is one of them
i remember playing this game back in  and getting my but whipped with the puzzles
i recently replayed it and found myself in awe of how well constructed it is
of course graphics have advanced since  but myst shows game developers how puzzles should really workunlike too many games today myst brilliantly evokes a sense of wonder and mystery
when you start the game youre just thrown into a new world with no explanation
you are left to explore and discover
there is a story with shocking twists but the story depends upon your involvement and choices not simply handed to youthe puzzles require a lot of time and thought
if you dont like puzzles and thinking dont play this game
if you like challenges myst will challenge you
the puzzles often require you to make connections between separate pieces of information or view your environment in a new way
some are frustrating and i did need to look at a hint guide a few times particularly for the mechanical age elevator but they all do have a logicunlike other reviewers i found the one area myst doesnt hold up well is in building an immersive environment
myst as a world doesnt have a logic
theres a spaceship a boat a clock tower etc just sitting on the island
it seems more like a video game hub than an actual world
i think myst makes up for its lack of internal logic by leaving so much mysterious and presenting you with such intricate puzzles that you want to explore the worldoverall myst was a historic computer game back in  and is still worth playing  years later
from the early s i personally preferred presto studios journeyman project which also had a compelling pointandclick adventure and featured prerendered d environments
however until that game gets rereleased myst is easily the best pointandclick adventure readily out therenote the game is also available on iphone ipad nintendo ds so theres no excuse not to try it outquotmystquot is the one that started it all
quotmystquot is the game by which all other roleplaying games are measured
no one had any idea when the game first came out in  that it would eventually become the bestselling computer game of all timerand and robyn miller the brothers who created the wildly successful game hit upon a winning idea
place someone into an unknown world where the clues he or she uncovers reveals the story
and one of the biggest perks of all  you cant diequotmystquot starts off by dumping you on a dock overlooking a vast ocean
you can hear water lapping along the dock and a wind makes the hair on your neck stand up
and from there it only gets more interesting  you discover books that can link you to other worlds like this one more commonly called ages you encounter all sorts of devices that even though they dont appear to do much are all part of the underlying thread tying the game together and just by wandering around you immerse yourself in the world that is quotmystquotoccasionally i meet people who are baffled at the success of quotmystquot  they dont understand how a game where you just walk around and solve stuff can be so appealing
there is little or no character interaction they say
ive noticed that a lot of these same people are those who like those quotshootem up and splatter their guts all over the wallquot type of gamers
the reason quotmystquot has been so successful is because it so pure  you dont have to worry about dying you use your head to get your way through things and each new age you encounter is just bursting with intriguing things to discover
that and each world is beautiful
not as jawdropping as quotrivenquot and not nearly as mesmerizing as quotmyst iii exilequot but quotmystquot has a subtle yet majestic beauty that makes it stand apart from other gamesif you have never played a computer game before give quotmystquot a try
you will be surprised at how addictive it can become
did i mention that there is no possible way in which you can be killed
seriously
how many games today offer that
theres a reason why it has been such a hit millions and millions of people cant be wrongthe hit s game myst set off the immensely popular myst series as well as myst spinoff computer games
the game is fantasybased puzzle game incorporating unique locations and mechanical motifs
while a bit outdated in some ways the game is intriguing and fun and well worth buyingplotyou play a character who finds themselves stranded on a tiny island
while exploring you begin to discover the dark past of the island which you are visiting
using ingenious linking books you can access other islands and unravel the truth behind the lonely mysterious worldsenvironmentthe environments while not necessarily beautiful are well done
there are a total of five islands all with different motifs
these islands or ages includea world with halfsunken boats and flooded tunnelsan age with a spinning buildinga cyprus forest with a network of treehousesan odd outofthis world island with a gigantic tunnelthe environments can be rather dark at times
in general there is little character interaction leaving the player dealing mostly with puzzles and exploringmusic drifts in and out of the game with some locations dominated by the sound of wind while others have music in the background
the music alternates between very dark to dark tinged
while the game does not have catchy tunes it suits the game quite well as background musiccharactersthere are few characters and interaction is limited
there is a selection of journals in a library which provide interesting reading and histories of the various islandspuzzlesthis game is a puzzle game
the puzzles are generally mechanical in nature
the puzzle solutions can be illusive but puzzles are generally not incredibly tedious
once you have solved puzzles once they can generally be solved again quickly allowing you to replay the game without worrying about coming to mounds of impossible puzzles yet againif you enjoy puzzles that involve common sense more than mathematics and like interesting and unique worlds you will enjoy myst
the game has decent replay value
the game is rather old and an updated edition called real myst is available on amazon
however for a genuine piece of gaming history the original is the way to gothis game is a good game depending on your personality
if you like to drive around in a car in  new  york city or shooting up alien invadersin other words you like games with a lot of action then this is probably not the game for you
there is no action or enemies
myst is more of exploring and puzzle solving
it requires quite a bit of patience to play
if your looking for an adventurepuzzle game then you should get myst
in my opinion it is a great game
one of the best i have ever playedriven is a worthy followup to myst and still must rate as one of the alltime great adventure gamesthose familiar with the myst series will know some of what to expect lush visuals although in static form no  rendering a detailed storyline fiendishly clever puzzles much mysterious machinery and a need to respond to and interact with the environment in order to solve the gamethere are some important differences to the myst series
first of all rather than exploring a number of different worlds or ages in riven you explore one albeit large world comprised of five islands
there are links to two other ages but these are very sketchily developed and there is not much to explore here
there are some differences between the islands but the radically different tones of the ages in myst or myst iii is missingthis has its advantages and disadvantages
the world you explore is much larger and you can progress over virtually the whole world without needing to solve many puzzles allowing even a casual player a good glimpse at the world of rivenhowever it also means that the puzzles are less contained and linear than in the other myst games
as well as a number of smaller puzzles there are two major puzzles to be solved clues for which are scattered throughout the islands
even with the smaller puzzles the control to open a vital door might be located a long distance away or only accessible via a very circuitous route
this can add another degree of complexity to the puzzles
having said that there is a degree of logic to most of the controls which are based on the culture and lifestyle of the inhabitants of riven
the puzzles generally also operate in a logical manner and relate well to the entire environment of the gamethere is little action for the punchemup enthusiasts  but theyre unlikely to be reading the review anywayin summary a fantastic game that will engross you for hours  i just wish more alternative ages could have been includedi havnt played myst yet but i have completed this one
what an immersive game this is
great graphics great sound great features to play with and great fantasy world
riven might only be a small world but its well worth the visit
you even get to see some alien creatures here and there
i give this  stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers
it took me  months in all without hints i might add
if you like fantasy puzzles and exploration
get it
its worth it just for the graphics aloneonce again you put your hand to the book and enter another worldthis time riven in an effort to find the wife of your host
yes its still basically a slide show and yes there really arent any other people to  interact with but its still beautifully drawn with gorgeous environments  to explore and atmospheric music to soothe yougiven the success of myst a sequel was inevitable
riven is both a sequel in spirit and in its story
the game takes place just after myst and takes the player to another age where you meet atrus father and wife amongst others
as in myst the story is told through journal entries puzzles and a few cinematic scenes
riven does develop the story more than myst did with more cinematic cutscenes and longer books
overall i think this is a great addition and the actor who plays ghen atrus father is actually quite goodlike myst riven is a challenging puzzle game
overall the game isnt quite as challenging as myst because the relationship between the puzzles and solutions arent as attenuated
however there are a few cases where i felt like i knew what information i needed but didnt know where to find it
this is particularly problematic in a pointandclick game with limited movement
i was particularly frustrated with learning the riven numbers  i knew i needed to in order to learn a code but couldnt figure out where to get the translation
also there is one thing in the very last puzzle which is a real pain  something impossible to see that needs to be movedthe graphics in riven look beautiful even  years later
the riven environment is gorgeous and has some really startling landscape
however the geography in riven is supposedly  times larger than mysts but because most of the game occurs within a single age is actually does feel a bit smaller
moreover i felt like there were more corridors or areas that had no function other than to serve as space between two other areas
myst by contrast was extremely compact
im not sure which is better but id guess that in terms of puzzle content the two games were about equal
i would have preferred a bit more environment and fewer corridorsultimately riven is a worthy sequel to myst and follows its predecessor closely
if you like myst youll probably love riven
if not riven probably doesnt offer anything new to change your mind
recommendedthis game is great
its not as good as myst but its still impressive
this games backs right up to myst so if you hannt played myst you will have no idea on whats going on
somthing thats better the myst the grapics
i dont know how good they are on pc because ive got the playstation virsion but the graphics on that are awsome
my opinion on buying it or renting it is you should buy it if youve played and beaten myst
but bloskbuster donent carry this gamethis game actually stands up to the test of time as opposed to myst part ones antiquated technology and ancient graphicsunfortunately i never got to play these games when they came first came out and being spoiled with all the improvements in the visual department over the years had to start with riven instead of myst
the game is probally the largest and most meticulous effort of all  games simply for being a little larger and a little more designed then many of the future underdeveloped but beautiful lands myst would take us toobviously this game is for a certain type of quiet gamer who prefers exploration and figuring out how to work a puzzle out over visceral button mashing actionif those attributes do intriuge you as a gamer however there is no better place and example to start with then the legendary myst seriesriven is a worthy sequel to myst and takes the myst quotmystiquequot to another level with five new worlds and an expanded story line
the brilliantly realized environments and moodsetting soundtrack draw you in  immediately and keep you there until the sun comes up
riven is not for  gamers with short attention spanssimply navigating and charting the  accessible areas of the age of riven take patience and time and solving  what i would characterize as the two major puzzles requires all of the  intelligence and tenacity one can muster
as some reviewers have said  having played myst first is helpful background to have but this is not  because the puzzles of riven are similar to those of myst but because myst  will acquaint you with how the creators conceive puzzles and heighten your  sensitivity to factors in the environment that bear noting and  investigating
i gave riven  stars rather than  for two reasons a  one of the major puzzles is soundbased and after some long and  frustrating efforts at solving it on my own i obtained some hints on the  internet and found that the solution required matching up particular sounds  from the game that in fact simply did not match up at least not in the  version that i bought and b one other crucial clue is a tiny blurry  image
in these respects i felt that the creators did not play fair
two  other pointsi contrary to what some have said it is indeed possible to  lose this game and meet an untimely end so be careful out there and ii  recognize that the cdrom version is on  discs which need to be changed  every time you travel from one world to anotherif you have a dvdrom  player by all means spring for the dvd version which consists of one  discafter the success of the original myst game changed the landscape of computer gaming its widelyawaited sequel created an even more engaging atmosphere
the only trouble
it is difficult to the point of giving up on far too many occasionsbasically riven follows the same pointandclick philosophy as its predecessor
you go around solving logic puzzles with the goal of saving catherine wife of agewriter atrus from the murderous gehnin terms of overall imagination and scope riven is dare i say easily the best of the myst bunch
the puzzles are more engaging than myst and the game just has an epic feel to it
every single different island creature or pathway one encounters in the game leads to an amazing discovery
at least at the outset it is almost impossible to not get swept away by the atmosphere and become completely immersed in the gameplaythe problem
here it is after playing all the myst games through as a teenager when they first came out i decided to tackle them all again and review them on amazon this time
myst was a grand experience and so was rivenuntil you actually have to begin solving the the mystery of the golden domes which leads in turn to the infuriating dotmatrix puzzle
the difficulty level gets to the point where one most devote countless hours and probably even some sleepless nights
to wrapping ones brain around the mysteries
unless you are fully  committed to the game you will waver at this pointan easy fix for the difficulty problem would have been having the islands be a bit more accessible
whereas in myst the action took place in relatively enclosed spaces riven sprawls out over and incredibly large environment
thus a discovery on one island is prompted not only by the thought of i know what this does now but also how the heck do i get back there
not having to spend valuable time traipsing across the entire game would have ratcheted up the experience quite a bit instead of dragging it down considerablyfinally it is sad that despite its shortcomings this game has not received a stable release on current software platforms
despite downgrading my quicktime and trying any number of compatibility fixes riven would not run on windows  without freezing up approximately every  minutes of gameplay
im not letting this issue affect my review of the actually gameplay itself but just be warned that getting the game to work at all will be an outandout struggleoverall riven is still a landmark pc that i truly hope gets an update for modern technology
it would be a shame to see such a fine game be relegated to the dustbin of history based only on outdated technologyape escape is on one of the sleekest action games on playstation which is in theory a pretty lowpower console
the graphics despite being  rather choppy are colorful and welltextured
most of all the game has a  high frame rate with no noticeable slowdown to speak of which allows  things to move quickly and smoothly
the control scheme is intuitive  despite being complex at the outset
fortunately no action you can take  requires pressing more than one button
right shoulder buttons are jumping  left shoulder buttons center camera and bring you into a firstperson  lookaround mode digital dpad moves the camera left and right sticks move  the character and the selected tool respectively which the x triangle  circle and square buttons select your tool
also the controls are quite  tight which will save you much frustration from falling over cliffs and  such
the camera is one of the best ive ever seen
it rarely swings around  the character although at times i did experience a few odd glitchy  perspectives such as from behind walls and from under floors
fortunately  the camera is springloaded to autocenter on the characterthe level  selection is the usual cliche pretty meadowsvolcanoesrobotic factory  fare but in order to fulfill your quota of monkeys capturing  anachronistic and very agile monkeys is the point of the game you will  have to navigate your surroundings in all of the three dimensions and  utilize all of your equipment monkeys are caught with a net enemies are  disposed of with a quotforce clubquot you can glide with a hand copter  to reach higher ground or swim via help of a motorized sub which is part  of the appeal
the levels are large and complexthe game is relatively  easy but the frantic excitement it creates will make you play it over and  over againape escape consists of more than  d levels based on a variety of time zones
to clear a level spike played by you must capture a set number of monkeys
after filling that quota you must access the next level
reaching the monkeys will require you to jump sneak swim climb and fly through a variety of situations
to help you on your way you are given a net and a lightsaber type stun club
throughout the course of the game spike will collect six additional gadgets
in addition to providing the means of completing future levels returning to previous levels with new gadgets will allow spike to capture any monkeys he left behind
in addition to monkeys each level has tokens to collect
collecting enough tokens will open minigames
this game gets addicting pretty fastif youre trying to build up a classic ps collection make sure to include this wonderful lil platformer
it may not be the quality of crash bandicoot but then again not many games live up to that seriesi saw this game and it looked amusing so i got it
i soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game i had played in the past
its really fun and you get hooked on it
plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus
the problem was the camera which could really be annoying at some times and the challenge
heres my tip if youre an advanced gamer  or older rent this game but do not buy
most  year olds and even some  year old have found this game easy
but if youre younger than that youll go ape over this gameunfortunately the greatest hits edition freezes during a certain cutscene and is unplayable
fun and hilarious game overall just get the original versionthe game is cool but a lot of the levels are really dark
a lot easier to play with cheats
im on level  and there are still more to go
its two players which is the only reason its good
otherwise zero hour is way betterduke nukem  isnt a bad game
in fact it could be one of the best on n
i dont know
i havent played much shooters on n
but i do own this and chaotic dm with  freinds and a bot couldnt get better
quake  and doom  cant offer this much fun
this is essentially a port of the pc game but with new levels and addons to existing levels
i recomend this gamethis is the funnest game i have ever played
if your looking for a game with good graphics this isnt for you though
but if your down with old school hardcore action then you need to buy thisi remember getting this game and being blown away
the aliens the gore the raunchy bad  hero duke nukemawesomeofcourse now we have call of duty battlefield dead space etc but if you are wanting a vintage gem pick up this game
i stayed up countless nights with friends playing through the game in coop mode and facing off with each other in team death match
solo player itself was quite challenging and still is
i have always felt this game sort of set the stage for fps along with perfect dark and golden eyebad points  it can be irritating because it is so challenging
also there are a lot of extremely dark areas of maps that make it hard to see maybe even impossible
at the time of its release i thought the graphics were great but now that i play through it again they are kind of disappointing
i mean still decent for the time but considering similar games that were on the they could have done a bit bettergood points weapons are awesome
smgs plasma canon that evaporates everything in its path pipe bombs shrink ray allowing you to crush your enemy expand ray that enlarges them until they explodeha just coolness
combat boosts were always a neat item that i wish had been in more games
you can also aquire a jetpack vitamin x holoduke to confuse enemies dumdum explosive pistol rounds and many other helpful itemsfairly smart enemies and a wide variety of aliens
challenging bosses as wella lot of objectives on each map
rescue the hidden babes find keycards solve lock puzzles even crush toilets and drink the water to regain health
and you get a good number of maps tooi would suggest picking this game up you get a lot of play time out of it
its a good blast from the past for us who miss the n on occassionthis is one of the best shoot em ups on the  this game is pretty much the same as the pc version but with more levels extended levels  or added bits and peices and a few new toysit pretty much feels just like the pc version but its a little darker on the graphics
you will have to run trough the game control settings to find the right feel for you if youre like me and where used to using the keyboardmost of the cool stuff is still there from the pc game
there is the same sayings some new ones same levels etc whats missing is the adult content the pc had packed into it
so some things are different like there is no strippers dancing around and you cant go up and press open to throw them money and the posters are different etc infact the second levels strip club has been completly re decorated into an outdoor loading dock with trucks
thats a bit of a disapointment that that stuff was replaced to tone it downthere is some new toys to play with but overall there isnt enough weaopens
there is a hand gun shot gun machine gun plasma shooter grenade thrower shrinkin ray enlarging ray new weopen
enlrage youre enemy till the explode
and a few other ones
but compared to something like goldeneye there feels like harldy any guns to choose fromi used to love to use cheats on the pc version and with this  version there are a couple of cheats but theres none to walk through walls which i do miss
its pretty hard to stay alive so turn the god mode on and enjoy iti cant believe how many gamers are hailing this game as the best final fantasy ever i mean i know everyone has a different opinion and all but i mean come on hasnt any of you played final fantasy 
that game pretty much did everything this game did only so much better
where do i begincharacters cloudan emo whiny brat that annoyed me to know end
i wish there was a shut up spell in this game to make him stop crying
barrethow many black stereotypes can we fit into a single character
lametifehey she has a killer body not much personality but hey sex sells right
yuffiewhat was here purpose again
aerishey someone with potential too bad she died before we could start to care
cait sith although i shouldnt have to explain why this character is lame ill do it anywayshes a cat that rides on a stuffed animal robotpause for laughtera cat that rides on a robotic stuffed animal
then there is vincent basically there for five minutes of an already convoluted story line that is other than that piece of the story he is in is an intirely optional character and can be put in the of no real importance folder
oh and i almost forgot cid yup his character was so awesome that i almost for got to mention him
and then finaly red  another character that had potential but when your surrounded by a bunch of numbskulls in a convoluted story line you stop caring about one character that has potentialthen there is the main bad guy sepheroth many people say he is the best bad guy ever
sepheroth is so bad to the bone man he rulz
he was equally as much of a whiny emo brat like cloud he wanted to destroy the world cause he missed mommy and a whole lot of other silly plot twists to make the storyline seem more advanced and mature
and i say this whoile heartedlyif you get defeated by a group of an emo whiner  a woman who has no real point in life other than to be said emos love object and to sell units do to sex appeal and  a cat riding a robotic stuffed animal you are a not bad to the bone and b disqualified from the greatest villain of all time list
sorrystory lineconvoluted
a lot of unnessisary plot twists although it was servicable and interesting at points
it would have helped to add characters withcharacter into the mix
also there was several completely unncessary scenes in it where i thought totally didnt add a single thing to the game the cloud in the bath tub with the dude or the cross dressing game
plus the ending reeked of dont know what to do wiht the story line so lets just say this happensgameplay once again servicable but nothing revolutionary or even evolutionary
as a matter of fact i think this game takes a step backwords instead of forwards
 had the job system
 had the unique leveling system
 had not only unique skills per character but had awesome gameplay sequences such as the opera house the stategic scens where you control  parties to more and block advancing troops etc etc
what did  do
had cool summon animations that got old after the second view and could not be skippedpassgraphics
they were horrible
yes even for that time
save for the stunning fmv sequences and the cool summon scenes that got old way too quick there was nothing pretty about this game
dull grey and bland environments abound
characters that made lego characters look realistic and just an overall boring and grimmy disgusting lifelesslook to the whole projectsighwhere do you find best ff ever from this game
its not even close to the top  was it fun
yes
did it make rpgs popular in the states
yes although i prefer some of the other games that came out on the ps at the time such as wild arms suikodin and revelations persona more entertaining
but the best
not even close
although i have to say it is better than i had heard about the ff series but never paid too much attention to it mainly because i didnt have a ps fast foward to a couple of years and i was trying to get some games for my ps library i fell upon ffx let me just say i was blown away and i think the ff bug bit me hard i bought x and told everyone i got it for my sis
then talking with other ff fantics they told me about vii
i havent finished it yet that is why i gave it a  star review but it is awesome so far
love the scene where cloud has the motorcycle
despite the age of this game it really does stand the test of time and personally i agree with belledandy about doing a remake id probably be the first person to buy it too
for people considering buying this game believe me when i say it is worth every penny you spend on it if you are a fan of rpgs or of games on the whole its great i really dont care if people call it the best game ever or not all i know is that since i have started playing it i cant put it down and my family and friends do feel neglectedthe battle system could of been a lot better
number one theres too many battles in the first place
you take three steps you get in a battle
you walk two steps to get somewhere and you end up in a battle
you take one step most likely youll get in a battle
also let me point out that once youre in a battle you cant move around
and plus summoning whatever it is youre trying to summon like thunder or something you have to press eighty buttons just to summon it at once
its hard to do
however i think that the game was engaging and never let ya go
it was entertaining and it is undoubtedly worth the twenty bucksbutthe battle system could of been a lot better im sorryi love final fantasy games and they never fail to be fun
this game was a lot of fun
i wouldnt say i love it though because there are ways it could have been better
it definitly was an awesome game especially for such an old onethis game is ok but not near as good as ff
ff has better graphics
the characters look like dolls
the cut scenes have good graphics
if you want this game get it for a cheap price or get ff
if your a big final fantasy buy it but if not i dont think you should get it
i think you should buy ff insteadwhile being an excellent rpg it is not up to the caliber of the originals especially iiiusvi
there is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome fmv
where this game really lacks is in its replay value
its a onetimer
i dont think i could bear to go though the whole thing again
there were too many things that were too tedious in the game namely the materia and chocobo development which they drastically improve with ix
developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff ie
master materia just isnt worth it
as for the chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest
overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets but only really worth playing oncethe only only only only only only thing that i didnt like about final fantasy vii was the materia system
it takes an eternity to master all of the materia
other than that this is the greatest game everfinal fantasy  is another excellent game made by squaresoft
the same company that made bushido blade and saga frontier
it was the reason many  people bought the playstations they own and defiantly the one of the best  during the year it came outas far as game play goes its excellent
the  controls are standard to rpgs
combat basically is turn based which i  highly prefer with a little bar that goes up as it gets closer to your  turn
it has several very fun minigames
also there are many characters  who show an actually personality during the game
there are several  vehicles you get as the game goes by to help you with your long trips  across the large worldas far as plot its well done
plot being the  most important part to an rpg its good to see this game was strongest in  this area
even though i wont reveal much on the plot i will tell you it  surprises you many times
like most rpgs you dont get a lot of control  over the plot but thats fine its still a good game
the plot doesnt  start to shake and get lost around the end it keeps you stuck form  beginning to finishthe graphics are wonderful for their time
however  newer games like final fantasy  parasite eve and metal gear solid are  defiantly better
often the characters seem a bit boxy in it
the  backgrounds almost always look beautiful thoughand finally as far as  length of time it can stay interesting is a long time
final fantasy  is  not a game you well beat in four or five games
you well defiantly have to  buy this game to beat it
its well worth the price thoughoverall this  game is good
i am one of those selfimportant jerks who things ff was the  best though but it did come close
it is defiantly worth playingthe story and plot are interesting enough to keep a gamer entertained
gameplay is entertaining but also challengingi cannot give the game five stars though
i had already played the likes of ffx and xenosaga prior to playing this game
their superior visuals and certainly the inclusion of voiceacting made the experience more enjoyable than ff
in other words i would have enjoyed ff if i had experienced the game prior to playing more recent rpgswhile this game may not be the very best rpg in my opinion i must give this game credit for being able to finally throw the rpg genre into the mainstream for two gaming generations
this game was the first game in the series to feature stunning fmv with d character models in prerendered backgrounds which was a major step up for the rpg world considering that any rpg released before this one either only had d models during battle sequences or none at all but of course graphics are not everything
gameplay will always matter much more than the graphics in any game it is the sole reason games are played to enjoy the game itself with graphics just being an added bonus to the already great game itselfthis game still maintains the fastpaced atb system where the characters must react in a timely manner to defeat the enemies or bosses that will cross paths with the characters controlled in the battles
one of the greatest highlights of this game is that this is the first game in the series to have a science fiction based plot otherwise unseen in earlier titles and very few other rpgs at the timethis game is also the first in the series to add character peripherals such as materia
materia can be equipped and can be made more powerful each time it is usedoverall i would highly recommend this title to advanced and beginners alike as this game has a straightforward level up system with a neat addition of the character peripheral i have mentioned above
this should last one a good  hours depending on whether one decides to undertake the various sidequests offered in the game or notthis game was a bit of a let down compared to its predacessor final fantasy vi us iii
its still a good game the second best one from the three released for ps ix is the best of the playstation era
the dark realism pioneered by this game made for a good story and was much more well done than final fantasy viii
the addition of fmv for the first time was also a nice new element
however the gameplay and story still fall short of final fantasy vi and ix
worth a play especially since the price is good nowi must say this game is greati have written another review for this game but i didnt feel it was completey correctone thing was it is confusing and i cant say its for everyone i say this because if you dont like ff and you havent tried ff before dont start herethe game is funbut not good graphics and its confusingyu may not like this gamei warn youlet me just break this game down step by stepstorylinevery good and very easy to follow
i like how it separates between shinra and sephiroth before the first disk is even half way over
very addicting and very fun to follow and it still always gets me going without ever getting oldgraphics years ago these graphics were considered best of all time years later we ask ourselves what the heck is this crap
one thing that never gets old is the fact that these poorly drawn d characters are unequally proportioned
huge hands twig arms
no mouths or noses and yet they have huge hair
in  all i can think of is to thank whoever came up with real d graphicscharacterseach has their own special personality that i love
barrett being my favorite
his attitude and swearing habits are possibly the funniest thing in the game
i usually keep him in my party just for that reason
cloud is  stubborn but not as funny
tifas got that hair thing goinglike i just mentioned
aeris is kind of boring and dies too early in the game to get to know her a lot more than you do
red xiihes a dog
cid another character who cant control his mouth
yuffiesome ninja girl that really serves no more meaning than a side quest
vincent amazing character who can morph into creatures
and cait sithwait a minute hes a toy
oobosseseach have their own difficulty which i likesome require you to actually have trained or else face a brutal whipping
final  bosses each have their own twang to them
especially sephiroth who is fun to go up against time and time again
i mean cmon who doesnt like a cool character with a wing for an arm
music kind of gets to you though and his  minute super nova attack gets really frustrating when he does it about  timesi kind of wish there were more than  allamerican creature bosses thoughmagicthe whole materia thing is fun except for the fact that it ruins your statslimit breakseasy to use hard to obtainplayabilityveryhighive replayed this game time after time again without getting bored
i try new strategies and new characters each time and try to level up differently than i did beforethis is definetly one of the greatest games ever made but remember its gotten quite old now and for diehard rpg fans this game is not that greatall clouds giant sword jokes aside this game has one of the most loyal fanbase in gamingis it worthy of all the fanfarewell i dont thing its worthy of rabid fanboyism and a  dollor price range but it is a damn good gamedispensing with my usual the good the bad and the meh
format
lets do a rundown by detailgraphicsit is a real mixed bagthe character models out of battle look ridiculous out of battle and pretty nice in battlethe backgrounds range to beautifully picturesque to lets see how much brown we can get away with
the cutscenes are pretty epic
spoiler alertthe high points to me were the opening the shinra building getting blown up and part of midgar callapsing onto a section of the slums
okay you can look nowthe gameplayno real suprises really aside from it including an active time battle systemminigamesthey are actually pretty neat and they give you lots of incentive to do them
maybe a little too much incentive actually seeing how one of them is the only place to get omnislash
my favorite being the chocobo farming and racingthe storywell pretty good but i think ff vi and iv did it better tbhmost of the game is traveling around the world chasing the big bad while avoiding or fighting the other big bad shrinra and unraveling the pastoh and theres this really weird scene in wallmarketthe musicheres where the game really shines giving us some of the most memorable tunes in video gamesjust listen to one winged angel now that is what death sounds like
albeit kinda a jaws theme ripoffcosmo canyons theme is amazingthe shinra theme stands out to me tomusic is subjective though so you may hate itthe characterscloud for most of the game hes a pretentious douchebag but he lightens up a bit near the endbarret he is mr t i guess someone at square really liked the ateam
tifa sweet goodnatured girl who isnt afraid to fist fight godzilla
kinda awesome
oh and she has a thing for cloud for some reason
speaking of thataerith the obligatory love interestred xiii hes a lion that talks
hes the most level headedcid a washed up foul mouth old pilottechnician  my favorite
vincent hes a shapeshifting vampire and hes kinda sad about ithis past happens to be kinda messed uphes even sadder about thatyuffie was the lolita ninja a trope before this girlcait sith i really dont remember many details about this thing beside that hes a robot controlled by reeve  a shinra employeeid go over the antogonist but i dont want this reviewretrospectic go be much longerso if these characters sound cool to you then greatif you like this game then check out legend of dragoon by the wayif you are a collector with a lot of money to blow then get thiseveryone complains how great or how bad this game was
to me when it first came out i loved it it was the first final fantasy game i played i was like  or  years old
i still like the game a lot yes now it has bad graphics but they were cool back then
the story was good but at times made you laugh
cloud was alright but there has been better but i thought sephiroth was a great bad guy and to me the best character in the game
yes it is long but i enjoy games that take time to beat and it wasnt very difficult to beat
i enjoyed that there was a lot of extra stuff to do in the game besides the main storyline which is smoething games are missing these daysall in all i still enojy playing this game as most of the other final fantasys my favorite is  to be honest
they all have good and bad things about them
so its not my favorite game but its still one of themmy favorite character is sephirothhe also makes an appearance in quotkingdom heartsquot as the toughest boss in the game
but i beat him
final fantasy vii is a brillant mindblowing gamecloud is the main character of this gamehe also makes an appearance in quotkingdom heartsquot as  or  bosseshes easythe thing isi couldnt even get past the mechanical scorpionthe game is just way too hard for mebut i beat itthe sephiroths are also hardif youre in for some actionbuy thiscloud is just such an amzig characterand so is sephirothsincerlykennyff was my first game to play from ff
great graphics very mundane story and the mini games were very well worth it
this game should be added towards your ff collectionim old enough to remember when rpgs werent called rpgs
in those days the essence of the game was to move the players about a game board fighting battles collecting treasure and finding clues
origins ultima series was the grandparent of these games  immensely entertaining but essentially twodimensional
among its heirs were the first games in the final fantasy linethis was also a time when computer capabilities and capacity seemed to double every few months
final fantasy vii is the result of an inevitable synergy between technology and imagination
players found themselves in a threedimensional world where they could wander at will
they were playing with characters that were not only more animated and lifelike but also had something that resembled personalities
in a very real sense ffvii changed the gaming landscape and rpgs reached a new level of credibilitywhat is inside is the story of cloud strife an exsoldier turned mercenary who is drawn into the struggle between avalanche a revolutionary group and shinra a rapacious company that is rapidly draining the resources of the planet
starting out in the city midgar the battle moves back and forth across the planet as cloud gathers team members accessories and power
everyone has a history often mysterious and an important role to playeventually it becomes clear that the real enemy is a laboratory experiment gone horribly wrong
shinras effort to produce supermen has created sephiroth who has become one of the legendary villains of the gaming world
physically beautiful his mind has been ruined by his knowledge of what he is and his goal has become the destruction of the worldthe plot is remarkably rich
within the main story arc are many smaller stories that build the players understanding of the nature of each of the characters
there seem to be an unending number of weapons powers and monsters
more than enough material for many replays
the graphics are a bit primitive for our time but were startling when this game first came out
as your imagination adapts to the imagery the game becomes truly engaging on many levels
final fantasy vii is still one of the best of its genre whether you are a student of gaming or an aficionado it belongs on your shelfthis was a very addictive game with lots of fun involved
when i first saw this game i thought it would reek because the fighting scenes arent great
but this game is a lot more than just fighting its an awesome rpg maybe one of the best
some of the bad language is not needed but its easy to look past thatone thing that really bugged me was that in some parts it was just too hard and you could walk around for hours and not figure out what you were supposed to do
but other than that it was great
you can actually play arcade games inside this game and there is even a place where you can shoot some hoops
there is a big mix inside this you can drive a motorcycle a chocobo  and some hover crafts
this game is really fun and has i think about  hours of gameplay on three different discs so go out and get yours todayjessealthough the graphics arent as good as one would expect the characters are very well done
espeically sephiroth he seems to be the very essence of evil with the tricks he pulls of in the game
many of the mini games are great my only beef with the mini games is that they should of amde the minibattle game available in the golden saucer also why didnt they put in real voices in the end instead of a postscript
this was probably to save money so square wouldnt have to hire voice actors
although the plot veers off track at times and a few of the program quirks are noticable this games still enjoyable and has a well written storyfinal fantasy vii  circa good considered a classic ps rpg by many people arguably best story in a video game epic story with fleshed out characterbad graphics are really dated d character models looked old even in  game play may feel datedif it fits your taste turn based rpg no voiceovers so there is lots of reading unless your looking for or like that retro lookfeel of an rpg it will feel dated to those raised on final fantasy x or kingdom heartsgame its most assocated too final fantasy viii final fantasy ix legend of dragoon chrono crossadditional notes there is two versions of this game in one version the female playable character is called aeris and in another it is called aerith note this is the same character there is a version for the pc
as well the cg movie final fantasy advent children is a direct sequel to this game note all final fantasy are not related to one another think of each final fantasy a its own game not connect in any realtrue way to another final fantasy the only exception is final fantasy x which is a sequel to final fantasy xthe graphics are dated and the storys mediocre
the game is still good
lets face it people
there will never be a perfect rpg but this one is good
youve all heard the story yet heres whats great about it
really good side quests beliveable charecters and beatiful movies
whats bad is the plot the graphics and the last boss
thats it
goodbyei was in high school when this game came out
i saw the commercials
i was little confused about the title what happened to final fantasies  through 
 but the game looked cool
i wanted iti did not have a psx though
however my best friend did
a week after he bought it he invited me over and he showed me the game
i was hooked by the time cloud and barrett rushed off the traini had to have the game
it was like no other final fantasy
the characters and the environments were so vivid so reali left my friends house with a burning desire to own this game and the knowledge of what had happened to final fantasies  through  or final fantasies   and after a few months of saving i had enough money and i bought the playstation a memory card and final fantasy all in all the game kept me riveted until the very end
the presentation was incredible
the story was intriguing
the game for me was an absolutely breathtaking experiencereally the only turnoffs for me were a handful of instances where the translation was confusing and some weird instances of homosexual innuendo honestly that was more comical than detractingby todays standards the graphics are dated but i still play through this game from time to time and i thoroughly enjoy it every timewhen i played this it was magic
journey back to the midlife of the playstation
no not the playstation  the original playstation
yes to the kids who were born just before the release of the playstation  and are now reviewing ffvii against games on the ps and xbox there really was a previous version of the ps
it was a greyish top loading cd based yes
cd
system with no usb or ilink firewire for the pc crowd
after the end of final fantasy games on the super nintendo entertainment system by nintendo yes there really was a system called snes that came before the game cube and for you old foagies among us the n nintendo  final fantasy finally got the d treatment for the first time
or at least the characters did
the backgrounds were prerendered textures
that is the backgrounds werent true d they were rendered on a computer in d and then a snapshot of them at a certain angle was taken and slapped behind characters who were complete d rendered internally by the original playstation remember the system that came from sony before the ps
only because the playstation couldnt render fully d extremely detailed environments by itself
up until ffvii which by the way was not the first final fantasy to be developed there were other d twodimensional offerings that only people who are long dead or are old and senile will remember ask your great great great grandfather if he remembers playing final fantasy on his nintindo enturtainmant sihstim back in the trenches during wwii there was a real worry that squaresoft as squareenix was called back then really had abandoned final fantasy games in favor of simple graphic demos on completely unknown systems like the n
not so
those demos were actually distractions from the truth
that squareenix errr i mean squaresoft was readying its final fantasy xii demo called final fantasy vii on the equally unknown playstation or as some amish like to call it the psx
but at that time the network feature wasnt fully implemented which made for a lonely playing experience for some already lonely and pathetic supernerds out there
but for us old timers it was a blast seeing final fantasy in d finally
however we didnt get the demo but unfortunately we got the fully playable game
which was great in and of itself
because it showed what was possible with the final fantasy franchise which wouldnt be fully realized until late  when all gamers finally proclaim in one voice quotwhat
another final fantasy game
i thought they discontinued it back when roman caesars ruled the known realityuniverse and mammoths roamed computer generated alien landscapesquot
oh well anything before doom  is going to vanish from the collective memory of computergamedom anyway so dont play this because you wont be able to
its just too alien an experience for todays ddr generation oh for those fetuses unfamiliar with ddr its quotdance dance revolutionquot and its what todays elderly play when their hips arent healing fast enoughbtw stop being putzes and review the game fairly and in its own context of time
it looks really dumb when someone starts comparing it to something so far advanced its not even fair
perspective my children
get someok i know this game is supposedly the best game ever
it even says so on the back of the disc case as quite possibly the greatest game ever made gamefan
i can agree that this is indeed a superb game with a great storyline its just that some things in the game drag it down which is why i gave it four stars
lets start with the prospros an excellent storyline one thats far easier to understand than ff viii that truly brings out the characters and their moving development
the multitude of characters are also a big plus
everyone from the ubersweet folk like ester and marlene all the way to the downright evil heidegger and sephiroth with everyone else falling somewhere in the vast expanse between the two
some characters are even evil yet you feel sympathy for them
characters like dyne who only wants to see his daughter again or cait sith a member of your party whos actually spoiler spoiler a robot controlled from a guy in shinra hq yet he tries to be on the good side most of the time
the music is another huge plus in this game
tunes such as aeris theme and the boss fight theme will be in your head for hours at a time
the sound effects are also a plus most of which if youre playing with surround sound put you right in the game
the graphics are also very good for a psone game with cutscenes that look better than most ps games nowadays
the materia system is probably the best magic system ive ever seen in a ff game although ffxs thing with the orbs on the little map is also an excellent version
it gives the player a true ability to customize the character for particular bosses ie before fighting a particularly tough turk you can equip your weapon to attack and induce poison at the same time
the game also has an immense level of replay value
after youve gone through and beaten the final boss you can go back and get all the enemy skills collect each materia raise a gold chocobo defeat the emerald and ruby weapons ive done it it is possible get each master materia raise each characters limits to level  get the secret characters yuffi and vincent go to the gold saucer and waste some time and money and many other challenges such as beating the game again using only green materia or never saving except between discs dont even try this unless you have a good tolerance for frustration
replay value a definite plus
ok now for the bad newscons the gameplay can get very very very boring
moments in the game take a complete departure from the action and elaborate on the storyline for much too long
spoiler spoilertifas trip in clouds consciousness is a perfect example of this where over an hour is taken to reveal whether or not cloud is a sephiroth clone
you cant save the game anywhere in it so youre stuck having to listen to this hourlong monologue especially sucky if its your nd time playing the game and you already know whats gonna happen
the same is true for the small menial sidestories that are supposed to bring out more of a certain character but actually just distract from the main storyline at times such as the whole thing with barret and the folks of corel
the sound effects although good are very repetitive
each characters attack weapon has the same sound no matter which version of the weapon is being used
the music can also be repetitive and sometimes lacking
sometimes yes its perfectly fitting to have a section with no music at all or only a low cello voice with a bass drum in the background but why on earth did nobuo uematsu decide to have no music for the snowboarding segments
also for some reason they put fairly lighthearted bgm in the section where the team is lost in the snow a scene that couldve taken a lesson from the snow levels in donkey kong country for the snes
oh wellok so its not the best game in the world i personally think zelda oot is the best but it is definitely worth the  bucks youll pay for a new copyill admit the first time i ever played this game i wasnt that into it
the main reason was that there in my opinion too many damn minigames that were kinda hard i still cant figure out how to get in line with the soldiers at the parade in i think junon
also the music while very emotional is very very sad
so is the story it got a little depressing to mebut that was the first time i played it
now im playing it again this is my third time and i just beat the game about  months ago and im finding the minigames arent quite as difficult im not getting lost nearly as much and ive gotta say the musics not quite so depressing anymore either
also i think it helps to play crisis core psp prequel to the game or at least watch advent children movie whose plot takes place about  years after the events of the ps game
the story is still quite sad but it works
i think anyone who is into rpgs will definitely enjoy this onefinal fantasy vii is a good game to play
it is difficult at some points in the game
i started  times just to overcome the beginning of the game and to progress to the continuation of the story
the story line is good
i especially like the stealing of items from monsters to see what all you can getsometimes a weapon or just healing items
sofar im just at the stage where i left the city and roaming the world map
im trying to get more familiar with it
it will take me a long time to finish this game since it has  discs maybe ill never finish iti found the only challenge to be the weapons and the final showdown with sephiroth
this was a great game but way to easy to play because i played phantasy star prior to this
on the other hand it had a slew of extra missions and hidden items and stuff to play for
find the ribbons and sephiroth will be a lot easier to fight
i found two
the graphics were terrible lets not lie ok and to add insult to injury there was never a remake
in a way it makes me hate the game a bit more than i already do even though it was a game i spent most my time withthis is possible the greatest game ever only out matched by super mario bros 
this game is both challenging and fun
number  in my book of greatest hits for the psi had never played this game until this year i wanted to see if this game lived up to its namemy previous experience with this series includes x xi and a touch of xiii i have to say that while i enjoy parts of x on the whole i hate these games
most of this hatred stems from having more hours of cut scenes than hours of actual gameplay
i also like rpgs to have a roaming element i like being able to explore and i like finding sidequests and items
i did not get that with these titles
i expected ffvii to be the same and just riding its reputationbad news first
this is a playstation  game and oh my does it look it
this is an ugly game
battles arent bad and cut scenes could be worse but walking around is bad
when exploring an area its often difficult to identify exits ramps and ladders and various switches  theres a command that highlights ladders and exits to other areas but ramps and switches are still hidden
this option has saved me some headaches but its aesthetically displeasing
rpgs hadnt started the journal thing yet so skipping dialogue even accidentally or coming back to game after a busy week can lead to some confusion
im not crazy about the combat system
combat isnt intuitive and that there are far too many status effectsgood news
the characters are varied and this together with the materia system allows for a wonderful amount of customization and different play styles
the characters themselves while definitely cliche have decent backstories and fairly strong characterization
ive heard a lot of complaints about character angst in this game but i think those complaints are exaggerations and what little angst is there matches the story and characters well
the plot itself is solid and has plenty of twists
the combat system works
i say its complicated and unintuitive but it functions well and allows experimentation with different tactics
most sidequests are fun and while you dont need the sidequest rewards to beat the game those prizes are often very powerful
the cut scenes are well done always convey something relevant and never overstay their welcomesummary  the graphics are bad and can get in the way of the game but this is the only thing that doesnt hold up well
its a long fun game with plenty of replay value
the combat is complex but it works well and that complexity allows the player to be creative and to try some very interesting things
this game certainly has its problems but its quality is undeniable and its rapidly becoming my favorite gamebeing a diehard final fantasy fan i just had to get this game
while i enjoyed it for the most part i was disappointed by the quotfeelquot of the game for lack of a better term
it was not fantasy it was more science fiction and i really could have done without the awkwardlooking polygon characters
but the music is fantastic the storyline is moderately interesting and i think it just depends on what kind of gamer you are as to how much you like it
most newer gamers really love it so if you are hesitant rent before you buy
they finally listened to us oldschool gamers and did us right with final fantasy ix though
marvelousi like how  of people either rate this game absolutely perfect or a complete waste of time with almost no  star ratings
complete fanboyism or complete antifanboy fanboyism
let it be known that i did not grow up with this game so i dont have the nostalgia glasses on when reviewing this game
so let me grab my antiflame shield to avoid being destroyed by somethingyear old butthurt fanboys for giving this game a star less from absolute perfection
gameplaybattle system  the controls are intuitive and easy to understand
nothing complicated there
the games challenge comes in the atb where characters have to actively wait before acting on your commands
it creates a tension in battle because you have to quickly decide what to do before time is up and you cant afford those precious seconds wasted especially during boss battles
the game is neither too hard nor too easy
power leveling isnt required for normal battles
grinding a level or two is required for some bosses especially the secret ones
ohter than that the game does a good job with difficulty
the materia system takes some getting used to however
that is the complicated part to really grasp and use intelligently
some characters like tifa wouldnt be a good healer so white magic materia is useless to her
you have to take each characters stats into play when equipping them with materia on their weapons
i like the strategy system in play though some felt it to be somewhat overly complicatedplotlinecharacters  many people consider this the best part of the game
i think its a very intelligent story even by todays standard
in fact its better than about  of video game plotlines
no exaggeration and i played this game in  it really does get you caring about the characters
one thing i didnt like however and this is kinda big is the main protaganist cloud strife
hes just plain unlikeable and hasnt the slightest inkling of a distinct personality but the storyline justifies him being the way he is and i understand his appeal to young people but i just plain dont like him
he has basically no personality
everyone else especially tifa are very likeable and you find yourself involved with their personal place in the overarching plotgraphics  first rpg with d rendering that complimented the gameplay and story
psone graphics aside they are groundbreaking like everything elseoverall this is a fantastic game
a few unanswered story elements and an  emotionally dead protaganist are my only real gripesif you have a ps buy this game
do it
forget the hype haters and fanboyism and enjoy this marvelous experience
cheers and happy gamingit was a great game of the time and lots of fun though an arcade game the graphics r good for the time period it was made but dosnt compare to most other raceing games nowthe graphics used to look great but now ive played ps and i think they look kind of bad but this is one of the best playstation games out there use the code to get the ford indigo its the best caroh dreamcast how do i love the
let me count the ways  power stone sonic adventure not two bangaio dead or alive this game is good and very entertaining
i would give it five stars had there been more to it
make sure to play with a friend to truly appreciate itgood the price should have been cheaper for how old this game is
game was just the way i played it years agocapcom continues to make great fighting games but this time out with power stone they create something special
power stone was one of the first dreamcast games out for the dreamcast and helped make the system worth buying
you can go anywhere grab anything and then beat the hell out of your opponent
its a great game the only problem is that there is so much going on during the game you can lose your concentration at times but thats the only flaw
otherwise its a great gamethis is one of the best fighting games that i have ever played other than killer instinct and i have to congratulate sega on it
the graphics are amazing there  are plenty of characters to choose from the levels are all varied and the two player mode has kept my friends and i busy for monthsresident evil code veronicathis was originally released on the dreamcast and originally intended to be the third of the resident evil series
however that went to what we now know as the excellent nemesis game for playstationthis game was the first to be set in full d with no prerendered backgrounds
this game has held up very well and the graphics are more polished on the ps and gamecube versionsit follows the story of claire redfield after the events of resident evil  and also reintroduces us to one of the heroes from the original game chris redfield
it features new enemies weapons and entirely new locationssomething about the location didnt set right with me
oh i knowits not raccoon city
well i guess they couldnt help that after nemesis but stilli say this is where resident evil started to go down hill
that doesnt mean this is a bad game but this doesnt feel as fresh as the others before it who still play great in  id recommend this as it is better than resident evil zero  and much better than graphics wise this game is awesome
the control is easy to get used to and it is funthe problems with this game begin early on
the main problem is the puzzles and bosses
there are many times when you will get stuck because you didnt move some block  hours ago of course you cant go back so your only alternative is to start over
very frustratinggraphics sound fun control this didnt have the best plot as the other res do but was a hell of alot challanging
your claire redfield looking for your brother chris redfield
you meet steve burnquist who eventually dies im sorry to say
i dont wanna spoil any more but anyway your main goal is to survive on the umbrella base owned by miss veronica
she is the master of all the ashfords which are a family of very wealthy people
youll meet alexia and alfred
they are deadly so becareful
the graphics are the best part
youll see a world of reality when you first see the first fmv
the plot is good but not the best
and the handgun you get as your first weapon lol sux
but you will not be dissapointed when you first turn the game on
you also will play as chris later in the game so have fun while the game lastsresident evil code veronica on the dreamcast has the same mutantzombie killing and gore everyone would expect from a resident evil game
the graphics are considerably better in this latest installment of the series and there are plently of new monsters to exterminate
as for the weapons there isnt much new herebut at least its kept relatively realistic with shotguns pistols and submachine guns ect
the story is involved and although at some points predictable its executed well from start to finish
unfortunately as in the other resident evil games there is a lot of back tracking that must be done to complete the gameand having limited item space makes it all the more time consuming
if youve played the previous resident evil games you know what to expect
theres also plently of fun secrets to unlock like battle mode and they add a considerable amount of replay value
resident evil code veronica is yet another great reason to own a dreamcastbaio hazard series have the most popularity in japan
especially code veronica is one of the most favorite thing
because it game is  very real gurafic game used the spec of dream cast ability very well
even if it is now time that there are more great spec hard ps xbox etc you can play the came with the joy and the satisficationvaio series is if i say to that simply a active horror and action game
the main character of the game collect many weapons and curing items etc  you defeat the monsters that get to be stronger and storonger as story advance
the weapon is real too
for instance the sound of the bullets gravity feeling when the character have his gums at the readywhen you use your bullets there is fun that you consider the remaining bullets
and the sound is the horror sound
the monster are horror toothank you for reading poor writingthis is a classic that took fighting games to a new level
although i am a mortal kombat fan i admit that this game is actually cool to a certain point
the second one is alot better and the third one is pretty sweet
however you must remember the humble beginings of super hero street fighter games
i like ituntil the dreamcast came along no other system could handle the d graphic processing power of a lot of d games without a lot of loading
marvel vs capcom is better on the dreamcast than it was in the arcades the control is easy the graphics are sharp and crisp and bright and the action is fast so fast you might lose track of what your doing
though it was overshadowed by its superior sequel marvel vs capcom is a must own dreamcast title on its own
also recommended is marvel vs capcom  power stone  capcom vs snk street fighter alpha  dead or alive  and soul caliburthis game was good but not great
it was the very first mvc game and started the ball rolling
i had this game for the dreamcast and played it the arcade for awhile
i thought it was pretty cool but just like xmen vs sf or marvel vs sf but the difference was that people could call out special assists characters
i give credit though for starting the idea of having  on  matches in mvcthere are secret ways to unlock alternate versions of some of the characters and even unlock onslaught
youll have to beat the game using certain techniques
in order to beat the game very easily i personally found it best to use ryu and venom on easy mode
use them to beat the game multiple times and youll be able to unlock all of the secret characterspros the vibration feedback is extremely sensitive 
you feel every bump and hit that you give your opponent there is an easy mode which strangely is not in mvc part  the easy mode allows you to use chun lis lighting fast kicks there are a few super moves that are not in mvc part  like chun lis has four supers in this game while she has only three in part cons there is a little slowdown with a few characters like war machine and strider
these characters move a lot faster in mvc part  you can not select the same person twice
in mvc part  you are allowed to select the same person so you may have a team of three akumas or whomever elseoverall its a great game and i urge you to buy it even if you already own mvc part  i own both games and love them equallythere is doubt about it this was the game that showed the dreamcast could be a major competitor
being a big fan of the arcade version i must sayfor the billionth time that this one surapasses the arcade version
this is a very strategic fighting game  and it is extremely deep gameplay
although my only compaint is that a button masher can beat the computer
that is my compliant about all d fighting gameas opposed to earlier street fighter and street fighter alpa series games
 is that button mashing can get you over
although in d fighting gameslike tekken and of course soul calibur you cant pull off impressivebeautifulcombos with just button mashing
for the most part this game has alot of relay value lots of of unlockable characters
the mssion mode which adds even more to replay value and the cool museum mode
in my opinion time attack mode is useless
the survival mode while great is just too easy
another problem the final boss inferno
he is pretty easy as well
but this is common in d fighters
but all in all this is a solid fighting game
it is just a bit too easy
even ultra hard mode can be easily won by a competent soul calibur player
although button mashers can win the first two stages
this game is a musthave for dreamcast ownersthis game is excellent
the replay value is infinite there are many characters courses etc
available for the dedicated player to find
on  top of that there are multiple modes for up to four players two or three players is usually enough though with  players people usually get boredthe graphics are adequate for the game
however the sound is pretty abysmal
the music is absolutely terrible on almost every course and it is recommended that you turn it offi also would have enjoyed a createaplayer mode
however this game is the best fun golfing can offer with its many courses characters and game modesnot that many golf games in the video game industry can actually sell very very well
most of them use a major players name and suppose to have their skills in the process
not that many of them can have a strong sense of enjoyment in the golf world where everyone wants a more serious side in the sports world with football and basketball
however nintendo seemed to hit the nail on the head with their  creationwith mario golf the game consists of the start of four golfers including baby mario peach and a couple of others
throughout the game you can access the get character mode which can help you challenge other characters like mario bowser and yoshi
once you win the character you also need them the harder the challenger in the round
it is also important in the tournament mode where you can also earn enough points toward newer golf courses and challenging holes in the process
each course reflecting on the cute mario brothers themed style which makes it appealing to all ages old and young where the other games dont seem to have that sense of enjoymentalthough nintendo stopped making games for the nintendo  mario golf is only one of the very few sports games i highly recommend for the system
although many people might not see the review because of the newer game system reviews and newer games of the gamecube xbox and playstation allright i admit it when it comes to gameplay this game loses but when it comes to creating wrestlers this game is revolutionary
the createawrestler feature on this game is so detailed that you dont just pick the face you pick the eyes the nose and the mouth
you also can put lettering on your clothing and have a wide variety of masks facepaint and apparel
with this game you could create the lod and even the insane clown posse
the createawrestler mode is so detailed this game is worth playing just for that
i only wish that modern wrestling games with caw
mode would take a page from this gamesmackdownjust bring it for the ps and smackdown  and  for the ps are better
but it is nothing compared to wwf raw for the xbox
raw for the xbox is better than any of them
but if you havent got a ps xbox or gamecube yet this is a must get game
gameplay is good it just takes a day or maybe a little more to get use to
if you want to save money rent it and smackdown  or  and see which one you would want to have the mosti personally own this game and can testify to how good it is
wwf attitude has eccellent character selection and create a player modefor its time
unfortunately it is getting lost in the shadow of games like smackdwon  with its quick executing of moves unlike attitude and its enormous backstage area unlike attitude
but on the good side it has some things other games dont tag team gauntlet and its huge hidden character selection that you are always trying to unlock
great game i would reccommend it to anyone who likes slowerpace gamesafter having pretty bad luck with trilogies see twisted metal  i was somewhat wary about renting resident evil   i mean how could they top a  classic like resident evil 
and thats where re is hurt  its  overshadowed by its perfect predecessor and to do anything but copy it  would be less than perfection
given all this resident evil  is still a  fun and very scary game
the quotforkintheroadquot choices you have  to make are fun and give the game tons of longevity as what choices you  make change the course of the game
the puzzles can be frustrating and  drawn out
resident evil  is basically resident evil  with none of the  bad points but missing some of the good points
the infinate ink  cartridge is definately welcome in my book
nemesis is an incredibly scary  character
the thing that i was disappointed in was the lack of actual  story or any real characterization
there was nothing really added to the  storyline that we didnt already know
it was basically just solving  puzzles fighting nemesis  times and the big ending
given all this  resident evil  is still a fun game that will keep you on the edge of your  seat and playing well into the morning hours
oh yeah and the bonus game  is pretty funi am a dreamcast holdout
and i am proud of it
the dc iswas the new resident evil machine and every game in the series except for  was on it
which brings me to resident evil this is the survival horror god
re is perhaps the most scaryinsert shocking here game of the series i have played yet
rather than face several boss charactors at obvious areas nemisis the big bad boss of this game will literally chase you throughout the game
i still remember fondly the first time i saw his distorted face
and i remember well his tenacious persuit of me causing my fingers to curl and my stomach to clench
he is scaryadded to nemisis himself is the wonderful useful dodge ability
tired of zombies walking through your hail of fire to rip open your neck
charge them and push them back
tired of spiders wraping their legs around you and pumping you full of poison
jump aside
it is so nice to actually roll out of the way of a enemies swinging claws
and re is the only game so far where you get to do thisfinally the gripes
although i have not played  re is the shortest of the series i have played
it is also much less epic than  or veronica
if it is lengh and amazing story you are looking for go for re code veronica
but is you want to be gripping the armchair seat and shivering from overdose excitementthis is the game for youthis review is actually in reference to both the dreamcast version and the playstation version
for ps  re  offers some of the best graphics available on the system on dc the graphics are a sore disappointment as there were only minimal improvements and while it does look better on the dc there are other enhancements that i would have implemented
this game had scared me when i rented it on the ps  so bad that i set it aside
it had got my heart racing the whole running away and running for dear life and me without a guidebook
several years later i buy the dreamcast version just to complete the collection and while waiting for the remake of re  for my gcn i dust this game off and played through it without a guidebook
this time i didnt get spooked at all
i was up pretty late that night i got scared anywayre  nemesis focuses more so on action than anything else and there is thankfully more than enough ammo and herbs to go around
i think that this is probably the easiest of the resident evil games not saying that you wont encounter the you died screen on occasion but less often than in other installments
this is also the shortest game in the series
the voice acting is dramatically better than previous games as well as the in game cut scenes a little more fleshed out
however the story is not as fleshed out as it should have been
the game does have some advantages
it is the first game to allow you to ascend and descend stairs without using the action button and it was the only game of the series to have a functional dodge button which was great
i also enjoyed the gunpowder mixing
all in all this game is a lot of fun short but sweet and although it is not the pinnacle of the series it is a worthy sequel
plus the dreamcast version has more than enough extras to keep a person busy for a while
lie re  this game is being ported to gcn with minimal improvements
i only wish that capcom would consider a total remake of this game as well with more story elements
if future installments of re are to keep the tank like movement than i hope that they will reincorporate the dodge buttonafter replaying both re and re from my childhood days i couldnt wait to buy re since i had missed that one growing up and was dying to try it out
well ive had the game for a few nights  hours gameplay and have already beaten it
and i gotta say it was a fun ride but im kind of disappointed
im a huge resident evil fan and ive been wanting to play this game for yearsdont get me wrong the game was very entertaining and still withheld the ability to scare the hell out of me
i did enjoy it a lot but it just doesnt justify itself as much of a sequel in my opinionheres whyfirst off whats up with the difficulty modes
youre only given two choices hard or easy
and their both screwed up
whyeasy mode the game starts you jill off with an assault rifle and  faid sprays enemies are way too easy to shrug off jill can take up to  bites from a zombie and still be in fine condition you have infinite ink ribbons all of the weapons in the game are already unlocked and located in your storage crate you have massive amounts of ammo for each gun already in the storage crate
and im talking massive for example  handgun rounds  shotgun shells and   ar clips picking up ammo gun powder and health items is pointless since you already have enough of each to last you to the end of the game it is not much of a challengeneedless to say i quickly changed from easy to hard mode after the first  minutes of playing
i usually dont like playing hard mode on any game
but it didnt leave me much of a choice and being a re veteran i figured i could handle it
in other words easy mode was obviously designed for newbies and people that absolutely suckhard mode you start with almost no ammo at all jill takes too much damage even from the smallest attacks the new dodging feature is nearly impossible to use nemesis is way too strong and can kill you in one or two hits jills inventory is very small
unlike the first resident evil zombies respawn after you enter and exit a room
true considering the situation and environment does make sense
like its impossible to kill every zombie in the city
nonetheless i completed the game on hard
having died  or  times being annihilated by nemesis
my only question is why wasnt there a normal or original mode to play
i like to be challenged and enjoy the game at the same time
playing on hard was difficult and irritating
especially when you have an  ft monster on your tail most of the timesecondly the storystoryto sum it all up the story is about jill desperately trying to escape raccoon city alive
and the first part of the story actually takes place like a day before the events of resident evil  the main conflict in the story is that umbrella corp has secretly dispatched a mutant tyrant called nemesis into raccoon city to seek out and destroy all the remaining stars members
namely jill and brad vickers
i wont spoil the ending for anyone and i think most re fans know what happens anywaywhat i didnt like about the story was that it was too confusing
like who is nemesis
where did he come from
i mean seriously whats his origin
also in re leon and claire were looking for chris who we later discovered had traveled to europe
but your telling me that jill was in the city the whole time
and not once did leon and claire cross paths with her
come onanother thing that doesnt make sense keep in mind this is before re is when jill makes her way into the rpd
building only to find that half of the doors are boarded upbarricaded having no access
which would contradict res plot altogether
how would leon and claire get around the building
it doesnt make any sense
why didnt they just have all of the doors jill didnt need to go in locked
the story itself is pretty clustered
and its really not even a story its more like a sidestory
it just seems that it was really rushed through and not a lot of thought was put into itthirdly the nemesisnemesisdespite what i said earlier i thought that nemesis was a great addition to the game
he definitely adds to the suspense and you never know when or where hes going to pop up and surprise you
however it doesnt take long to get tired and frustrated with him
mainly because there were a lot of areas in the city that i wanted to explore but couldnt because i was being pursued by nemesis
and he shows up like  minutes apart from each appearance
so exploring or not hell always turn up sooner or later
and yes you can fend him off
but theres really no point since hes nearly impossible to kill and your only wasting precious ammo and health trying to fight him
by the way some of you may remember mrx from re well theres a big similarity between the two
their both huge mutant zombies that stalk you throughout the game
so its quite obvious that nemesis was a variation of mrxprosre did improve and add some great new features
such as the new dodge feature that really adds to the gameplay and helps a ton when your in combat
it took capcom  games to finally add the  degree spin which enables you to turn around quickly and run to avoid danger
i also liked the new gun powder mixing feature which enables you to create ammunition for your weapons
there is a lot of action and surprises in the game
adding the interactive environmental objects explosive barrels etc
was a nice feature and really helped in difficult situations
i did really like the outdoor environment in the game
i thought that was a nice breakaway from the first two games
and finally you dont need to press the action button to go up or down a flight of stairsconsthe graphics are the same as in re and re only with slight improvement on the character models and design
the prerendered environments dont look as good or dark as in re but are still nice
the game itself is very short compared to the first two and the only playable character is jill
the camera angles can get annoying sometimes especially when there is an enemy blocking your view
this problem is in the first two games also
it wasnt as scary exciting or suspenseful as re and re
but still has moments that make you jump out of your seat
and lastly it lacks a storyconclusionbottom line renemesis is a good game
its fun scary and entertaining
and no its not the best and in my opinion its the weakest game in the series
and anyone who disagrees obviously hasnt played the first two
but i will cut it some slack because resident evil  had a lot to live up to
and it was because resident evil  really set a high standard for the series
lets face it resident evil  was a legendary game and quite possibly the greatest sequel to any video game in history
i just think that re could of been a better sequel
and it isnt as good as its predecessorfinal rating in res evil two you had two discs of stuff to get done one playing as leon and the other as claire
in this one you are jill valentine and you cant really pick anyone elsestill the weapons in this game improved a great deal
you get the standard pistol shotgun etc but there are improved bullets to be made more powerful shotgunspistols m rifles and so much more
also each time you defeat nemesis in the hard level he gives you a peice to a gun you wont find in the game or something cool like that
then there is the mercenaries game after you beat the actual game through the first time
mercenaries is a little bit redundant but if you keep at it you can buy unlimited ammo start with automatic weapons and more
this means any gun you find in the game never runs dry and believe me the first time through the hard level youre going to want more ammo
besides as you obtain more powerful weapons you can swat nemesis like a pesky fly with the missile launcher mow down zombies with the magnum or massattack with the mini gunthe story is pretty much quotget outta dodgequot but the added affects of meeting various survivors here and there is kind of cool although some of the survivors are not always the good guys
also each time you beat the game you get another peice of what is happening with leon claire barry and moreid suggest this one i played it for a solid month even after i beat it and im still playingfor anyone who has not played this stellar game series this is what you call a survival horror game which means you have a gun you are alone and you have s of zombies dogs ravens monsters and mutants after you
the third installment of the resident evil game series actually takes place before the second game so you are writing the future playing as the lead heroine jill who survived the first game
you start out on the streets of raccoon city which has been ravaged by zombies and you work your way to the police station and back into the city streets trying to escape the town all the while being stalked by a huge ugly killer which appears every once in a while to give the player a scare
unlike the other two games jill is armed to the teeth right when you begin the game
she has a handgun shotgun magnum and an assault rifle however unlike the original two games there are not waves of zombies to go through instead there are only a few zombies but the city streets are like a maze so there is lots of ground to cover
there are only a few improvements made from the first two games
in resident evil  there were only  types of zombies with this game there are dozens of zombies such as fat zombies beautiful zombies and so on
there is also a new system where you can make bullets for certain guns but there is no chance you will ever run out of ammo
another nice addition is that the player can dodge attacks without the players help
the graphics and sound are still excellent but several graphics were taken straight from resident evil resident evil  nemesis adds a nice touch to the resident evil formula
not only do you have to deal with oncoming hordes of zombies but now you have another worrybeing chased by a nemesis that will come after you no matter what you do to try and stop it
the addition of nemesis made this game one of the most enjoyable and my favorite of the resident evils
the addition to now be able to walk up stairs without pressing a button really did help way back when though wondering how that was ever not a feature in the games is a bit of a puzzlement
and on the subject of puzzles the only flaw this game has is the water puzzle near the end of the game
only because it is totally random
meaning you can get lucky and solve it in  seconds or it could take about  minutes to beat
but other than that this is a great game that any resident evil fan should have in their collection
nnycw for capcityas i have mentioned before in my past reviews i did not and will not buy resident evil  or resident evil  for gamecube i just dont feel like they gave the fans what they could have given them
in the fact that resident evil remake for gamecube is far better than the original resident evil on psx that out of the way lets slip once again into the survival horror genre with resident evil  to be flatouthonest i loved this game from begining to end
never once did i find myself annoyed or slowed down with any problems while playing this game
the graphics and sound are not much more than resident evil  gave us but the game itself seems to flow seemlessly with re  in every aspecti feel that capcom hit the nail on the head with this game as they did with resident evil  heck thus far they have done a real bang up job making these games
in closing all i can tell you is that not trying resident evil  would be a mistake as the game has everything in it that you would need for a heartpounding experience of funresident evil  
capcoms third installment of their famous survival horror serieswhen capcom unleashed the original resident evil on the psx back in the spring of  they had no idea that it would become one of their most successful franchises to date
in fact the series is still going strong to this day with new games on the ps and gamecube
so capcom heeded the fans calls for a sequel and released re a couple years later
this game ended up being much greater than the original and won over many more gamers with its intense action and edgy suspense
after re received much success it wouldnt be long before another sequel would be in the works
come the fall of  re would make its appearancethe first thing most gamers will notice is that re isnt intended to be a full blown sequel but rather more of a side mission designed specifically for veterans of the first two games who thought they were two easy and wanted something more challenging
plus it would buy time for the next real sequel re code veronica
its quite clear that capcom had this group of fans in mind when designing the third game
there are two difficulty settings and although re isnt intended for newbees of the series the easy mode does give you plenty of ammo to survive most of the game without any problems
hard mode on the other hand is very tough and it teaches you to conserve ammo and health items until they are absolutely needed
and even though it was always important to save the game in the past its strongly recommended that you do it here because its that tough
the action is certainly more challenging and it offers a plethora of small improvements over the other gamesthe games only real downfall comes from the fact that the story isnt anywhere near as compelling as the other games as it just takes place in the same time frame as re
well specifically the first half of the game starts a day before the events of re and then the second half picks up several days after that game
basically the plot consists of jill valentine star of the first game and thankfully not played by the same voice actress
trying to escape the streets of the tvirus infested raccoon city all the while avoiding getting killed by the nemesis a crazed rocket wielding monster whos out to kill stars members
theres nothing really surprising to the story although jill does encounter numerous mercenaries from umbrellas evacuation fighting squad
carlos is the only one jill spends the most time with and he resembles sort of a love interest for her
capcom doesnt really succeed as much with these two as say the relationship between ada and leon or the young girl sherrys affection towards claire both in the previous game
still there are multiple paths and different endings to achieve so plenty of replayability is here
thankfully any fallacy of the story is more than made up for by the gameplayif youre already a fan of the action from the first two re games then youll love re because there are a ton of additions to make the action segments more enjoyable
for instance you can now dodge enemies attacks and utilize a quick turn so that running around is a lot easier to do
plus there are now interactive environmental items that you can fire at to cause damage to enemies
theres nothing more satisfying than being chased by a group of  zombies and then suddenly taking them all out by firing a single shot at an explosive
bang
how cool is that
btw zombies can now run after you and chase you up stairs so watch out
another cool feature is the ability to create your own type of ammo by collecting and mixing different gunpowders
even on hard mode with the right combinations you can end up with a lot of heavy firepoweras for the graphics sound and music they are all nearly identical so read my comments on them in my re review to get the synopsis
same with the music although i will comment on the effectiveness of the music when the nemesis arrives
its quite scary when you leave the room that the nemesis inhabits and then slow eerie music starts playing
you know that the nemesis is nearby and will attack you at any time
this aspect was done very welltheres only one playable character this time but the game lasts at least  hours depending on how fast you go
not to mention that items and monsters are randomly placed each time you play the game
re does improve on the lack of challenging puzzles from the last game by featuring ones that have random outcomes each time
in fact one puzzle toward the end of the game took nearly an hour to solve
the scare factor isnt quite as high as in re but a new fear element is introduced and revolves almost entirely around the nemesis when hes chasing you
the first time i played the game i thought that killing the nemesis was impossible but now i know that even on hard mode you can still best him if you use your resources properly
after the game is done theres still plenty of unlockable goodies to acquire such as a timed battle mini game different outfits and numerous epilogues to explain the story furtheroverall if youve mastered the first two games and hunger for more then by all means pick up re
its not perfect but any older fan will find this game worthwhile
however new fans should start with the other games first before tackling on this one as they may find re to be frustrating
highly recommendedok this game was great
the time line is very interesting in this game cause it takes place before and into the same time period of re
the added feature of having the main boss chase you the entire game gives the game a interesting challege
just when you get all relaxed and are on a roll killing zombies the music changes and your hear stars
so now you have a very ugly mean disgusting thing chasing from room to room
ne ways this game is great a definant must buy for any fan of the series
and a great game for beginnersthis game is excillent the graphics are top notch the game is chalinging but not to hard it is just a great game why did i only give it  stars
because the stupid voice acting and why do the characters always move thair hands like that do you know anyone who waves thair hands in slashing motions while they talk
if they would stop the hand movements and tried harder on the voices the game would be perfict
dont let the voices discurage you from buying this game thair is so much to this game let me talk about replay value almost every puzzle in the game is random so you cant just use the same solutions every time through the game
let me talk about the nemesis hes a fti think tall monster that makes frankenstein look like a whimp with a tenticle that spews poison at you and equipped with a cannon
he sounds dangerious you face him more than wonce in this adventure
after much time playing this game you could tell capcom put much time in this enemy and he has the only voice in the game that is not annoing as he only says quotstarsquotthe final instalment of the series on playstation  doesnt disappoint
this is a classic game an all time great
although not as good as its two prequals res evil  makes up for it with improved graphics and an amazing mercenaries game
the hard mode also offers the most difficult of challenges ever seen on the ps one
if you are a fan of the series then you must own this
some gamers may feel its too easy iof they complete the game but try it on hard mode and then try the mercenaries and you get all the challenge you could ever ask for
the only reason why ive given  stars instead of  is the basic fact res evil  and  are both better
but dont let that stop you buying it this is a game that offers challenge new enemies harder puzzles and throws further into the series evil intricate plot
a classic gamei loved this gamei like the fact of killing smart and fast dinos alot more than killing stupidretardedslow and mindless zombiesit makes the game a little more challenging and this game has so many surprises going from raptors poping out from a corner to rip your face off all the way to a gient trex busting through a window to bite you in halfi must say that this game is very gory but in a way still cannot compare to the goryness of re gamesi bet though that your wondering why i called this one of the best survivalhorrors when i have only givin it  stars instead of a perfect wellthe game seems to have to much puzzle solving and not enough killing dinoslike there is about a dino in every hall and in a few rooms but after you kill them all your stuck with about  puzzles to open a new area and then you finally get the opportunity to kill a few more dinos and then the same proccess over and over puzzles dinos puzzles dinosbut heylook on the bright sidethe graphics are very greatalong with the sound and awesome fmvs and the game also has its great and fun moments like when the trex comes outin this game the trex plays a simmilar role such as the nemises does in re because they are both constant enemys that keep showing up to ruin your day and they seem invincablethis annoys some because of the same boss showing up over and over but i think its great
plus if you have played re and got annoyed by the nemises showing up over and overyou may like this a little better because in here the trex does not show up as near asmany times as the nemises doesaside from the trex and the raptors there are  other deadly dinosone is the small and very very annoying compyswho show up and theres about  of them you gota kill which wastes a great deal of your ammoanouther is the flying bird dinosi dont know how to spell there namesand last but not the leastthese very very strong and very bigbigger than a raptor anyways but way smaller than the trexwierd looking things that i do not have a clue to what there names areohnow i would like to get to the ammoammo is very very hard to find in this gameand there is not even that much to findbut i suggest to you to get and infit ammo cheat because youll need it for this gamethis games aiartificial intellagenceis very goodthe dinos are smart and if you are bleeding they can smell it all the way from a different hall and start stalking youso over all this is a great horrorsurvival that has somwhat littlebut good action none the lessbuy ityoull love itexept if your not good at solving puzzlesbye nowthis game isnt historically importantin the history of videogames its derivitive and flawed but i still had a lot of fun playing it
its like a good bmovie
i tend not to like the graphics of playstation games i preferred the snes back in the day but here they work
the graphics lean towards realism but have a hint of anime influence and i think they did a really great job on the dinosaur models and most of the animations are pretty expressive the limping of regina when shes injured for example
the grainyness of the graphics enhance the bmovie feel
the voice acting isnt great but each character has a distinct personality
i also enjoyed the item mixing system this allows you to customize the difficulty of the game you can choose to use weak items or level items
there is also a decent amount of strategy in the game depending on the kind of weapon you use raptors will be unfazed stunned or knocked down depending on the strength of the weapon and there are also laser shields in some areas you can use to knock down raptors in order to run from themflaws the first and most serious flaw in the game is that the areas on the map arent labeled this is idiotic it means that when you find clues with room specific information then unless you have a great memory you wont know where to look
another problem is that sometimes important objects in the environment will blend in with the background and look unimportant there is a key slot that would have taken me hours to find if i didnt get annoyed and look at a game walkthough
sometimes the camera angles can hide important objects too
there is also a problem with damage detection and hit point arithmetic a raptor wont take damage during some parts of its animation and if you get in some shot gun blasts then switch to the hand gun sometimes it wont count the damage done with the shotgun both of these issues waste bullets
you cant group items how you want sometimes youll want to upgrade just one item but are forced to waste two others because of auto grouping
the select sound effect gets annoying considering how often you have to go to your inventory
the save system is slow and annoying
the pace of the game gets stalled from puzzles sometimes youll be running for your life but then have to stop and do a puzzle and i never figured out the rules of the crane puzzle it just felt like trial and errori remember back in  when i received dino crisis as a christmas present
this was my first exposure to a survival horror game
believe it or not i actually didnt bother with the resident evil series until six years later in the summer of  which is when i played resident evil  for the very first timenow lets go back to  for a moment
the world of d gaming was in full swing at that point in time
 was a year when people were anxiously awaiting what the playstation  would give us while at the same time we were appreciating what the original playstation was offering
the original playstation as you may already know is where the survival horror genre really became popular
resident evil silent hill and the now underrated and unfortunately forgotten dino crisis seriesover time people havent treated the dino crisis series with nearly as much respect as the resident evil and silent hill series
it probably has something to do with dino crisis  being a really bad game with horrible camera angles which meant after that failed experiment hit the market people werent interested in any more dino crisis games
but you know even before dino crisis  was released people didnt respect the dino crisis series as much as the other survival horror games
i really have no idea why
dinosaurs can be just as cool as zombies
believe me
perhaps it has something to do with the animation
even though killing dinosaurs is fun and addicting capcom made killing zombies slightly more interesting thanks mainly to better animation from pointing and shooting your guns at a zombies head
it just looks and feels better in resident evil
this in no way should be reason to avoid dino crisis
this also doesnt mean dino crisis is flawed in the shooting department
both resident evil and dino crisis offer tons of enjoyment
tons of enjoyment
they are just separate beaststhe original dino crisis is supposed to be about making the right decisions when it comes to either keeping your ammo and health in one place or making the decision to bring the ammo and health with you
its supposed to be about guessing whether or not the ammo or health will eventually be necessary as you progress through the game
however on easy mode none of this makes a difference
the game is so easy on easy mode that you can literally get attacked by dinosaurs about five or six times before you even need one of those med pack ms used to bring your health back to 
seeing as how there arent many dinosaurs in the game overall you will only need to use one of these health packs maybe two or three times throughout the entire game
dino crisis is that easy
this means you will only have to bring one or two med packs with you and leave the rest behindto be fair you cant just mindlessly shoot every dinosaur you arrive to because you arent given a whole lot of ammo
certainly not as much ammo is given to you compared to how many health packs are available throughout the journey
despite that running out of bullets probably wont ever be a problem
just make certain you avoid some of the weaker dinosaurs in the early parts of the game
that way you will have enough bullets for the bigger and deadlier dinosaurs in the later parts of the game which obviously require more bullets to killyou are given the ability to mix things together to create dangerous darts
these darts are used to kill dinosaurs very quickly sometimes in a single shot
the problem here is that on easy mode the game is so simple that mixing darts together isnt even important
you dont have to worry about dartmixing on easy mode at all
you can simply shoot or avoid all the dinosaurs you come across on easy mode and not have to worry about dartmixing ever
that kind of ruins the whole survival horror aspect of the game
you should have been required to use at least one or two of these dartspeople criticize dino crisis  for being just a mindless shooting game where you have to kill as many dinosaurs as possible to progress to the next area and collect bigger guns but the honest truth is the original is a much easier game overall because you can simply run past all the dinosaurs that stand in your way
you cant do that in the second game
you have to stand up to them and shoot
so dino crisis  is a harder game in my opinion
oh sure you are given an option to up the difficulty in both dino crisis games but the problem here is that the difficulty goes up significantly making the game nearly impossibleanother problem i have with the game is the amount of cutscenes
you cannot skip over them so you are forced to watch almost every single one of them
most of them are kind of boring because most of the cutscenes feature the main characters just talking to each other
sometimes you will see a coollooking dinosaur attacking something though
but capcom really should have given you an option to skip over the cutscenes like they did in the sequel because most of them are flatout boring
these conversations are supposed to create a spooky mood but it doesnt work in my opinioni also have a problem with the incredible amount of puzzles you come across
i am not kidding theres over  puzzles in this game
some of them are just a matter of typing in the correct series of numbers or the correct words to access the next area
some of the puzzles are more along the lines of finding the right way to complete them such as the puzzle where youre pushing these up down left and right buttons to figure out how to sucessfully lift up and put down boxes using a giant crane
these are extremely hard puzzles to figure out by yourself unless you have a walkthrough
once you figure them out the sequence is exactly the same the next time you play the game though
theyre not random like in resident evil the game is also very heavy on searching for the correct key cards to gain access to the next part of the game which can be annoying
simply put the game is dominated with puzzles and key cards which are always required to access the next area
a bit much to say the leastdespite the above problems dino crisis is still a pretty fun game because the dinosaurs are animated beautifully and the graphics as a whole are really good for  as well
the actual gameplay has some problems mentioned above but theres also plenty of action to be found
also the game is pretty scary and intense and the dinosaurs are simply wonderful looking and its interesting the way they can attack you because they attack differently each time
sometimes they will bite at your arm other times they will pick you up from off the ground and moreoh and the music and sound effects are amazing
perhaps the best music and sound effects in a survival horror game ever
instead of featuring melodic themes you are treated to sound effects and musical notes that seem to play randomly almost making it sound like improvised music like something from a king crimson record
this means if you listen to the music carefully you can hear a bunch of unusual and creepy sound effects in the background
you hear something different each time
its awesome and works great
its not a typical soundtrack in any shape or form even by survival horror standards
its so goodoverall even though dino crisis has almost zero replay value and too much time is spent running around inside a facility doing one puzzle after another and collecting one key card after another the game is worth the experience
its not a classic just a nice gamedino crisis is a great game  lots of excitement suspense and action
it doesnt fail there
i beat it in four days seven hours playing time though so definitely rent it firstsome of the voice acting is weak  but its not the worst out there
the story will keep you interested as  will the battles with the enemy dinosaurs
an added plus is the decisions  you must make at key points in the story but even this and the different  costumes isnt enough to give the game the replay value it needs to make  it a star gameyou can say this is resident evil with dinosaurs but its a little more than that
definitely scary
puzzles are a little complex and tricky
youll need a pen and paper to figure them out
cutscenes are awesome
monsters are quick here
you no longer have the comfort of running away from a slow moving zombie
certainly challenging
four stars overall because this game is short but still worth iti did play dino crises  and it was okay
more of a shooter
wished capcom stayed with the survival horror element
they had a winner hereas my first forray into the world of survival horror i was very curious to see how this game would hold up in this age of playstation s and halo
i am pleased to say that this is a pretty fun game that has its strenghts and weaknessesyou play as a secret agent named regina
your mission is to infiltrate ibis island to find a mysterious scientest named dr kirk
upon landing on the island it quickly becomes obvious that there is something very wrong with the island
then it becomes a quest to survive the evil reptillian menacemany many people have complained about how dino crisis should be called puzzle crisis
it is true that there is an unusual amount of puzzles in the game that you must solve to advance
they range from simple switch the batteries to the moderatly difficult move the crates with a crane to the quite difficult rotate electronic chips to divert power
there are also a mamoth amount of keys that you must get around 
there are also ddk locks that you have to dechiper to unlock doors hence the title of this review
most of these puzzles can be solved moderatly easily if you really think about it
overall id say that the game is a  mix of puzzles and dinosaur actionas for the fighting part of the game you get a total of three weapons shotgun handgun and grenade gun to exterminate raptors pteradons etc
some people might be turned off at the idea of only  weapons but i dont find it a problem
combat is handled in the re control scheme which works pretty well
as with a lot of survival horror games you have to be carefull as to how you make your way through with ammo which is not unlimited except in  case
fighting the dinosaurs can be difficult but mastered
overall id give the combat a bthere are some things to really like about dino crisis
at certian points during the game you have to make decisions aka choose your own adventure style do you investigate the underground area or go save a comrade
this adds a nice touch of replay value
the graphics are pretty good by ps standards
the best part of the game however is the trex
the trex provides the most exciting elements in the game and each encounter is a adrenaline charged rush
likewise the  possible different endings are all very exciting and cool to play through although there are a few things i am curious about
for example spoiler
how can a trex swim  miles an hour in water
that dosent make much sense
end spoilerthe weak points of the game are mostly the puzzles
there are a bit too many of them and not enough dino battles
also the devlopers throw puzzles at you when you least suspect it and when you dont want them
while racing to a heliport for example a big race against time with tense dramatic music the game tosses a box pushing puzzle that you have to solve to advance
another time you have to solve  big puzzles in the span of  minnutes where you have to power an elevator then move cranes when they are only  minnutes apart
also the unlockable minigame you earn if you beat the game in under  hours is dissapointing at least to me
the element of strategy is unwelcome i just want to blast dinosaurs and not worry about ammo and why isint the trex includedoverall i think that dino crisis is a fun game and a good start to the world of survival horror
i recomend picking it up if you find it for uner  the goodgood graphicsgood dino actiongood storychoose your own adventure style branchesthe trex cool endingsthe not so gooda bit too many puzzlessome really difficult puzzlesnot enough dino actionmediocre mini game see abovemakers of re bring us  dino crisis  the graphics musick backgrounds do look pretty good
you play a redhead babe regina and have to blast your way through all these blood thirsty dinos it gets hard at times but after you play it a few times youll be all set this also has decent replay value as well you get more costumes and an infinite grenade launcher so you can play again and blast all dinos reginas other costumes are really cute as well especially the cavegirl one and she looks  yummy
what else can i say
dc is worthy of purchase although its somewhat on the mediocre side
re fans will likelet me give it to you really short and sweet
did you like resident evil
then you will like dino crisis its resident evil with dinosaurs
all capcom did was change the characters and instead of shooting zombies you get to shoot and kill raptors and other dinosaurs that are trying to eat youi myself am a fan of resident evil so for the price this is a cool game
the same problems from re come with dino crisis however lack of ammo
besides this its a fun game lots of puzzles to figure out and lots of shoot first ask questions later type of funwhile some reviews hail this as a resident evil with dinosaurs its much more than that
the characters were greatand the story line is awesome
the only complaints i had for this game were the camera angles some were very infuriating
the game play is solid and this game is an instant classic
i would recommend picking this game up at the cheap price it is being sold for before its too late
fast shipper as well and prompt servicehaving played a rather large number of survival horror titles in my time i uncovered this title at the local flea market for  bucks
having missed it back on the ps days i was too busy with silent hill and resident evil i guess and being a die hard fan of survival horror i picked it up
first and for most many people have claimed this to be rresident evil with dinosaurs
dont get me wrong the similarities are hard to miss but this really is something unique
enimies are fast the slow moving zombie has been replaced with the screeching agile adreniline fueled velociraptor which makes this game pretty difficult
no think about it
re controlls only with zombies that move faster than you
get the picture
while this does ramp the difficulty significantly it isnt too over bearing you just have to learn that blasting dinos isnt a good idea and running away is
despite the more frentic combat the game still moves at a sluggish pace that survival horror players have either come to love or hate
this is due in large part to a vast number of puzzles which make little sense as usual colored key cards statues crate moving etc
and back tracking in true re fashion
however this game offers some really chilling atmosphere and despite the slow moving speed it really does feel faster and more frentic than its compitition just because dinos are everywhere you are always running and usually have an extremely low ammount of ammo at all times
because nearly every area has key items you have to explore
because these same areas feature dinos you have to use ammo to kill them
because dinos are so fast and hard to kill you are always taking damage
you use healing items to cure wounds so there for unlike resident evil it is pretty damn hard to hoard ammo and healers all this results from fast moving enemies and because you almost always just barely escape every situation by the seat of your pants this gives dino crisis an exciting edge that most other horror games still havent perfected
add to this choose your own adventure style twists in the plot where you call the shots as to which direction the story goes the ability to combine items to create more powerful weapons new types of ammo and more potent healing items and some pretty nifty graphics they really arent that bad considering this game is almost  years oldand you have a winning title
as for the notsojuicy parts well there are only about  types of enemies
and if you ever saw jurassic park or opened up a childrens dinosaur book you already know what they look like and how they will act
im not complaining because each dino still scares the crap out of you when it pops out of a vent shaft or chases you down a corridor at high speed but they lack that whatthehellisit
factor of the mutants seen in re and silent hill before you ever encounter them you already know exactly what the enemies will look like and how they will try and kill you
it just isnt as disturbing as the freekish encounters experienced in most other games of the genre
more so the weapon selection is a little limited  weapons pistol shotgun grenade gun which offer a nice balance of speed ammo availability and power but it still leaves something to be desired as pistol ammo is far too week to be useful  to  hits for a kill on a fast moving enemy yeah right and shotgun ammo is far to scarce to be wasted on anything but important circumstances obviously grenades are saved exclusively for bosses if you actually want to beat the game
a good middle ground weapon would have been nice just to lower frustration and make combat more streamlined
in short if you never liked survival horror this isnt going to turn you into a fan
but if you like the corridor romping the solving of mundane puzzles that pop out of no where and a few heart pounding marrathon runs while being chased by savage lizards this is a game you should check out
dated by todays standerds but still decient enough to replay to see the  different endings
i give it a solid  out of i am basically buying and beating old playstation games i never got a chance to beat
i just finished this game today and it was pretty good
the controls are prettymuch identical to the early resident evil series and so is gameplay really
the story is pretty decent the only things i did not like about the game is it can become tedious running and back and fourth and some of the puzzles  not hard  are just kind of annoying
good pickup if you can find it for under  bucks and looking to waste a saturday with a   pack
game should take no more than  hours and thats really pushing itthis game is fun dont get me wrong but the problem is that this game offers nothing new to the style of game created by capcoms own resident evil series
basically its the same story youre trapped on an island where dinosaur research has run amuck and your goal is the escape before getting devoured by the many dinosaurs youll run accross while playing this game
along the way youll have to also solve some puzzles to be able to escape the island
so basically if you enjoyed resident evil or any of its clones dino crisis is a game for youaround  this game hit shelves on the coat tails of the success of the famed resident evil series
it even comes with a demo for resident evil  nemesis
that said this is not resident evil
it has similar controls and a story a little too silly to understand but that is itthe game is dependant on your ability to craft darts or find bullets to kill the enemys of the game
you will never have enough ammo to march through the compound and kill every enemy
you will need to run close doors operate lazer gates and ect to get through this gamethere are puzzles as well none that i can immediately remember except for the puzzle where you move cargo holds to make a paththe enemies are excellent
this game has dinosaurs that look and feel like jurrasic park dinosaurs
the raptors are vicious and terrifying the pterradactyles are a situational enemy but they are a thrilling challenge the domeheaded dinosaurs show up and kick your can and the tyrannosaurus rex is simply great
the enemys are so well used in the game that they are completely plausable
they take a great deal of damage and are fast and strong enough to rip you aparti give this game praise for going away from the zombie threat and replacing them with something exceedingly more violent and threatening
i love zombie games more than the next guy but this was just good
the story was bmovie just like in resident evil and the enemys were terrifying and threatening
the enviroments were dynamic and look really good on ps
very little did not work in the game and if ther was something then i cannot remember itto be frank this is what got me hooked on pacman
after i tried the original mrs pacman i wondered about the other version
id heard good things about it and that it was a very good game but i wasnt so sure
then i tried my cousins game boy version of it and i loved it too
pretty soon i had forgot in favor of my now favorite video game series crash bandicoot
then we went game shopping in toys r us and i saw it
the st thing that popped into my mind was thats a cool looking pacman
since mny dad had said no more crash games for a bit i asked him for this
i loved pacman worlds graphics game play controls worlds and the challenge
i was hookedthe storyline is quite simple
its pacmans th anniversary and the pac family is gearing up for it
theyre preparing a big party but suddenly guess who shows up and kidnaps them
thats right the ghosts
their new boss tocman wants to replace the pac in all the titles of pacmans games with toc thereby making himself the star of the series
so pacman must rescue his familyi recommend this gamethis game was good it actually has talking in it you dont have to read everything its pretty difficult in a way that its fun and its not too short there is a storyline to it the game works great no unable to read disc errors or anything like thatthe only downfall is that if you have pacman world  for gamecube or ps you going to be slightly disappointed because pacman world  is way betterbut thats just my opiniongreat buythose who grew up playing games published by acclaim knew that either they were adecent enough or b really really bad that no one should pay to play
you can file this game under surprisingly dark and deep
in  acclaim released shadow man for the nintendo  sony playstation sega dreamcast and the pc
but with limited advertising not many people knew about this game but it soon had a cult following
if you are looking for a dark and morbid horror game that isnt resident evil then shadow man is a good alternate choiceyou control michael leroi a man who has a dark past that catches up to him and cost him and his family their lives
he gets resurrected by a voodoo priestess who has visions of apocalypse that will consume the world and recruits him to stop it by any means necessary
she gives him voodoo powers and he sets out to find out how to stop it and who is behind the incoming disaster
you start out in liveside which is set in the real world but soon warp to deadside a world where only monsters and zombies are known to wander
you come across many weapons to add to your arsenal and you need to seek out artifacts that give you special abilities
much like super mario  where you had to collect stars in this game you collect dark souls which make you stronger and let you pass through portals to access the other areas
by the end of the game you would have travel to  different areas and be strong enough to face legion the end game boss who you must defeatthe pros this is a horror game and sets itself apart from the other horror games especially the dominant resident evil and silent hill series
the story is dark moody and while slow at first gets more engrossing to the point that you want to keep playing and find out how all of the main characters are connected
the graphics arent good now but back then it was decent enough and the cut scenes detail the story and keeps it moving
shadow man takes advantage of the expansion pack so if you didnt have it you could still play it
however the bump in the resolution and special effects is good enough to have it installed
the music is haunting and fits the areas you travel in so it sets the mood effectively
the sound effects are just as good from the sound of your weapons the screams of the monsters you encounter and the background noises in certain areas
its a very long journey you will be on so you will need a memory pack to save your progress as you wont be beating this game overnight
its also pretty hard so expect to die a few times and you may get stuck in some areas so expect to rely on your memory at times to figure out what to do next
if you look in certain sections of each area you can unlock cheat codes which are either helpful or give off funny effectsthe cons some people may be turned off by horror games so if you dont play these games or dont have any interest in this genre then stay away as this game wont help change your mind
the controls while better than other actionadventure games are pretty stiff so it will take a bit to get used to them
you can choose from a number of preset controls but you cant customize the buttons yourself
once youre done with the game thats it
outside of the cheat codes there isnt anything to unlock or any bonus modes to play throughshadow man was and is never meant for little kids to play
there is a considerable amount of swearing lots of blood and gore and deals with voodoo harvesting of bodies monsters that make you cringe and features a story that is twisted enough to keep you on your toes
the mature crowd can appreciate this kind of game
it was never as popular as other horror games nor has it established itself as a series
but theres a reason why those who took a chance with this game stuck with it to the end it was different it was interesting and was surprisingly dark
take a chance and get it but if you still arent convinced pick up a used copy since it is hard to find it new without paying a premium priceyou start to notice what late s games in d were going for open level design with large levels to explore
banjo kazooie donkey kong  and jet force gemini did it
so now comes an m game with the same d formula as the other games i mentioned only you get a more action oriented game with bad voice acting good for the time
you get a pretty decent story that will carry the game along
most important you get large semiopen levels that you can explore
however you dont really go through levels because the whole game is one big level with small loading screens
but you backtrack whenever you want which is something you couldnt do if it was broken up into levels
the only area you go to thats kind of a split from the main game is the real world
its a pretty small area compared to the dark world you go to for the rest of the game
however you can treat the game like levels if you want because at a certain point you get to an area where a new picture appears in the menu so you can fast travel to whatever ares in the game like you would if you selected levels
however you can go back from where you start to a previous area and it acts more like an adventure game
the reason i call the game semiopen is because you do go through a very big world with many areas with hardly any load time but the level design leads you in a kindof straight path
the reason i say kindof straight path is because you can stray off the path a little by going down another path or exploring the area a little
however its not open like say elder scrolls because there are walls on both sides left and right of you the whole time
you cannot jump over these walls and explore whats outside of the area so id call it semiopen world
it has a similar world structure that dragon age origins has strangely
its more like a very long straight path kindof open world with other smaller areas you can explore
if you play the game and compare it to elder scrolls and dragon age origins youll see what i mean
so it does feel a little confined
but the very large kindof linear world you travel to is very interesting
usually the game feels semilinear because if you just go in a straight direction you can usually proceed through the game
you also occasionally jump off a ledge and go into a circular are with multiple paths you have to go to
aside from the world the gameplay is fair
its better on dreamcast and pc because the controls are more fluid
on n shadowman stops often when you want to turn or face a different direction
so navigating through levels can be irritating
also the game is pretty frustrating because enemies take a long time to kill because you only have a pistol with unlimited ammo
you pick up other better guns but their ammo is extremely scarce as are the guns
the whole supernatural semihorror thing the gam has going for it is really cool and interesting
it reminds me of the town in ocarina of time with the creepy dead people made out of mud
thats what the enemies look like sortof
the game is overall just very unique and fun at times it can be quite hard but it is worth a purchase for the dreamcast or pc version
the n port is pretty inferior but this is the version i have and it isok the ps version is apparently godawful so avoid that verion at all costs
so i would probably give the dreamcast version  stars for more music more sounds better more fluid controls and much better graphicsvery great port of a very great gameit controlled for me fine
using the dpad to move and b to runit felt greatit is only lacking the extreme battle modebut everything else is there including some bonus documents that arent found in any of the other resident evil si did not know  had a resident evil a friend of mines loan it to me oh boy
this game was the first resident evil i ever played it was sweet and of course scary there are flaws the controls ect but you just got to love this game its real fun i think personally that this is the best resident evil everrr
maybe its the  genre whatever you need to tell you self this game rocks i now have code veronica and outbreak so i know what i am saying be sure to get you doctor advise before playing its not a game for the weak at heart laterzzzzz gamers yyeeeeeeaaaaaahhhhhhhhhthis game is great
the handling is cool and so is the combat and magic combat
i personally would reccomend this game for legend lovers  ya know magic
the buttons are great and so are the graphicsgauntlet legends is a mindless hack slash burn and blast game
there is nothing wrong with aimlessly wandering about creepy dungeons mashing buttons and mowing down bad guys
its especially fun with companions
this game is a classic
i enjoy the graphics the audio effects the characters the different environments and seemingly endless procession of monsters in this game
finding all the switches one needs to progress is sometimes tiresome
the games storyline is linear but thats okay
sometimes a formulaic approach is just what the doctor orderedthe dreamcast was is a good system
ts only fault was arriving when it dideither too late or too early
it has a sleek and quasifuturistic look
the controller is a bit blocky and not as smooth as the playstation
the memory cards are huge and chunky and dont do that great of a job at least not compared to other systems
but the most important element to a game system are the games
ive never been a huge fan of sega games or their systems
but one thing i noticed about the dreamcast is that the sports games they have are generally some of the better games in their genre and are quite fun
and crazy taxi plays well on the dreamcast
i wouldnt recommend the dreamcast as your first or only system but since it is discontinued i guess i dont have to worry about that but if you come across one used for a reasonable deal it does make a nice system to add to the one you already have in placethis is a very good gaming system
it was released by in september of  i think that sega made their point out when they installed the k modem with this
its a really nice feature to have and now every modernday system comes with a ethernet or dialup modem port
i didnt rate this a perfect because i think that the graphics arent that good
i really dont like how the controllers are
but i think that atleast they have disks because since nesn nintendo has been using cartridges and sega made cartridges in the beginning but they changed to disks before the nintendo and atleast their disks are normal
they have some good games like sonic which are really good games to own
here are the technical specs of the dreamcastcpu bit hitachi sh risc processor mhz  mipsgraphics nec clx processorram mb mb video ram mb sound ramcolors  millionpolygons  million per secondgame media gb gdrom x access speedresolution x pixelssound yamaha  channeloperating system custom windows ce with directx supportmodem kbps usjp ntsc kbps palits a really good system but i dont think you should buy it now because its way to oldgame consoles are expensive these days
im not getting an xbox because its only available in bundles at 
gamecube is nice but there arnt very many good games out for it
i have a playstation and game boy advance and recently bought a dreamcast
why do i always leave the things i really want to buy for lasti have so many friends that think a system with fun titles can actually die
you still play that
they stopped making them and dont make games for it anymore
its dead its old
it came out in 
uh that really wasnt that long ago
i still want an atari  but i got a pocket pc and a few more games at the top of my listthe dreamcast is possibly the best console ive had the pleasure of wasting my eyesight on
its the first system to launch with a successful online plan  for genesis it tried yet nobody i know knows they really did try
that and it has some of the best games available for it soul reaver mdk jet grind radio crazy taxi many more to name
in addition it has the most confortable controller ive ever used good for big or small hands
and now that sega is out of the hardware industry and trying to sellout their whole dreamcast inventory the price for the dreamcast has now dropped to 
it goes necktoneck with more recent consoles and its dirtcheapi honestly dont see any reason whatsoever why you shouldnt buy segas final legacy
for any holiday if you have a nephew son friend or whoever that wants to play games for at least  hours a week and doesnt have one yet at  this is more than a realsteal
most of the games now are cheap around the  range and the system costs only  times that pricein short buy the dreamcast
sega only stopped making them because of financial problems despite the dreamcasts success
a lot of good games to play on it and gives the options of internet play or surfing the web or even hooking the thing up to your monitor for crisper graphics
outstanding
id give it a  but only if it had a builtin toasteri got my dreamcast last christmas and i like it alot
its a great system
but there are two big problems  the controls for it are very awkward and they stopped production
no more games
they really could have done something with this system but once again sega made a booboojust bought a dreamcast about  months ago
never owned one before however a friend of mine had one back in the day when it was still somewhat popular  years ago
i wasnt really into video games at that time but i loved playing soul calibur with himfast forward  years later and ive picked up video games as my new hobby
after getting a wii a  a ps and a ps the collector and retrogaming fan in me wanted to add a dreamcast to my video game stock
the dreamcast is a great piece of video game history and still offers great gaming to enthusiasts like me yet the high price tag of yesterdays technology will no doubt discourage mainstream interestyou should not expect to pay much for a used dreamcast
they usually fetch around    along with a few games on amazon or ebay
the new ones or the ones being sold as new are quite a bit pricier
new controllers and vmus are going for less than 
many of the games are still affordable but rarer ones such as powerstone    still command high prices
to contrast when i got my ps i was able to get a lot of the games for    each
but quality dreamcast games that are still in good condition are costing me   
i also invested in a vga adapter to get the best picture which is well worth its price as well as some ps  saturn  dreamcast controller adapters great for all those fighting games
allinall for a great dreamcast experience and to get the collection going with some great games you will certainly be paying more than what you would for a comparable ps collectionthe system itself is definitely good quality and sturdy but very noisy
the largerthanlife controller isnt that bad and is actually great for games such as sonic adventure and crazy taxi and other driving games too but for fighters such as sfiii project justice and kof i prefer the saturn controller via adapter
the cool thing about the dc controller are the triggers ala xbox which go great with shooting games and the for gradual speed increasedecrease in driving games
the things i dont like about it the thumbstick is obnoxiously rounded and made from hard plastic and the dpad is certainly a step down from the saturns controllerthe dreamcast has a reletively small gaming library compared to other systems due to its short lifespan but you can double that if you get the converter software to play japanese games you may also need to learn a bit of japanese for a lot of those non usreleased imports
either way there are plenty of gems that make the dreamcast well worth getting
im still in the process of building up my library and playing through the games but here are my recommendations thus farsoul calibur simply a masterpiece this game wowed gamers in  and still looks and plays quite well by modern standards
its also available on xbla but that version is missing the mission challenge mode
sonic adventure    these were rereleased with extra content on the gc but for me the gameplay feels smoother on the dreamcast
crazy taxi    great lighthearted arcade fun
the first one was rereleased on ps  gc unaltered
also released on xbla in widescreen but soundtrack was completely changed
sfiii double impact  third strike the gameplay is simply addictive despite the retro graphics
the backgrounds are static but the sprites are fluidly animated
third strike was rereleased on ps and xbox but double impact which contains alternate backgrounds and cutscenes from the first two sfiii incarnations has yet to be rereleased on any console
power stone    chaotic goofy and just plain fun and addicting
the fun factor is multiplied if you play multiplayer with your buddies as opposed to single player
rereleased on the psp
marvel vs capcom    these have a completely different art style from mvc
mvc is on with a rd character as assist only while mvc is on and triple the primary characters selection and d backgrounds
mvc was rereleased on xbla and psn while a inferior version of mvc was released on the psx
capcom vs snk    nearly identical gameplay but  has more characters and d backgrounds
 was also released on psx and  was rereleased on ps and gc
dead or alive  another dc game that dropped jaws in the early days of the th gen systems
doa ultimate was released on the xbox with improved graphics and gameplay but the dreamcast version is still a great collectors piece
king of fighters evolution dream match  updated graphics for  at least and a couple of new characters
choose a team of four and one acts as an assisttype striker in evolution
nice d backgrounds in both games
dynamite cop if youre into retro fighting games youre gonna love this one
blending humor with traditional sidescrolling actionpacked antics this game is short but sweet
project justice this one is quite pricey goes for the same as a new release so only get it if youre a diehard fighting game fan like me
fighting vipers  import this one was only released in japan so you will need a converter disc
the gameplay is essentially identical to the original fighting vipers game on the saturn
a simplistic and shallow yet enjoyable fighterso if you are a collector wanting to get yourself a piece of video game history be ready to drop some serious money on dreamcast games in good or new condition
the system itself is cheap enough to get yourself two if you buy them used and the controllers and vmus are a dime a dozen
if you will only be satisfied with a brand new dreamcast caveat emptor as there have been many reports of sellers refurbishing used dreamcasts repackaging and reselling them on ebay and amazon as newwell i now have an xbox which is grreat
but i did have a dc and i have to say it was one of my fave consoles ever
great graphics it looks like ps and it looks almost a little better than gamecube
when i heard a while back that sega was ditching dreamcast i was so mad i wondered y because it was such a great console
so i think if you are someone out there who wants to play games that areent up to date but great this is the system
i think that someday sega should jump back into the marketing and make dreamcast  with more power than ps or xbox and come with dvd and net support
it woulld be greatthe following is the review of the system not the games that can be played on it
first off at first i thought that the controller would be pretty clunky due to its size
but in actuality it is fairly light and fits nicely in ones hand
biggerhanded people might have a problem though
what i really like about the controller is that all buttons are accessible without having to remove your hand from anything
unlike that stupid n system that has buttons in the most unreachable places in the heat of battle
i didnt see the point behind the little videogame screen on the controller though
to me it just weighs it down more andlets face itwhy bother playing pixally games when you can play your dreamcast
one thing that i like about playstation is that the memory cards are inserted into the system not the controller
wise move
but unfortunately sega didnt have the foresight to do that
as for the system it is slightly smaller than a sony playstation
graphics run really well on this system and im surprised at what it can do
there is one thing that i have to say about the  megs of video ram on playstation ps versus the  megs of video ram on dreamcast
when i watch a final fantasy fmv on playstation i know that they are pushing that system to the absolute limit
if dreamcast has twice the video ram then i expect to see something twice as impressive something that is so graphically intense that it threatens to overheat the system
but sadly i havent seen any dreamcast game do that
in fact some of these games look like the regular playstation could handle them
overall this is a nicely designed system but now that sega is putting an end to its dreamcast games its not worth buying
id buy a playstation metal gear  is around the corner and ff x or maybe a nintendo dolphinlet me start off by saying i am not quotfanboyquot
i am not into the name brand war
i am a gamer i play on any console and format pcarcadedcpsps reasons to buy a dcthe console is the cheapest out of the consoles coming outthe games and the graphics for them pretty much hold there own against the ps
awesome sports lineup and online play
being realistic of course eventually the ps may surpass the dc due to the advanced harware on the ps its now up to the game makers to utilize the full potential of the ps which is probably around a  year away
the ps still needs to mature before you see its true powerthe console is available now
while you wait for the psxboxgamecube
you can have and play a dc now with plenty of great games
plus by waiting the price of these other consoles will come down and there will be plenty of titles for them by then
good things comes to those who waitcheaper price more games more availability
online play
the best opponent is a human opponentbottom line its cheap for the console and performance it provides it cant be beat plenty of titles to choose from rd generation titles coming out soon its available now and its got online playgrab your dc today
gamer is out
game onthe dreamcast when it came out was the best system available
even today it can still hold its own against most consoles
the problem that doomed the dreamcast was timingusually and we see it even today consoles come out in groups  snesgenesis playstationn the psgamecubexbox pswiixbox  the dreamcast came between the psn wave and the psgcxbox wave
casual gamers had just shelled out money for the previous generation and the more savvy ones were saving up for the next
developers held off making dreamcast games so when the next generation did come out the dreamcast had a lack of titles and lessadvanced tech dooming itthat said the dreamcast is a good console
the controllers look weird but actually sit well in the hands and i like that the dc has four ports off the shelf
the console is also fairly compact
plus for its lack of titles it had some really good ones the original soul calibur shenmue skies of arcadia and grandia ii come to mindsegas detractors still ask  why own a dreamcastthey also state theyre a waste of money because they failed the  bit system wars
i respond by saying they are pretty inexpensive if you can find them used
i recently rebought a sega dreamcast  controllers  games and it only cost me 
i think thats a great dealthe dreamcasts graphics still impress even today
not to mention that the dreamcasts best games are also in my opinion some of the best of all time
the dreamcasts library consists of adventure games like sonic adventure and sonic adventure  plus fighting games like soul calibur and virtua fighter if you get tired of playing games for a while the dreamcast will also play audio cds and features an internet connection
so even though the dreamcast didnt survive the battle of the other  bit systems that came after it they set the bar for them and are still worth owning in my opinioni cant say much about the dreamcast like i did on the playstation and n but i can say i like the dreamcast
the games are wonderful and there is a fairly wide selection of them
they are kind of expensive but for most of them it is worth it
my personal favorite is definetly crazy taxi and my least favorite is any marvel fighting game
the graphics are very sloppy and it is just a button masher i found but nowadays i guess most games are
the dreamcast is a very good console but it is more of a transitioning system
it is better than the playstation and n and with the n anything else including atari is better but in cannot compare with the playstation  xbox or game cube
overall it is a very good machine and if you have the money dont even hesitatethe dreamcast is the next generation of gaming machine from sega most well known for its sonic the hedgehog games
with dreamcast sega moves beyond sonic into a heavily graphic and netsavvy arcade machineprobably the biggest difference between the dreamcast and its competitors is the built in k modem
this allows dreamcast owners to log on to the net surf the web and fight other opponents head to head
this opens up a huge opportunity for finding playmates that until now was restricted to computer gamers
the web surfing ability only sweetens the deal although like webtv there is no ability to downloadits not for free    but for a household that is currently not on the internet the price gets both the web access and unlimited gameplay
you also need to buy a keyboard if you wish to do any web worklike the sony playstation the dreamcast will play audio cds
unlike the playstation  it will not play dvds however
also while the playstation  can play all playstation games since both are cd based the sega dreamcast cannot play older sega gamespopular sega games tend to be arcade or fighting games  rayman  street fighter alpha  the incredibly high polygon draw rate three million polygons per second means that these games fly giving great gameplayeven though this is equipped with a x cd player its still slower than a cartridge system like the n
on the upside cds are cheaper than cartridges and can hold a lot more information on them leading to more involved gamesim personally not a huge dreamcast fan  the types of games available on it arent ones that tend to appeal to me  but my arcade and fighting loving friends enjoy it a great dealspecifications cpu bit risc clock speed  mhz  sound cd quality  voices connector standard plug videoaudio connector  x  resolutiondreamcast was a system i obtained in  as a christmas gift
i wanted a ps and acted like any slightly spoiled child would when i opened it
ten years later i still have one and enjoyed it very much
in no way am i saying that ps didnt blow this console out of the water however ten years later i still play itmy first dreamcast i did absolutely no up keep to it but sadly a hazed friend of mine belly uped my first off of a counter by snagging the controller i lazily left outluckily i was able to replace it new for over that ten years everything worked great on my first except for some reason shenmue did not like to be read
i believe that meant the eye was going out or my dreamcast just did not like that particular diskssome games on a disk sometimes didnt work on other dreamcasts
if that happens you need to repurchase the same game and usually the other disk would workfor some reasons some disks wouldnt work on some dreamcasts
this wasis uncommon but it happensmy new one runs like newevery game boots right upthe design imo is attractive but dirties to easilyfan power seems a little weak but vacuuming the vents every few weeks or so really helps mine  do at own risk
its a little brick with a mediocre hardware systemits easily just as loud as an xbox  when disks are read
has a cd player option that is attractive when used alright sound put outthe system utilizes its  controller slots a lot of the time to the maxthis is a fun party game system
roommates really helped with the use of this systemgames such as doawetrixle manscrazy taxi power stone soul caliberand many others were fun games to play with four people sometimes two right next to youother multiplayers still had home multi player but also went onlinegames like bomberman onlinepsochu chu rocket were a hit online for a short period
understand that this is the first system to fully push online play  ok people say saturn did and in fact yes their right but if anyone had played it they would probably agree with me that it was a jokeif youve never played online for dreamcast lets say compared to ps dreamcast would make you laugh
if you are younger and started next gen you may not understand why i even put up with itunderstand even when i played pso online as slow as dial up was that i put up with it because this was a firstthis was like black ops of online play is no longer supported through sega on dreamcast
i believe if you are smart enough some people still play games like quake  online with their dreamcastsomehowthe next thing that is neat about the dreamcast is their games that were individually selected for that system
games such as dproject justicesamba de amigowith mirachasand seamanwith mic give you huge bragging rights
samba di amigow mirachas easily could fetch some of these games are hard to find cheap or even at allwith the accessories it gets even more expensivethough the listed genres i put were strong  a lot side scrollers and d fightersrpg is where it really took a hityes skies of arcadia was perfectionshenmue rockedand pso was decent but thats about itsadfps were scarce too
soldier of fortune is the only one id really recommend now that quake  isnt onlinei love my dreamcast and play it regularly however a lot of the reason i enjoy it so much is because during my peak of gaming this is the system i had
if you missed the dreamcast growing up think twice and try it before you buy
some of the happiest times were playing games like nfl k when they came out or if a childhood friend came to visitif you jump from next gen into dreamcast without experiencing it as when it was the new thing your content with the console may not be as much as some reviewers will sayyou kind of had to experience it imo to fully enjoy ithow do you know if the dreamcast is the system for you
forget about graphics think about the games
if you love arcade style games this is the system for you
some of the best ports include soul calibur gauntlet legends street fighter  rd strike marvel vs capcom daytona usa network edition mortal kombat gold house of the dead  and the list goes on
if you prefer role playing games and more adventure oriented titles even though dreamcast does have a few good ones you may want to get playstation  as it offers more variety in that catagory
the only bad feature about the dreamcast is the controllersthey break down often especially if you constantly play capcoms d fighters
plus i think it was a bad idea to make the vmu slots on the controllers rather than on the system itself it just seems awkward
as for the durability issue i cant really speak for that yet
what i can tell you is that i have had mine for well over a year now it has endured extensive play and has yet to display any noticable overheatingoveruse problems
i havent heard of any problems with the dreamcast breaking down as of yetbut be careful
give the vents on the right side of the dreamcast plently of room to blow the hot air out
if you want to get a dreamcast hurry up it probably wont be around much longer thanks to the playstation   fortunately the dreamcast has already established a solid library of games
get it now while you are still able to find games and accessories easilytheres no greater case for questioning why and what if than the dreamcast
everything you can say about this system has been said x over
underrated overlooked before its time revolutionary
the list goes on and on
it all adds up to fun anywayim one of those that was completely sold on the dreamcast
id never been more excited about a console and never have since
this was the console that finally would give us arcade quality games in our homes
i remember when i first saw ready to rumble up and running
i just couldnt believe how good it looked and how fun it was to play
after looking at jagged and pixelated ps games for so long it was a sight for sore eyes literally
that game alone sold me on the systemi was crushed when i heard that sega was pulling the plug and abandoning the dreamcast
the best console with the best games was on the way out and it didnt seem right
it didnt make sense
it was immensely popular had one of the best launches in console history and its sports games were flourishing even without eas support
it still stings the memory like your favorite team losing the championshipbut we still have our memories and even better many of us still have our dreamcasts
a true testament to a console and games of the past is how well they hold up today
many times your memory serves you better than reality
ive experienced that many times with old games i used to like
but many of these are still alot of fun
maybe not as much as they were at first but they can still provide a good timesega was in its prime when they made games for the dreamcast
sonic crazy taxi house of the dead  sega bass and marine fishing daytona usa and virtua tennis are still among the best and most playable today
other honorable mentions go to soul calibur street fighter alpha  power stone  marvel vs capcom  jet grind radio  wheeler and silent scope
unfortunately the dreamcast will never come back and sega may never again be the giant that they once were but you can still find  the console the games vmus fishing controllers and light guns to experience some of the best that gaming has to offer
get it while the gettins goodi play games simply put
if i want to play gran turismo metal gear solid or final fantasy   or  i need a psx
if i want to play phantasy star i need a sega genesis
but in this case with the dreamcast consoles production be halted and for a rather low price not necessarily through amazon its quite a dealthe games that i have look very good
i have found that the sega products tend to keep a more cartoony style while the ps is desperately trying to get the characters to look more human
well humanoid
only square can do it best  i dont have many and that brings up the next casesega honestly doesnt have any games that i really want to play
even when first coming out over a year ago there were few games that really caught my eye
carrier was one of them because i thought the premise was better than the resident evil games which i dont care for
i needed a fighter and streetfighter fulfills that
i have doa on the way but the game that made me buy the dc was phantasy star onlinethis review is about the dreamcast and it is a worthy machine no matter what anybody says about it
the problem and why it receives  stars is that the majority of games are absolute junk
i have specific tastes and sega just doesnt quite cater  but thats not a bad dealsonys latest console certainly has the best selection of games chief among them pro evolution soccer and the getaway
it is however a tad too expensive considering its specsthe dc has an interesting game library
neither the best ps nor the worstwhat it does offer is awesome quality for a low price tag
the ps is capable of displaying  million polygons the same as the dc
the ps has mb of vram while the dreamcast has mb of vrambut the most astounding thing is that to this day the dc thorougly dominates two key gaming genres  racing and fightingmetropolis street racing has overall better graphics than gt and handles really well
arcade racers abound such as the great tokyo xtreme racer series
to top it off the dc boasts the awesome f possibly the most realistic car sim everthe dc also has what has been recognized as the best fighting game of all time  the wonderfully deep soul calibur
add to this countless d fighting games and other fare such as dead or alive  and virtua fighter tb and you have happy fighting game fansother areas that are very well covered by the dc are sports with the famed sega sports series and offbeat games such as rez space channel  and the d version of qbert
there are also a number of kids games probably more so than on the psthe only bad thing about the dc are a few nd gen games such as test drive  and rainbow six which hold the system back somewhat
and needless to be said it cannot playback your citizen kane dvdalthough id take the pss controller over the dcs the dreamcasts joypad is certainly better than the xboxs or that of the nanother plus is you will find every one of the games for less than half their original price given that the dc has been discontinuedif you really want a ps xbox or gc i suggest waiting until they drop their price which they most likely will
i do not think those consoles are worth that muchin short the dreamcasts price to quality ratio cannot be beateni dont really have much to say about this controller except that its got some cool buttons
but it looks awkward
it seems like you could break it on accident if you pull it sidewaysthe sega dreamcast controller is still one of the best designed and assembled game pads that i ever used
in highsight while awkward and uncomfortable now compared to more recent designs it was perfectly suited to the dreamcasts d games while still being simple enough for people to easily grasp
its also generally comfortable to handle for hours making it a perfect fit for weekend long gaming marathons and is very responsive for standard gaming fare on the dreamcast
the colorful main buttons are situated on the right side directly opposite of the analog thumb stick and the dpad with the triangle start button smack dab in the middle near the bottom
there are also single left and right index finger triggers on the underside of the controller
the overall layout make the controller intuitive and easy to learn allowing you focus on playing the game
it also features two expansion slots to accommodate a couple of accessories like multiple visual memory units and a single rumble pack or even a microphone depending on how its configured
to me the only strange thing about the overall design of the controller is that the power cord is connected at the bottom which is a little unorthodox
luckily it can conveniently be secured in the tradtional forward position on the underside of the unit to accommodate gamers with old school preferences
unfortunately like other people have mentioned the sega dreamcast controller it isnt ideal for playing fighting games
the shoulder triggers are simply placed a little to far back and feel a little bit awkward to use effectively not without throwing a minor hitch in your mechanics in the beginning
pulling off some of the more complicated moves in street fighter consistantly is next to impossible for me
so the dreamcasts pad is merely adequate in this particular area and takes a little time to get used to but it isnt a deal breaker
in its defence no standard controller can truly replace a traditional arcade stick in handling the precise quick and smooth movements not to mention the  dedicated and responsive face buttons that capcom and snk brawlers practically demand
luckily agetec released a stick just for the sega dreamcast to address these various issues and manages to bring the arcade feeling home a definite must have for diehards
overall id still highly recommended this purchase for a person who still enjoys playing games on the best console that sega ever made the dreamcast
after all it always helps to have an extra controller handy when playing power stone  chu chu rocket or numerous other classic multiplayer titles from the dreamcast library when friends drop by and are itching to get a piece of the actionthe dreamcast controller is similar to the xbox controller the only difference is xbox has more buttons
the triggers are pretty much the same the analog stick is above the dpad so if you added select black and white buttons and another analog stick itd be exactly the same as xbox
however the lack of these in dreamcasts severely limits gaming possibilities
for most ps games the right analog stick allows players to rotate the camera around their character
without that if camera controls are needed in a dreamcast game the l and r triggers normally are assigned for that
this limits the options for useable buttons
also that right analog stick is sorely missed in first person shooter games which are rare on the dreamcast to begin with
the games that are available invariably use the a b x y buttons for directional movement and the analog stick for aiming
so when compared to halo which makes use of those buttons on the xbox controller for reload jump switching weapons and melee attacks they are incredibly hampered by thisthis controller is great for rpgs like skies of arcadia fighter games like soul calibur and platform games like sonic adventure
but dont buy hidden and dangerous or rainbow six or even quake iii arena because after playing fpss on xbox and ps shooter games on dreamcast are really a step downjust as the title of my review says  it was a cool and original sort of innovative idea that went underrated and underused
but at the end of the day all i needed was a gadget to save my dreamcast game files and it does that perfectlyi like the direction sega took memory cards
at the time i really thought it was the future of controllers and memory cards
i mightve been half right i guess
i would give this item a five star if it werent for one thing that i really dont blame sega for
it uses a lithium battery and for some reason mine always seemed to die before i even noticed
its too bad sega had some good ideas that were just harder to execute at the timemaybe i just got a bad unit but my batteries ran out after only a few hours of use
the memory unit runs on two type cr batteries
now the problem with this is that these batteries are so expensive that replacing them costs about  the price of the vmu
kinda expensive if you ask me
it is still a great idea however and i recommend picking at least one up
i have a few games for dreamcast and they would have been somewhat less enjoyable without the unit
i just hope your batteries last longer than mine didi have a ps and a n thats all but my dc is great and i think you have to have this vmu because if you dont a lot of game you cant play i would say buy this its greati read a lot of reviews on this game before buying it so maybe my expectations were a little high
the graphics here are really not that different in quality from xmen ma actually the backgrounds in xmen are more dynamic
the fighting is good here though and the characters really do have distinct fighting styles that give you quite the challenge in arcade mode
they also tend to defend themselves more here so your every kick or punch wont connect like you want it to
if youre buying for a good fighting game then you shouldnt be disappointedbut if youre buying expecting graphics that are unlike anything youve ever seen before you may bethis ismy favorite fighting game on my ps
and i should say that i still donget bored with itthe graphics are obviously developed you could notice the polygons are smaller and the characters are more realisticalthough there are bizarre characters such as gon the little dinosaur they add the fun to this game even though i dont use them that muchnamco should create more of this stuffthe tekken catagory of games d style came about on its own and took the gaming world by storm
tekken  is just another step up the ladder of success for the tekken series
this game has quottekken ballquot where you play volleyball it has numerous hidden characters and it will definitely keep you playing for hours so you can see your move over and over again in instant replaygraphics very impressive with smooth animations and the requisite cool lightning effectssound while theres no street fighterstyle semiincoherent yells the sound effects are better than what you see in most fighters and the music isnt too annoying eithergameplay if youre new to fighting games this is a good place to start with lots of easy combo strings and flashy moves with enough depth to justify spending a week or two learning the ins and outs of your favorite character
unfortunately hardcore fans will be disappointed with the emphasis on uncounterable pokes double reversals and insane float combosreplay lots of new actually interesting modes and plenty of characters for you to trash a friend with
its just plain fun playing as a giant bear or breakdancing fighteroverall  not an averageif youre reading this review you probably dont care about the finer gameplay aspects
go ahead and buy it even novices can have lots of fun
if youre experienced with d fighters youll probably want to buy a dreamcast insteadtimeless soundtrack timeless everything except the visualsgot this as a  year old i believe still good gameplay although compared to newer games the combat is limited but deeper than mosttekken  is awesome
new characters new moves new combos and some favorites as well
along with some great extra features aside from the tournament like force mode survival and volleyball
tekken  deliversthis is a really good game for all gamers and it hits the essence that is d fighting games
plus new characters and new fighting styles are also pretty cool
the drawback is that the old quotbutton mashingquot is still a viable means of winning the fights and for a lot of the characters some of thier combos thats all you have to do best example eddy gordo
for those of you advanced gamers try the new and improved king jin and lawdefinately check out tekken  this one is definitely worth it for the psone
if youre looking for other great fighting games on the psone check out the street fighter alpha series soul blade and dead or alive sorry tekken fans good graphics cool characters but lacking personality
yes i know its stupid to take off one star for personalities but hey i paid for this game
if you liked tekken  without the personalities too i recommend buying this with tekken this is one kickbutt game
i mean it
literally
about two dozen characters multiple difficulty levels a couple of interesting games this is one supercool gamethe graphics are great and the fight moves flow so prettily its almost scary
the characters are all interesting to use at the very least and theres something for everyone from an enormous slowmoving bear to the lightningquick but tiny xiou yumy only beef is with the tekken ball stage and the sidestepping
tekken ball is just silly
it does nothing for your characters its decidedly simple its 
well its a little kids game stuck in the middle of a rather bloody d fighter
it just doesnt seem to fit with everything elsethe sidestepping is almost ludicrously difficult
you have to tap the controller so lightly that taking a few simple steps to the side becomes impossible
i realize that logistically it would be difficult to find another way but it does hamper your stride particularly in the tekken force stagea great game thoughthis game was great as a matter of fact but its not all that people say it is
theres some new characters added to the game and the characters from the first  games have all gotten older
the fights are great the new and inventive modes such as the one where you fight off gangs and stuff like that on different stages are good and the characters are all fun and easy to use
tekken fans will love this one a lotits interesting to note now that diablo ii has come out how many of the improvements darkstone incorporated into the diablo play model are now found in diablo ii
darkstone has a quotpreviously visited  locationsquot menu that allows you to reduce the tedium of having to  navigate a lot of area youve cleaned out already diablo ii has  quotwaypointsquot
darkstone had extra skills which you could customize  classes with as does diablo ii
darkstone had a populated wilderness area  as does diablo iidarkstone gives you two characters one of which will  contribute to battles when youre controlling the other it can be a fun  game for a younger child who wouldnt be able to play diablo
even if he  cant click fast enough to kill the monsters hell have backup
also the  shops use pictures of items which means a child who cant read or is just  learning can still play if he knows his numbers
the game generally seems  less spooky and bloodywith all due respect to t byrl the voice  acting is a bit strained though not the worst weve heardthe quests  pile up a lot more quickly than in diablo as well
its difficult to get  through the first two villages without being accosted by halfadozen  villagers needing tasks performed
that keeps things moving  alongoverall the game seems a lot easier than diablo
spells cost  less gold is more plentiful magical items easier to come by resurrection  spells allow one surviving character to bring bacak one that just died  etc
etc
etc
and you have to worry less about moving in combat rather  than attacking as would happen in diablo quite a bitbut the combats a  bit mushy relative to diabloa little too automatic feeling perhaps  which is the only thing that keeps me from giving it the five stars
i  killed the first quotbossquot losing one of my own characters before  i knew what happened
but then i could just resurrect himoverall a  worthwhile contribution to the genrenot perfect by any means but it has addicted me
graphics are ok voiceovers are not the kind blizzard has made us come to expect
not the best story
but i am enjoying it and for thirty bucks that says a lottrue they also wont win any points for originality all though there  are a number of game play innovations that i hope the staff at diablo ii  wont ignoreupgrading weapons skills better mapping running and that  feature that autopilots you to certain places youve been before
single  player was fun featuring the ability to use two characters but as with  almost games i play nowadays multiplayer is what i care about
and with  two good friends we had quite a blast romping through the dungeons at  heatnet all though its difficult to get a game going there as it hasnt  achieved a high level of popularity
what made it even better was that the  three of us were using roger wilco to communicate
it felt like we were in  our high school dungeons and dragons days even though we were in different  stateswell until diablo ii comes out as many have said you could do a  lot worse than this gameit has some flaws you will have to run around a bit between play areas but it plays well enough
the price is right and it is worth the time you will spend on it
the learning curve is small and there are music sound tracks buried deep in the cd if you look for them a neat extra
it has been around a couple of years and there is nothing new though you do have a partner you can exploit during battle 
i liked it enough to want to finish it i think you will tooflaviusmaximusnow that ive gone back and started replaying diablo i realize how spoiled ive become playing darkstone
major improvements were made the the diablo engine by god when they put this game out and diablo actually feels somewhat kludgy in comparison
ability to change camera angle the previously visited places menu that sort of thing
godtake  did a good job with the patches as well not only fixing some dd problems in the original version but adding playability as well
a fine product overall thats still got me banging away at monsters after months of singleminded playingim not a big fan of the diablodampd typr game but this game is really neat
the one big advantage of this game over diablo is the ability to control  characters in one game
very high replay value also makes this game a winner
pick up a copy if you can ive seen it rather inexpensive at local retail store
for the price you cant go wrongi bought this to complete my collection
i expected the graphics to be a bit cheesy due to its age but it was fun nonethelessstill fun to play
ive manage to get it to run under win xp
it might run on windows   from what other people say some of the older games of xp era run on windows  with no problemsmy friend and i played this years ago
it is the most fun i have ever had on the pc
the multiplayer rocks and the graphics were great for back thenits funny that i would review this now because my computer wont even run a game this old
but if you have an older pc and it runs games you need thisdescent  is interplays followup to the highly acclaimed descent franchise
you are once again cast in the role of the material defender
this time however your mission is one of retribution as you battle  virallyinfected robots across  levels  normal plus  secret
you  must prove that the head of the ptmc intentionally contaminated the  companys robots with an alien virus
after your rescue in the stunning  opening cutscene you learn that the ptmc went so far to modify the virus as  wellyou will fly a total of three ships in this sequel including the  old pyrogl
weapons run the gamut from the standard concussion missile to  the allpowerful black shark
new energy weapons such as the microwave  cannon add a new twist to decimating enemies and standbys such as the  fusion cannon and plasma cannon make a return
the graphics are  breathtaking and the sound is nothing short of immersivedescent   requires a mhz pentium processor with a mb d accelerator card that  supports directd glide or opengl
i recommend a pentium ii or iii class  machine to get the most enjoyment out the game
certain details can be  turned off to get an acceptible framerate on lowerend machines but it  detracts from the overall experienceif youre a descent fan or a newbie  descent  is a nice to get acquainted with the wonderful world of pc  gamingive been an rpg fan for longer than i can remember and have played around  of emdespite the very harsh review of gamecriticscom i thought this game was actually really good
a nice breath of fresh air from the very linear but nonetheless brilliant final fantasy gameshell sure the story wasnt to die forbut beautiful musicacool combat system and tons of replay value make this one that every fan of the genre should ownall gamers have had the experence of playing a game be it an rpg or anything else they felt had its fair share of flaws but has that one very bright redeeming quality that makes all those flaws take a backseat to that one positivestar ocean the second story is one of those games
star oceans appeal at least in my case can be summed up in a single word combat
star oceans combat system is probably the games most notable feature
the realtime battle system which has a very arcadelike feel to it is a very enjoyable change than your standardfair rpg battles
its just so much fun to destory enemies with a volley a special attacks from you and your allies
the skill system is also a plus as well increasing characters stats and developing other usefull non combat skillsunfortunately the rest of star oceans elements arent quite up to par when compared to the hustle and bustle of battle
graphically star ocean is behind the times no matter where you turn excluding the fmvs
actually the games graphic engine is very simular to a  squareenix title the often overlooked and bashedtonoend saga frontier one of my favorites  yes im serious
the fact the game uses most of the same graphical tricks empolyed by a game two years earlier underlines this factstorywise star ocean  suffers another slightly smaller blow
while the story is generally good it seems to drag on until you reach the second disc where you do more exploring and fighting and the story begins to unfold more
characters arent as developed as well in star ocean compared to other rpgs such as final fantasy or wild arms though the game tries to make a very obvious effort to do this though the use of the private actions system where you enter a location and your characters split up and you can talk to them on a oneonone basis to discover more about them  this affects the outcome of the game in various ways
i will give the developers credit for trying thoughmusically star ocean  has its ups and downs
some of the tunes can be quite annoying but no game score is without its duds
however when you hear the battle themes played near the end of the game for the final bosses which mainly are of heavy rockmetal variety all is foregiven
soundwise the characters various soundbites during battle are cute at first but become annoying really quickly how many times can you remember claude saying thats around  points after a battle  too many to admit when im sobereven with its flaws star ocean the second story is an above average rpg
while im not sure if i would call it a classic  i would recommend it to anyone who had the time or showed interest in the genrethe storyline characters and music are all incredibly good
i could play this for hours and not get boredonly con is some stuff is so frickin cryptic
you have to look at a guide or you will miss many things while playing
i spend half my time playing with my head in a guidei must saythis game is alot of fun there are many many many endings so replay value is great
i thought i would hate it i dont care much for the quotspritequot type char but after playing for just a hour  making your own weapons food goods well it was a blast
i would buy this 
an well i have game was in very good condition it wasent as good as star ocean  in my opinion but it is a great part of my collectioni really liked this game
i played pen  pencil dungeons  dragons for years so i have an appreciation of the dungeonmaster concept behind this game
dungeon keeper  is a blend of realtime strategy basebuilding and simdeveloping but the real treat is being able to play as naughty as you wantand be rewarded for it
there are a few things that i would change about dk but overall i found it quite enjoyable even years after its initial releasegameplay there are three different gameplay modes
first there is the campaign which includes several mission in which you snuff out the lairs of heroes and rival keepers on your way to dominating the region
typically you build a base by tunneling out rooms and finding gold attract a legion of monster henchmen while doing so and then take on the forces of your rival
there is enough variation in the missions to prevent boredom although there are a few very tough missions especially the last two
there is also a skirmish mode that lets you fight against  rival keepers while fighting off other interlopers
the skirmish game can be customized in various ways although there are only about  maps
finally there is a my pet dungeon mode for those who just want to build their subterranean masterpieces without being troubled by opposition although you can choose to include setpiece battles against heroes
all of the gameplay modes have their appeal though i liked the campaign and skirmish the best
the game can be played online but i suspect there is not much of a multiplayer community these daysthe game is fairly easy to play once you master the controls
youll need certain rooms in place lair hatchery blacksmith prison torture chamber and library to really get things going along with a number of choice spells heal rally make gold that can be researched at the library
you have limited control of your creatures beyond being able to drag and drop them
you can take direct control over a creature with the possession spell and even have a number of creatures follow you
this puts the game into firstperson perspective which can be fun but not all that useful in later stages of the campaign
but again the real joy of the game is all of the naughty things that you can do like torture captured heroes in your custombuilt torture chamber have corpses drug to your graveyard where they might eventually attract a vampire to do your bidding or summon the godlike horny devil to turn the tide of a battle
a fully fleshedout dungeon feels almost like a small town under your control and you can spend hours just admiring and tinkering with your handy work or trying to keep your minions happy
and though a somewhat dark game dk has more than its share of humor from the vincent pricelike narrator to the casino that gives you a ridiculously funny treat if one of your monsters hits the jackpot
the game never comes across as cheesy or trivial but it obviously does not take itself too seriousgraphics for a game that came out in the late s dk looks pretty good
models are detailed enough to be credible representations of various monsters and animations are pretty decent
some models such as the enemy hero lords are used too often but otherwise the visuals are good enough to allow the game to immerse yousounds the game does have enough sound effects to convince you that it takes place in an underground dungeon
however the best sounds are the voice acting which is topknotch all the way around
the narrator is both sinister and hilarious and the enemy heroes are overthetop in their arrogant dismissive attitudes toward evil
the music is okay but not particularly grippingtechnical issues the game has been quite stable on my system even though i have xp with service pack  be sure to install the latest game patch before playingreplayabilityvalue i picked this game up new for about  on ebay so i certainly got my moneys worth
i dont see much replay value in the campaign though i can imagine replaying it again at least once
the skirmish mode is decent and there are enough maps to keep you playing for a while
if you are looking to play online im afraid youll have a hard time finding a gameprosgreat concept for a gameterrific voice actinga few different gameplay modesthe dark humor is spot onits good to be badconsno online community at this pointa few frustrating campaign missionsno modding community to speak ofthis game is a hoot
taking the originals overthetop evil to a new level in graphics and a far improved firstperson engine it basically polishes and refines the gameplay of dkyou control a variety of  minions from goblins to dark angels with a variety of wants and needs  all toward the larger purpose of wiping out the good in the world
and a  simpering pompous sort of good it is full of bloated speech and poseurs  who care at least as much about how good they look as they do about  fighting evilmuch like bullfrogs populous the beginning however  there isnt a lot of game here
its more of a puzzle game than a realtime  strategy game and once you solve the puzzle actually enacting it is  usually pretty straightforward
like ptb the beginning levels are easily  won by accident making this a good game for children if you dont mind the  quotsuggestive contentquot
actually all there is is that the pain  mistresses enjoy being tortured
but were not talking about quotsoldier  of fortunequot violence or quotpanty raiderquot sexuality  here
anyway the aesthetics of it the humor the quotmy pet  dungeonquot feature and the overall attention to detail make it a hoot  to explore even if it doesnt have a lot of depth particularly for casual  gamers with a dark sense of humordungeon keeper  is a great game
the plot is that you build a dungeon to attract creatures to fight heroes to get portal gems to give to the horned reaper who collects them to get to go to the overworld our world
sadly this never happens because number  was canceled but the game is a hidden jewelyou can build all of the normal dungeonesque rooms eg
prisons gladiator pits and torture chambers
you can recruit many creatures from the usual demons and undead to the odd imps and goblins
the reason i rated the game  overall is because of the incompatibility between dk and xp
the game works on my xp for about an hour then it crashes or freezes
the patches also wont work because some goon deleted patch  to  which is what you need to get the rest all the way to 
confusing eh
if you think you can have fun for an hour or get it to work then i strongly suggest you try the game
you wont be disappointedwe waited quite a while for dungeon keeper  to come out and bought it immediately when it did
on one hand its great for a sequel
people who played dk will easily be able to pick up on moving units building rooms  lining corridors with trapsthe graphics are better in the sense that  theyre more geared towards future development
instead of pixelbased  graphics the creatures and rooms are now drawn with polygons
while that  makes some of the monsters look clumsy it does mean that future graphics  will be much smoother and cleanergoing down into your dungeon by  possessing a creature does not cause the creatures to turn into a cloud of  dots  the rooms you roam through are still crisp and easy to see
roaming  through your own dungeons is one of the true pleasures of this game  toothere are only a few extra rooms  youd have hoped for much more  from a sequel that took this long to make
the casino is neat if only  because a jackpotwinning minion starts dancing and singing when he wins
disco inferno
rooms have better graphics though
the henhouses in  the hatchery the onwall bookshelves and torture racks everything shows a  subtle touchif choosing between dk and dk id definitely recommend  people get this game
the challenges and gameplay in dk are better than  dk and dk has many new extra features like pet dungeonsnew players  will appreciate having a well crafted game that is a fun challenge while  experienced players will appreciate the subtle differences between the old  and new versiondont expect a masterpiece of sequelhood but do expect  a fun strategy gaming experience that will last quite a whilealien vs predator is the best quotalienquot game released to date i was actually fond of alien trilogy and has a lot going for it
you can play as a marine alien or predator
playing as the alien is the easiest  and is pretty difficult to master as first
you will need to climb on  walls learn to pounce and sneak up on your targets
as the predator you  will need to use your fast arsenal of weapons visions and invisibility  features to win
the scariest and most fun character is the marine
you  will need to collect weapons health and watch your back at all times
you  never know when an alien is around the corner
and if you see or hear a  face hugger you better start shooting or run for your life
if one gets  you you will jump from your seat
the only drawbacks is that the save game  feature is lame if you download the patch otherwise there isnt a save  game feature and the game will give you extra levels at the end only if  you beat the game at a higher difficulty
other than that if you like the  alien movies get this
i give this title a bi bought this game long time ago back then it was pretty cool but the game has no story to it plus your only supposed to run from point a to b shooting any moving object you go by except for the alien he cuts his way through thats  the whole storybut the plus side of the game i that you can play three differnt charectors each with there own special abilities
plus look out for the place called fury  thats where the story of alien   takes placeoverall a very good game but get alien versus predator  its way betterthe game has done a great job at capturing the overall atmosphere of the alien and also the predator movies
the weapons are the same as seen on tv heck even the sound effects are the same
play the game as the marine alien or predator
great plot great action great gamethe marines smartgun is reason in itself to buy this title
simply deliciousthe singleplay is too hard and dark and the scariest of all timemultiplayer is funjust buy this game for horror fan fpsi reccomend it
also what is good is dsound support from eax creative labssonic adventure was the start of sonics modern appearence its an excellent game and the storyline will send shivers of joy down your back it was also the first game to allow you to raise chao its really cool also try the sequel sonic adventure  its got an even better storyline and is the first appearence of shadow the hedgehog and rouge the batquotsonic adventurequot starts off easily and its easy to get the hang of
however it may be a little too easy
there is a lack of puzzles and the bosses are pretty simple
i guess im the person that likes rpgs like zelda and grandia ii
the story is hohum but once you get into it the story really breaks off in different directions when you see the game through the eyes of the six characters you can play with
thats the main reason i gave it four stars instead of two
also the graphics and sound are good
my only gripe about the sound is when characters are talking their mouths speak japanese but they speak in english
that is if you have the language set on english
im not sure of this but i am sure that their oral movements definately arent matching what they say
overall its worth the pricesonic adventure is one of the most important games of sonics history being it was the first d sonic the hedgehog gameif you recall on the sega saturnsonic xtreme was going to be d but it was cancelledsonic d blast was isometric not dsonic r was d but it was a racing gamesonic world was d but it was in sonic jamsonic jame was a compilation of the first  sonic gamesthe hub worlds are amazing and so are the action fieldsit makes sense to have you complete all the stories to get the final story it was repeated for a few until  we all know what happened thenthe camera oh god the camera i have so many times due to the camera which is why my rating is  starsthis game could have been a classic but it isnt
the game has been developed under a very strict deadline and because of this youll often get the feeling that things shouldve been tweaked a bit
dont get me wrong it still has got plenty of things in it to justify the purchase but its a darn shame that they didnt wait lets say a month with the releaseive got almost no complaints about the graphics
theyre very good and move very fast
the camera doesnt always cooperate though and that can sometimes be very annoying
it also seems that tails hovers a bit over the landscape so he doesnt let himself be controled fluentlythe difficultylevel of the sonic and tails campaign is okay although sometimes its a little too easy
i didnt find the knucklescampaign quite entertaining
in each level youll have to find  emeralds adventurestyle
this isnt fun because the sonicgames are fun because theyre fast and pretty much straightforward
with knuckles youll sometime be looking for an emerald for five minutes
the robotcampaign is far too easy but has a very original and even moving storyline
youll have to find out for yourselfthe leveldesign varies from pretty good snowlevel to simply amazing amusementparkleveloverall its a pretty good game that couldve been better
it doesnt cost all that much thoughsonic adventurewhen the dreamcast first came out this was one of the games you had to have
sonic being the cornerstone of sega was expected to be segassuper mario  although it failed to meet that expectation they did create a fairly fun game
i still think if you own a dreamcast that this needs to be in your collection
if you dont own a dreamcast there is no reason to find one just for this gamegraphics at the time these were really good graphics
they couldnt stand up tosoul calibur but it was still solid
many problems lie within the graphics though
the level design is poor
the adventure zones are small and yet have a loading screen every time you walk through a door
action zones are sometimes better like in twinkle park but not usually
the camera has all kinds of problems
you will become annoyed very quickly if you find yourself in a small room and the camera is caught
the graphics are smooth and have some good details but overall the level design is just uglystory this is probably the best aspect of the game
in this game you dont just play as sonic you can play as five other characters tails amy knuckles e and big
you cant just pick whoever you want you have to start as sonic and earn other characters
one you earn another character you can go play through their stories
you earn other characters by meeting them in the game
so the stories sort of intertwine
you never wonder what other characters were doing because you can play as them all and figure out
other than that the story is you basic sonic story
dr robotnik is causes havoc and you have to stop him
its just interesting because it shows how the story affects all the characters in the gamesound your basic sonic sounds
you have some decent music here and there and that stupid jump noise
a lot of music is reused over and over again
the sound in this game is just above average and has nothing special about itgameplay although they added in the ability to play as different characters this is still a very bad gameplay wise game
as sonic you go through the longest portions of the game
sonics story is probably one of the most interesting and well worth your time
tails consists of you racing sonic to try to prove that you are just as good as him
this is fairly fun but you are practically just replaying a portion of sonics game
as amy you will be protecting a bird
you have a hammer as a weapon which is at least a little interesting
as big you have to fish to find your friend froggy
this is a change in pace but it is poorly done and very annoying trying to catch that stupid frog
knuckles can glide and climb on things
as knuckles you are looking for pieces of crystals
this is fun but far too easy
as e you are working for robotnik for most of the game but you also get to play the aftermath
he has probably the easiest game in the entire game as he uses a gundifficulty  note this is how much i like the difficultythe game is either extremely easy or it is annoying like bigs is
the game can be flown through
the only thing that keeps the length up is the multiple characters
even with all the characters this game can easily be beat within  days
i know the game is based for a younger audience but it could offer a little challenge
the only hard part in the entire game is the final th character you unlockoverall this game is a fun game worth playing it just fails at being a truly entertaining experience
if you own a dreamcast i suggest you buy this game
if you dont own a dreamcast forget you even read this review and go buy something awesomesonic is back and is looking like he never has before
this game is very fun and addictive
it has awesome graphics and has tons of levels
the only bad thing i can think of about this game is it is a little to easy
you can unlock up to six characterseach with their own adventure
you can play minigames and replay previous levels
this is a great game and no one should miss out on itthe short version graphics  sound  control  fun factor  total this is a sonic game in d that about sums it up
everything you would expect from a traditional sonic game is here
fast paced gameplay great graphics a memorable soundtrack all of the holes to fall in and glitches also
if you go too fast you will often find yourself getting stuck in a wall or falling through the scenery
the camera also seems to have a hard time keeping up with the action
the stages of the game are standard sonic including an ice level a casino level a green hilltype level ect
though many of the features in sonic adventure are just revisions of older ideas there are also some new additions that keep the game fresh
plenty of minigames and multiple characters give the game replay value
despite the minor drawbacks sonic adventure is one game for the dreamcast that should not be missedwhoa
i have never seen such a fastpaced game like this one
after playing the demo on the sega dreamcast generator disk i decided to try to find this and after playing for about  hours i was definently satisfied with it
being a long time fan of sonic sonic the hedgehog   and  sonic and knuckles sonic d blast i was looking forward to this dreamcast title
the graphics are absolutely amazing the music is great and the action is fast furious and entertaining
however i have to deduct a star for the occasional camera angle which somtimes interfered with gameplay
besides that this game is a keeper for all dreamcast owners
get this along with its awesome sequel sonic adventure  asapnice speed and gameplay overall
the only  cons are the camera angles and some of the enviroments arent fully interactive
you cant enter all the buildings with each character
even with that though its a great game and some levels are extremely well matched with the background music red hot mountain
i played this game for nearly three hours before realizing how long id been on it
deffinetly worth the time and money to pick this one upsonic adventure is an instant dreamcast classic that shouldnt be missed by any dreamcast owner
the game features sonic in full d with newly detailed level enviroment
this was one of the first games to launch with the dreamcast and is still one of my favorite dreamcast game
the game features a brand new system called the chao system you basicly take care of them and show them new moves its very simple but youll need to have a vmu card to do it
the game features more then  playable characters
the story in the game is very lame if you ask me they could have done better not to mention the english dubbing is terrible so just stick to japanes language and english subtitlesill make this short and sweet for you
sonic adventure is the best sonic game ever and has great levels awesome d levels and lots of things to do but personally i wanted to beat the storyline instead of that whole chaos thing
im going to make this review short and sweetgoodgreat level desighnawesome d graphics of sonic for the dreamcastlots of playable characters which is really greatthe new chaos growing process but i really didnt do it i just play the storylinesuperb fast pace actionbadhorrindess english dubbingthe cutscenes look horrible even the ingameplay is better then the cutscenessome really bad camera angles ruin the fast pace of this gamei kind of wished it was a sonic only adventurebut ohwellthe uglyrobotnickehehhehoverall sonic adventure for the dreamcast is an instant classic packed with full d enviroment and full d character model and fast paced action with some really great music
some things like camera angles ruin this game and some really bad english dubbing makes it even worse
but overall this game doesnt dissapoint sonic fans and that is why im giving it a out this is still in my opinion the best sonic game ever but it was ruined by some flawsgreat game overall thoughlatesin this game you play sonic the hedgehog attempting to chaos the watery god of destruction from annihilating the world
later in the game five additional characters are introduced into the game  each with their own style of playthere are basically two types of levels in sonic
in action stages the game behaves like any other platform game mario adventure pandemonium crash bandicoot where you run around a d world along a predefined path dodging traps destroying enemies and collection objects
in adventure stages your character is allowed to free form explore  talking to characters and finding hidden objectsthere are also a couple of mini games including a chao breeding simulation which provide additional amusementthe graphics are beautiful to look at and the level design is extensive and complex
the sound effects and sound track are also very well executed although there is no attempt to lipsynch the voiceovers
overall the game is fun and has a lot of replay valueif you expect sonic adventure is just going to be another one of those typical sonic games  think again
sonic adventure is  loads of fun essential for your dreamcast collection
who can own a sega system without a sonic game
i think that is a huge accomplishment for sega because its really hard to find a game out there with a good story line that is appropriate for anyone
the graphics are great
unfortunately you will probably be paying more attention to the realistic scenery than beating the game sonic adventure is rediculously easy
i beat it in  days im  years old
however my  year old cousin spent a lot more time on it it took her about  weeks or so
it basically depends on your problem solving skills and things like that
oh  did i mention the camera problem
this one hurts throughout the game the camera is a major obstacle
you are constanly hidden behind some rock pillar or even the scenery
sometimes this can give you a bit of a headache the camera is so bad it makes you dizzyoverall i give this game  stars  it would have been  if there wasnt that stupid camera problem
also i recommend this game for all ages especially ages around when it came out this game was hugely anticipated
after all the sonic the hedgehog series is one of the most popular in videogame history
was it worth the wait
was it worth the hype
is it worth picking up even nowthe transition from d to d has been much discussed in the past and you can see why
what works great in d doesnt always translate so well into the d world
and when a series makes this sometimes awkward transition there are usually a few hiccupssonic adventure attempts to use level design that gives you the speed of the original games while also featuring puzzle solving and rpgadventure elements talk to people play minigames open doors ect
by featuring several different characters for you to play as the game allows you to play a balanced game sonic blast through stages with nothing slowing you down tails run away like a chicken amy shoot everythign in sight the robot go on a treasure hunt knuckles or spend all your time fishing
big the cat
each of these elements is entertaining in its own right but where the game really shines is the action scenes as sonic and tails
the adventure portion of this game suffers from the same flaw as many rpgs namely you cant find the stupid key to open the door
so the first time through you may hit a few snags
and the some of the more adventureplatformer elements can get very frustrating i hate the platforming section of the snow level and the skydeck level in particular
and of course the collision detection polygon clipping and camera problems are pretty darn buggystill youve got to love this game
the graphics are great some of the levels the first level windy valley and speed highway especially are just plain awesome
everyone should at the very least play this game and true videogames fans should own it
it has flaws that cant be ignored but there are enough moments of greatness how about the part in the temple where you see the stone carving of chaos destroying the world
to more than make up for it
definitely check it outsonic adventure took sonic to an amazing level and it only took  years of sega saturn failures
the first thing sonic does is fight a monster called chaos
after beating chaos the camera turns to eggman who ominously tells himself sonic has no idea what he is up against the perfect start to the game
sonic then goes off to rescue tails from a plane crash starting the first level
emerald coast was a beautifully rendered beach with a beautiful theme and huge d action
the camera shifts and sonic is suddenly is being chased by a giant whale
after that he runs through a tight cave and then finally rescues tails
after a happy reunion eggman steals tails chaos emerald and feeds it to chaos the monster
congratulations you can now play as tails
he can fly
his levels involve racing sonic and eggman just like in sonic r
 and thats about it
the best thing about tails was his inspirational motto i want to fly high
i shall belive in myself
after tails was knuckles who had a totally different story
one night he was rethinking his life and why exactly he was guarding the master emerald when somebody steals the master emerald way to go knucklehead
his levels are composed of finding the master emerald pieces
knuckles wasnt nearly as good as tails
after knuckles comes amy rose sonics girlfriend
her levels focused on platforming while avoiding a robot that decided to chase her
maybe a  year old girl would find amy and her obnoxious theme song cool but the teenage nerd reviewing this finds amy very annoying
big was next and sega really should avoided this idea while in development
big is a big cat according to the sonic team
he really looked like a purple bunnybear creature
his whole goal was to find his pet frog froggy what a clever name
it was torture watching him trudge to some water in the great zones sonic and tails enjoyed
twinkle park was only a lake for big
for sonic it was a bumper car ride followed by intense platforming and the great voices sonic tails amy e gamma and eggman made big even worse
in a dumb voice big constantly shouts froggy
where are ya
thankfully e gamma came after big
gamma is a robot built by eggman
you start out following eggmans orders shoot the sonic doll shoot the real sonic lock amy in jail
after that gamma accidently sees eggman torturing his robot rival beta and starts to wonder if he should follow eggmans rules
like every good robot character gamma decides to betray eggman and find his true destinyspoiler
which sadly is exploding while sad music plays
spoiler overupdate  okay i am almost through with this game and feel like throwing up
the end is very intense with the final egg level almost being impossible due to collision issues and camera bugs but i got through it
chaos actually succeeds and completely destroys the city which is only made worse by the dreamcast  gamecubes jawdropping graphics and the song that plays open your heart really makes me sick
awesomevirtua fighter may have a hard time competing with games such as doa or tekken tag but believe me this was what paved the way for those games
all though it lacks where the others seem to excell with story modes and hidden characters virtua fighter makes up with character variety and a great display of styles drunken style mantis sumo etc
i was shocked at how fun this game was even after playing more modern games
even with new games on the market i think ill be playing this one for a while
the teacher of fighting gamesfirstly virtual fighter tb lacks any sort of graphical polish whatsoever
the game is lacking in graphics when compared to dead or alive  and soul calibur but makes up for it in the technical and deep fighting fighting engine
this makes this a stand out title when compared to the watered down all icing no cake titles mentioned abovethe game is a must have for d fight fans
the characters are fun and the backrounds are decent and they add some strategy to the fighting as they are not simply a flat surfacethe game is a must have please go get it if you have a dreamcastwords cannot describeyou need to feel this game
cringe as pai floors  you with a double toe kick and mercilessly follows up with a jumping knee  to the midriff
cheer as you fight back with a spinning kick as you get up
you nimbly dodge the next kick and fire off a triple punch combo finishing  with a powerful backhanded punch to win the round
watch it on the replay  go on
laugh at shuns everincreasing drunkenness
memorise that sweep  kick movement
gape as you realise fighting games do not have to feature  blazing blue fireballs and super hyper alpha combo breaking double ex  special level three moves
instead heres a fighting game where the  feature is actual fighting
crikeyso why only get to about  oooh level  battle relentlessly until both characters are nearing the  end of their tether
open your attack and watch as the opposition stops it  and fires one back knocking you out
pound your controller through the  floor while screaming quotbutipushedpunchthenquotrecover from  that bout of frustration continue the game and realise that when youre  not frustrated youre having incredible fun
read this review
go to the  store
buy the game
do it nownot sure whether to give this a  or a  this is kind of like a first person shooter like halflife only you are too weak to really get into big  fights
it has some rpg elements but only barely
the graphics are ugly  but i dont really care about graphics
the respawning monsters but not  respawning ammo are annoying and the weapons that break after a couple of  shots are majorly annoying
that alone is reason to have the author  kicked
but despite all of that the game is actually fun to play and the  story is somewhat interesting
you could consider deus ex to be system  shock  since its extremely similar only with better technology and  weapons that dont break as easily although the ammo is still limited   none of these are quake kiling sprees
but ss is a fun game you just got  to keep your expectations somewhat low because there are a lot of little  annoying things herei really cant say enough good things about this game
firstly the code  is rocksolid
its probably the only d game thats ever played on our  clunky home computer without crashing or giving us glitches
it also has  an atmosphere that constantly sends prickles down your spine and encourages  you to do more than shoot everything in sightthis game will scare you
as you fall into the world youll start to jump at every bump and hiss  around you and if you hear a monkey chattering youll probably start  trying to shoot evrtything in sightanother interesting aspect is that  at the start of the game you get to choose if you want to be a straight out  soldier a psychic or a technical minded fellow
the skills that you  choose can allow you to slip through the many traps and dangers in the  gamethe plot is that you are a soldier who has just recieved some  cybernetic implants
you wake up from coldsleep not knowing quite who you  are or how you got to where you are and only have a voice on your comm  telling you what you need to do
youre given help in the form of  cybernetic modules that upgrade your skills and allow you to gain new ones
you pick up weapons from fallen monsters and also gain healing  itemsbut you do more than just shoot things
you have to operate  machinery you gather up bits of crewmembers logs to piece together the  truth you perform chemical analysis on alien organs to find out what they  are and you hack into replicator systems to try and get useful  itemsthere were only two annoyances in this game firstly weappons  degraded after use at a very unrealistic rate and the monsters kept  respawning even if you wiped an area clean of them
but the developers  were kind enough to come up with a patch you can download to fix this  particular problem so its not that big of a dealusually im a  straightout adventure game player and i avoid st person shooters but  ssii changed my opinion of them remarcably
it was great to actually sink  my teeth into something with plotsystem shock  follows many conventions of a roleplaying game with considerable firstperson action involved
like quotthiefquot whose engine was used to create quotsystem shock quot the objective is not  necessarily to kill everything in sight but to achieve the required goals
you play a new recruit onboard a starship fighting against alien viruses  and the ships evil main computer
you start with some initial skills of  your choice and are given chances to improve your skills as the games  progresses
the goals you need to achieve range from mundane to  complicated locating crucial items unlocking rooms restore power to  equipments hacking into terminals scouring dead astronauts journals for  clues collecting chemicals from laboratories that enable you to research  on technologies that help you combat your enemies find tools that repair  and maintain your weapons and so on
my favorite puzzle is finding pieces  of a secret code hidden among the numerous video screens on one of the  levelsunfortunately firstperson combats are not as fun as they could  be
monsters respawn shudder
and depending on the skills you  acquired at the start of the game you may not be skillful enough to combat  efficiently at the beginning and will be prone to dying over and over  again and having to keep restoring your save games which on my pentium ii   with mb takes over  minute per restorealso the  cyberenvironment in system shock which many loved is not in this gamehouse of the dead the arcade is the reason i bought a dreamcast
i played it at a local movie theater about  months ago and realized and i wanted it at home
i did a little research and found out that not only was a home version out it was very affordable and a perfect arcade portthis game is great on the dream cast if you have a light gun if you dont this game is not good
the user interface for the game was designed for a light gun so if you play with a controller it seems unnatural and you have a desaster almost as big as trying to play virtual on without the twin sticks
if you do not have the gun strongly consider buying the quotstringer light blaster amp house of the dead  bundle packquot by pelicanlove the gameyour gary or james or both and you are off to kill goldman the one responsible for the  curian case or house of the dead  you will face an endless number of zombies and kill several bosses
your goal is to stop goldman from destroying all of mankind with his secret weapon which is the final boss of the game
the game is fun for a while but eventually gets very boring
you can play arcade mode or play original
the game bases all on the arcade
you can do training mode which has several shooting events you can do until you get  stars on them
all different things are in this game and what ive explained is not all of iti bought this game so that i can replay my own dreamcast
the game worked great but i did notice that if you are using a never lcd flat screen then the laser gun to play the game will not work
you have to use an old tube tv which i happened to have and it all worked great
my brothers and i spent the entire night playing it i used to play this game in the arcades until my mom would literally drag me outone of the first games released for the dreamcast house of the dead  is an instant classic
the game is identical to the arcade smash with the inclusion of exclusive dreamcast levels and the graphics and detailed zombies will leave your mouth watering
the voice acting is pretty bad though making the voice acting from the first resident evil look like shakespearian acting but that is overlooked by the shoot em up action
a light gun is strongly recommended but the standard dc controler works just as well somewhatthe console light gun game is something of a neglected genre
in the case of the dreamcast that problem can easily be attributed to sega wussing out on releasing their own gun peripheral in light of the columbine massacre
thankfully a number of thirdparty companies were willing to pick up the slack and thus by spending some extra cash you can play this highly enjoyable fragathon the way it was meant to be playedhouse of the dead  gets my vote as the best quottraditionalquot meaning you kill things light gun game available on a home system namcos point blank series i think has it beat in terms of potential enjoyability but thats another kettle of fish
its also one of the hardest
even on the easiest setting with maximum health and credits blasting your way through it is no small feat
most enemies can sustain multiple shots and dealing with several of them at once while not getting cut or bitten or tackled or whatever will challenge all but the fastest trigger fingers
for even more of a challenge just try nailing all of those agonizingly evasive bonus items that appear when you shoot barrels crates etchouse of the dead  is not content to force you down the same path every time you play
depending on how many civillians you rescue and which ones you will be sent in different directions within the same stage and the bosses will vary their attacks accordingly so its impossible to see everything the game has to offer in one session
of course the civillians are typical helpless weenies begging pathetically for mercy and cowering in corners one guy even dies from a single kick to the rib cage if you dont save him in timewimp
their voice acting as well as that of the heroes and villains is unsurprisingly weak but the bmovie quality sort of adds to the feel of the gamegraphics are mightily impressive and pretty atmospheric too the look of a gloomy european town is captured quite wellthe soundtrack while not exactly stellar is certainly passabletheres also a training mode where you must accomplish tasks like blowing zombies off a moving car
its nowhere near as fun as the main game because theres really no margin for error but its a nice touch nonethelesspointing a gun plastic or not at the screen and blasting away is a wonderfully primal visceral video game experience and youd be hard pressed to find a better excuse to do it than this
the high level of difficulty may turn some people off but for those of us who can only go for so long without shooting something its a real treat as well as a great reason to own a dreamcastgory fun and entertaining
yes house of the dead  is all that and then somethe graphics in this game are simply amazing a perfect resemblance to that of the arcade game
the animations and textures are used wonderfully
gameplay is pretty darn solid and the replay value is tremendously good especially if played multiplayerdont listen to those who find this game too quotdifficultquot due to the lack of gun
all you require is a controller some skill and quick reflexesi highly recommend this game to all dreamcastersi like sports games and find many of them are good value for money
but i have found many of the nfl games to be hard to play
if you didnt know  much about the plays etc then it made it even harder
but not as much with  nfl k sure it helps if you know abit about the plays but there is a  feature where the dc can select a play for you
a good way to get started
the graphics are brilliant but still has some problems every now and  again
the ref is at times poorly done and forget about the sideline  graphics
but the stadiums and players are amazing
the few problems the  game does have i am sure will be worked out in nfl k
but overall this  game is a ton of fun with a lot of playabilitynfl k is one of the best football games everfirst of all it has great graphicsit also has great play calling interface and last but not least begginers can get used to the game fastsome of the flaws in this game is that there is no franchise mode and  when you whant to play a season the space to save a season on your vmu
is outrageous  blocks of space leaving you with ten blocks of space leftone last problem is the running game there is know way in hell that your running back is ever going to run for a  yard touchdown because it is amazing just to be able to run  yards in this gamewell i have told you the pros and the cons about the game if you ask me though the cons did not stop me from liking this gamethere are some games that i walk away from either whanting my money back or being truly ticked off but not this onealright ill start off with the badthen the goodthe first bad part of the game that plagues every sport game it takes to much blankin memorygood lord the back says it takes hey they were incorrect sounds like it doesnt make a difference well it doesif it took as much as they say it didi wouldnt have had to delete game files to play itanother thing although the games sound is excellent the voive over becomes repetetive after some amount of hours in gameplaynow to the goodthe gameplay is greatdecently fast with varied difficulty levelshowever if youre playing rookie then you move up to proits almost impossible the learning curve is highbut the graphics look really greatim not comparing this game to its more famous counterpart nflkim saying the graphics are great sound is just as greatand gameplay is excellentyou can create your own playerit has a good create a player modeor even a team
however what really stinks is you cant play with a created team in a seasonthats stupidnow the season mode is pretty coolyou could have fun with this even if you dont like football and if you do like me youll have ablastand with the great price it has it wont put a big bend in your walletsolidi am not a big football person but this game has sparked my interested
i am enjoying the play action the realistic graphics and all the high quality sound
it is worth owningthis is a great game but has some audio bugs that are annoying sometimes a sound sticks and repeats over and over or the commentators who  comment on the wrong team at halftime etcnfl k is a great game for the money  youll have a lot of fun playing
the graphics are great
the gameplay is simple and good
i think its playable even for someone who does not know football but wants to play this game bc of its raved reviews
the play diagrams tell where the players are going doing and the players in play are tagged with control button icons so you know exactly whom your qb has to pass the ball
its great for beginners as well as experienced players
the only problem i see is the inability for a second player to call timeouts
this is actually a big problem
thats why it gets  stars instead of i usually get nba live but when i bought k it changed the way i think about basketball games 
the graphics are good and the gameplay is good 
this was the game i chose when i first purchased mt dreamcast i got it after it was already sold out and now here i am writing a reviewnba k is not the best basketball game for the dc
nba k is better
k  you can play network games has more players including classic players better moves and controls no more not catching a pass or passing the ball to someone out of bounds no more crazy camera angle changes that sometimes cause you a turnover bc you walked backcourt etc
but nba k is a great game
its better than ea sports or anyother bball games out there
the graphic is excellent controls are easy to use and simple and playing against the computer is a good challenge
its quite addictive because it takes a little time to become good
so most likely you will lose to the computer at first even with the best team
dont get discouraged you will become better and so will your players reallythis game is solid and will provides hours of fun
if you want to get nba k but dont want to spend all that money get this game
it is lacking a franchise mode but in all other aspects it is very similar to nba k
the graphics are almost as good as nba k and the gameplay is just as good
there are not as many moves dunks or creataplayer options as in nba k but it is still the second best basketball game on the market
if you are looking for the best bball game get nba k
but if you are looking for a fun and a quality game for a reasonable price get nba ki found the game to be alright
i love the real board game so the i was pretty excited to play the computer versionbut if you are expecting a version exactly like the game this isnt it
there are some changes like  payback and all that
its fun to pick your people and get your house and  all that
its cool how it goes through the decades and all that
if you  liked the game i think youll like the board game but be warned like the  game the mroe people that play the betterive always loved the board game version of quotlifequot  i played it hundreds of times with my family while i was growing up
the computer game version stuck to the board game as closely as possible
you spin the wheel exactly like the board game your little car moves around just like the board game they even copied the board almost exactly
its pretty fun  ive played it a few dozen times and really enjoyed it
i wish that when you are generating your character there were a few more options your character choices are extremely limited but that is the only real fault i could find with the gamethe graphics are cartoonish  but it fits
whenever you land on a spot there is a short little clip showing what happened to you  these are pretty funny
overall its a cute game
it would be perfectly acceptable for kids too  there is nothing bad in the game at all
since its so cheap i definitely recommend getting it and playing around especially if youre a fan of the board gameas the other reviewers point out this is an hillariously addicting little game
the game works find in the windows me environment but ive yet to get it to work in xp i just use a dual boot system to play this gamei just bought the n version of the gameshark and am somewhat satisfied with the results
i own no mercy which is plagued by glitches
gameshark allowed me to gain all that i had lost in the game by unlocking all the secrets
a great peripheral for those who are stuck in a game
unfortunately there are some glitches
apparantly some games wont work with it as my resident evil  kept locking up when i tried it with gameshark
also there are reports of it breaking after a few months of use
all in all a good tool but buyer bewarewhen buying a game shark to use with certain games you should keep a few things in mind
for one this is kind of cheating when playing a game
so if youre playing a really complicated game and youre telling people oh yeah i beat that game in like two days
but you were also invincible and had unlimited ammo its not as much to brag about as someone who used no cheats and beat it in three or four days
on the flipside video games are supposed to be entertaining dont mix entertaining up with ruling your life get out of the house every now and then
anyway theyre supposed to be entertaining and there is nothing entertaining about playing the same level  times in one week trying to figure out how the hell you get on the other side of this wall to flip the switch to open the door youre stuck behind and have to get through in order to get the switch and blah blah blah
you know that whole bit
using a game shark can let help you get through so you could later one day play the game without any cheats and when you run into a wall you can be like heh heh blow it up
or you know whatever it is you figured out with the game shark
it can also help make games that are too challenging for you and make them easier for you
different people have different ideas of entertainment
some like a challenge and some just like to blow things up or walk into a building of about  or  people and take them all out without getting a scratch on them
whether you love or hate them i think everyone owns one or two at one point in their gaming phase
i know i thought they were lame and just taking the easy way out but i have one for my nintendo  game boy color and game boy advanced
i dont have much time to play video games like i did when i was younger but when i do get the time to pick one up i want to be entertained
some days i like a challenge and other days i just wanna fly through a few levels real quick just to pass the time and actually have gotten somewherethese things usually come loaded with tons of codes for games
if you have a lot of games that arent on it you can google the title of the game followed by a comma one of these things  and the word gameshark or gameshark codes
you can also remove games from the gameshark that youll never use
you completely control what codes are loaded into the gameshark and what codes are activeever get tired of playing a video game
just get a gameshark
this product lets you use it to enter codes into any game to modify it
extra lives extra equipment unlimited this or that and anything you want
with the gameshark and its codes you enter the codes once and the gameshark saves them so that you do not have to ever type them again
plus the gameshark comes with s of codes for s of games already preloaded on it
if you get tired of entering codes then there is something on the back of the shark that lets you hook it into your pc so you can type codes on your pc
the gameshark includes with a video that shows you how to make your very own codes
master hackers for games like wwf no mercy and star wars pod racer have even made entire new levels and totally changed the gameive seen some of the reviews and this item is notorious for just dieing
well its cheap enough
it dies ill get another
it does what its supposed to do
cheat your way to victory and enjoy your old games again  make sure the terminals on your game are clean or it wont workmechwarrior  is the sequel to the classic mechwarrior  which made me stay up almost every night
now i must say the graphics are beautiful
the lighting effects are shown well on my creative labs savage
gameplay is  pretty impressive too i use a gravis blackhawk
for keyboard users you do  get a foldout leaflet with all the keys pretty intimidating at first
the  biggest problem with this game is its length and difficulty
the missions  finish way to fast and are way too easy
i beat most of the missions on the  first try
i also finished the game in less than a week
but you  multiplaying on any of those networks
ill probably buy the expansion i  hope its good
there arnt many new mechs too so another disappointment  there
all in all this is a good game but to fully get its value you  have to play against other peopleon a scale of  the graphics in this game are a as for the ai its a they cant figure out how to go around any obstaclesthere are only  missionsi beat the entire game in  nightsits a lot of fun thoughthere  is a tradeoff between fun and frustratingyou will probably play this game  for a long time and i reccomend getting itthe first foremost negative aspect about this game is the fact that it doesnt really have a soundtrack
its only got two songs on the cd and this is quite a shock and disapointment since for example mechwarrior  mercenaries had a full awesome soundtrack
nevertheless the  songs seemlesly integrate themselves into the feeling and the repeats arent that noticeablethe game has a good plot good graphics and good action
in multiplayer its even better but the system of finding a server could have been easier and more straightforward
matching is done via a microsoft website where you can find games and chatrooms and you also need to have installed zonematch a small program similar to msn messenger
in my opinion everything should be incorporated into an ingame multiplayer interface just like the majority of other titles out thereyou along with other troops are sent on a mission to neutralize enemy forces occupying a planet
as you reach orbit the dropships are shot down by enemy forces
you have to fight your way through meet up with your other lancemates that were also shot down and find a way to get off the planet alive while at the same time driving to accomplish your missionthe game puts you in the cockpit of awesome powerful ton humanoid warmachines with enough firepower to level a city
the array of mechs and arsenal wont disappoint
customize your warmachine any way you want and take it to the battlefieldi especially like the mission commentaries video feeds and voice acting theyre very well done and really help create the overall atmospherebe advised
the game out of the box may have slight incompatibility issues with windows xp especially if you have service pack  installed so make sure you grab yourself the latest game update patch from the internet
once patched it runs without any problemsmech warriors  is a game that no doubt has revolutionized the graphics industry
there is no other way to put it the graphics are really great surprising for an older game
the game is so fun and i like the way you can customize the way your bot looks moves and fires
my friend did something that was so cool i do it too
he took one of the heavyweights and put on almost  lrms and two gause riflesprobably the best weaponone on each hand
he then battled several of those tiny robotswhos name escapes meand took em out indian style
it was cruel but totally awesome
i use that tactic almost every time on battle modeif you go to options you can turn off the heat sensorsi hate them and put on invincibility which is also coolfor kids whos parents dont like them getting violent games probably dont want this because of how discusting it is to kill one of the people running on the ground
it reminds me of halflifei think this game is worth it new or used and recommend it to botlovin kidsive loved all of the mechwarrior games they are always so easy stand and pick other mechs off at extreme long range
besides graphics changes the two big changes are a nice zooming rectile to make those longrange shots easier and a mobile field base that will fix you up in the middle of a mission
all of this makes the campaign short just  hours or soi had one glaring problem it wouldnt install or run on windows  maybe i could have gotten it to run if i had hunted down and handinstalled all the files
it ran without a single hitch on windows sethis extremely comprehensive and demanding flightsim appeared back in about  and after release looked like it was in trouble
despite the hype a lot of it deserved falcon or f was dogged by both huge system requirements and numerous bugs
based on the f and following a string of hardcore sims going back to the original falcon of 
 f had been awaited breathlessly by fans and arrived with numerous bugs
mps fs publisher suddenly announced that they were dropping the sim paving the way for fs nearest competitor janes fa to become the top game for fans of highly detailed and demanding hardcore flightsims
by  with the stream of flightsims having stagnated a year old sim still has much to offer  but the sim to beat isnt necessarily fa a great sim to be sure but f rescued and brought to beautiful useability by a legion of online simfanatics
having gained access to fs sourcecode these fans have crafted their own software called service packs which partly patch but mostly expand the original game
ill keep this review confined to the original though
in short  f still has much to offerf is focused on the f the usafs premiere multirole fighter
not an original concept you can fly the viper in campaigns single missions and instant action but f never lets you forget that the proof is in the execution
the flight model is demanding slippery along each of the major directional axes and for a light fighter can lose energy and get heavy really quick
the avionics are also comprehensive  think that multimode radar means airtoair and airtoground
here youll be fiddling with modes even in pure situations in which youll be either primed for counterair or groundstrike missions learning the nuances of rangewhilesearch or trackwhilesearch modes while hunting migs
the range of weapons is wider than on older games  echoing the fs maturation from a small jet that could only fight with irondumb bombs and short range missiles like the sidewinder to a more complex machine geared for smart bombs antiradiation missiles and amraam in night or adverse weather
the enemies arent slouches either although that may have much to do with my failure to master this simfs campaign is set in a futuristic north korea making it more topical than janes fa which has you flying off russias arctic frontier
an elaborate setup menu allows you to tailor realism and controllability
my thrustmater wcsfcs setup was recognized here as quickly as on janes fa unsurprising since they both have to run through windowss control panel  but thank heaven for small miracles nonetheless though fs keymapping editor seems more stubborn than that of the other game
while the game ran well normally using my geforce card the menu appears to offer support only for dfx cards and not opengl the api for that geforce graphicsacceleration
unfortunately f was one of those great games that appeared immediately before the end of dfxs reign as the king of graphics acceleration
not only is dfx a thing of the past but glide the dfx api isnt supported by newer operating systems like winxp
like flanker  you can play glidesupported games on your opengl system and still appreciate how far ahead of their time they were but  stuck in softwareonly mode  never forgetting how long ago that time was
sound was also an issue  with the sim modeling a great range of sounds from the screams and roars of your engine down to the distinctive howls clicks and whistles of each types firecontrol radar but also suffering a lot of stuttering
attention to detail is magnificent
control surfaces and engine nozzles are convincingly animated and the fs trademark shoulder vortices appear in highspeed climbs
you can even customize the skins on both your airplane and those of your enemies
i gave mine the israelistyle camo paint job that appeared in the iron eagle movies now theres an idea for a sim certainly one that cant be more unrealistic than the flick it was based on
the beauty is that while f remains cutting edge by virtue of how far ahead of its time it was and how few new sims have come to the market since then the faster computers that can run f more comfortably are cheaper and more widely availablesystem issues i flew my f on a pentium running at ghz
xp accepted this sim out of the box something else that janes fa couldnt quite claim
performance was largely smooth but became noticeably choppy at times even on simple instant action flights
in more elaborate game play  especially during dynamic campaigns  f reveals itself an incredible hog for just about every resource your computer has the cpu main memory graphics memory etc
worse f suffers an acute memory leakage problem as youd expect it takes a lot of ram to create each of those enemy tanks and soldiers and endow them with ai but not so much that they dont just turn north and run for cover but the program doesnt deallocate or give that ram back as quickly as it takes it away which means that your campaigns will bog down really quicklyin short  if you want a truly hardcore sim one that will make you forget your machines obsolescence consider what your system offers but also remain informed about what each sims fanbase offers
with tech support becoming less supportive for such games f and its competitors from  will always rely on the perseverance of fans to adress their flaws
for either janes or f youll need a machine with an even ghz of processing muscle
opengl owners should consider fa again  no slouch but those owning lategeneration graphics cards based on dfxs voodoo technology should get five played a lot of flight sims but falcon gains most of my respect and time
falcon  truely lives up to its name of the most realistic flight sim around
the game gives you an adrenaline because of the realism and the power of a fighter in your hands
excellent graphics and sounds
physics is without question the best ever
the downside to falcon is that it takes a lot of time and energy to learn
besides having a  page manualwhich you have to read in order to play the game is hard to get used to
especially landing which took me a long time to learn
bottm line once in a life time game but be prepared to be irratatedi have played this game for  years now
its great and addictive and is very different from what i have played before
it draws you in as the scenarios get tougher and your will to beat them skyrockets
the gameplay is good but can lag and the time in the game moves slow
i feel its a good game to play if your bored and you should buy it and try it yourself
beware its addictivei am normally not a real big fan of sim type games so i waited a while to buy this one
i didnt like it all that much at first but after picking it up i really got to like it
this game is very precise and fairly realistic which makes it hard to learn but also a lot of fun to play once you havethe animation and sound in this game are spectacular
you build all sorts of amusement park attractions for your guests and then you watch them walk around your park like little ants
all of the sounds of a theme park are there
the clicketyclack of the roller coaster chains the screams of the riders as the coaster plunges down the hill and the laughs of the children and yes
the programmers even included the cheesy music that they play for the bumper carsanything that moves can be clicked on and examined
the level of precision and the amount of choices that you have in this game are fantastic and sometimes overwhelming
the game consists of twentysome scenarios that gradually get harder
each time that you finish one you get a new challenge which keeps the game from getting too easy as you become more proficientthe roller coasters have realistic physics
this is both good and bad
the good part  if you are a roller coaster enthusiast then you will love being able to design a working coaster
you control everything from the height of the first drop to the colors of the trains
the bad part  designing even a mediocre coaster can get very tedious and expensive
one big coaster will chew up all of your cash and if you are playing a short scenario you probably wont be able to build another one
in addition coasters take up a lot of space and because of this your park usually runs out of it
i have played almost all of the scenarios and i have never really gotten to build the ultimate megacoasterthe one aspect of this game that i found to be annoying was the tendency of kids to get sick from your rides
this aspect of the game was badly overdone maybe the writers thought it was supposed to be cute
even if they dont get sick a lot of them will be afraid to ride it
the park customers are total wimps
you can build a foot tall standup roller coaster with  inversions and nobody will ride it because it is too intense whatever that means
the rollercoaster physics might be realistic but the customer behavior definitely is not
this is one of a few examples of questionable ai in this game
still as a rollercoaster enthusiast i thoroughly enjoyed this gameroller coaster tycoon is a game that is focusing on building an entertainment park
you can build your own themed park rollercoaster gokart track and many more
this game is released years ago and now the price has been dropped
being lowpriced doesnt always mean bad games
i played this game for months a few years ago
it has free mode where you can build your own dream entertainment park
or you can play in mission mode in which you have to meet the requirements for each levelthe sounds in this game is pretty good making you feel as if you are in the middle of an entertainment park
you can hear the screaming of people on the roller coaster the tune of the merrygoround the noise of the crowd and so onif you have good pcs with great graphic card you may want to try roller coaster tycoon  with d graphics with better gameplay graphics and soundsoverall this is still a great game and really worthy
with only a few bucks you can have another entertainment source in your pc for your weekendthis is a good game and my  year old son loves to play it
this game can be installed on a pc running windows xp home edition and will run fine but you can get better performance if you use the windows compatibility wizardthis game is great
it has the same basis as sim city only you control all aspects of an amusement park
you are given objectives for each level that you must complete in order to unlock more levels
once you have completed all the levels you gain the right to build your own amusement park with no restrictions
the best part of this game is the fact that you build the rides individually
you can create your version of the best roller coaster ever and see if the guests like it as much as you do
this game does get repetitive after a while though as every sim city type game doesthis game is very very good because it has the reallife thinking it runs on slow computers like mine it doesnt that that much space up and its fun too
the only probalm with this game is the money there isnt any freeforall levels which makes it lessaddidive there are lots of things to do completing parks takes too long and too hard though
the moneythere is hunger thirst happyness nausa and bathroom i like to rise the money for bathroom a lot so people after it hits really high they have to go
the downside to this game is even if you make a great park if your people have to pay everytime they go on a ride they get broke and leave or get mad trying to find there way out this happened to me so just make park enternce  dollars and everything free
even food what my nd favorite thing to do in the game is make roller costers that stack on each other you can make a roller by just one land by rising the land first not too high though then get a roller coster picked the put the first roller coster path on the high land you made and build on
you can make lots of stuff in a small area
graphics ok this is good but nothing like what today is plus people can get stuck on water rides for no reasons and it isnt perceft on making a good life like roller coster because parts show on and off graphics fun this game is the most addidive game ever
fun gameplay this can last you like  hours gameplay sound this is a bad thing in the game like only the sound of kids and roller costers needs sound overall this game is great if you like fun games get this which is great and  stars goes to roller coster tycoonroller coaster tycoon is a prime example that gameplay will get you a lot longer than shiny graphics ever will
the game may be technically infirior to theme park but rct makes up for this with a much more addictive gameplay
in short rct is probably the most fun youll ever have running a theme park on your pcthis is a great game and remake of the original theme park made in the early s 
it is so addicting and time consuming so make sure youve got plenty of time to waste before you sit down to play
 its definitely a great game although the graphics arent quite up to snuff with todays technology but you get over that
it definitely has challenges too so dont think you can just breeze through the scenarios
a definite buy for your family gameryou know when i first saw this i thought it looked like sim city which i think is a ok game but it gets so boring and after a while it gets dumb
but i went over to my neighbors house and saw roller coaster tycoon for  the first time
its awesome
im going to probably have to force myself to  stop playing it though because its so addicting
you just always want to  add more on to your park and get more guests
in the game your given  levels
each level has a challenge
they give you a certain amount of  money sometimes you can add on loans and a certain amount of time to  get so many guests and have a certain rating for your park
in the ride  department you can choose from either prepackaged things or build your own  roller coasters trains monorails log flumes and more
you can also add  restaurants and mostly anything you can have in a theme park
also if you  keep a level for a certain amount of time you get more attractions and  rides and restaurants
the roller coasters range from regular wooden to  steel to one support steel and any roller coaster you can think of its  awesome
it may be a strategy game but its better than any shooter or rpg  that ive ever played
buy itthis is a very cool game that has infinite replayability
one cool feature that this has is you can click one any person in your park and can see their status if they like your park and where they have been
the best part in this game is obvious you get to build your own amusement park
for people who love roller coasters you must get this game
the short version graphics  sound  control fun factor  total this is a very good game
i used to play this game for hours on end
its a lot of fun
the best part about it is that you dont need to have a supercomputer to play it
for those of you whos computers cant handle rct  buy this game
do not get rct  its not worth the money to buy a slightly worse carbon copy of a great gameits fun and all but still no coaster cam
i wonder why
but the game is still fun
i like the gameplay and i like the fact that it is not hard
and the game is not boring
graphics are goooood and not blockey if you are a roller coaster tycoon fan ther is a web site calld roller coaster tycoon 
com and you can look at stuff for the game
and i like the way you make rides the game makes makeing roller coasters fun and makeing your park fun 
so by thes fun and not hard game now you will love itthis game is one of the best out there
you dont need a supercomputer
in fact this is one game where the requierments will let it run just fine
pros very addictive fun realistic low requierments
cons very easy time consumingthere are time limits but you need to wait until the time expiersvery annoying
overall this game is well worth the money expesaly if you buy loopy landscapes the expainsioni bought rollercoaster tycoon a long time ago
this game is pretty exciting for anyone who dreams of running their own theme park
you can build from over  different rollercoaster plus you can build your own race tracks and alot of other exciting rides
but the fun doesnt end there
you have to put up food stands bathrooms trash cans shops and some nice scenery to keep your guests happy
you have to build thrilling rollercoasters for the intense guests but if you build a rollercoaster that has too much intensity nobody will ride it
thats the challenging part of the game
but not all people like rollercoasters
a lot of people prefer gentler rides such as go karts or the merrygoround
you can also hire entertainers to help keep your guests happy
when your guests are complaining about how long your line is just pop in an entertainer right there and it will cheer up the guests and in no time theyll be on the ride
you also must hire mechanics guards and custodians to clean up the park and take out the trash
if you dont build good rides and dont have enough scenery and shops then your guests will be unhappy and destroy your benches and trash cansthen you gotta replace them
you can help stop vandalism by hiring a few guards that patrol the park
so those are just the main reasons why i like this game
you can build about jsut anything you can imagine
so why did i give this game  stars
well because this game gets very boring after a while
im into multiplayer games like quake  arena or starcraft
but whenever i come home from a theme park i wish i still had this game
i may even buy it again
trust me this game is a hit for all you people who like to be the bossthis game wasnt very challenging but fun nevertheless
the idea is to build a roller coaster park which may also include thrill rides gentle rides and water rides
the people whom you can see in your park even as you build roam your park
you can spy on each ones thoughts
you need to keep them from getting thirsty or hungry and provide bathrooms
you need to make sure they dont vomit often and clean it up when they do
you can build any roller coaster yourself or choose from preset designs
building roller coasters is a bit of a challenge since it can be hard to connect the end to the beginning but they can fit the given space more easily than preset ones
its important to balance your budget and keep track of prices
this game is easy to win but takes a long time to play
i recommend this for anyone who wants a laid back simulation and for people who want to build the ultimate roller coasterthis controller is very good for what it is
if you need a usb controller for nes snes or playstation emulation this is a good one to get
i bought two of them for nessnes emulation and i have no major complaintsthis pad comes with a small joystick you can screw into the dpad which is awkward and youll never want to use
the only problem is that when you have the stick unscrewed the center of the dpad has a threaded metallic hole which can slightly irritate your thumb after a few hours of playing
despite this minor flaw while its not the greatest controller you can buy at this price its an excellent valuei had to write a followup review now that about  years has passed since my last one and two sequels to this game have been published
despite playing the newer games i dusted off and fired up my old copy of jedi knightmystery of the sith jkmots and had a blast
the two are obviously dated but dont suffer as much in comparison in terms of game play as the original dark forces circa  had in light of jkmots
like df all the games in the jedi knight series are first person shooters
jkmots added the lightsaber and force powers with an enhanced game engine  besides better graphics and sound it was now possible to combine moth horizontal and vertical head movements using the mouse df had separate buttons for vertical looking which made the interface feel exceedingly clunky in comparison
also basic movements were more natural  you never had that feeling prevalent in df that you were a golf cart instead of a personbut above the improved engine jk excelled because it was as much a sw experience as it was a game  with a tight story line excellent level design and filmed fmv cut scenes
most people hated the cutscenes  poorly acted and not very effects laden  but i loved them they added to the movielike feeling and anyway attack of the clones had horrible acting and scenes that went on much longer you never had that feeling of other shooter games where you suddenly stopped and wondered  ok where am i what am i looking for and why am i hitting all of these buttons
the story returns prorebel mercenary kyle katarn to the fore
learning that his father was killed by an evil dark jedi named jerec kyle sets off on a mission of revenge
soon he learns more  that jerec rules an entire faction of imperials intent on locating the lost valley of the jedi also featured in jedi outcast
the burial place of countless jedi the valley also holds a bottomless reservoir of their force power
the plot has kyle tracking a traitorous droid named t from nar shadaa to his fathers home planet of sulon the droid decodes a map leading to the valley  the map is then destroyed
great level design makes each player map seem less a map than a place that must be navigated
ai suffers in terms of the imperial troops  who prove bad enough before their blasters are forcegrabbed away
balancing that out the game is generous with boss modes  sending you up for  lightsaber duels with the dark jedi including the climactic duel with jerec
personally i hated the saber duels  they always seemed to boil down to hopping and slashing with sabers
jedi outcast is most improved in that respect  there are much better looking duels and more of them
your force powers are divided between generic powers speed jump sight and those specific to light heal persuasion or dark lightning forces
your reliance on dark or light powers and your ability to keep from killing various innocent bystanders will determine whether you are a light or dark jedi
the consequent difference for one side or another is not that great  mostly it determines which of jerecs evil jedi you will fight in one of the latter duels and which cut scenes youll watch
sound and graphics compare well with the newer games and the overall plot makes you feel like youre in a star wars moviethis edition also comes with mysteries of the sith  a companion disk that uses a slightly altered game engine and was originally released separately but otherwise required jk be installed
in mots you play katarn for the first several missions then assume the role of mara jade a former imperial agent brought to the light her character was introduced in the novels of timothy zahn
the tight plotting of the first game is gone  replaced by looser story arcs as kyle you must save a rebel base from an imperial ground assault then destroy an orbiting asteroid the imperials are using to stage their attack as mara you will infiltrate the palace of kapa the hutt and then in a switch go to work for him you will also track down and try to retrieve a jedi holocron and save a rebel corvette from marauding pirates eventually you will follow kyle back to a mysterious planet of the sith where its dark and swampy the locals are hostile and hungry and your weapons dont work
if uneven mots has its share of thrills and challenges
ai is noticeably improved with stormtroopers ready to go fisticuffs when their blasters are forcegrabbed and gameplay is much more challenging on the whole
should you tire of the levels provided an entire online community has crafted single and multiplayer levels for both gamesin short both games are still great values and enjoyment isnt terribly undermined by your having played jedi outcast  though its obviously not the mindblowing experience of  still its aged better than the spice girls
if youve got a p  its just an excuse to turn the graphics up to excessive
i first played this on my pmmx computer with voodooii graphics acceleration and enjoyed every minute
on my p i had no windows xp problems and was able to crank graphics to the fulllucas arts has come out with some notable fiascos over the past few years as far as games are concerned
force commander xwing vs tie fighter which is only good in multiplayer starfighter etc
this is one of thier outings that i actually would rate at   stars and is one of the most misunderstood and underrated games to come out of george lucass computer game brainchildthe premise is simple
you are given control of either the empire under emperor palpatine or the rebel alliance under mon mothma
if you start out as the imperials youll get a significant advantage in technology and capital ships as well as more developed worldsplus you have a bonafide jedi in darth vader who can detect and train jedi students as he discovers them making these officers even more valuable more on this later
the rebels start off with nd rate capital ships and planets that are far flung for the most part
thier base is moveable and under the circumstances thats a good thing since part of the imperials goals is to destroy the rebel baseill try to simplify this game but its not an easy task
depending upon the size of the galaxy you have picked small medium huge etc your goal is to colonize planets and develop them use diplomacy to introduce other cultures either into the rebellion or the empire or outright conquer enemy planets
these planets can then be equipped with varying tools to make use of thier inherent commoditiesfor instance one planet might have multiple shipyards for building your navy while others might be resource sytems used only for mining and maintaining your credit flow
characters in the game each have inherent usessome can do ship research others can be used for diplomacy while others can be sent to sabotage enemy worlds and ships
if the character has been detected to be a force user then a jedi knight or master can begin to train them resulting in a character with increased scores for thier particular specialty
in addition characters can be places in positions of authority either in fleets or on planets
admiral ackbar can lead one fleet while lando calrissian can general it thus resulting in your fleets doing more damage and taking less hits in battlesresearch is a lot of fun and can be begun almost from the beginning in one of three areas
ship research new ship designs fighters etc building design new planetary shields improved shipyards and troop design dark troopers sullastan regiments
typically whoever has a leg up in research has an easier time controlling the game and its highly recommended that if you find any npcs wedge antilles can do ship research bevel lemelisk can do all three typesto start asapthe part everyone wants to know about though is the gigantic ship battles and man they can get epic
theres nothing like seeing  rebel ships do battle with the same number of imperial ones and engagements can run up to  minutes
the graphics of these battles are a little dated by todays standards but still seeing a calamari cruiser turn sideways to exchange broadsides with a star destroyer is a sight to see
fighters swarm around the whole time sniping at enemy fighters or helping engage the big capital ships
theres different options for your ships to maneuver into position for attacks but as far as i can see theyre for the most part pointless as both fleets typically run straight for the other and begin duking it outsingle player is fun but gets dreary after a while especially if youre playing as the rebels
the imperials generally name thier ships at the beginning but the database for ship names must be shallow because soon after youll start seeing such inspiring names as carrack cruiser  or star destroyer 
and the most glaring deficiency in single player mode is that the imperials will never build a death star
ever
leading me to want to shout the death star plans are not in the main computerthis game becomes sterling in multiplayer though and if you ever wanted to play a strategy game on an almost epic level this is definitely a game you want to check out
a human will almost invariably play by different strategies than the computer will and oftentimes youll find different and sometimes very unique methods employed for winning
my brother tends to build zillions of fighters on each planet he owns making capital ship conquest almost impossible to accomplish without matching the number of fighters in your own fleet
my nephew builds heavily into capital ships with a mixed escort screen basically heavy on planetary bombardment
i tend to make a mixture of the two aiming for a well rounded task force
and when turn  hits and youre still grappling for control of the galaxy with your opponent well lets say that it never wears down on you
if ever you get a chance to build a death star do it
it is an incredible rush to build one secretly moving it suddenly and unexpectedly into your opponents main manufacturing planets orbit and then hitting destroy planet watching half of his shipbuilding capability go up in a blaze of smoke and rubbleunless you have a lan at home and know someone who wants to try this gem of a game out the only place youll be able to play is on gamespy and internet gaming zone but expect games to be very long and drawn out sometimes lasting as much as a week depending upon how often you have to save and reloadthe mediocrity of the single player game is more than made up for in multiplayer
trust me and grab a copy and see for yourself anyone ever play privateer armada
this really reminds me of that allot
the great sweeping star wars saga has been replaced by nothing more then a third rate game of chess
the special effects are cheesy and the socalled battles take forever
save your money and dont buy this oneif you want a great star wars game get xwing or xwing alliancestar wars fans should be grateful for this gamethis is a  strategy game and even in the galactic battles you need to double think which spaceship to send against whichthe idea of the game is simple manage your economic resources wisely as well as your politics and military to gain supremacy over the other sideyoull need to select destinations for your mines refineries development labs training facilities etc so as to maximize output and grab the most out of themone thing you have to take into account is how changing the game is in some part you can be lured to assume youll wipe out your opponent in a couple of turns when you angrily realize he has taken control of  or  of your planets leaving you with most of your spaceyard or building facilities out
get enough patience because the game is long and pretty hard to understand but once the efforts been made its really worth itsweet
ive been around since the original xwing and im glad to see the advances
remember the original floppydisk xwing for msdos
the ships were nothing more than  a few singlecolored polygons and the hud  only showed a picture of the ship not the actual moving ship
plus you  had  ships well okay  ships after the bwing expansion pack to pick  from
the dumb racing track took over ten minutes to go through one lap  and the missions were close to impossible
but we didnt mind because that  was the best a computer could offer back then
well not weve got  extremely detailed ships with moving gun turrentswow
  with d  accelerated graphics over  ships you use about  of them in the real  game many more in multiplayer you can fly and newfangled light sources
plus you go into the death star on this one
it isnt like that  twocolored gray surface from xwing
now its got  million colors
unfortunately some of the difficulty from xwing moved over to xwing  alliance
its just a wee bit hard
some missions will have you laughing  at the enemy while others will make you slam your computer desk
fortunately you can put it on easy mode cant do that in xwing
plus  some of the mission objects may seem a bit too much to handle
but i think  this is only a minor problem
a few missions stand outlike one where  you jump out of hyperspace directly in front of a super star destroyer
for the uninformed a ssd is a big mutha ship that you shouldnt go  nearheck its so bad that youll only see one in the whole game
overall youll find a great space combat game in this package
go  onbuy itbesides being the latest and likely last
of the xwing games alliance is also the best  bringing the series back from the hole it sat in after xwing v tie fighter to the epic trail blazed by the original tie fighter
the real question though is whether its improvements make it worth getting to players who bought the older gamesunlike the older xwing games you dont start out as a fighter pilot or even with alliance or imperials for tie fighter owners
instead you belomg to a familyrun intergalactic shipping business plying lawless tracts of space
in a time of civil war your family tries to stay neutral even as its split along prorebel and imperialloyalist sides guess which side youre on
despite its seemingly civilian trappings interstellar freight forwarding involves a lot of space combat  youre armed with turbolasers and ioncannon and equipped with deflectors
though you wont face imperials immediately combat will come quickly  forcing you to fend off the viraxo your familys hostile rivals
as the war progresses the viraxo leap to the empires side forcing you to the rebellion and trade your corellian freighter for an xwing fighter
until then the game offers a series of missions that evolve from tutorial to modest test to more intense combat
youll likely already have the skills needed if youve played the older sw fighters games but these also set up the back story
on an interesting note scifi fans may note a resemblance between the viraxo fighters and the angel fighters from captain scarlet
the game climaxes with the epic battle of endor in which you take on the nd death star from the inside in a mission i like to refer to as operation watchthatoverpass
as in older games you fly alongside and against ai pilots though theyre more chatty than before including a motormouthed droid named mkay who makes cpo sound positively mute making the dialog sound more natural than it should
that is until youve replayed the mission a few times and it all starts to get old
alliance is a mixed bag of hits and misses
ties to the original xwing of  are painfully clear in terms of graphics and gameplay  this is still about flying canned missions in linear order in which you must complete by fulfilling a set of specific and not infrequently counterintuitive goals ie no matter how many tie fighters you swat down all lambda shuttles must dock with the medical frigate all correlian cruisers must survive you must inspect every container etc
counterintuitive mission goals guarantee that youll fly even moderately challenging missions more than oncegraphics and sound are uptodate  the date unfortunately being   the big news is that you can now padlock those enemies or missioncritical craft  which is great not only for improving your situational awareness but also because you can view the insides of your ships flightdeck this is a huge leap over previous games which essentially gave you d renderings of the same flight panels weve seen since 
while shading and lensing effects are also added i usually get too focused on the enemy to really appreciate them
im also not enough of an audiophile to comment on the sound though the sound effects and john williams score remain as expectedly faithful to the films as weve come to expect though on my xp machine the soundtrack tended to get hung if the mission lasted too long
the mission areas seem larger and you now seem to have even larger numbers of enemies to fight against clouds of fighters instead of just swarms
also you may now have to zoom into different areas via hyperspace buoy in a single mission  although i just find that increases the chances of running into bugs that make missions unwinnable
also failure to achieve goals in one of the mission areas means that youll have to refly the entire mission set againthe games most revolutionary improvement isnt technical at all  relying on a story that at first makes you more than just another faceless rebel flyboy
looks like somebody at totally games fired up a copy of the orginal tie fighter and was reminded why that game was so much more popular then xwing
instead your fight is for survival against greedy competitors soon to become a personal vendetta against the empire
characters you meet between missions including mkay and other vengeful relatives advance the plot and keep it focused throughout successive missions
even when you join the alliance youll still be asked to handle some family business
if anything the story could have kept you out of the rebellion a bit longer or at least made the transition a tad smoother  the story loses something once you become a rebel pilot though manages to hold onto you anyway
other notable improvements  besides fighters you can also fly armed freighters in the class of the millenium falcon or another class of ship that looks like a souped up version of the mf
to add to the complexity you can turn over the actual flying and man your gun turrets or set turrets to defensive fire  while that reduces the laser fire you can devote on targets you attack while flying its another example of how the game challenges you by forcing you to allocate your limited inflight resources
other new wrinkles  as a freighter you can pick up cargo which makes for interesting missions retrieving contraband from a combat zone
in an early mission youve got to snatch a container of warheads from a space station under attack by a star destroyer  the way the mission is structured you cant retrieve until near the end of the mission when the station is about to explode
most pcs should run this game without problems
i played it on my p having few winxp compatibility problems sound among them
the game also supports rudder pedals  for rolling maneuvers such as those used by scores of tie fighters
in short an xwing battlesim thats guaranteed to please though obviously pleasing most those whove never tried one beforethis game is great and it is a great game overall in order for lucasarts to strike back at eidoss tomb raider for trying to take away indys title of the greatest adventure dude out there
the game is one of the best i  have played but if you do the wrong thing the game crashes
most of  these problems can be fixed by downloading patches at lucasartscom but i  really hate the hassle this causes
make sure you know how to get a patch  if you get this gamei had big worries about this game
i used to play the old point and click adventures of indy and i was worried that like its predisecors this would be insanley difficult
thankfully it is not
i am a bad puzzle solver and luckily with the exception of the pyramid of the sun dial puzzle none of the puzzles are that hard
the graphics are quite nice and the levels are gigantic and tempt lots of exploration
all of the characters are well done and interesting
the music is nice and you have a lot of neat weapons to choose from
however this game does have some flaws
first off sometimes you will be walking around wondering what the heck you are supposed to be doing
second some of the enviorments are way too big
the third and biggest flaw is that the last levels are way out of place
the nd to last is strange but acceptable but the last level is wayyyy out of place
the last flaw is that the ending is really dissapointing
overall this is a fun game that will take up a lot of your time and is definatly one of the better lucasarts titlesthis was a really fun game to me
i enjoy challenges and puzzles and this game offers many of each
they got the sarcastic one liners of indy down pretty well though it would have been a lot cooler if harrison ford voiced it
the game has an intriguing story though somewhat far fetched but its a game
the graphics were a bit on the mediocre side for the requirements but it didnt take away from the game play
the controls are good but i find sometimes they dont respond like they should
my only real complaint is how linear the game is
there is only one way to go and that doesnt make the puzzle solving the most fun sometimes
good game overallthis is a great follow up to fate of atlantis and its nice to see indy jumped into d
the textures are really nice and it carries a lot of typical indy puzzles
sure it looks  a lot like tomb raider but you know indy was there first
this game needs to be ported to ps
the only downfall is theat the programming is a little tempermental in win but then again what isnt
plus there are patches for this game
this is worth the buy
you wont be disappointedwhen this came out everyone went crazy because it was new and the games were on discs
which is much eaiser and handier to keep clean and take places
most people had a n before this and even at the same time so they were used to the cartridges which were big and bulky and somewhat annoying
it has two memory card slots and two controller slots and it can play compact dics so you can listen to music when your bored on your tv with your own cds
most games on this console had good graphics back then so people thought it was amazing
they became highly addicting and very fun to play
this became the most popular system in the usa and almost everyone had one back then
many games get scratched and broken as time goes on since they are old but try to keep them in their own cases they came in so they will play better and much longer with out the annoying freezing and skipping of the game
i am saying this because many games will not play or work anymore because of the lost case so they were just thrown around in the closet untill i finally put them in a computer case way back whennow i am more protective of the games because it is very dissapointing to find that your favorite game will not work anymore and you have to go through the trouble to buy them online because stores do not keep or sell them anymore
this is a very good console that i would purchace if you do not have a ps or just to have this original masterpiece to bring back memoriesthis shakes so much at times it seems hard to stay in control of your games
the design is smaller than what i expected it has quite a kick and the strength that it shakes at seems appropriate for what you hit
it provides that extra oomph that is not provided when you dont have a jump pak or tremor pak or that mad catz pak
it shakes the most when you cause rapid rumbles or when you are hit in a game
i would have given it  and a half stars but that was not available so i put it down to  stars
however this is highly reccomended by mealmost every dreamcast game supports the jump pack feature
this is because the feedback mechanism adds an extra dimension of fun and interactivity to games
if you are wondering if it is worth the price to add this to your controller  yes it ismy only complaint is that the jump pack should have been built into the original controller
this feature is near standard in all games and it seems like a crass money grab by sega to force you to buy a second devicei have not tried all of the jump pack devices
however i have tried the tremorpak and the dreamcast device
i cant really tell a difference other than that the tremorpak seems to vibrate a little stronger than the dreamcast device
as far as compatibility is concerned it has worked in all of my gamesit has my votei just played diablo for the first time aug 
i wish i had played it much earlier before playing great games like morrowind and the baldurs gate series
then i would be able to appreciate it as the classic that many have claimed it to be
anyhow i found this game very entertaining from start to finish
it was easy to learn to play suspenseful and i didnt notice any bugs which is a real surprise for games nowadaysi liked a lot of things about this game
first it has a great soundtrack especially once youre in the dungeon
the voice acting is pretty good and the other sound effects help build atmosphere
for an eightyearold game i think the graphics look pretty good
there are a lot of really creepy areas and monsters in the game and they are animated well
the map overlay was a good idea since it allows you to play while seeing exactly where you are on the mapregarding gameplay most of the time youll be clicking the mouse to move attack pick up things and open menus
there is really nothing difficult to learn
i personally was not bothered by all of the clicking as long as the fights were challenging
during the first few levels my figher had no problems even when faced by a mob of enemies
however by the  or  level i had to fight more strategically since the monsters had become much more difficult to beat
by the th level youll have to draw enemies away from their groups and fight them one at a time
the end fight was appropriately difficult but not as insanely challenging as the final fights in baldurs gate   one really great thing about this game is that each time you start a new game the dungeon levels are redrawn and new monsters treasure traps and other things are generated
i really cant see playing this game again since there are so many better games out there right now
however i like this formula which allows for a tremendous degree of replayabilitythere were a few things i didnt care for but they are all together minor
first this is not primarily a roleplaying game so it is unfair to criticize it for not being more like baldurs gate and other rpgs
diablo is mainly an arcadestyle action adventure with some limited roleplaying possibilities
you can only choose between  classes fighter sorceror or rogue your stats are preset although you can control how points are allocated between abilities during the game and npc interaction is very limited and more or less restricted to trading and questgiving
also the town itself is small and static and your character cannot carry much in hisher inventory which will ensure many visits to town for supplies
however in the dungeon itself you do get the sense that you are surrounded by evil and there is a good amount of suspense as you get closer to the endi am glad that i finally got around to playing this and will definitely be playing diablo  plus lod next
for anyone who hasnt played diablo yet its definitely worth a look
however dont expect it to rival games like baldurs gate or neverwinter nights in complexity options gameplay or anything else
again its good old hackandslay arcade action with a pinch of roleplaying thrown innot to put too fine a point on it this game is essentially a shallower realtime version of nethack a game with roots stretching back  years to older computer games like quotroguequot or quotbeneath apple  manorquot
you can find the freeware nethack easily on the  web
however it is a particularly solid implementation with  excellent music graphics for the time theyre somewhat outdated now  sound effects voiceacting and most critically a decent interface
the  story is more or less irrelevant but it servesthis is a fairly short  game with a fair amount of replayability
theres not much brainstrain nor  is there much of a learning curve
reccommendeddiablo is a game from a simpler time where single player ruled the day and online multiplayer was a niche market
its clear blizzard expected players to start a character play straight through without careful stat minmaxing beat the game and call it quits
there are monsters that permanently knock your maximum hp down shrines that screw up character stats at random items that disappear forever when durability is lost and no option for increased difficulty in playing single player
diablo doesnt even drop an item when killed
multiplayer seems to be almost an afterthought you gain some by being able to play with friends and at higher difficulty but you lose out on quests several items and some of the mechanics change considerablyits not without other flaws
the game is crazy unbalanced i played a sorcerer who didnt manage to learn the supervital fireball or stone curse until  through the game and still had a far easier time than the hackandslash warrior i tried briefly
a series of bugs still remain unpatched for years
battlenet is a hackerinfested heckhole but is also the only way to play the game tcpip multiplayer
the game is too light on story though i realize this is not a fair criticism as its primarily actionoriented anywaybut all of that is forgivable because diablo is just a darn good gametm
it completely captures the essence of hackandslash action rpg gameplay
it pushes all the right buttons monsters die in satisfying explosions new spells are a visual treat changing equipment alters your characters appearance etc
most importantly the loot system is intact and excellent
somehow hearing that ding of a falling ring makes the last hour of clicking monsters completely worthwhile
blizzard took and refined all this gameplay gravy to produce d one of the most addictive games ive ever played
the original still holds most of that charmif you own diablo but havent given it a chance you owe it to yourself to do so
for diablo ii players it is immediately familiar  it plays like a cut down version of d only three character classes with significant overlap far fewer itemsprefixessuffixes a handful of randomly generated quests
the total length is about that of one or two d acts
it makes a good change of pace from the more recent releaseon the other hand if you dont own diablo get the battle chest instead since it includes diablo diablo ii and its expansion
once you play diablo youll be looking for more and the sequel brings it in stylei had bought diablo  and the expansion for it before buying the origional diablo
i expected it to be even better because i usually think quotthe origional is betterquotbut it turned out the exact opposite
i found myself stuck on the same level for a while
this huge pig with a butcher knife killed me over and over again and the people that live in the little town thing assign you the mission
i finally killed it but the missions just get boring and youre just going through this big dungeon full of skeletons
i know it may sound whimpy but the game is too chalenging
maybe it is because i just played as the rouge
but otherwise i think it has a good dungeons and dragons feel to it and that is a good thing to mei dusted this off a little while ago and played through it again
its still one of the best games ever espcially if you put quothellfirequot on itdiablo is a challenging and addictive dungeon and dragons type roleplaying adventure
this is the first of the series and predates diablo ii
when i saw it on the shelf i snatched it up
i mean for a legendary game
for less than the cost of a movie you can a lot more funyou take on the role of a wizard warrior or rouge and start venturing into the dungeon
various quests are assigned randomly which you complete to gain experience and unique weaponry
as a result you can play it several times with different characters and the game is different each timeunfortunately sometimes it devolves into a simple hack and slash adventure
also note that there is a learning curve to figuring out what spells do whaton the whole this is a fun gratuitous addictive hack and slash game
it is also inexpensive almost to the point of being a nobrainer purchaseid beaten baldurs gate tsc but rather than basking too long in that glory i rushed back to the nearest electronic boutique only to find there was nothing that appealed on their shelves i refuse to pay full price for  just released games so torment was out
the helpful assistant when  quizzed as to what someone who loved bg would like to play mentioned  diablo  quotan oldie but a goodiequot they didnt have it in stock  but it had recently been added to the quotbudget listquot  of our  miserable aussie dollars which just now is equal to about  cents us
my mission for the rest of the day was to track it down   stores later   poorer it landed on my pc
and the next two days were lostas  someone else mentioned this is not your traditional rpg  the nearest  thing i can compare it to is adampds dungeon hack all those oldies out  there might remember it  i must have played that about a zillion times all  those years ago
each new game you play has the same end result but the  replayability comes in how you get there
each new game spawns a dungeon  filled with different items and a different combination  i think of the   possible quests
you only have three classes to choose from and the  class stats are always the same but that means character generation is as  simple as choosing a class and thinking of a nameafter bgtsc which  took me i dont know how many hours over about  months to beat i was  fairly surprised when my warrior knocked it over in about  playing hours  and one star is lost from my rating because the final conflict was  surprisingly easy but then i did have a kickass weapon pretty fantastic  armour the mana shield spell and plenty of mana potions
 but i  immediately generated a rogue and set off againthis is the kind of game  you can play single character for a spare hour without having to get too  involved in any plot consequences  the only strategy is kill or get  killed
beats playing patience every timethis game i must say is one of the most addictive fun frustrating sleepwasting homework delaying fun games ever
while blizzard in the manual gives their usual in depth backstory and pictures and all the plot  of the game is very simple  fight your way through diablos minions and  then kill the big guy himselfduring the course of all this you can go  back up through the depths into town to reprovision get some advice from  the townspeople and go on quests for them from which you get various  rewardsi literally do not think ive ever played a game as addictive as  this one
the hours fly
you go through a few levels and it seems to be  fairly quick and then you realize its  am
the first few levels may seem  easy especially if youre playing with a warrior but once you get down to  the depths believe me it will be a challenge for anyonethe graphics  almost five years later are still very good as are the spells weapons  and enemies and the animations of all of them
the worst thing about this  game is that you will invariably want to carry more gear than can fit on  you and its a beitch trying to figure out what excellent item to sell  and what to keep only to decide when its too late youd rather have done  it the other way aroundi havent played much multiplayer but thats  excellent too
i definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone
kudos to blizzard for a game well donea true classic of the rpg genregreat gameplay immersive and rich storyline fun multiplayer experience
highly recommendedblizzards diablo started it allthis is an rpg stripped of the roleplaying elements and reduced to a hackandslash
but its a fun hackandslash and thats what matters right
theres a nice variety of baddies to go after especially if you buy  the hellfire addon
dont buy if youre prone to repetitivemotion  injuries because youll be clicking the mouse nearly constantly throughout  much of the game and watch out for cheaters in the multiplayer arena
but  take it for what it isa fun romp through a dungeon full of monsters  carrying around gold coins for no obvious reasonand you cant go wrongsometimes you just need to whack things around
storyline
who cares
plot
who needs it
gimme a sword and a healing spell some monsters to bash and im happy as a clam at high tide
when i feel that way theres only one place to turn and thats diablowhile later games have improved significantly on the user interface diablo pioneered this is certainly still a playable piece of work four years after its release
i find myself trying to get to the previously visited places menu from darkstone at least once per hour but i can live with that
diablos atmosphere is dark almost palpably creepy
thats not something thats easy to do to someone whos staring at a computer monitorif you dont have diablo yet what are you waiting for
at its new bargain price its one of those games that should be in the collection of every gameri remember back when i first played this and just couldnt stop
after moving and losing it i bought another copy
not as addictive as i remember but still something if you have some time to killa diamond in the roughi cant believe i forgot to review this
ive actually had this game for ages and i even reviewed its horrible sequel jade cocoon  but i somehow forgot to actually write a review for this one
well anyway ill get on with it
firstly i should note that if you are a studio ghibli fan this game should feel oddly familiar
the art style is from what i understand either directly inspired by ghibli  or the art design was actually worked on by studio ghibil members not totally sure which
the story too also feels pretty ghibliesque but more on that later
the only other thing ill mention before i get into the category breakdown is that this game strangely comes in one of those doublecd cases but only actually has one disc
its a pretty short game so i have no idea whats going on with that
maybe the marketing department was trying to fool people into thinking the game was longer
i have no idea  oh well on with the reviewgraphics score  the graphics are decent for their time this game came out a couple years after final fantasy vii
the cutscenes are animestyle which is lovely because such animation  pretty much never ages
the ingame background graphics are pretty good  they are quite detailed
the only problem is that sometimes the backgrounds are too detailed  it can be hard to see items on the ground or to determine what is and is not a pathway
the character models are kind of blocky like youd expect for an old ps game but there are ingame character portraits during dialogue which is nicemusic score  the music itself is pretty average for an rpg
its decent but not astoundingly good or anything
what is of note though is the voice acting
yes there is voice acting which is unusual for a ps game
not just that but the voice acting is pretty good
ive heard better voice acting on more modern games but for a psera game its pretty darn good
believe me ive heard much worse grandia comes to mind so kudos to the developers for hiring some decent voice actorscharacters score   sigh i really like this game but it commits one of my most disliked offenses  it has a silent protagonist
levant never speaks and doesnt possess any sort of personality
thankfully the other characters make up for it since they actually do have personalities
all the characters have fairly restrained and normal personalities versus some of the exaggerated and wacky characters you can get with a lot of rpgs which feels pretty realistic for the setting
despite their demure personalities you really start to feel sympathetic for levant and his wife mahbu as the game goes on
having an emotional investment in the characters is a hallmark of a good rpg and jade cocoon succeeds on this frontstory score  this game can be described as light on plot but heavy on thematic elements and setting
it relies more on its atmosphere and themes to carry the narrative than on plot twists or an intricate storyline
in fact the actual plot itself is fairly simple
a small village that has always been protected from forest monsters suddenly gets attacked one day and several villagers fall into a sleepingsickness
its up to levant and mahbu his newly married wife to obtain a rare herb from the dangerous forest in order to save them
even though that sounds pretty simple the actual themes are mature and thoughtprovoking
remember in the introduction  how i said this game reminds me of studio ghiblis works
jade cocoon reminds me most of princess mononoke since they both have a lot of the same themes
it literally feels like you are playing through a mythological tale or a fable of some type  in fact the very opening of the game features a creation myth complete with a frightening capricious deity before the game sets you up in a more mundane human village
the cultural setting of the game is radically different from a western one the people inhabiting this tiny village are very much bound up in the rigors of tradition and responsibility is put before personal feelings
its pretty much the opposite in theme to your typical rpg which is all about running around the world having exciting adventures
instead of that sense of freedom jade cocoon makes you feel the oppressiveness of this cultural tradition and the sad and weighty responsibilities put upon the young protagonists
in fact there are a lot of interesting concepts explored in this game including arranged marriages superstition and mythology religion and creation stories harmony and balance between humans and nature prejudice and morality
the great thing about this game is that it doesnt really answer any of the moral questions it raises for you  its up to the player to ponder themselvesbattle system score  the battle system is a turnbased system that will be instantly understandable to any person whos got a vested interest in rpgs
whats different about this game is that levant is the only character you get to fight with and hes actually a pretty weak fighter
youll spend most of your time summoning monsters to fight for you
yes jade cocoon is a bit of a monsterraising sim
you can capture monsters of various elements earth fire water wind to fight in battle for you
you can also merge two of them together to improve their stats  and their appearance changes
thats really the biggest selling point of the monsterrelated gameplay
based on what you choose to merge you can make a monster look however you want it to
unfortunately youll usually be merging solely for stat boosts or to get certain abilities which can sometimes produce a very fugly monster
still its an interesting mechanic to play around with
my only complaint with the battle system itself is that the battles can feel a bit slow due to slow animations
speaking of which the capturing animations are a bit too long for my taste and even though the menu has an off option i cant tell any difference between on and off
go figuregameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
sigh this is where this game takes it in the rearend
jade cocoon has the worst movement system of any rpg ive ever played
remember those old tanklike controls that infested early resident evil games
jade cocoon has these
why
basically levant slowly pivots left and right and pushing up goes forward no matter what direction hes facing in
its a good thing the battles are turnbased or this would really be a problem
it is however a bit of a problem in the forests because there are onscreen enemies that are very hard to dodge with these controls
if you hold down the triangle button levant will run straight forward
once you get used to this you can hold down triangle and sort of steer him left and right but it always feels awkward
in addition to those problems the actual button layout is irritatingly nonstandard
the circle button opens the main menu and the triangle button backs out of the menu
if youve played many final fantasies as well as many other rpgs you expect that to be the opposite
aside from the button scheme the actual menus used to do anything are not terribly intuitive and are more convoluted than necessary
for example if you go to the shop first you have to listen to the shopkeeper make random chit chat then you got to a buysellexit menu then you can select buy to get something
sounds simple enough but no
if you select an item you then have to put in an extra yes im sure confirmation
then when you want to leave the shop you cant just hit triangle to back out you have to select exit and then listen to the shopkeeper give you some farewell chatting
this problem is especially bad when you are talking to mahbu levants wife who basically manages your monsters for you
whenever you need to do something with her theres a bunch of confirmations to jump through
this isnt a huge deal breaker of a problem but these little extra confirmations are everywhere and they slow down the gameplay
it just makes the game feel unpolished and for a monsterraising sim such a slow management system is unacceptable
on top of all the things previously mentioned the gameplay is a bit repetitive in that theres a very simple villageforest villageforest villageforest pattern and you dont every get to go anywhere else
this isnt too bad though because the game is pretty short so it ends before the repetition drives you mad
all things considered what keeps this game from being fantastic are purely all these gameplay issuesoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
its a real shame that this game is held back by so many gameplay issues otherwise it wouldve been excellent
the whole game really feels like a diamond in the rough
if you are an rpg enthusiast and can overlook this games rough edges then i still suggest you pick up jade cocoon
its worth a look if only for its unique story and atmosphereif you need teambased with a blend of unreal tourney and the scifi channel heres a good title to work on
its all multiplayer so theres no singleplayer mode besides the training missions
its a hard game to explain but i can say this this game is fun and heck and lets you take any role whether it be a repairman heavy defence or transport pilot
buy this if your computer isnt so hot
if you do have a good computer with a geforce get tribes  it adds on to the first in almost every way and is a little more fun than this title
but get either one tribes is one of sierras best titlesif you have the same game i have you arent going to be able to connect to any game servers
this is a known problem but theres a fix
you can connect to game servers by following this operating procedureinstructions for entering new master serversthe following are the steps you need to follow to configure your tribes game server and client to use the new master servers for your server and client to usethe super easy waystart your starsiege tribes  clientopen the console

once on the server list page click refresh all and the server list from tribesmasterservercom should show upjust so you know i am only going to discuss singleplayer version because i never tried multiplayeryou have warcraft you have diablo and then you have starcraft
diablo and warcraft have gone off to have  and in warcrafts case  but starcraft has nothing but a brood war expansion
i cant see whystarcraft is fantastic
you have three different races that are unique in their own way
different buildings different units different ways of evolving heck just about everything is different between each race
i think that is pretty cooli personally like the custom scenarios
i also like a really cool scenario that is kind of like a arcade game where you try to protect your nexus protoss main building from oncoming enemies
and get galactic heroes if you survivei found the actual campaign a bit too difficult for me with some missions seeming just plain impossible
it also takes a while to master each race i like the protoss but the zerg are in my opinion the easiest to fight with  but it is still fun and i really like some of the heroes especially the protoss heroesfinally i like making my own scenarios
it seemed difficult and a little confusing at first but i eventually got the hang of itgo out and buy this gamethis is one of the best games ever made
but one thing
it is additing
i think if u by this only play it on vactions or if you dont have work for a week or twowith this game my grades went down to cs and ds
i am not saying dont buy it just dont let it get out of handstarcraft is always fun although you start getting bored with the same  old sprites after a while
the balance of three different races is great  although youll have to download patches for the latest game balance  necessary for internet play
gameplay itself is easy to get a grip on  blut very hard to master
still the game allows players to just build up  big powerful units and bulldoze to victoryas i said this is a good game acctually its a great game
one of the best strategy games i have playedalong with age of empires  and the sims
i have always liked another game age of empires as whelli reccomend you check that out too but this is a little bit different
unlike in aoe were you just control humans in this you control one of three species
the zerg the protoss or the terranhumaneach with there own special units and abilitys
the graphics are acctually pretty good though some looks a little to cartoonynot cartoony i mean to much like animated stough
you have  campiangs to play
duh one for each racespecies
the one problem with it is its map editer
i had always liked creating my own maps and scenarios in aoe and was looking forward to creating maps on this game but was dissapionted
you can decide on the terrain and were resurces are and where you start but thats about it
it has this stupid dfault thing were evan if you quotdoquot put units they just put your town centerconrl centernexus etc and four worker units
there is suppose to be some thing you type in in the propertis box to change this but it never works no matter what i do
despite this problem its a good game
buy iti really enjoy playing this game
in the beginning i found it a bit confusing compared to age of empires an absolutely excellent game so i didnt really like it
i eventually became better and now i find it very fun to play
it is set in the future and you can have your choice of whowhat you are
there are some really cool aliens
take a look at this game
its great for someone who likes stragedy
planning your next move against the enemy
highly recommendedthis game is great
i have a new computer and i still am able to go back  to broodwarstarcraft even though it may seem outdated
it just shows that  a game is built off of more than graphics and more on replay value and  gameplayi really liked the original and recently returned to the series and decided to play through the expansion missions tend to be larger and more resource intensive then in the original starcraft and very often follow a bunker build breakout pattern
the game definitely favors the player who masters the tech tree and knows when and how to use all there unitsunfortunately it took me very little time to realize the ai cheats like most rts games brood war is supposedly a resource based game but in the campaign mode the ai has unlimited resources and simply cannot be mined outthis may seem like a petty gripe but as a resource based game giving the ai effectively unlimited resources seriously limits a players options imho and gives the ai a tremendous advantage for players with excellent micro this is not problem for players like me who win when i do economically first its a serious handicap and while i have not yet found a situation i simply could not win the games often devolve into excruciating marathons because again the ai having infinite resources can always replace its losses turning mission after mission into a marathon slogfests of trench warfarewhile it is not uncommon in rts games for the ai to cheat this is supposedly done to make the game more challenging for elite players but no elite player will ever run into this issue because of their excellent micro skills it is the more casual player who may not have that excellent micro who is going to run into this wall another example of devs trying to please the elites and by doing so punishing everyone else stupid enough to play their game
including me
i have to admit i like the game its engrossing and i personally like the art and play better than scii which is a bit weird in its pseudo d for me but i cant give a game where the  ai is obviously cheating full pointsi heard that this game had garnered a good reputation but until now it had never piqued my interest
there are so many games in the realtime strategy genre  you have classics like age of empires  and command amp  conquer or total stinkers like tiberian sunits important to remember  that starcraft was created at least two years before age of empires  its  obvious that aoe borrowed some good ideas from starcraft
the main one  being those of unit limits
in starcraft you have a  unit limit so its  still possible to build a huge army
but you also have to balance that  against the number of units you use to gather resourcesanother unique  feature of starcraft is the totally different sides
it absolutely amazes  me that a single game can have such diverse armies and yet still manage to  be so well balanced
there isnt a single unit in the game that cant be  neutralised by another unit  which is no mean feat considering how  powerful they arethe most interesting aspect to these units are their  special abilities
certain units in each race have special attacks they can  use to neutralise or destroy an opponent
for instance the terran ghost  soldier can fire an emp blast that can knock out mechanical units
zerg  queens can fire parasites which attach themselves to enemies allowing you  to see whatever that unit sees
the protoss have the templar a unit that  uses a chain lightning psionic storm to eliminate whole squadrons of  unitsthere are certain features which i wish had been implemented
its  not possible to control the behaviour of your units ie
setting them to  guard or defensive mode etc
this makes it entirely possible for your  entire massed army to chase after a single unit when really you want them  to stay in one place
fortunately a hold command is provided but i  still wouldve preferred to give my units more advanced commandsthe  other annoying aspect is map size
its blindingly obvious that the maps  are too small when compared to the size of the units
try leading a group  through a narrow canyon  because there is so little room individual units  will often take a different path to get to a destinationstarcrafts  other strength is in its storyline
i have never seen such powerfully  realized characters like this in a computer game
in truth there are no  real good guys or bad guys in this game
everybody has their own  motivations for their actions
the sequential compaign design only  strengthens this aspect
its unfortunate that tiberian suns michael biehn  and james earl jones didnt have a script like this to play within  conclusion starcraft is everything that command amp conquer tiberian  sun wasnt
it has the best designed units of any strategy game
it has a  strong storyline which is beautifully realised in the singleplayer  missions
and the addition of staredit means you can create your own  missions once you tire of the blizzard approved ones
no wonder why this  game has stood the test of time
however the omission of advanced unit  controls mean i have to deduct one starall of the reviews ive read seem to come from longtime players of this game rather then new players who actually bought the battlechest
one of the first things you need to know about this addition that there is no manual
i was pretty surprised to discover this
but wait you say there are two official strategy guides
yes there are
but they wont teach you how to play the game
they dont include basic stats on all of the units they dont include all short cut commands they dont include technology trees they dont explain the concept of real time strategy games
they offers hints observations and walk throughs of all of the missions which are handy but not a substitute for a manual
the only help the game itself offers is a list of some of the keyboard short cuts hints and one training mission which will be of little use unless you are familiar with real time strategy gamesive recently discovered and fallen in love with real time strategy games and having recently begun playing age of the empires ii and empire earth i found the basic concepts similar and could figure you out in general what i was supposed to do
but i found myself struggling to understand the specifics of the game and how to best use the units to win the missions with such incomplete information
fortunately at battlenetcom the official starcraft website i discovered extensive documentation
still its hardly as convenient as having a manual to refer to while playingarmed with a link to the battlenet documentation i have played through half of the terran missions and have found them to be very entertaining
the missions are varied and gradually introduce you to new units and concepts
hints are offered along the way
so far that are quite easy once you actually understand what the units do but for completely mastery of the game there is a huge amount of information to learn
even though the graphics are not as snazzy as newer releases the attention to detail is outstanding
the cut scenes are excellent and the storyline is far more involved then other similar games
there is an amazing amount of strategic possibilities in this gamein addition to the missions there are a bunches of ready made scenarios and maps in the custom scenario section ready to play
i suspect these were not in the original version but since i dont have any documentation i cant say for sureso if you have played more recent titles and are wondering if this will seem dated rest assured that on the fun factor scale it compares very favorably to newer titles
but if you have never played this type of game you may want to consider another title first unless you have a friend to help you out or are willing to invest the time needed to figure it out on your ownfirst point the original starcraft is excellent
if you are the kind of person who doesnt care much for the plot of a video game and only want to play play play then this game is for you
if you are the kind of person who enjoys the plot as much as the game then this game is for you
it combines a good plot with a fun gamesecond point starcraft broodwars is just as great as the first one
its plot is more indepth and the game is not a sequel but an addon so it acts as if it has the difficulty of a higher level and it is much more challengingthird point the starcraft strategy guide works so well
if your stuck on a level then take it out and itll tell you how many of each unit to make where to stratiegicly place them and so onfourth point sad to say that the brood war strategy guide is not one of the best guides out there
its more there to give you hints not to walk you through the levelfifth point this chest rocksi like this game a lotis rts in its most pure statebuild your economy set your army go to seek  destroyno crappy heroes to level upit runs ok in my old video card a nvidia but show some graphics issues in my new nvidia gtxin the menu screens but in the gameplay the graphics issues are goneso i have to deal with the graphics issues only in the menu screensafter playing the starcraft  beta i can assure that starcraft is better than starcraft  not just for the lan support thatblizzard remove in sc the gameplay in sc is awesomeyeah sc has better graphics than sc right but a gameis about gameplay and not graphicsme and my friends still play sc in lanfeststhis is something were going to miss in scafter being disappointed with several of the newer games out mideival total war  neverwinter nights  i repurchased an old favorite
its not fancy and the graphics are nothing special but starcraft is a solid fun game
the ai is limited but sometimes i like to set it to  melee everyone against me and see how many computerplayers i can fend off
if youre looking for unsophisticated shootemup fun nothings better than starcraft for the priceive enjoyed starcraft ever since it came out
i loved it and even to this day i enjoy playing it
starcraft is just one of those games that ive continued playing over the years
it has everything a great game needs good graphics and sounds compelling story welldeveloped characters and balanced interesting units
if youre interested in getting starcraft  but have never played this do yourself a favor skip out on starcraft  and buy this insteadfor the most part i play starcraft for the single player campaign
not only is it fun but the characters actually make you care about them
for me the characters are the most compelling aspect of the single player campaigngameplaywise i cant really say that starcraft is much of an innovator
nevertheless the three races are well balanced and packed with interesting units
there are only two resources but the resources themselves actually managed to be fairly interesting to me for a while
the single player campaign has well over  missions with starcraft and broodwar combined
there are also a few cutscenes for each racethe voice acting is fantastic
the characters end up being well developed and like i said before they make you care about them
the voice actors really made their characters come to life
the unit sounds are also very well done and are fairly distinctas far as video game plots go starcrafts is pretty good
theres nothing really amazing in there but it still manages to be interestingthe graphics are pretty good they bring the dark gritty universe of starcraft to lifegood as it is starcraft still has its share of problems
for starters you can only select  units at a time
this ends up being fairly irritating as more often then not the player will have a large force but will be unable to select all his or her units which can be a pain if youre in the middle of a large battle
the unit pathing isnt that great either
the units in starcraft cant take care of themselves very well
total annihilations pathing is quite a lot better and you can select more then  units at a timethose two problems are my only real gripes with starcraft
the units are interesting the characters and voiceacting are fantastic and the three races are very wellbalanced
theres a reason that starcraft is one of the most celebrated rts games of all time essentially everything about it is almost pure excellence aside from a few issuesthis is a retro game  no way around ithowever i actually enjoy retro games
i actually just got done playing another world and fallout    on my laptophaving been playing alot of desktop tower defense games lately i thought i would upgrade to a true rts game
starcraft kept coming up high on everyones favorite list so i thought id give it a trythe good this really is a fun game
im only on level  out of  on the original but its fun
level  took me about  hrs to finally beat
but some of this is because theres no instructions in the game see the bad
after reading the strategy guide for the level i finally figured out what i needed to do
however i had fun playing the whole time without getting discouraged the graphics arent all that bad
i was expecting much worse
though theyre not bad theyre not great either
about the same as fallout   i am surprised they havent been improved by a patch no easymediumhard setting
i actually prefer to not have an easymediumhard setting
on some games my first instinct is to pick medium but then i will often get stuck or find its too easy
and then i wish i had picked something different
this game you have to really be strategic
some levels may be too easy and some may be pretty darn hard
if theyre hard simply refer to the guide
which brings up another point
you dont have to keep playing a level until you demolish the cpu
you just need to win
i tried out middle earth rts and your people carry over
i got a few levels in and couldnt beat the level
after hitting a forum i found out its impossible to win if you didnt max out your army from the previous levelsthe bad  video
i run this on my laptop and the screen turns black and the game starts in the upper left part of the window consuming only about  of my widescreen laptop
the rest of the screen is black
its pefectly playable but awefully small
however i noticed that when i put my laptop in my docking station connected to an external monitor it goes fullscreen
of course fullscreen on a  widescreen monitor is not good for this game either
no amount of tweaking to the shortcut seemed to help
the only option is to change the desktop resolution to x before starting the game which is a major pain
some googling and it seems most everyone with a widescreen laptop experiences this
they all refer to a freeware download that lets you run starcraft in a window
this actually works very nice and was surprised at how much i liked it compared to the smaller screen in the upper left
however theres comments from some users that after using the program some people have been banned from battlenet since it saw they were using a rd party program with starcraft
im not interested in playing sc on battlenet so thats not a huge deal for me
but really if youre going to actively sell a game at the game shops you would think this would be fixed by blizzard
its one thing if i found this at a useddiscount store but i didnt
also im surprised blizzard hasnt released a patch to smooth out the graphics a bit
its not horrible but its hard to imagine that it would be too hard to fix it up a little better with a patch
many other games have patches that improve the graphics
doom quake to name a couple no instructions
really
no instructions
the strategy guide helps and the first levels help give you a feel for the game but really
no instructions
this is part of what hurt me on level   i wanted to beat it without having to read the strategy guide
in the end the guide told me what units i should have before i attack and some of them i had never used let alone knew how to useend rating   stars
im having fun and thats what counts for a retro game
minus  star since i have to use rd party freeware to get it to run in a window or proportioned correctly on my laptopi have to say that even a long time after its release this game still keeps me entertained
the graphics are great the atmosphere is amazing the ai is incredible
altogether one excellent game
there are loads of different puzzles and there isnt any faffing around with end of level bossesthere are few downpoints though even in a game of this standard
the direct x graphics mode is terrible and the open gl is not compatible with my card even though open gl works fine with my card in other games
more general pitfalls are that it takes time to get going  theres no way to skip the intro which isnt that relevant to whats going on anyway
the first few levels provide little entertainment
 of the way through you get thrown into some alien planet which almost stops the game dead
it sometimes feels a bit linear as wellhowever enough moans coz the good outwieghs the bad by a long shot
this contains all the elements that sin shouldve hadmy only experience with the game is the solo aspect
from a solo standpoint the game is probably the best shootercrawler ever but to linear for me
i like a more open sandbox type game
halflife took an already crounded genre refined and did it better than anybody before or really since
flawless game play easy and intuitive controls and top notch story line
i think the story was the best part of the game
despite my personal views this really is a must have for any pc gamer as it really is the top game in its fieldever wanted to be a scientist but never had the aptitude for it
ever wanted to join the army or the marines but couldnt because you were flatfooted
well you can rejoice now because halflife will solve both those problems with one blow
you start off as an intelligent scientist named gordon freeman
you work at a place called black mesa which is like area  after an informative trainride you get off have some chitchat with the guards and get your suit
i was very impressed with how professional the level looked
security guards retina scanners the works
this aint your local bank
after getting your suit you go to a room where an experiment is about to take place
youre a crucial part of it
but wait the scientists are sounding as if something might go wrong
and then you push the specimen into the beam and 
and shortly after that youll be experiencing one of the finest moments in video game history
remember that nicelooking level i was telling you about
now visualize it with heavy damage dead or dying scientists and guards and aliens popping out of thin air
and you have no weapon
this is no quake cakewalk with john wayne heroics
youll be crawling in fear for most of the game
i think one of the main things that made this game popular was this it touched on the common fear of going into the unknown and feeling illprepared for what lies ahead
sure you might have  rounds on the mp a rocket launcher and whatever else but believe me it wont last long especially on hard mode
another thing that this game touched on was this the fear of small spiderycreatures and large ugly trex things that can run faster than you
believe me when i say youll jump when you stick your head in a tunnel and a snark or headcrab jumps out at you
after a while you manage to arm yourself and try and make it to the surface 
only to find that marines are attacking black mesa in an effort to cover up the severe accident
so now we have this ugly bermuda triangle of marines aliens and you
the aliens are just plain bad
youre just trying to get your innocent rearend out of there
and the marines are just following orders
makes for one whopper of a story and a game
but not all is runandgun
many times youll be jumping like mario making welltimed decisions and solving puzzles
but besides all that there are three other things about this game that i like a flashlight
its about time someone did something to light those dark levels
humor
guards goof around with experimental technologywith disastrous results
welllighted levels overall
the only fps ive seen with more light is serious sam
very rarely will you be squinting your eyes in this game
to wrap things up my favorite levels are the beginning one and the one entitled surface tension
despite some wonderful level design in this game i really hated the alien levels
sure they looked nice but when you start playing them its a different story
also the two endings are too short and unsatisfactory
but overall this is a great game worth getting even now especially if you havent played it before despite the fact that return to castle wolfenstein and other fpss are around the cornerhalflife was efficacious in improve my handeye coordination which is compromised as a result of using narcotics for three years
id like to find something that will improve my memory but ive resigned myself to the fact that im going to have to restudy everything ive already learned
yep oxycodone does make you stupid
just look at rush limbaughoh  im getting sidetracked
lets not digressok why did i give it only  stars because after the patch to  and then   the final comprehensive patch  freeman would still get stuck on lifts and elevators and diewhen he gets stuck you cant move him or make him jump and he takes damage and gets crunched
i dont know why the patches never resolved this problembut the problem of getting stuck on lifts and elevators has a fix
read some of the faqs
if you jiggle the controller around a bit freeman wont get stuckwhat else every time i tried to load a saved game from the game it would crash my system
i had to exit the game and restart the game i wanted
i could save without a problem and quick save and quick load f and f worked finethe endgame was a little far fetched
the game was well thought out but the ending wasnt commensurate with the game
it was episodicaside from the few snafus yes it was fun to play
the health and hev dispenser are somewhat unrealistic
i mean getting health from a dispenser 
only in a game
but it was funim glad i had an opportunity to play itand yes i think it helped my motor skillsok  just like everyone sez this is one of the best games ever made and you should buy it immediately
but it does have some flawsfirst of all a lot of the weopons in this game i dont like
there is only one machine gun only one shotgun one pistol  etc
cmon wheres the variety
second the team fortress add on that comes with this game really sucks
it is no where near as good as counterstrikeanyways  buy half life and download counterstrike for free of the netthis game is will go great with the add ons
but i love this game with gordon and all the other civilians and scientists and security but this game has very cool weapons and very cool monsters
but this game is not reccomended for young users because of major violence and gore
and multiplayer is a blast
but dont ever give away your cd key if you do you may never play half life multiplayer agian
dont even copy the cd for your friends
but this game has everything i expected with excellent graphics
everyone will enjoy this game im sure
but  stars is my rating because i cant give anything  stars unless its awesome and has nothing wronghalflife is a first person shooter in the same vein as doom and quake
what sets halflife apart though is the more detailed backrounds and more realistic gameplay
in quake you blast everything to pieces and plow your way through the levels
in halflife you pretty much do the same thing except the backrounds and characters are more interactiveit almost seems like its part role playing game
the graphics rival those seen on quake and unreal and the story has more backbone also
overall halflife provides more of a realistic environment to explore and destroy than most other games of its kind
if you cant get enough of first person shooters halflife is a great choice for some more actionwhat can i say about this game
it was name pc gamers game of the year
the game is simply great
at first glance it seems like your typical first person shooter but once you start getting into the game everything changes
it turns into a complete horror game
its one of those games that if you play at night will make you want to turn all the lights in the house on
the game gives you huge suprises like little alien creatures jumping out at you from no where
or dark corridors with things waiting to kill you on the other side
this game is great and is perfect for anyones collectiona mustkill for dedicated fans of singleplayer first person shooter
hl takes an utterly unoriginal idea for either games or movies and crafts an utterly unstoppable gaming experience
you play gordon freeman who works in the bowels of an ultrasecret underground research facility called the black mesa
having played the game yet im still not sure whats supposed to be going on in bm  its the aftermath that matters
oozing hightech the facility is host to the denizens of another dimension when youfreeman accidentallydo something that tears a whole in the fabric of our own  allowing beings from that other world to enter oursnow if you think that these otherworldly denizens are peaceful beings intent on fostering crossdimensional love or that your fellow human beings will enter the black mesa unarmed intent on warmly welcoming these beings to our world or at least to rescue you  im afraid youve picked up the wrong game entirely
for in the bowels of black mesa youll confront howling dog things flying crabs alienzombified versions of your colleagues gigantic aliens that breathe fire through their fists aliens that hang from ceilings and entrap their victims using these vinelooking things and squads of human special forces troops intent on killing everything that moves  including you
if the above attracts you because you think it may be the setting that elevates the nobility of the human existence i should warn you to look elsewhere  for in half life youll find yourself acting indiscriminately with a mm automatic a submachine gun grenades and most regrettably of all a nasty crowbar youll make few friends and find yourself for the most part alone and not infrequently exiled to ventilation ducts again with the ducts
to avoid getting shot at by humans or burned bitten bolted or tonguebathed by alienscomplex problem solving skills as much as marksmanship or bulletsaving are crucial in this game  in which your enemies have aboveaverage levels of ai
there are unfortunately times when a level may be hung up by the failure to achieve some specific missiongoal but this is on the whole a game in which the goals are sufficiently complex to make you feel cool for achieving them yet not so complex as to be impossible to solve
the games settings are fantastic  from the vast to claustrophobic
the game is long  uncommitted gamers may find it tedious  but the scope of design here rewards those who keep up with iti ran this game on an xpequipped p with a mb agp card and had no problems other than those involving the evil aliens and homicidal fellow humans
graphics and sound were smooth and i suffered no ctds
as with all fps games the rotten review strenuously endorses the nostromo speedpadboy this is a tough one to write about
how can i fairly review a game  that has resided on my hard drive since the very day it was released
for  the technical minded halflife hl is based on a modified quake   engine but the modifications simply blow quake away in almost every  aspect
valve made an excellent move with this choice
it is well known in  the gaming community that quakes engine has some of the most stable  networking code in the business
too bad the video compatibility is a  little odd
for the gamer at heart this game may have a 
half life  longer than quake itself
valve made a good move allowing the gaming  community to have the worldcraft level editor and other sdk software
what  this means to the average player is that a simple jaunt to a good web page  will yield every manner of new levels characters and baddies to download  and install to their hearts content
and with valves opfor expansion  pack this game will take up a large amount of space on a lot of hooked  players computersone of the most notable modifications to half life is  the apparently intelligent enemies
shoot the quotdogsquot and theyll  run for cover and regroup with their pals
let the marines see or hear you  and theyll drop a hand grenade on your head
ninjas dont just run into  you they jump over your head and land behind you
crabs pop up at the most  inconvenient times
a well designed level and a poorly designed level is  differentiated by the quotintelligencequot of the enemies
although the  modifications are great they are certainly predictable to an extent
play  the game enough and youll eventually spot patterns to the enemies  quotthinkingquotso of course after defeating the game forward and  backwards it would be time to test the quake engine network code
needless  to say a k modem is not recommended
even though with my experience the  network game play is better than the unreal engine the modem does this  game sad justice
hopping up to anything better than a k modem really  makes this game shine
valve has multiplayer levels packed right in with  this game nice big areas with lots of weapons make this game a fun  quotfragfestquot
the levels dont have that disgusting  quotdarkquot feel to them
underground levels have suitable colors and  lighting
out door levels have an expansive feeling although no where near  the quotout doorquot feeling that unreal does so well
too bad that  hl has compatibility problems with various video cardsits really not  so much compatibility problems its really more that valves default  settings for the are usually not the correct settings
the voodoo video  family suffers the worst from this
by default the video gamma is far too  bright for the voodoo  card
the decals have the incorrect value
lighting  dont appear correctly
and sli seems to have an odd effect on the game
most cards have their unique set of problems and all of these adjustments  have to be done at the command level
not something to be done by the  average gamerand this game screams to be played by all gamers
with  many advanced gamers using the enclosed software developers kit sdk and  worldcraft to make new levels and in some cases completely new games
valve guaranteed hls place in the gaming community
even if the average  player has no idea how to use the software to create new levels they can  still go to numerous web sites and download any number of home made levels
the  opposing force expansion pack and the upcoming gunman game are direct  descendants of users and their valves sdk that are purchasable in the  store while hot downloads like they hunger and dss
darkstar add free  life to the gamethis leads up to the final gripe with hl though not a  major one
i have the team fortress classic tfc expansion the opposing  force pack and numerous quotuser madequot levels and my directory  continues to grow
currently the space taken by hl and the various packs  levels and extras has reached  mb of space
in contrast diablo  full  installation is  gb while diablo  is only  mb
the games are  growing guys and gals so the pc requirements should be followed like a  bibleall in all i would have given more than five stars if the system  would have allowed me to do so
but i admit i had to take at least one star  away i did this to force a point onto most people who wish to own a copy  of hl the game can be played right of the box but to get the full effect  of the game youre going to need to edit the auto start and configuration  files
voodoo  owners used to have the hl voodoo doctor but alas i have  not seen his web page in months
hl really does not like the voodoo card
ati rage fury does a little better but youll get a bizarre  quotghostquot on occasion
the tnt family does the best out of the  bunch with the default values
i understand valve is working on this issue  in hl  tfc 
but well have to wait and see
congrats valve this  game shoved quake quake  unreal and duke nukem d permanently off of my  drive
ive since gotten a dual  gb drive configuration  gb total  ive never even bothered to dust off those games
with the purchase of  bungee software by microsoft please god dont let halo and oni be xbox  only games
 the multiplayer nature of quake  and duke nukem with the  unreal engine on a perpetual release date hl will be a tough game to  knock off the quotgame of the yearquot throne
has hl cursed the first  person shooter genre
are developers afraid to knock the king out of the  ring
it may look that waythe third in the mysterysolving series gkiii not only improves on the series but on the genre itselffor those who enjoy games that involve more thinking and amazing storylines this game is definate buy
it was the first gabriel knight game i had ever played and when i was finished i wanted more
the plot alone is so deep and enriching that youll want to play just to see what happens nextmy only problem involved the difficulty of some of the puzzles
its not that they were too hard but that they seemed a little ridiculous
some seemed to beg for the purchase of a walkthrough and i admit i did some quotwalkthroughquot searches on the net but it was worth it to see the endingi thought the graphics were great especially the detailed scenery which is an almost exact duplicate of the real french town of rennesleschateau
one of the high points in the game was robert holmes soundtrack which relied mostly on creepy atmospheric piano pieces
it really added to the experianceanyone who enjoys puzzlebased suspense games should give this one a try  its more than worth iti had seen this game sitting on the shelves of software stores for months
when the price finally lowered i decided to buy it
it was well worth my money
the game is absolutely stunningthe first thing to note is the graphics
the textures arent really that detailed but that doesnt stop them from preforming
the scenery is absolutely beautiful
playing the game makes me want to visit rennes le chateau for realthe next good thing is the soundtrack
it is perfect
every scene has a unique track
sometimes i have the character just stand around doing nothing so i can enjoy the musiclastly the story is fabulous
it has some great supernatural influence as well as classic detective worki take away one star because some of the puzzles can be ridiculously difficult expecially if you dont understand what youre supposed to be doing but dont let that stop you
if you really need to you can always find a walkthruthe first gabriel knight game was about a voodoo cult in new orleans the second was about a werewolf murder in germany and the third is about  vampires
in this episode gabriel sets out to solve the abduction of a  mans child and crack the mystery behind an age old vampire cultthe  pros of the game are the graphics and controls
its really great to be  able to pike the camera at whatever angle you want and examine things
everything is rendered so the screen is more than just a backdrop that you  cant peek behind
almost everything is something you can examine  closerthe puzzles are also logical
they make sence instead of being  wild things like ripping the leaves off a plant and combing them with a  rubber duckie or some other hairbrained idea
i also loved the animation
for polygon rendered people and buildings they were impressively  handledthere were only two things about this game that i have any sort  of beef with
firstly the character of gabriel seemed to have lost a bit  of his tact and charm
in the first game gabriel could charm the pants off  of just about anyone he met and could smooth talk his way just about  anywhere he pleased
although the voice actor was the same man as the  first gk game he seems to have forgoten gabriels smooth cajun accent for a  horribly sounding southern drawland also the game didnt seem to like  my ati graphics card so although i had the game for a couple of months i  wasnt able to play it until i upgraded my card to something elsebut  that aside id still reccomend it to any adventure game fan in a  heartbeatfrom its solid d presentation to its immersive free roaming gameplay to its unique integrated puzzles gk ups the ante for adventure games on this releasethe experience is quite an immersive one although i found some of the puzzles too tedious and actually got burnt out with the game for a while because of itprobally my fault though as the extremely high praise for this game makes me remember what it was like to once install a game that actually attempted to be an experience rather then a mere gamei have to admit that my copy of gabriel knight  sat on my shelf for over a year before i felt like playing it all the way through
this was because i did not like the d graphics this time around after all some of the quotmoviesquot on gabriel knight  were superb and you just cant get that with d  i still dont like the d graphics but once i started playing this game seriously i was hooked again
the historical background stuff is always fascinating to me and any game in which a tube of preparation h plays a part is always going to impress me
i hate to think what sort of individual could play this game without resorting to hints and cheats although they would have to be somebody with a lot more time on their hands than i am
there is always some point where i need some help finding out what i missed out on that prevents me from advancing to the next time block i didnt pick up the glass in the hallway and now i cant listen in on conversations going on in the rooms
sigh
i like tim curry as much as the next person but it doesnt sound like him so his return is not a big deal for me i liked the guy in gk
whats more important here is the wry sense of humor cant get somebody to talk
try the gun icon see what happens
i have to assume most people who play quotblood of the sacred blood of the damnedquot come to the game through one if not both of the first two gabriel knight adventures
in that case i certainly do not think you will be more than mildly disappointed with episode i hear than this particular type of computer game the gabriel knightphantasmagoria type is on its way out because it takes too long to put together and does not sell as well as the bloodier arcade type games
that is not good news because these are the only type i play
after i finish im going to have to go back and play again and try out some of the variations
note it can be very useful to save the game at different points and go back and do some variations
getting caught snooping around can be also be fun
bottom line for most of gabriel knight  with its wagner and werewolves has been the highpoint of the series to date
but i am more than willing to give anything jane jensen wants to do a trygabriel knight  gk is a challenging and entertaining game that is both aesthetically and technically pleasing proving to be an all round triumph by game designer jane jenson and sierra studios
the player is immersed in a compelling convoluted murdermystery in a remote french village gets to play as two characters and gradually unravels a complicated web of mysteries suspects and the key ingredient vampires
the aforementioned aspects of gk make this hour  cd extravaganza a true delight to play however one may find that the plot is a little too complicated which proves detrimental to the pace of the gamethe player assumes the roles of gabriel knight and grace nakimura both private investigators in a small village called renneslechateau
the village is steeped in history due it being the suspected locality of the holy grail
gabriel has been assigned a mission by prince james a wealthy businessman whose son had been kidnapped whilst in the vicinity of the area
as gabriel gradually uncovers more about the mystery of the kidnapped child he concomitantly delves into a turbulent violent world of treasure hunting vampires religion riddles shady characters and murder
it is a real pleasure to witness this fantastic story unfold despite it being rather slow in unravelingthe marvelous although slow moving plot is incorporated into a fully interactive d environment which the player is able to investigate thoroughly due to a camera that is able to be manipulated
the player can move the camera around much like the camera in a st person shooter allowing investigation of intricate spots such as under a desk or inside a dumb waiter shaft
what makes this localeinvestigation so delightful is that each of the environments looks absolutely gorgeous barring the occasional obviously d tree or clearly polygonal hillthe sound is pretty good the characters can eavesdrop on conversations and engage in conversations with striking clarity to name but a few features
although the voices come out crystal clear the actual sound of the voices is quite terrible
tim curry of rocky horror fame is the voice of gabriel knight and his feigned southern drawl quickly becomes irritating
graces voice is average as are some of the other characters and the script can sometimes be quite terrible
none of the characters despite how lifethreatening the predicament seem to realise just how endangered they are
gabriel even goes so far as to wisecrack when a razorsharp pendulum is about to chop his head offbut despite the minor problems with voices or a rather sluggish plot gks good points far outweigh the bad
it is full of challenging problems and provides hours of great fun and excitement which is exactly what a game should do
gk amalgamates innovation with traditional murdermystery storytelling so if youre looking for an adventure game triumph then look no further than gabriel knight  its a real winnerthis is the first gabriel knight game that ive played and im definitely looking forward to playing more games in the series
gkiii blood of the sacred blood of the damned had its moments of brilliancethe characters were well developed with distinct personalities
the voice acting however ranged from decent to shameonyou bad
case in point tim curry as gabe knight
his accent seemed to shift wildly from southern tosomething unidentified
hall of shame nominee scottish thugs proclaiming were scots god help ye
the graphics were generally detailed but pixellated
d models had a tendency to cut in and out of the screenthere were plenty of places to explore in the chateau museum church and town of renneslechateau and in the surrounding countryside
the puzzles were often difficult and i frequently found myself backtracking for missed items
also there is a lot of downtime in some of the timeblocks so i found myself wandering around for a while trying to kill timethe storyline was genuinely unlike anything ive ever played before
although the initial premise is that of a vampire cult kidnapping a child the ending drastically reinvented the story of jesus which is sure to offend many
i still dont understand half of the cutscenes and ending months after playing itthere was a lot of dialogue to sort through and many locations that i had to backtrack through so this game kept me busy for quite a long time
gkiii is not for everyones tastes hence the m rating
it deals with vampirism and a reinvention of the death of jesus
it was definitely thought provoking and entertaining and if youre a fan of mystery and the supernatural then blood of the sacred blood of the damned is worth a looki finally got around to playing the entire gabriel knight series
for the rest of you who havent youre missing out
these are positively the best rd person adventure games ever madeits hard to review gk on its own merits without comparing it to gk and gk
first off going directly from gk to gk was a shock as the former is done entirely in fmv and the latter used d cg technology
when gk was made this was fairly new and not as polished as it is today
the environments are well done but i had a hard time with the characters
they didnt look quite right and a lot of their movements were stylized and unrealistic
i got used to this as the game progressed
however i still find that i relate better to d characters as in the longest journey or gk than i do to d representations that are trying so hard to be human and not quite making itthe script and voice acting were often not quite what i had come to expect
i particularly was not fond of tim currys portrayal of the title character a fact which struck me as odd as i loved his work as gabriel in gk
but in gk i thought he had a little too much tendancy to go over the top particularly with gabriels wisecracks which sometimes seemed more suited to beavis and butthead
gabriel as a character grows and changes a lot over the course of the games and i dont think currys portrayal was true to that fact
i was also puzzled and irritated at gabriels sudden inability to pronounce french
he had a beautiful accent when french terms came up in gk what happened to it
whether this was due to the actor or the director it was a poor choice and it bothered mehowever gabriel knight  is still a great game
like the others in the series it is quite long and takes a lot of thought and a lot of close attention to detail
i liked that the npcs had lives of their own and moved through the game in ways that were unpredictable
by keeping close track of them sometimes stumbling on interactions and conversations you can get a much larger picture of whats going on
i thought this added a lot to the realism of the game
you dont have to see everything to complete the game but attempting to do so both makes the game last longer and makes it very replayableevery gabriel knight game pushes the limits of the genre by utilizing special interfaces
in gabriel knight  the special interface is a computer within the game
in addition to being vital to solving one of the main puzzles this internal computer offers a wealth of information on a variety of subjects
you can spend hours just searching the database and reading the entires
i thought this was very coolthe puzzles in gk are generally a mix of standard inventorybased timed activity and arcade
often you have to wander around a lot to figure out what you need to do next
one particular puzzle stands out as one of the best thoughtout and most complex puzzles ive ever come across in gaming
in it you must solve a riddle by analyzing and linking various inventory items
its a very long puzzle and some people might find it frustrating but it was the thing that really caught and held my interest
if all i have to do is talk to people and find inventory items i dont feel like ive really done anything
theres plenty of that in gk but you also have to stretch your braini really enjoyed john delancies performance as the villain
i also enjoyed the depth of interaction between the main characters and i am very impressed with the amount of research into esoterica that jane jensen put into this and the other games in the series
if you are at all of a mystic bent or have any interest in what might be termed the occult you will like this gameyou can play gk without playing the other games in the series but i think it wouldnt be as enjoyable as the background information gives so much insight into the characters and their relationships
still if youre looking for a great story and challenging puzzles dont pass up gabriel knight for those unfamiliar with the quest for glory series you are allowed to choose between playing a fighter a magician or a thief also if you are a dilligent player of the series you can import a character from a previous  game which gives you access to the paladin
or if you know where to look  on the internet you can download a paladin elsewhere easily  your goal is  to win the rites of leadership over a land whose king was murdered and find  out the truth behind his death
for whatever character type you play the  means for solving the puzzles and finding the answers are different
as an  added bonus there are also numerous side quests for the various character  types to complete which can double the length of the game or you can  ignore them and get to the meat of the issue if youd ratherquest for  glory v is done in polygons and has multiplayer capability if you download  a patch from the sierra website
you can choose the fighting and game  difficulty in the menu screen if you want to focus more on fighting or on  adventuringif there is any one thing i would nitpick about it would be  the character movements theyre stiff and a bit unrealistic but that  can be easily cast aside once you begin to get into the game
quest for  glory in its first four incarnations was a game played with sprites so  polygons add a whole new depth to itfor someone that wants to play a  fantasy adventure game this would be one of the games i reccomend
since  there are different quests for different character types you can also play  this game more than once to see how things would go if you decided to be a  paladin or a thief instead of a wizard which gives it good replayability as  wellgood descent ww sim but we must remember this sim is old so the graphics are not going to be the best in the world
its sort of a classic
the planes probably handled the same as they did during that particular timediablo is the game that changed everything
i had high hopes for this expansion
this expansion was published by sierra not blizzard and it shows
the install insists on installing bloatware
the monk is added to the playable characters but is not well thought out
a monk should be a hand fighter but instead it uses the staff like a wizard
the special ability to locate treasure is nice but because the search skill can be learned in a book it is not unique like the trap finding of the rouge or the smithing skill of the warrior
the monk is a disappointment
there are a lot of new items mostly traps
because it adds items the player does not find as many good items as it raises the probability of finding them
i did not find any new quests
this is a very old game and while fun it wont run in windows   i had to dig out a very old xp computer before i could play it
i am glad that blizzard has not allowed other publishers to create expansions since
i am glad to have played this expansion but i dont think it was worth the price
the seller however was wonderful
i would recommend himyoull have to create a commandtxt folder  place multitest cowquest theoquest bardtest barbariantest to unlock some of this stuff
the monk can either bee seen as some kind of joke or the most challanging character to play
the bard  barbarian are improved versions of the rogue  warrior in that they can wield two handed weapons at a time
the cowquest is funny
not having played diablo without the expansion i cant say what else is new but i do like that this game has the save anywhere feature than many games after it neglected
there are an aweful lot of different dungeon maps so i suppose some were added as well as armor weapons monsters extra difficulty
on the negative side it didnt add better voice actingsystem on which this was tried out pentium iii  mhz nvidia tnt  pro  mb ram win with a monitor with  x  resolution
hellfire must be installed on top of an existing diablo install and requires the diablo disc rather than its own to actually playbeing a sierra product the installer will install sierra utilities in your startup menu if you dont already have it with no option to skip them although you can uninstall it separately the utilities are the sierratypical uninstallreadmesupportautoupdate
autoupdate if invoked asks you to connect to the net searches your system for sierra products then queries cendant softwares site to check for any patches or other updates including updates to the sierra utilities package itself
the original hellfire release must be patched for the town characters to properly interact with you for instance  otherwise their gossip mode will be stuck
the sierra utilities wind up under program files on drive c no matter where the user asked the actual game to install and the icon for the utilities is added to the start menuonce you have hellfire installed and patched youll see some differences from actually additions to baseline diablo right away as you start your next new character
a few new character types have been added
for a basic hellfire install only monk has been added but if you download and apply the purgatory modification on top of hellfire youll get bard and barbarian as well their icons look like warrior and rogue respectively but they have a different mix of skills
also a new game can be started at any of  difficulty levels  but a weak character has little chance against the higher levels so prudence is recommendeda nice bonus is that hellfire gives you the option of running in town regardless of your characteryoull also see new types of items to pick up oils
some allow you to repair your weapons without running to the blacksmith while others improve their statistics such as oil of accuracy and oil of fortituderunes
these arent related to diablo iis runes theyre plainlooking gadgets that cast a single spell when set off like crude grenades such as rune of fire or rune of stone new types of scrolls such as search very helpful for locating any loot in your vicinity search temporarily gives them an aura and marks them on your maphellfire also adds  additional levels
a new farmer character has been added to the town of tristram and he has a problem that he wont discuss with you until he knows you fairly well  that is your character must have a minimum expertise before hell give you the explosives you need to break open the hive south of town
the hive is  levels deep and contains  new quests that youll always receive leading to two level bosses
defeating the final level boss in the hive will give you the key needed to enter the remaining four new levels via a crypt in the cathedrals graveyardthe hives monsters are mostly variants of giant insects covering several different physical types with different kinds of attacks
as well as scorpions spiders and boarlike monsters there are monsters that spit poison or acid and giant floating orbs with tentacles that shoot energy bolts at you  and hunt in packs of course
the hives labyrinth generates random mazes as does the original diablo engine so the replay value is very high and its atmosphere is well done  the walls look like a wasps nest and instead of breaking open barrels to hunt for goodies the hive offers podsthe vault has an even wider range of new and interesting beasts lichs undead beings with a ranged attack satyrs anubislike creatures that look like animated metal statues firebats like those who appeared later in diablo ii
the final vault level is something of a set piece because of the level boss prison
the vault also provides the cornerstone of the world a place that is the same in all worlds  that is a mechanism for allowing different single player characters to exchange itemswhen i first loading this game there was many graphics problems and hanging up on my computers part
i have a relatively new computer compared to when this game came out in   this is a good game but make sure before you buy it that you have the best graphics card possible or else youll run into the same problems i didmicrosoft has given all other ww simulators a challenge
this game has great graphics and gameplay and at times good cinemas but not the greatest
its hard to play without a joystick and a good system if your  speed is not a pentium  or higher it could be a little slow
its still  fun though
the missions are fun and fast paced although it takes a while  to get used to and be able to handle the plane
also in battle its  sometimes hard to get the other planes but the bombers youll probably get  on your first try but it still takes a while to get the others
there are a  number of different aircrafts but only a couple available in each mission
it is a challenging and fun game i reccomend it to people who like air  combat and flight gamesi love this game
i am really addicted to this one
this is really an open racer
if there is traffic instead of there being only  root you can turn down alleys or other roads
i am not going to comment much about the  features someone has already probably written them but i have  problems  with this game
 the mapped are of chicago is too small
 there are too  little cars besides that i really love this game and you should buy this  gamethis is a pretty nifty little peice of software espcially since that the graphics are so good for the price anyway
to me the driving realistic enough to make you think that its real but not so unrealistic that you think that your driving on air through a stack of concreate blocks and moving plastic ones with no windows or headlights
the only complaint i have is that it gets pretty old after a while
ive had it for about two or three years and i have gotten tired of it
itll keep you entertained for about two years thoughi loved midtown from the moment i first played it im a sucker for driving games but this one is just a hoot to play
where else can you tool around a very very realistically modeled city chicago in this  case in cruise mode running away from the cops and reenacting scenes  from quotthe blues brothersquoti agree with some folks that  replayability becomes limited fortunately i had this at work where i and  my coworkers would often have headtohead races during lunch hour
great  fun was had by allso you might get sick of the limited selection of  cars the singleplayer race modes or even gasp chicago itself
after  all how many donuts can you spin on home plate of wrigley field
cheer  up midtown madness  is just around the corner
more cars
new race  modes
two new cities london and the mother of all carchase cities san  francisco
plus mm will be backwardcompatible with mm so new cars  will work in the old city etc etcprepare to feel the madness once  again
and if you havent played the original you really shouldthis is one of the best classics game ive ever had
this game is released years ago yet this game is still a fun game to play todaythis games requirements are not high and this game can be installed on slower pcs or laptops
if you like this game you may want to add the expansion pack available to enhance the features on this gamea police officer i knew got me into this game
i didnt think much of it because it was essentially the same game design as the venerable dune and war craft games
one age of empires as originally designed was never meant to be the huge slug fest that it ultimately turned into
the icons on the map were meant to be just that icons representing single armies
but the players demanded more and a patch was released allowing multiple units to be manifested on the map
result that icon that was supposed to represent an army suddenly became a single unit in the armyso instead of a game where you see elements of civilization compete and clash as was the intent new users essentially got another massive army combat game
not a big deal
it was fun all the same
i was befriended by some guys on the old ms gaming zone and wed have a blast after work or school going late at it late at night
and then on the weekends wed have marathon games in the morninggreat fun lots of fond memories
ill never forget my age of empire daysi think the games well past its peak but even as a solo effort its slightly amusingenjoythis is a great game
its going for  now damn good deal
a lot of fun
well worth ten bucks
plays on lap tops
so you can have something to do at work
wyatt kaldenberga game that is addictive and easy to play but hard to conquer
a game for the agesa game that is still in my library with its sequel  yeah i like it that much found it addictive and imaginative as well
it is date by todays standards and likely the online play is dead as it was when i attempted to play there
not to mention those out there playing online are usually hardcore and own any new people as well which was a major frustration when i finished first person a long time ago and attempted to go online haha
this game was fun with its story and is one i consider reloading at times after so many disappointments with newer games that just dont satisfy someone who has played for so many years nor someone who wants to spend so much for so little these days
todays game are pretty much knock offs level racing mindless hack and slash limited originality limited character uniqueness and profit versus gamer motivated today as well
if you want to give it a try id say it is worth the ten bucks  if you really like it the sequel is good as well
space command and conquer is a good way to think of this game with a mobile mother ship for game play though it is more multidirectional that c and c  control might take a little to get use to but who expects a game to practically play itself lolwhen i first started playing this game i was awestruck by the amazing graphics
i installed it everything ran smoothly and even though the tutorial level was extremely long i didnt tire of it simply because  everything was so impressive looking even at the meager x res i  started ati played the campaign next and although it was pretty cool  that you had the same resources and ships from level to level the levels  themselves were extremely easy i know that because i suck at rts games and  i didnt have to reload once on this one
it also was boring having to  collect every last scrap of resources at the end of the levels in order to  support your fleet through the next threateven through all of this i  thought it was a very fun addictive game but when i started playing  multiplayer it dawned on me where this game really lacks  theres not  enough variety
the ships arent varied enough and even though its d  theres only one terrain type  space
theres just not enough variety  for it not to get boring after too longso even with the stunning  graphics compelling music and simple but effective cutscenes the  unintuitive gameplay and the sameness of it all brought this still very  good game down to only  starsi was so excited about this game that i played it for  hours straight and completede it
the game is great and tons of fun but its just to easy
the enemy ai is too predictable and its all too easy to win the  battles
but if you want the greatst grafics ever on a pc buy this gamelet me start out by saying i waited some time until purchasing this software because of the bad reviews
im a huge fan of the first two games but decided to hold off on this one until the price dropped
something about not having sid meiers name in the title
i have to tell you though i was impressed by what i saw
perhaps it was because i was expecting a terrible sequel but call to power civ  is a better surprise compared to civilization   there are more changes and the game is more complex
as a matter of fact i find this game more challenging than the previous twonow dont let this review get you enthusiastic about the game because on the same token you might be disappointed with the sequel
there are gameplay problems such as a new macro economy that doesnt seem to have been well planned out by the designers no scenarios or predesigned maps specifically the world map a combat system that leaves you in disbelief when your m soldiers are wiped out by cowboys etc  i was also disappointed by the new wonders im not sure how the copyright worked out with the new company but i felt the old wonders were more logical
an example is the sphinx instead of the pyramids
that seemed to disappear quick as far as their effects because technology is obtained so easillyif an overhaul of the game was in store i feel that the designers could have put more technologies into the game as well as a better variety of attackdefense units considering it covers so much time
bc  ad
but the price is right for this game at this time
now that the call to power sequel is out i would recommend this game to see if you enjoy the new formatit seems some people dont like call to power because its not sid meirs civilzation but thats exactly the point its a different game
this game is kind of a hybrid between sid meirs civilization and age of kings
i think the ai intelligence is right up there with civilization by sid meir
also the graphics are pretty good too
this game is quotoldquot so it may not be up to some peoples standards
also i like the huge maps and the lots of advances city improvements and units
quite frankly i like call to powers spaceage military units better than civilizations
if youre looking for a sid meir clone dont buy this
but if youre looking for a fun alternative this could be for youive been a huge fan of kings quest for a long timei think it was the  first game i played that actually had better than monochrome graphics on my  xthe first three games are the best which is odd cause their  graphics are the worst by todays standards four and five are pretty  cool
six and seven had cartoonlike graphics but didnt seem to have the  adventurous feel of the others
the first one is still the most fun and  they even added both the old classic version and a newer version with  better graphicsif youve played either space quest or police quest  youll get an instant feel for this onethe kings quest series are probably the most memorable adventure games in  existance
they appeal to children adults men and women alike
the  games are serious slapstick romantic dashing and so many other things  all rolled into one
i really loved this series and im glad that someone  decided to package themeach game follows a member of the daventry  family in one manner or another
as an added bonys girls sometimes the  hero is actually a heroine
as the series progress you can watch the  daventry family grow have children and suffer tradgedy through at least  three generationsthe only thing that might be a problem is that as some  of these games are old they might not work on newer machines
make sure  that you have all the patches from sierra and read the documentation  thoroughly in case the games dont function your first try
with a little  bit of computer coaxing you should get them going again but you also might  decide its not worth the troublekings quest collection is very good
it has all of the kings quest games except kings quest   it also includes other neat games from the same creators
the collection is pretty challenging and will keep you up late in the night for months
very funthis game was great back when games sucked
if sierra remade this game and released it now with added civilization rts properties for each race fire giants wind giants water people earth dwarves ect it would  hold its own against all of its current competitorsit has amazing music artwork and you can really tell that the makers spent hundreds of hours making sure everything was seamless
even the one glitch that this game has the life staff glitch only makes the game more fun
its an old game but classic and with added expansionist features combiningage of wonders ii the wizards throneandsid meiers civilization  completewith lords of magic they could have a game that would stand the test of timeheck
if my win ran lords of magic i would still play it because theres just something about the music the artwork and the gameplay that really pulls you indont get me wrong i enjoyed this game from front to back
it has graphics that while not amazing you wont be confused about anything visually
the sound however should be award winning
it is simply magnififcent and gives you the feel of combat when the combat music is playing of coursebut this game has bugs
one really bad one i found is when i was making a trade this is a easy thing to do and will happen often
i paid a lot of gold and stuff for some crossbowmen and i never got them
it has only happened to me two timesthe game features a quest pack but i dont find it fun
they expect you to win against dozens of creatures and evil guys and god knows what else while you control at best six or seven creaturesthe lords of magic part however is much better
you control one of  faiths each with different creatures buildings and spells
some of them are much better off than others the weaker faiths have many more allies
the stronger faiths tend to have more enimies
two faiths fire and choas start out with only one ally which is each othertwo other faiths view them as neutralno matter what you do your opposite faith and the death faith start out powerful
this adds a new challenge to the game the death faith is out to kill everyoneso this game has good graphics sound and completly different gameplay
it does have bugs but they wont ruin it for you
you should check out this game
now im going to go play a game that you for whatever strange reason you have still have to purchaseright up front you need to know that this is not an easy game
video jocks who play all those fast paced and basically brainless real time strategy games will probably not go for this one
however thoughtfull  players with some tactical skill who like a real challenge will find this  game very rewardingthe heart of the game is its tactical combat system  which is by far the best that ive seen in any fantasy game
maneuver  plays a big part in it  using your faster units to circle around and hit  your opponents archers
using your slower melee units to screen your  archers from his troops
using the terrain to set up quotkill  zonesquot that you can lure your opponent into
it will take a little  getting used to so expect to loose your first few battles until you figure  out how things workthe game has an interesting variety of units and  spells and a particularly nice selection of artifacts that you can find in  dungeons and suchthe strategic level is good but not great
you collect  resources you build things you research spells same as in most games
one nice addition is the ability of high level characters to train new  units letting them start off with some experience
this solves the  problem that occurs in so many games of this type where new units starting  late in the game are basically hopelessthe two real weaknesses in the  game are    a very limited diplomatic engine
there are a total of eight  powers in the game but your options for peacefull interaction with the  other seven are pretty limited
  weak ai players at least on the  strategic levels
some of the computer players do absolutely suicidal  things like walking their undefended leader up to one of your strongholds
even the toughest balkoth lord of death isnt nearly as aggressive as he  should beoverall this is a challenging but very interesting game that  players with some tactical skill will really enjoyoh and one fast note  for new players the hardest part of the game is the opening
to maximize  your survival chances make your starting character a wizard of life then  on your first four turns attack four level one dungeons
then use all  your resources to hire mercenaries and attack the great templegood  luckthis is a pretty decent game
it is very hard to play at first but after a few days you will get the hang of it
you can personalize your city using the urban renewal kit
you can even paint your buidings andor you can place cool buildings in your city whenever you want
the only problem that i have with the game is the lack of funding for your city
you have to issue many bonds which are very hard to pay off
nevertheless this game is fun and i recommend it to everyone
with patience youll be building a lot of cities
remember build a power plant first
you cant have a city without electricity right
start your city near a lake or river and build a lot of water pumps
build them on the shores of your body of water
connect the pumps with power lines from your power plant
now build some zones
connect them with roads powerand water pipes from your water pumps
now build a hospital a schoola college a police station a fire department and a jail
you might also want to build stadiums andor parks
remember the pipes roads and power lines
fund everything at least  and listen to what people have to say about your city so you dont have problems
good luckive had fun with this game for hours and hours
the gameplay is god
the only  bad things is the graphic arent that great and flood cant wide the city off the face of the earth
its worth the buythis game introduced me at a young age to communial development planning and money management
this game is i guess you could say one to grow with it takes time and it helps one to learn along the way
id also like  to add that it helps especially a younger mind to experience freedom with  their money allowing them to spend it as they choose
if heshe spends it  unwisely go bankrupt that person will know to become better managers of  their money the next timeahhh gabriel knight
what can i say
probably one of the best adventure series to date
this limited edition package includes games gk and gk  along with the sound track a graphic booklet to gk gk novelization and  little this and a little thati would say that this limited edition is  worth purchasing but more so if you are new to the series
the biggest  thing in this edition is probably the soundtrack
the rest that is has to  offer such as the games themselves most fans already have
there is the  novelization of book of gk not including gk but if you dont have it  you can purchase both books here at amazoncom
the limited edition also  has a prologue gk graphic booklet but if you purchase gk the same  graphic booklet is included
there might be bug fixes in the limited  edition versions of gk amp but if you have problems with your earlier  releases of the games you can always download patches directly from  sierracomthe soundtrack was slightly dissapointing
most of the  tracks are from gk and minimum from gk and gk but gk wasnt out yet at  the time of this releaseif you are new to gk and want to see what its  all about i suggest getting this purchase instead of hunting for these  games seperatelyfor the price this is definitely a game set worth considering
both games  are quite good although definitely the second is the one that makes this  buy worthwhile
the first game is definitely a bit ancient in terms of  graphics and gameplaybut gabriel knight wow what a game
i played  it twice something i never do with adventure games
but this one was so  well written and conceived and it was recognized by many folks as a game  of the year
it truly does immerse you in the story and some of the final  movie sequences are superbly done
great locations great plot definitely  a game you have to play if you havent alreadythe game is civ in a new world so i guess we could also call it civ after our rocket landed
the interface is pretty much the same if we neglect optical changes
from  nations we got  factions which are  specialized in civ there were no special abilities so you have to know  from the beginning to which type you are most suited
automation is by my  opinion not very helpful the most helpful thing is building queue which  enables you to forget many smaller cities until they grow to size  or   then you must check every such city or bigger ones regularly if you want  to make enough progress
great bonuses can be won from the seas not  usable in civ and city improvements and wonders are little more numerous  than in civ
the whole scene is almost too dark and morbid alpha centauri  is a sun therefore a planet could at least have a little light
 it runs  very slowly units travel as they would take sedatives all time and the  diplomacy is very limited as is perhaps in real life but every faction  leader is tremendously aggressive
therefore best start for you is even  more essential than in civ if you fall back at the beginning it will be  very hard for you to gain back what you missed
the terrain is extremely  unpleasant and it can also be of great importance where you land
i had  best experience with the science faction zakharov because i was able to  overcome my opponents through technology
the game is very uneven from the  beginning if you dont get a good draw you are soon in trouble and it  could run much faster
that took away one star for her
otherwise  if you  like civ and if you dont mind too much about this lacks its no question   buy it
if you expect another revolution form sid lean back play  another civ  and wait for part having played more games of civ ii than i care to remember i was really looking forward to this game
initially i had thought it was just more of the same and i should have saved my money and kept playing civ ii
dozens  of games later i can honestly say this game was well worth the  i had  paid and at the current price of  its a real deal
the game isnt a  departure from civ ii in anyway and may fall short of others expectations  when they are anticipating civ iii but with any amount of game play they  will be pleased
is it the same game
basically yes
are there that many  improvements
no
is it better than civ ii
yes
just the little things  like unit customization new techs new races improved network play etc
make it worth it in my book
ive had the game since it was released and  still play on occasion and most likely will still play a year from now
if  you approach this game not expecting it to be a huge breakthrough in the  civ series then you wont be disappointedive owned this game for many years so long i dont even remember  pre
to the best of my memory this game occurred when sid and the civ people were having a bit of falling out so sid moved to fireaxis and produced this game which built into it many of the improvements that he forsaw for civ it was in some ways a pointer to civ iii and some of the changes to occur therebeing a  game it has primitive graphics no d etc as in todays games but i still think theyre decent
also like civ ii this is not a halfhour game it can go on for some time but at least you can save it and pick it up laterit does occur beyond civ after the launch of the spaceship and colonization of space and involves a new set of races and a new tech tree
some call the tech tree too foreign or hard to understand but i dont really think so the techs may seem artificial or invented while the civ techs seem real that is techs based on things we are familiar with
to me they are just a ladder to climb to more advanced capabilities wonders called special projects social options units etcthe game can be won through diplomacy conquest transcendence sort of a humanevolution event economics cooperative and many rules can be turned onoff and iron man modefurther there is major flexibility in choosing not only governments but also economics military education environment big factor in this game research health etc
and you can take stances ruthless moderate or idealistic for military interactions
trade still can play a big role toothis is not a war game though it can be played that way instead it is an influence and strategy game without being too longwinded i think its strong points are relative to civ ii you can use the governor much better including customizing it to your own rules as opposed to the governor in civ which i dont know anyone who uses including unit automations these are especially useful in  to reduce the tedium in the ics infinite city sprawl and popbooming strategies often employed where there may be many many cities
 strategic deallings with other civs are crucial to a successful game
 boundaries or areas of influence are introduced these help manage warpeace and some of the really annoying situations in civ ii
 you can set ingame slants on the governor as you progress through appropriate play styles of explore discover build and conquer you have to be prepared to play any of them depending on game circumstances
 there are major improvements in automation beyond just the governor and slants such as using queues for building and group commands like build road to instead of having to go tile by tile to do it
the goto command is improved too complete with mods like avoid enemies etc instead of a lot of units the units instead are basic but extensive mods can be researched and added to basic units to form new capabilities
this helps avoid the warrior vs machinegun syndrome all units can be upgraded for a fee this is more realistic than the throwaways or needing leos workshop wonder
 materials dont have to be in the city to use it they can be teleported to other cities from one city or from a distant location if you can control the landwell you get the idea its just a lot of new stuff i dont particularly like the huge differences among the races some of which have such constraints that they are virtually impossible to win a game with only  or so really lend themselves to playable games
but i dont think this is a game stopper just a constraint it would be nice if some of the traits could be modified to more balance the game but i truly think they were created to be a foil to the human player
as you play you can use the social engineering for some balancingthe game is richly complex with numerous inplay options mods and social structures etc that can give play variationsall in all i find it to be a game offering many enjoyable hours though it is hard to force it to play your play style you instead have to probe for play styles that fit the nature of the challenges of your particular game
i still find myself playing this now and then even  years after its releaseit can be purchased now for the  range including shipping
id say its a definite option at those priceswhile the graphics are not that advanced it is still one of the best turn based strategy games available the different cultures each have an individual feel to them and the advancement is both fast and enjoyablealpha centauri is a turnbased citybuilding strategy a great followon but not a sequel to civilization ii
the game adds a lot of diplomacy features although i usually try to wipe the other players out
alpha centauri has automation features too city governors who decide what to build although sometimes they would try to build something they shouldnt such as the build governor making military units
overall a classic recommended for most and a must have for civilization fansi bought this game at a eb store
it was one of the most interesting civ games i have ever played
it had verry good game concpts and i played for hours on end
and that was about  to  years ago
i still remeber playing it
but then again i like all civ games
it got  stars over all
but i only got  stars of fun out of it
i finaly got burnt out on it and traded it
and i have nothing but good memories from playing it
planting forest and reaserching biomorphic fugi
and the wierd mind worms which took the place of barbains
differnt factions such as chairman yang of the hive and more cool stuffthis is a good space simulator
it allows you to control many different aspects of your people including socioeconomic model resources transportation security etc
it also allows you to design your own units based on what technologies you have researched
it is also a good macroscopic military strategy game
it is turnbased so if you play only rts dont play this
if you dont mind turnbased games though and you like spacebased strategy games you should play this
the graphics are secondrate but that is just because it is oldok first off id like to say that um jammer lammy is a great game
but only for a select few
some people might be turned off by the d graphics and cute characters and it can be frustrating to time yourself while quotplayingquot the guitar
at first i could only get through the levels on the easy mode but after a while everything gets easierthe main concept is this you are lammy um jammer lammy a guitarplaying lamb in a rock band called quotmilkcanquot which also includes a bassplaying cat a drumming dog and a rapping onion
throughout the whole game you are helping lammy get out of sticky situations by playing the guitar ex
putting out a fire flying a plane
you are rated as awful bad good or cool and if you make it to quotcoolquot you get to solo
you play the guitar by pressing different buttons on the control in time to the music and there a guide telling you when to play
the songs are catchy and sometimes very funny the animations are funny too but most of the time you are watching a scrolling guide on top of the screen so this game is sometimes more fun for spectatorsum jammer lammy has great music good gameplay esp
if you like puzzle games or music for that matter imaginative controls and and the whole game is a cool concept come on a guitar playing lamb its never been done before
there are hardly any music games out on psx as far as i know parappa the rapper and um jammer lammy are the only ones but i could be wrong
overall um jammer lammy is a very fun game
if youre interested in a challenging game with catchy songs a rock band made of up animals bizarre scenarios or just something different then this is for youthis video game system is great and even though it isnt very noticeable right now it will be a major competitor for the game boy color system and is very compareable
the two systems are the same size only the neo geo pocket is horizontal instead of vertical
the system also has a bigger screen with sharper and more colorful graphics
the joystick is a bit hard to use but you will get used to it
the one major gripe i have with this system is the fact that there arent really any standout games right now
i do like the fighting games and i have neo turf masters sonic pocket adventures and dark arms beast buster  which are all good games but they arent very noticeable
still id buy this system and make these games noticeable because the games and system deserve itnintendo has always been a fighter
the game boy and segas game gear have duked it out for quite some time
however snk seemed to notice something the game gears library of games lacks the oomph the game boy does
that said it was time for portable neo geo action
the neo geo pocket color couldnt have had more potential
the system looked dang awesome
look at the bitesc graphics
listen to that sound chip
and then came the gamesthe game library certainly looked awesome at first
after all weve got handheld fatal fury metal slug pacman in color and even sonic the hedgehog joined in the party
the titles were certainly too good to be true but they were
this convinced customers that the game boy was having serious competition for the first timethat was until later years
all of those games we sawwere all we were getting
the neo geo pocket color died in just  years leaving us with a rather lopsided library
heck even the japanonly games still result in a small overall library
and because of that there are very few games of certain genres metal slug and sonic being the only platformers i know on itbut that does not mean the pocket color is a bad system
the games that we do have on here are excellent
want to see the exclusive adventures players experience on only this handheld
buy the systemthis is an excellent game but not one that you can really jump right into
it takes a lot of playing to get used to the many controls and commands
microprose was quite thourough and everything is pretty darn authentic
if youve got the time and patience this game is very rewardingone downside no joystick calibration
or force feedbackotherwise excellentthis game just annoys me to the point i dont want to play it
the term metroidvania doesnt do it justice if anything it insults the metroid name because everything in metroid is about exploration and everything is deliberate
sotn just teases you in the first part of the game and annoys you all together
so at the start you play as richter belmont picking up from rondo of blood or dracula x in the west
you reach dracula and enters chessy voice acting
so your like oh ok i can dig this but youre already fighting dracula so what else is there to fight
fast forward a couple of years and now enters alucard running through the forest and jumps the gate
awesome scene now your in control and this guy has a powerful weapon and armor
so everything just dies in one hit
yeah
just as powerful as richter
then its taken away from you
that
is
so
not
cool
why the big tease
where in development they thought was a good idea to show players alucards powerful equipment then have it taken away
then the sense of direction
oh my god after that big tease you follow the path and then after a while you explore but you cant because you need a relic to open blue door but you need to find the relic but you dont know where to find it
you find those relics laying around only that they supposed to be in the game already
not a fudging relic to show enemies names or the damage
its cryptic and its not known where to go
then the spells its never told that you can cast spells to gain small health and summon a spirit
however
moving away from the negatives i will say that the soundtrack is amazing and the graphics have aged well
its an ok title much like simons quest this game isnt for everyone and im almost done playing the game and i feel ive wasted so much time getting lost i just want to fight dracula and get it over with
thats the point isnt
to get lost waste time get powerful and then comes the endgame boss your pretty powerful already so youll be disappointed on how the boss fight came outoverall its an ok title but to me its just more annoying than fun im already level  and majority of the boss fights are becoming easy but im nearly done with the game so i have to beat it now
its a game that just wastes you time all games are but this one and simons quest just literally wastes your time like no other
the portable games of castlevania follow this formula now which is disappointing
just try this game out for  minutes then youll see what im taking about
its also an xbla title so you can find it pretty easy or pay for a ps titlethe good fast fun gameplay nice graphical style some of the best video game music ever created long good storythe bad extreme difficulty can really turn some people away the age here shows quite a biti never played this game before until now
i was too young at the time to really understand the game
now that ive played it i understand why it got its praise and i dont understand at the same time
what really makes me not like this game as much as other people is the extreme difficulty
either that or i just suck at the game
im not really good at d platformers to begin with but this game does deliver on all accountsit has a great story great graphics fast fun gameplay you can equip stuff on every body part you have ahem you can buy things
while im not a huge castlevania fan to begin with first cv ever was lament of innocence ps
im not saying this game is terrible but for me the difficulty was way too hard for me
i just couldnt get past the third stagetheres no other way to put it there has been no other game ive ever played in my life where ive wanted to play the game from the beginning over and over as i did with castlevaniasotn
sure i beat it countless times but from beginning to end is just so much fun its unbelieveable
the game is super deep youll never use every special trick no matter how long and how many times you play this game
the graphics are spectacular for d the music is the best of any game ive ever played why no soundtrack available
so why not  stars
it hurts me to not give it  stars but i have to be honest the games kinda easy sure its super long but back in the day of the old castlevania games they were just so challenging in terms of obstacles and amount of enemies
but with this game with all the save spots free extra health and lack of extremely hard obstacles its kinda hard to die
although if it had been that hard then i probably wouldnt be playing it over and over again
lets say  starsone more thing if you go through the entire castle and beat belmont dont think youre done yet youve still got a whole other castle to conquersymphony of the night is considered the pinnacle of the castlevania series and with good reason
at a time when sidescrollers were falling to full d games konami proved that there was still room for a good d game in the gaming industry
symphony boasts impressive environments huge bosses multiple endings creepy music and more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at
my only problem is that its just too much for me to rememberwhen im being mauled by beezlebub is not the time to look up the dark metamorphosis spell
if you take the time to learn all your spells as well as the insandouts of all the familiars though you wont have that big a problemi have just a few picks about the game
as stated before the inventoryspell system is huge and can be intimidating
voice acting
aughh
wish there was an option to turn the original japanese voice acting on like you can in lament of innocence
bosses
bosses are typically easy provided you have enough healthrestore items
however i frequntly found myself being turned into a bloody pulp literally by the sheer numbers and strength of ordinary enemiesisnt it suppossed to be the bosses who kill you over and over againdont get me wrong symphony is one of the best castlevania titles to datebut if youre looking for a more userfriendly castlevania game i suggest aria of sorrow for the game boy advancethe reason im still getting psx games is nostalgia but also because there are few games these days that match the awesomeness of the wipeout franchise
having played this on both psx psp and ps i must say the wipeout games never disappoint
the techno soundtracks are a good match for this type of racing game
if you are like me it will not matter if you get this or the more recent versions it will be as funive enjoyed this game for years
it doesnt get old
lost my original copy and had to get anotheri have only played flight sim games on pc and was really surprised to discover this great game on dreamcast
its an old game which is almost a decade old but i had to test my flight joystickpanther
i had a problem loading the game because i bought it from ebay for  with some scratches
after i got past the main screen i had a choice of planes to purchase but since i had no money which you get for shooting down enemies i had to pick my default planei have completed the first couple of missions in about an hour because i picked the easiest setting
but about half was through the game i started having difficulty completing some missions because of time limit and more enemies
i finally got enough money to buy a descent plane and none of the enemy planes could touch methere are escort missionsprotect the target and take out an enemy objectives
the real challenge came during the last two levels which i had to restart numerous times and by that time i could afford to buy most of all the planes
there are different variety of enemies such as groundsea and air
but the most challenging is the air targets especially when you have to chase them and you have limited amount of timei was using a panther flight stick and didnt have a chance yet to try standard controller
the flight stick was awesome it responded quickly and all buttons have its own distinct function
i would recommend playing this game with a flight stick if you can find it
it  just feels like youre in the game when using the joystickthe graphics are as you expect on console made in  pixalated in some parts
the plane detail is pretty good for a console flight sim and looks very similar to real plane
the ground texture look good from above but really pixalated when closethis game is on dreamcastso dont expect a real flight sim this is just an arcade port
you can buy this game on ebay or amazon for under 
just have funthis is konamis attempt at ripping off namcos ace combat series
plain and simple
whoever was expecting microsoft flight simulator really needs to buy a clue
the dreamcast is a game console people not a pc
there is simply no way to replicate the dozens of keyboard commands required to produce a realistic flight simulationwhat does the dreamcast do best
correct arcade games
this is an arcade attempt at a flying game
no takeoffs no landings no aileron tweaks no altimeter factoring it is a plain easy to understand straightforward shootemup in the sky
are the controls sluggish
yes
do the different planes really matter
not really
will you get any mileage out of the machine guns
probably not
but this is all par for the course for the kind of game this issky odyssey for ps is a much more fun and active flying game than this but this is by no means chopped liver
the graphics are often impressive and the game does put up a fight in the later stages
but as long as you arent dumb enough to expect a nasa flight replicator you might very well enjoy this little romp through the unfriendly skies
who knew terrorists would have the  to own more jet fighters than most industrialized nationsps
how in the world does this game maintain a star review rating average when i know for a fact that i read at least a dozen star reviewsthis game is original
it has cool characters and a nice range of attack and weapons
starting off you play with two usable characters
one is weaker yet faster the other is slower yet stronger
the only thing i have against this game is the fact that the music can be really really annoying and the control is a little stiff
oh and youll get stuck in the early quarter of the game
i still dont know what to dooverview its a good thing blue stinger is a launch title because had it been released later closer to capcoms resident evil code veronica it would have been drowned in the torrent of comparison
developed by climax graphics of shining force landstalker and dark savior fame and published stateside by activision blue stinger with its cliched portrayals and bmovie voice acting is an adequate if underwhelming entry into the everexpanding genre of survival horrorgraphics   clean
very clean
thats the most appropriate way to describe the visuals in blue stinger
the highresolution texture maps and relatively highpolygon models are what youd expect from a nextgeneration console and the developers made sure to add liberal amounts of lighting particle and translucency effects
boss encounters are another notable as they really show off the abilities of segas machine
the only area in which blue stinger does not stack up is a big one animation
no motioncapture here
the characters animate quite stiffly creating a rather slow and goofylooking gait and while this is not totally damning it takes a while to get used tosound   well this is a cdbased machine so the music is high quality
some of it seems a bit out of place for a survival horror game but its not bad
this actually works in some places such as the townmarket area where the christmas atmosphere and music creates an atmosphere eerily reminiscent of the original gremlins film
voice acting is another thing entirely
while i dont think it is quite as bad as most of the professional magazines have made it out to be its definitely of the bmovie variety perhaps a bit better than the original resident evils
maybecontrol   this is blue stingers weakest point
analog control is too loose for precision movement while digital simply isnt responsive enough
the result is a game thats difficult to play at times when precision movement is critical such as swimming
luckily this isnt a platformer so these are few and far between
what really makes the control so lacking is the camera which while far improved over the cinematic one found in the japanese version thanks to some noticeable tweaking by activision still manages to get itself in shall we say less than advantageous positions usually theyre experienced while in water or in tight corridors
while these are minimal there are more than enough of them to annoy all but the most hardcore gamersgameplaytheme   yes blue stinger has its problems but it is fun
as with any game of this nature part of the fun comes with blasting enemies with highpowered weapons
in this area bs delivers
ranging from the usual shotguns and rocket launchers to more exotic weapons such as ray swords a lightsaber ripoff and railguns
each character has their own unique arsenal of weapons which are either found or bought from numerous vending machines located throughout dinosaur island
needless exploration and a few vague puzzles can dampen the fun for you remember the passcode  youll need it if you stick with it the experience can be rewardingoverall   like many launch titles blue stinger is a flawed first effort perhaps moreso than many of the others
that said it does have its good points which are far more numerous than the gaming press is willing to let on and while not for every gamer if you like blasting baddies adventuring and a decent story and are willing to work past the flaws blue stinger might just be worth a few of your hardearned dollarsthe variety of monsters and weapons is very cool and the story is fun
the controls for combat are good but your character does seem to plod around
its a very good gameblue stinger i think is a must own for anyone with a dreamcast this game is an action game and a survival horror game the first time you complete this game is the best you can complete it many times but you already know whats going to happen some bad things about this game are their is some annoying music you have to put up with and you end up killing the same mosters over and over again their is so much more to say about this game but ill let you figure them out buy this gamewipeout  is not a better game than wipeout xl
wipeout  special edition isbut since special edition is europe only you probably have ordinary wipeout  it is still extremely goodthe good extremely pretty graphics
very few games on the ps compete with it visually only one that comes to mind is ridge racer r
 very good course design
it has some better courses and some worse courses than xl
 cool music
better than xls
full stop
 boost
this is the only wipeout game that has it but its a great additionthe bad it feels unfinished
the handling is a bit silly at times weapon pads dont darken when inactive there is text in the menus that is pretty much unreadable no indication of you being on the final lap the menus are a bit oddly designed in certain bits such as the  or  players select
 the unlock system is stupid
i shouldnt need to play the same stages over with different vehicles to unlock new ones
 only  tracks
xl didnt have very many either but still
 the announcer doesnt say what weapon you are going to be hit with just warning
 a lot of sections are too dark and your vehicle doesnt have any sort of forward illuminationspecial edition fixes all the problems listed but the last  but its pal onlyxl delivers a better racing experience compared to standard wipeout  but  is still better than fusions meh course design overindulgence of combat and styleif you like wipeout and cant play pal imports get wipeout  if you can import get special edition with its  extra tracks and loads of fixesthis game has some of the best graphics that ive seen for the psx
it levels are very colorful and filled with futurous scenery
the many powerups and weapons add to the fun in this game
control is a little hard when you first start playing but it is easy to get used to the craft slide a bit when you are turning
there are only  ships to choose from and some of them arent very good
more tracks wouldnt hurt either
this game is a good game and you should buy itthis game has many levels and tons of characters to go along with them
tricks tricks and more tricks that describes this game
plenty and plenty of game play
if you love skateboarding get this gamei went through my old video games weeding out those destined for trade in at bookmans
i saw this one and remembered liking it so i threw it back in and played it through
i forgot how much fun this game was and highly recommend a retry to those fps freak out there
i mean you can get this game dirt cheap now and it is a total blast
my only beef is you have to play it through in order to use the cheat available and many of us play a game once and thats itother than that not a single complaint
this game freaking rocks
tons of different monstersfoes tons of cool weapons level upon level of varying backgrounds
too me back to the old days of all the doom gamesso if youre feeling nostalgic and want to play an fsp that doesnt require you to evolve three extra fingers on each hand dig this one back up or buy it dirt cheap here on amazon
you wont regret itthis game packs lots of action and a great soundtrack
it is great port of the pc game but the levels are not quite the same
as one who has played quake ports or pretty much every available hardware n psx pc pocketpc symbian os apple ios windows mobile etc this game is invaluableone of the best fps for ps one
great graphics with a surround sound option
comtrols leave a bit to be desired as far as customization goes
not much for scares or surprizes and still mildly inferior to the legendary originalhighly recommended to anyone who still plays the old psgreat shipping and condition of productwhen quake  originally hit the pc its unabashed violence and surprisingly addictive gameplay not only outshined its predecessor it killed it before it hit the ground
the ps and n conversions took much longer than expected to be released and fans of the pc game anxiously awaiting the home versions were a little worried about the quality of the home system versions
when quake  hit the ps those fears were dead in the dirt
activision hammerhead and id all did a fantastic job bringing quake  to the ps while keeping a surprisingly smooth frame rate although the graphics arent as good as its pc counterpart but that was expected and the unabashed violent addictive gameplay remains intact
the game makes excellent use of the pss dual shock controller the controls are easy and every button is to be used
while some parts can be frustrating and the game has a rather steep learning curve quake  is still undeniably fun
those still holding on to theyre pss can find this bad boy at a rather cheap price and have a great time with this near classic fpsbefore i get into anything about quake ii i have to say if you still own a sony playstation or like first person shooters in general quake ii is definitely a must own
lots of great things to say about this gamethe levels were well designedeven today the graphics are pretty good as a d polygonal shooterlove the light sourcing effects that bring realism to the overall look that quake ii hasvery smooth fluidlike gameplay and excellent use of colorthankfully the game has some pretty tough enemies because i notice with d shooters you dont get huge doses of enemies like you get in the older doom gamesso why starswell sigh i was blown away by the first quake and theres plenty of words for itadvanceddarkcreativeor my choice of word would be primitive
firing a nailgun at an ogre enemy wielding a chainsaw and chucking grenades i thought the quake series was just going to get more grim with every future release in its polished form
quake ii is still a noteworthy shooter but it goes towards a hitechbioorganic cybernetic experiment and does a good job at itits just that the quake series didnt stick to a particular formulathe single player isnt so great but if youve got access to  controllers with duel shock support i highly recommend getting this game and playing a few death match rounds with your buddiesyes quake ii the game pc owners have been enjoying for a long time has finally made it to the playstation
being a fan of pc firstperson shooters i was less than excited
i mean ive already played the singleplayer to death on the pc and multiplayer fps games on a console are usually quite pathetic
the n version was pretty good provided that you could look past the flaws that most fans of the pc version would notice in the first  seconds
the playstation version has many of these same flaws but given the playstations rapidly aging hardware its easier to overlook these flaws
while you may not remain interested in the singleplayer mission to see it to its completion the fourplayer multiplayer in quake ii will make you glad you had picked up a multitap and three extra dual shocks
the storyline is your typical hostile alien sort of thing
you as a space marine land on the planet of stroggos with the intention of blowing up everything in sight
unfortunately you get separated from the rest of the marines and are forced to go it alone
so now you must run all over this planet collecting keys opening doors taking elevators and wiping out various alien monsters before they tear you in half
to wipe out these aliens youll have to find weapons  your wimpy default blaster simply wont cut it
youll find a couple shotguns two types of machine guns a grenade launcher a rocket launcher and two types of energy weapons  one of which is the almighty bfg a gun that spits out a huge power ball and wipes out just about anything that gets near the blast
youll also find a great deal of ammo armor and health scattered about the levels
a game like this really requires a good control scheme to succeed
thanks to excellent use of the dual shock controller it has one
in the default setup you use the left stick to look around and the four buttons on the front of the pad to move in any of four directions
you can also configure the right analog stick so you can use it in much the same way
the r buttons handle firing and jumping and the l buttons let you cycle through your weaponry
you can play the game on a standard controller but trust me  you wouldnt want to
the game also supports the playstation mouse but if youre already used to using a mouse to control your firstperson shooters then you probably have a pc and youve been playing the pc version of quake ii for ages making this game mostly uselessgraphically the playstation really does a decent job
the textures may look a little washedout a few models may have been simplified and a few frames of animation may have been chopped here and there but overall the game runs at a very playable speed
the tradeoff is that the game has much more frequent loads
most of the level modification between the pc and playstation versions is in the addition of many more small closedoff hallways that serve as little loading areas
at first its not a big deal but when youve got to go back and forth between different parts of a level to accomplish various tasks loading every  seconds is enough to make you crazy
the games sound effects and music are taken directly from the pc version and overall the sound is greatthe multiplayer mode is where this title picks up most of its value points
sure a few of the multiplayer levels are a little on the weak side but there are enough good ones that it doesnt really matter
the three modes in the game are standard deathmatch team deathmatch and versus
versus mode is a lastmanstanding affair where you and up to three friends duke it out until only one of you remains
the coolest multiplayer option is the gravity slider which lets you turn gravity way down for some really highflying action or turn it way up to keep people from hopping around like lunatics
sure its not as versatile as being able to program your own modifications to the game but its a nice touch and it manages to breathe a bit of life into the game
in the end the playstation version of quake ii falls under the same disclaimers as most other pctoconsole firstperson shooters  if you own the pc version dont waste your time
but if youre looking for some good splitscreen shooting action with a decent singleplayer mode to back it up this version will make your dayjjgames sold it for a good price but its pretty scratched and comes wo the casethis is one of best ps games ever played
pure destruction is what its all aboutit definitly improved from the first one from the upgrading of the vehicles
like the one before this one it was funi played this along time ago and was immersed until the end
it was on my old pc and the graphics were top notch but i could not play at full copacityi am now going to play it on my new gaming pc and it shall rockthis game is beutiful challenging full of action and smarts
the idea behind the game play is awesome
the worlds and characters are realistic and belivableso put on that halo and get ready to be plunged into a new futuristic worldi approached this game with caution as i was not a fan of nomad soul and expect it to be similar
yes it has similarites but it is  times better
firstly you dont get lost and wonder aimlsessly
there is a logical behind  everything
the idea of pocessing enemies is a new and original one
its  what makes the game for me actually
there are graphical and soung bugs  like a lot of rushed games these days but messiah is an original and  novel idea
controls are good
story is good but no masterful plot
it is a  game i didnt expect too much from but was hooked
give it a try  you  might like it
oh one other thing this game is tough from day  theres a  big learning curve but once this is passed it will be weeks of enjoyment  until you complete it
hurray for bobi had read all of the bad reviews for messiah so when i found it in the bargain bin at a local computer store i decided to throw caution to the wind and give messiah a try
perhaps the game was in pretty bad shape upon its release but after applying the latest patch ive found a game with rich graphics great sound and an interesting storyline
the control scheme could be a little more intuitive
messiah is definitely an underrated titleyes fallout  is one of the best rpg games out there especially considering the fact that there are no futuristic rpgs in the current market
however this game requires way to much search and talk
it gets  very old very quickly and you will find yourself with the best equipment  on the planet by simply waiting for two different parties to kill each  other
i had a flamethrower within one hour of playing that made me nearly  invincible
i mean come on
unless you are going to play this game  without accepting help from npcs this really proves no challenge and  damages the fun factor
at least the price is rightfallout ii while falling short of the original fallout or the squad based fallout tactics is still a fantastic game definitely worth a look
it plays similar to the first installment but boasts better graphics and richer character dialogues the two things going for it
i recommend purchasing the dual package which contains both fallout i amp fallout ii
it is worht the price for the first alone and the second is a nice bonus
four stars highly recommendedi would have given this game  stars were it not so blatantly hateful of republicans
the last portion of the game gave the character no option but to spew venom hate and lies about republicans
i only finished the game anyway because i had already bought it and thrown away the receipt
otherwise i would have returned itin the future with regards to the rumoured upcoming fallout  i will keep the receipt and do internet research about that game before deciding to keep it for goodwhile fatally flawed by its undisguised bias the game in its time was excellent
the mixture of realistic weapon sex graphic violence post apocalyptic storyline and rpg elements make this an almost great gamethe graphics were quite dated and the sound effects often cut out but this was not the games fault
i bought this game long after its time
unsurprisingly the intervening years since the games first release saw graphics and sound standards rise dramatically
my soundcard also was not supported for by the game
again not surprising and not at all the games faultim surprised at the number of reviewers who found this game disappointing
i found it to be a challenging expansion pack that significantly raises the difficulty level over that of the original
no tales of the sword coast doesnt extend the story line of bg and no the story line doesnt even fit comfortably within the original bg plot
and yes tales is basically  an addon that simply allows your characters to increase their experience points and find new items in the processstill i think it is a fault to criticize the game too much as many customer reviewers have on issues of story line
if you want a great involved story well buy planescape torment my vote for greatest rpg title ever
even though tales of the sword coasts game objectives may seem completely out of whack with the bg main plot think back to bg and i think youll recall lots of areas that didnt have anything to do with the iron shortage or saverok  for instance did the firewine dungeon quotreallyquot play a crucial role in terms of story line
did helping drizzt fight off those hordes of baddies really advance the plot
how about all the random questsin other words i think one should evaluate tosc using one simple maxim as a guide namely are the new areas fun to play
in my opinion the new areas in tosc are both challenging and enjoyable
one of the levels beware spoilers here the ice island is a throwaway but the other two werewolf island and durlags tower are impressive
werewolf island does have a captivating plot and although its size in terms of area isnt large the battles are numerous and semidifficult
durlags tower provides players with something that bg kind of lacked  a decent dungeon crawl
i found durlags tower very involving and moderately difficult
unlike the ridiculous monster count and borderline unplayability in terms of difficulty of icewind dales dungeons durlags tower strikes a nice balance between being difficult but not too difficult it knows how to challenge players without forcing them to die reload die reolad die reload ad infinitumlastly i found this game a decent value in terms of length
tosc is now a bargain bin purchase and although some customers here like to brag lie
about how the game only took them  hours to complete tales took me betwen  and  weeks to finish
i admit that i may not be a master adampd player yet i did successfully complete bg and felt that my party was very much up to the challenge of the expansion packthis game does get docked a notch however for some small problems  pathfinding is still troublesome
 inventory juggling is still a nightmare
i truly believe that about  of baldurs gate and this expansion is spent juggling inventory items
 the puzzle element introduced in durlags tower is more annoying than fun
 the nexttofinal battle against a monster summoned with durlags blade is insanely difficult and convoluted
but basically if you enjoyed the original you should probably enjoy this expansionafter this game i played diablodiablo is not a bad gamebut baldurs gate makes it look like pongthis is the best adampd game ivve ever played and i play a lotbaldurs gate is about a kid played by you who grows up in candle keepunder the kind tutelage of his foster fathergorionafter a couple of years growing upgorion wants to move awayyou dont know whyin about  minutes into the game thats how long it took megorion gets killed in a horrid battle by mercenariesyou must avenge himbutafter traveling and making friends and making enemiesyou find out your dark secretvery addictive gameyet the computer was going through hellthats the only problembuy this if you liked lotr
lord of the ringsi bought baldurs gate after  friends kept telling me how great it was
im not a big rpg player however i did find this to be a truly great gamepositive features of the game visually the game is quite well done especially the scenary and spell effects
the atmosphere can get quite spooky in underground caverns and during thunderstorms
there is a lot of flexibility when it comes to character creation and one is even allowed to doubleclass and choose their characters appearance
the npcs can be quite engaging and party members you can have up to  actually interact with each other verbally in often humorous dialogue
the storyline is interesting and generally linear though there are many subquests that one can choose to pursueregarding the down side of the game by the time the game got to chapter  there are  i was ready for it to end
and the ending itself is a bit anticlimactic
my party got up to only th level and thus had rather limited abilities
comparing this game to morrowind which i am now playing bg could have been a bit more openended and expansive in size which would have enhanced its replayability
after  intense days of playing to the end i promptly auctioned it on ebayfor those interested in a welltold gorgeously rendered ddstyle adventure with a welldefined main plot and credible monsters and npcs bg is a good buyrating  starsthis is an interesting title
i never got into it that far but it is  pretty cool
very difficult
beware not for amateur gamers
i can get about   hours in and half my men die
i dont like when that happens but you got  live i guess eh
good luck if you choose this titlethis game is wonderful
customizing my character was very entertaining and one of things i enjoy the most about rpgs and the small side quests are numerous and interesting
there any many areas that serve no particular purpose other than to gain some xp doing quests
this i think is a weakness of the succeeding games in the bg series there are not enough exploration options available
the possibilites of your party are nearly endless since there are many npcs all of whom have their own strengths
however there is little npc interaction which is disappointing
there are some annoying aspects of gameplay which is what caused me to downgrade this game slightly such as the fact that the characters are excruciatingly slow and have a poor pathfinder feature which leaves them w a tendency to go places other than where you planned
you will be challenged from the first shocking event to the final showdownand you will enjoy it the entire waybaldurs gate is probably one of the better role playing games on the market today
it has some good characters along with a riviting story line that will keep you hooked as you play it
the music is great and the graphics are very good for a computer game
there is a wide list of characters and npcs that will help your character on their quest
and the best part of this game is that the controls are actually easy to use so you arent stressing yourself out to looking for the right buttons to use in your battles
i rate this game at  stars because it could be a little longer and a little better but for  it is definately a game worth buyinghey i remember the old goldladen boxes for the first adampd games by  ssi back when the c was still a great computer and im here to tell you  this is a vast improvment
overall the game is well drawn with decent sound  and standard voice acting
many elements of the pencil and paper game a  found here with some annoying omissions that will be fixed in the next  installment
these were the low experience cap and inability to distribute  weapon slots towards twoweapon style to name a couple
at any rate the  game is loaded with subquests and days of good solid gameplay
black isle  is on a rollone of the things that always made dampd annoying for me to play was that the gm could rarely be completely cold and fair in regards to die rolls
sometimes the gm would pick a favorite class or a favorite pc and  theyd always come out better than others
well in baldurs gate the gm  is the computer so everything is fair and impartialon the singleplayer  aspect the game is fun
you can be whatever type of person you want to be  and do whatever you want
you can be a noble paladin ot a scoundrel  thief its up to you
as you progress through the game you gain  experience and abilities and learn more and more about why people are  hunting youon multiplayer it can be fun if you have the right group
the story is the same as it is in singleplayer except one member of your  party is the main character while the rest of the group are backups
if  you have a group with enough imagination you can have a game that lives up  to any tabletop dampd gamein actual gameplay a lot of what you do is  travel from place to place and quest
sometimes you encounter people who  want to talk to you and sometimes you run into a pack of monsters to kill
the interface reminds me a bit of diablo but the games are not clones of  each other i assure youalthough the game is slightly buggy that  cleared right up with a patch
i also like the ability to customize your  character portraits and sounds it makes the roleplaying aspect all the  more realill state from the outset that my background in rpgs is limited
sure i had friends who would gather together on friday or saturday nights to play pen and paper dampd but i was never among them
occasionally however i did enjoy playing computerbased roleplaying games the three bards tale adventuresi say all this in an effort to convince nonadampd people or nonrpg players out there to give baldurs gate a chance
yes adampd rules are numerous and complicated i have no idea for instance what d means but dont worry too much because the computer takes care of all this for you
essentially youll encounter enemies youll push your spacebar to pause the action and point and click directing your party members how and whom to attack
the computer calculates all the dierolling stuff
you just sit back and watch the blood fly
this is not to say however that bg is a brainless game
in fact youll learn quickly that quotfools rush inquot if you dont think about battle strategy
put simply baldurs gate achieves a perfect balance it both satisfies hardcore dampd folk who have long clamored for an accurate pc rpg experience while also not scaring away newbiesthis is not to say that bg doesnt take some learning
the manual is thick and at times confusing particularly in how to memorize spells
there are lots of options in bg so youll have to become familiar with the game interface and inventory system
be prepared to spend several hours just getting comfortable with how the game operates
also be prepared to die a lot in the beginningonce youve mastered the controls this game gets addictive and fast
bg is now an older title and with bgii having been out now for over half a year the original is currently a bargain bin purchase
i bought my copy through an online auction for eight bucks
those eight dollars provided me with six weeks of constant gameplaying
most action games can be completed in less than a week but bg was vast and involving
the world is huge and sprawling side quests are seemingly infinite and replay value is a bonusso why four stars
well like many people i have my subjective nitpicky problems
first the pathfinding is pretty weak
its mostly okay when youre out in the open but in dungeons the pathfinding is flatout horrible
i barely escaped the firewine dungeon alive because whenever id get into a battle and order my commands my party members would then stupidly go off in six separate and unexpected directions
second although the world is huge it does get tedious trudging across the bg map
at times the game can feel like a chore to explore that unnamed wilderness section thats located leagues away from where you truly need to go only because well you feel there might be something interesting there
third going up levels takes a long time
dont get me wrong i realize that going up levels shouldnt be too easy to accomplish but its kind of disheartening to only be a level seven fighter at the end of the game because theres an experience point cap of  with thirtyodd hit points
either raise the cap or make level limits a bit lower
lastly although hardcore gamers may love the myriad spells weapons and potions i felt there were too many
your party members dont have many slots for carrying items and all those items you find during your travels potions in particular become annoying should i use suchandsuch potion immediately
should i save it for a big battle
should i sell it and make money
should i simply leave it behindstill despite the quirks ive never been so deeply involved in a pc game and im looking forward to my next purchases icewind dale and bgiialready has all the elements that will make bg series such an absolute game
to play preferably using bg  engine or wait for the bg enhanced edition
pure role playing
try it if you esp if you like the genrewhen i first picked it up i thought it would end up just being another throw awayi was wrong 
fun game your actions change the story an how others will interact with you
download a few quotadd on quot utilities for this an you will become a godloli would have given this a  but they need to change up that ending a bitkinda goes to fastwelli must say that this game is just that its not the best game ever but it is really fun and youll play it a lot supposing you like dampdadampd or rpgs
that being said allow me to get to the nitpicky stuffone major gripe with this game that i have is teh experience system
it divides up the experience rather then give each party member an exact copy of the amount recieved
another problem is the amount of quotcosmeticquot strikes and how you miss a lot
i guess that is for quotrealismquot but it just annoys me
also sometimes the game is really nonlinear so you have to get a guide or talk to everyone in a place to see where you need to goother than that this game is really good and will keep you playing it forever
the story is really good and the rest of the game is good i will not spill details although most of you have already gotten the game and beaten it
well i must go hope you enjoyed the reviewthis game is loooong
i really enjoy long games but this a bit much for me
of course if i could play more than two or three hours a week things i didnt like not escaping though cutscenes not automatically reloading the last quicksave and less reputation comments from your npcs  highly recommended and a must have for any rpg fanthis game is very different from any other play station game
but that doesnt mean it is dumb
when i first played it it was hard
but when you really get into it
you will be stuck on that game
its very addicting
i recommend this game to anyone who likes a great adventuremuch like halo i never really had a divine interest in tony hawk games aside from maybe one or two from the franchise
this game is still lots of fun to play even since its release nearly a decade ago
doing ludicrous and impossible stunts is still a lot of fun
there are still plenty of characters to play as and there is still a ton of stuff to unlock that still makes this game worthwhile and it still has its endless replay value
im still unclear as to whether i want to buy a modern skateboarding game like tony hawk or perhaps rival skater skate
whatever i decide this game is still a top notch title to play even though there are control and camera issues during gameplaythis game is good
it has the basic features and moves and levels
its fun to play as you try and advance your man through his career
also it becomes very addictive
however tony hawk pro skater  is out and has some incredible upgrades with new levels people and career options
i would recommend buying the newer version of this game but dont get me wrong this one is good tootony hawk pro skater is a top of the line game top of the line game because of its control gameplay music and overall fun
there are a dozen popular skaters to chose from each with their own tricks and talents
each skater has about ten original official and detailed skateboard which you may customize the look of
the point of the game is you can either practice to learn the tricks or you can take on seven skateboard courses three skate parks
every course is extremely detailed and has five challenges for you to accomplish
you will have to go back through some courses to get all of the challenges so you will not breeze through the game in a day
the down side is that there is no customizable skate park or skate boarder
you can begin this game and have fun and you can be a master at this game and still have fun
if you are concerned with the message there are no helmets or pads in this gamei had this game when i was younger and i should have kept it cause as i have gotten older it is a lot of fun to go back and play the things that i did when i was younger and this is one of the things my friends and i always tried to show each other up onthis game is one of the best out there as far as graphics are concerned
with real voices and great graphics gameplay is one of the best of its kind
i would suggest this to anyone who has a d graphics card it will definitely make the experience a lot betteryou shoot aliens you ride around you blow up things you ride around more you go too different planets and you ride around even more i noticed a previous reviewer said you really need a fast system to play bz
well i am playing on a mhz pent  megs ram voodoo  and with a kbs internet connection speed and it is smooth as silk with every  feature turned up and using x res
he must have alot of stuff running  in the background
well enough of that
the single player game has great  graphics and good strategy gameplay
i find the storyline a bit weak  though
the multiplayer portion needs some work
ping times are extremely  high and it is hard to get into a lowsub  ping room
they really need  to fix that portion
while i am not quite as impressed as with the first  bz is still a good game to keep you glued to your monitor for hoursway back in  long before the days of grand theft auto kingpin assumed the mantle of the most controversial game out there raising the ire of censortriggerhappy pantywaists everywhere with its combination of graphic violence and even more graphic language
kingpin is basically the andrew dice clay of computer games lacing every line of character dialogue with profanity
news flash to all the haters there innercity thugs on the make tend to use strong language
its called realism people
do we really want to hear mafia dons saying things like i say old chap whatever are you doing with that gun in your hand
or dear me i do believe i shall have to exact a modicum of revenge on that brash young man who helped himself to some of my cash holdings
uh no
that would not be a good thing
and its not as if the makers of the game xatrix entertainment and interplay were sneaking this game into santas bag for little johnny
its got a great big red sticker on the front that says parental advisory contains graphic language and violence
kids could never buy this game on their own
going even further the makers included the option of installing the game without all of the explicit languagewhat about the game itself
well its a darn good firstperson shooter built on the quake  engine
it does require a d graphics accelerator but that pretty much comes standard with any decent pc built in the last several years
in terms of player control and perspective it is quite similar to that of quake  which should be second nature to virtually every gamer out there
yes youll see more than a fair share of warehouse settings but youre looking at  individual levels in singleplayer mode each of which is quite atmospheric in a film nourish kind of way
i do have to turn my brightness up to about  in order to see everything in the darker environments but youre really looking at a fairly elaborate arena to exercise your thirst for virtual blood here
as for the violence much of the shock value has disappeared since the game was released but its always cool to blow some schmucks head clean off  and you have a decent variety of weapons with which to wreak your havoc pistol shotgun tommy gun grenade launcher flamethrower etc
 all of your typical weaponsas you start the game youre basically a worthless thug with a chip on your shoulder having just been beaten up by some of the kingpins henchmen
naturally you vow revenge on the bloke who made the mistake of leaving you alive and able to come after him
it takes time patience some puzzlesolving ability and a lot of ammunition to work your way up to his high rise building and leave him laying in a pool of his own blood but you dont mind because you get to do tons of damage along the way
it isnt all about killing people though as some of the npcs can provide you with helpful information and others will back you up if you have the cash to buy their brawn and bullets
being the thug that you are you have a pretty limited vocabulary but you do at least get to choose between friendly and decidedly unfriendly approaches to each character you talk to
now if youre like me you always want to shoot first and ask questions later so it can be hard to temporarily holster your weapon  but theres no rule that says you cant ice your informants after theyve told you what you want to knowi never tried the online multiplayer component of kingpin so i cant tell you anything about that
one thing i can tell you though is that this game installs and plays flawlessly on windows xp unlike most games released in   having just played the entire game again recently i think i actually had more fun with it now than i did when it was first releasedkingpin life of crime is a dark fps with a great gameplay set in the real bad world
you play a unnamed guy just called thug
the game opens with thug badly beaten up and left in an ally by nicks men nick works for the kingpin thug vows to get revenge but he does not have anything besides a small pipe so he has to kill people for money he kills people takes their money and weapons buys more weapons hires goons rides on a stolen bike jumps into a moving train finally he takes on the kingpin kills him and he becomes the kingpin
the single player gameplay is a different and great experience no boss levels all the villans are humans but their weapons and toughness changes
besides shooting the baddies you have to talk and get advise from people in night clubs visit the pawn o matic hire goons ect
the level design is fantastic from a dark ally a steel mill railroad bad streets ect
they are very fun and very enjoyable to get through
the level are huge and are in hub layout
the weapons are good there is a pistol shotgun tommygun grenade launcher bazzoka and a flame thrower
the flame thrower looks as good as it is in rtcw this same company did rtcwkingpin is built on the heavily modified quake engine
i play it on the default opengl video mode and the game runs very smooth
the graphics are fantastic look great even today
the charecter animation is good but thier flesh moves as if they do not have any skeleton
sound is very good weapon sounds and the music is great
the voice acting is averange and almost all the male charecters sound the same
the art direction for each levels is superb artists who did it should get an award for their contribution kingpin has the best art direction in a computer game even today
wow
fantastic environments look real and the atmosphere is superb
kingpin is a very violent game you could see arms and limbs comming off baddies injured and running away will leave a trail of blood
the level of violace and langauge make games like sof look like a kids game you can reduce them by installing the pg version
there are lots of bad words you will hear the fword hundred times in the first level itself
the ai is quite good villans react well in situation
kingpin is a very good game if you do not mind games with heavy violance and bad words then you will surely like it
it is one of the realistic and coolest fps i have ever playedi purchased this game when it came out new then again as something to pass around on deployment
the multiplayer is awesome with some great support sites to download new content from
tthe singleplayer mission is also fun even though the graphics are clearly dated
on the plus side there will be very few computers that cannot play this
i play this on my asus netbook but not sure if some of the older netbooks will be able to handle thiswarcraft  is a legendary game made by blizzard a big gaming company as of now
the game when it came out had everything and was a start of a brand new kind of game play
now with this edition though you can play on  the internet which was something many people wanted for some time
the  races of  arnt nearly as strategic as starcraft its following great  achiever due to the facts that the orcs and humans in the game play are  almost identical
the only real difference is the spells and the way the  units lookthere is  reasons that i think you should buy this over  starcraft one is that it has two great previews of the upcoming game  warcraft  and the game diablo   the other reason is that not everyone  can afford computers that are incredibly fast
so if you can not play  starcraft very quickly and it goes slow on bnet for you then warcraft is  something you must buy because it will work much more effectivelyprospriced right at just  for jewel casestill very popular with hundreds of potential opponents onlinebalanced weaponry no one unit or structure ruleshuge variety of maps and missionseasy to use map editoradditional games online such as capture the flaggame rarely lags or runs choppy even with v and v gamesdoesnt require much computer or a top video cardeverything is on just one discconscartoonish graphics are a bit datedgameplay while easy to learn can be tiring and out datedover all warcraft  is still a great game and loads of fun
i had known about this game for a long time and finally decided to pick up the  version which also provides you with a strategy guide
an exellent value
i heartily recommend this game because you know what youre getting
the concept is ok with the humans v the orcs but almost all my time with this game is one on one multiplayer
you dont have to go to battlenetcom you can also play a buddy modem to modem
how you begin the game depends on the map but usually you start with one peon or builder and a certain amount of resources
you will always need a certain number of farms to feed your people as well as a steady supply of gold and wood
wood is everywhere but there are a limited number of gold mines and it is around these that you will build your camps
most of your military will come from a barricks and you make more peons from a town hall
youll need a blacksmith and lumber mill to upgrade your troopsswordsmanarcherscatapults ect
and from that point you can add specialty forces such as gnomes mages and flying birds that crap explosive eggs
note that im referring to the human race because i play that all the time
the orcs are very different and frankly quite weird
one of their units for example is a huge beast with two heads that only uses its fists as a weapon
both races can make a cool spy plane and a fairly complete navy as well as towers that can be upgraded to shoot cannons or arrows
oil is another resource thats needed to make some more advanced units
a lot of strategy is required because maps are very crowded with many narrow passage ways
some maps even start you off completely surrounded by trees so you cant go anywhere untill you cut down a path
i like those maps because it prevents quick attacksgame play is fairly easy to learn
you just click on a building and the unit you want to build
its easy to order your units to fight or where to go but you can only control  units at a time
the biggest negative about this game is that you cant queue up your barricks to produce more than one unit at a time
this can make the game a bit too busy and tiring and requires you to have several barricks
for example to maintain a steady source of resources you may need two main camps and one smaller one surrounding gold mines
that means probably at least  barricks three town halls as well as at least one gnomish inventor and aviary and a navy or two
considering you will have at least a couple dozen peons gathering resources and building farms it becomes a contest of who can point and click the fastest as you constantly move from building to building while trying to control your military units
a lot of work
too bad blizzard hasnt added the multi queing feature which exists in age of empires gold and just about any newer game
maybe there is a mod that can be downloaded to ad this feature but it is not available here
for that reason i only give the game  but it still makes for plenty of good clean fun for very little moneysocksrailroad tycoon ii is the  sequel to the  classic sid meiers railroad tycoon
even though sids name has jumped ship this is a solid sequel to a great game
the premise is simple enough build a railroad buy some trains ship stuff from where it is to where its needed
get richfrom humble concepts mighty games are grown and enriching this basic idea are things like train quality which forces you to choose between cost fast good on slopes or reliable keeping demand high by supplying only small amounts versus the cost of connecting other places where demand is high short routes with small payloads and fast turnarounds versus long routes with big payloads buying and selling stocks to take advantage of economic trends buying the businesses whose materials youre transporting defending against train robbers or hiring shady characters and exploiting legal loopholes and so onbasically this premise works and supplies hours of good addictive fun
theres a lot of replay value as well since you can take a different approach to each game
the graphics are still even in  pleasant and communicative and the sound is mostly good
the scenarios are pretty challenging without for the most part being crushingly hard and the three levels of victories encourages replay as you try to go for the goldthe are a number of hitches unfortunately
the manual and tutorial are really inadequatewhich tends to sting given that most of the fansupplied data on the web is gone
the supplyanddemand process is actually somewhat opaque
i did figure it out but it took me a while and some research on the net
your board of directors is very gullible not able to look ahead even a month this makes them easy to manipulate
the stock market stuff makes it easy to lose with a thriving railroad and doesnt add much to the game that ive experiencedfurther trains really only go from point a to point b that is say you have cattle yard b that needs grain and two grain farms a and a that supply grain you cant set up a train to pick up grain at a travel to a to pick up more grain and then travel to b to drop it off
when the train stops its completely unloaded
this is never spelled out anywhere and certain ways of setting up a trains route suggest otherwise
but in the above situation your train will actually unload grain at a grain farm for no money rather than haul it another ten miles to the cattle yard where its actually neededthe scale of the game is such that each train moves about thth of its actual speed
in other words a trip that should take a week takes a year
this is probably a necessary abstractiontrainmodel fans will want to keep in mind that this game has nothing to do with their hobby but it has the effect of exaggerating every mistake or mishap
jesse james didnt just rob a single train he robbed your entire route for the yearall of this detracts a bit but its a testament to the strength of the concept and execution that this would still be a fivestar game even with these issues
the killerthe thing that made me subtract a staris the tracklaying interface
its really easy to lay track you didnt mean to
theres no undo
it actually costs you to remove it
the way the ui figures out the smoothest route is dubious and theres really no decent handling for the fact that finding the smoothest track is best done at the closest zoom while finding the shortest route is best done at the furthest zoomcoupled with some bugs that make stations seem disconnected you can end up in a situation where you lose a game because the tracklaying interface was not up to the task
and thats the only real sour lemon in this package
again though even with this theres still a lot of funitll definitely whet your apetite for railroad tycoon i just got the game a few days ago included in a value pack
i am currently playing the campaigns and so far i am enjoying the game
even my husband is playing itpros sim type gamedifferent type of trains and several campaigns which i loveis challenging for an average game player dont know about hardcore playerscons the game tutorial was okay but wish i could find a way to start back at the beginning of it
when my husband wanted to play i had to tell him how to do it instead of him doing the tutorial because it wouldnt start back at the beginningother than that i dont know of any other cons since i have just started playing and havent started the sceneriosyou do get tired of laying down tracks all the time and have to zoom in and outso far i am really enjoying itpros this game is exactly like being in the middle of a star trek episode
you play a star fleet cadet whos father was killed during the borg encounter at wolf  you are offered the chance to go back in time shortly before the battle to see if you can change history
as soon as you accept the challenge you are transported to the bridge of a starship as the crew prepares to engage the borg
you have the uncanny poignant experience of watching the father you scarcely knew as he interacts with his shipmates tries to save his friends and bravely prepares for a battle he is doomed to lose
i havent played many full motion video fmv games but i thought this one was very well done
the acting is as good as that on any star trek episode the borg are horrifying and menacing and q is in magnificent form as usual
it was great fun to have q chastise and insult you in the same sarcastic way he uses with picard or janeway
the puzzles are wellintegrated into the story and allow you to use some of the equipment and consoles that youve always wanted to try
i did not consider the bulk of the puzzles to be particularly difficult although they do require some outofthebox thinking
there are lots of alternate endings in this game most of them start with your demise after which there is a commentary from q as to the efficacy of your effortscons the game plays a lot like a movie with certain decision points at which you choose how to act these moments are clearly signaled in the game
there were enough of these to make it feel pretty interactive but not nearly so many as in a traditional graphic adventure
when a decision point occurs the game will not respond if you click too quickly
in order for your decision to register you must hold the mouse down firmly for a second or two
i would have liked the game to be a little longer though in the ongoing tension between length and quality ill take quality any day
actually i would have liked the game to be a lot longer
truthfully i would have liked the game never to endbottom line a musthave for any trekker or anyone who enjoys fmv adventuresi bought one of these back when the n was still a modern console and i just bought another one on amazon
obviously i think this product is pretty adequate since i bought two of them
but heres some additional detailpros the bundle comes with both a rumble pak and a controller pak or memory card
how cool is that
if youre buying stuff off of amazon it saves you about four dollars in shipping fees
whats better is how cheap the tremor pak plus is now
if you snoop around you can get this bundle new for the price youd pay for a either individual product by itselfas for the actual rumbling it works pretty awesomely
ive tried it out on perfect dark and madden  so far
its got high and low settings
true n players use high for maximum vibration
the memory card is the same size as the controller pak nintendo originally made
alas it is not bundled with some of the larger memory cards that interact produced
but most games will easily fit onto the page cardcons the tremor pak plus is both larger and heavier than the rumble pak produced by nintendo not to mention the original tremor pak produced by interact
this is because it has an additional slot to stick a memory card into the tremor pak
presumably interact thought people would like it since it allowed them to use a controller pak and a rumble pak at the same time
nice thought on their part but the original tremor pak is as a consequence much sleeker and even more desirable than this improved versionin summation i sort of wish interact had just given us a bundle with the original tremor pak and a page memory card as opposed to this bulky contraption with a slot
even so id totally recommend this bundle to anyone whose interested in the gracefully aged console that is the nthis thing is really bulky and if you play a lot of n itll eat your batteries up too
it gets the job done and has a strong rumble and you still need to buy a memory card
fast shipping ai order this a few days ago and it came no longer than three
the memory card is what i mainly wanted and the rumble pak
ill just let anyone who plays as the fourth player can use it because i had three rumble paks for my other controllers before this order but no memory card yet
when i order this it said like new and guess what
it actually came brand new sealed in the hard plastic that normally takes scissors to cut
i like this seller because they mean what they say
i also ordered this in the used section which is also weird i still got it new but im sure you know that
like most people said the rumble pak is kinda more heavier but im not even going to use it anyway because again i already have a rumble pak for my other controllers
the only thing i really hate about the rumble is that all rumble paks i own take triple aaa batteries
the problem with that is batteries run out
i do have some advice for some people purchasing this
if you want a rumble pak try to find rechargable triple aaa batteries if you can
by the way the memory card can also be used alone without the rumble pak
it should of been powered in the controller though
i guess thats old school for youworks just fine
so far i havent had any issues with the product
most likely ill be buying two more to complete my setthis game fetches for hundreds of dollars nowadays but with that said this is a pretty good game
you have a plot that interconnects with  different characters that can be recruited at their perspective times but unless you are a completionist you will be extremely disappointed in the ending you will get
now whether or not you want to spend  on this is entirely up to you
i spent it and i felt i somewhat got my moneys worth but at the same time a little disappointed that i spent this much on a game but oh well there is worse like  for panzer dragoon saga
anyways just like with any other suikoden entry you can go to war with the kingdom whom the main character is opposing with and use all kinds of tactics in battle that will determine your fate
the story is pretty solid and the character development is also quite solid as well and you have a lot of lush beautiful environments to traverse through with a world map
overall this game is good but be prepared to drop a fraction of your wallet if you want thisthis was not a cheap game but its rare so i was expecting that
i wish it had the case but im sure that was part of the reason it was so cheap
either way the game is in great conditionthose out there who decide to play a game based solely on the hype it creates no doubt know how cool the final fantasies and the lunar series are
but if you skipped over this one just because it did not create the final fantasy type of hype prior to its release you missed something specialwhen i picked up suikoden it was a slow night and just about everything else i wanted to rent was out
when i first played it i was slightly ambivolent in my decision as to whether or not it was a cool game
the opening intro with its soulful choir gripping and excellently composed music and great still pics of the games scenes and cast blows away almost every tune in the final fantasy audio library
heck andrew loyed webber or john williams would be hard pressed to do better
but upon entering the game things seemed to be only average
though the story was good and the dialouge was well written and there were powerful and very funny scenes early on it lacked final fantasys epic atmosphere
also the opening is the games audio highlight
dont expect it to get any better then that
but what suikoden ii lacks in atmosphere it makes up for in substance
the charachters are written in such a way that even the most fantastic and unreal scenarios seem believable
from luca blights savagery and cruelty to shus strategic brilliance to jowrys desparate measures that he takes to protect those he loves every moment is very believable and realalso helping the game is the number of secrets and sidequests that there are
its here that suikoden shines there are limitless quests charachters minigames and hidden items for you to find and do
giving the game unrivaled depththis game is a heavy hitter
theres no doubt about that but i liked the final fantasies better
they just have a way of grabbing you by the heart strings that suikoden rarely achives
its still one of the most awesome rpgs out there and i do reccommend it to anyone whos already completed chrono cross or final fantasy ix
with a little more tweaking suikoden iii will be able to hang with those big rpg bad boyzfans of the series will tell you its worth the money its going for but i think if you missed suikoden ii you missed it
suikoden  is better afterall
even the reviewers will tell you
im not saying this is a bad game it was actualy a very good one but its not worth shelling out  dollars fori absolutely fell in love with this game when i first played
the story can get a little confusing at times but thats no reason not to get this game
this game uses stealth which really makes it fun for a number of reasons
the graphics in this game are a little cliche but then again it came out in  and its for ps come on
only problem its way too short
if there would have been say another  or  hours added to the game i would have given this game a  but due to its lack of lenght i give it a out of this was a decent game
probably one of the first of its kind so that gets it major points
its a little on the short side  hours total if you watch all the cinematics and take your time and the difficulty takes dramatic leaps and falls throughout the game making adaptation difficult
the graphics are absolutely horrible but maybe im just spoiled by my ps
the voice quality isnt bad for a game as old as this one and the moves and strategy you can use are all immensely helpful as opposed to some games that give you neat moves that have absolutely no application in the game
very originalthis game was way ahead of its timethis is probably one of the best playstation one games there is
this has the best storyline of all again the characters are coolthe music is okay and the action kind of blows
what i mean is that unlike mgs you cant switch to firstperson mode and use your gun and revolver ocelot is kind of lame to fight  chasing someone in circles is not my idea of an exciting gunfight
and you cant zoom in or out when using the sniper rifle also cant use it while standing
still it is a good game but the sequel is better
not a bad gamebut could have been improvedi bought this game for a friend of mine for christmas
he really likes it and thats all i wantedmetal gear solid  circa good considered a classic ps game to many voiceovers and sound track are pretty good birthed modern day stealth gameplaybad graphics are pretty dated game play might feel a little dated the dialog can drag on a little bitif it fits your taste stealth gameplay with some action mixed in mature and complex story multiple endings and even a few bonuses to unlockgame its most assocated too tenchu siphon filter metal gear solid vr missionsadditional notes there was a remake of this game for nintendos gamecube called metal gear solid the twin snakes metal gear solid is not the first but the third metal gear game in the metal gear franchise previously there was metal gear and metal gear snakes revenge on the nes the game metal gear solid vr missions was a spin off from metal gear solids training vr missions there is also a version of this game for pcthis game invented stealth to the gaming industry
plus it porved that you could be a badass in a video game
unfortuantly no one who has played mgs is gonna go play mgs
and thats a shame because mgs almost beats the nd one
better gameplay
yes theres a lot more action stealth is more important and theres more gameplay than movie
the storys pretty normal until the end
it seems like a regular terroist movie turned into a game
however there are some bad things compared to the nd one
bad graphics cant shoot in first person mode and you dont have a tranquilizer
oh well this is playstation  they improved on mgs but only a littleafter eight years without a new metal gear game this franchise got its third entry with metal gear solid
the graphics have not aged well at all
textures are very pixellated animation is very jerky and the framerate can get rather slow at times
the audio however has lots of great dialogue combined with a catchy musical scorethe gameplay is based around stealth
you are solid snake a spy working for a secret agency whose objective is to stop a device called metal gear and save a couple of old guys
the story is deeper than that of course but in a nutshell thats it
the controls while laid out well can be very unresponsive at times
the game itself is very fun sneaking around to either get past or silently eliminate enemies but is very easy to complete and take away all of the cinematics and dialogue  hours of it all
 and youve got just three hours of gameplaymetal gear solid hasnt aged well at all but is still very fun and happens to be a nice collectors piece for fans of the series
but should you start here
no grab a gamecube and metal gear solid the twin snakes a nextgen remake of this instead then grab metal gear solid  substance on the ps or the xboxgame arrived quickly and works wellbeing new to console gaming i really did not know what i was missingthe game is very challenging and is right on timei remember spending hours playing this game when i was younger however some of that fun has worn off because of better options that have come out over the years
still its always fun to bash an opponent or a friend off their motorcycle with a bat a chain whip taser or whatever you have at your disposal
its still fun to jump over cars by popping a wheelie or to watch someone hit a car or another object causing themselves to crash or to hit innocent bystanders
the motorcycles are still cool looking along with the characters but the character models are recycled along with your environments
the graphics look bland and too blocky by todays standards as well
but it never really gets old to hop on your motorcycle and bash an opponent off their motorcyclewwe wm  is a great game with tons of matcheswhen i first got this it was around the time it first came outman this game is awesome
they steel cage match hardcore match and i cant remember but i think they had first bloodi thinki dont rememberthe graphics were good for its time
gameplay was quick which is a good thing
it is also the first n game to have blood in a wwe gamemy favorite match is the steel cage
its sooo fun but i wish they had a hell in the cell matchgameplay matches graphicsfor its time out of laterquite the little breakthrough when this game came out although on the surface one would not really know whyyes the graphics are especially nice for the time the tone is decidedly dark and the plot is  unusual but what players became facinated by was the development of the story and how it related to your gameplaymore game makers should take the cues that psychology plays in this game as it offers an entirely new less restrictive playground for the seasoned player to venture off intothe premise for the story is that a man is in a major car accident and wakes up in a sanitarium without any memory of who he is or his past
throughout the game the character learns more about his past
the plot is very engrossing
the levels are bizarre and creepy
there are some very disturbing and gross parts but they arent inappropriate to the game or storythe puzzles are easy
i only had to look at the walkthrough once and that is rare for me
as the other reviewer mentioned make sure you are standing very close to an object before interacting with it or the character will refuse to do iti did run into two bugs that produced unwinnable conditions
luckily i made multiple saves and reverted to a previous savei guess something that really struck me was the melancholy feeling in chapter   its been a long time since i cried so much over a movie
i dont know if ive ever cried that much over a video game
it was a very powerful and moving emotional themethe good creepy atmosphere great voice acting enticing characters engaging storythe bad tons of technical problems puzzles get way too hard its not clear what to always doadventure strategy and rpgs were the pinnacle of pc games back in the mid to late s and sanitarium is one of those games
you play as max who suffers a car accident and is stuck in his own insane delusions or is he
you explore  sick and twisted chapters with excellent voice acting and very interesting characters but dont forget those adventure puzzlesthe game isnt much different from the standard adventure game where you wonder around and click on items to proceed to the next area
your icon is a magnifying glass and you hold down the right mouse button to move your character around
this was my first annoyance with the game being that the characters walk so slowly and theres no run button
despite this clicking on things is actually interesting because most of it doesnt even pertain to the real world
your first area is an asylum where guys are bashing their heads against walls and the people you talk to are completely out of their minds
this gets even worse as the game progresses but thats a good thingas you collect items you find ways to use them in interesting ways and it actually make sense
however most of the times the way to use them is so obvious that you will miss it
this game isnt exactly easy and just gets harder as the game progresses
you get thrown a couple of puzzles at the beginning but towards the end the game gets very puzzle heavy and they are not fun or easy
sure they are unique to the individual worlds but they arent easy
i had to use a walkthrough through most of the game because i just couldnt get what to do most of the timemy favorite part about the game was wandering around and talking to people and hearing their strange voices or weird stories
the world themselves are characters because each one has a big problem to solve but thankfully each level is small and its not easy to get lost in
the game is paced well with some cgi cut scenes of course they look horrible being from  but its nice that this game feels high budget for its time
i always looked forward to the next zany world and what weird character i would run into
i never got bored and always wanted more
the game is nicely paced at around  hours and it had a satisfying ending
the one surprise i had however were the couple of boss fights
most adventure games dont have these but these were strangeoverall sanitarium is an excellent adventure game that shows how great the s were on the pc
you can pick the game up on gogcom for only  but i did run into one huge problem
the game crashes a lot on newer operating system and gog never addressed the issue
if you can get the cd and use on an older operating system like windows  but otherwise you will have to trudge through the constant crashessanitarium opens with a movie  a man on his way home from work calls his wife with the news that he has quotthe answerquot  next thing you know his car flies off the road
he wakes up in an institution his face swathed in bandages with no idea who he is where he is or how he got there
of course this is exactly what he  and you as the player  must now find outsanitarium is a really great oldstyle rd person adventure game that combines an intriguing story with interesting puzzles a spooky atmosphere and pretty decent graphics for its time
in its nine levels you visit various parts of the asylum a huge insect hive a scary circus and other places all steeped in the main characters personal mythology
each level not only has its own internal continuity but is connected to the larger story by threads of symbol and dream logic
i found this fascinating and extremely well done
it was one of the things that kept me wanting to play even when it was late at night and my eyes couldnt focus any moresomething i havent experienced with a game in a whilethe puzzles are a pretty good variety  some inventory some conversation some mechanical
most are pretty easy once you find what youre looking for but there are a couple of frustrating pixel hunts where its possible to miss the one thing you need to move on
also sometimes the inventory which flashes when it can be used has to be positioned in exactly the right place
there are also a few action sequences and you can die
usually i really object to this in adventure games but sanitarium handles the action the way it should be handled  the sequences are pretty straightforward if you die you get to start again at the beginning of the sequence without going through a tedious quotyou failedquot ending sequence or reloading from page one you have infinite lives and the pieces of the puzzle you have managed to solve stay solved so you dont have to repeat what youve already done over and over
take a tip from this game designersnavigation is a little awkward to start  you interact using the left mouse button and move using the right  but you get used to that quickly enough
the main problem is that the character can get sucked into things like stairs so you spend a lot of time going back and forth or i did anyway
another problem is that sometimes you have to have your character in exactly the right spot before hell do what hes supposed to
if hes not close enough hell say quoti cant do that or some variation thereofquot  except for sometimes when hell walk over and complete the action on his own
i found no rhyme or reason to this and it got a bit annoying in placesthe graphics are midnineties graphics  rd person d  so if you cant appreciate a game that doesnt have all the latest bells and whistles you wont appreciate this one
there are some really gruesome scenes not for the faint of heart or stomach
the voice acting is mostly pretty good but in some places character voices were hard to understand
there are subtitles though so that wasnt a problem
other sound fx were welldone being suited to the various environments yet not too repetetive or demanding of attentioni completed sanitarium in about  hours
if i had a complaint it was that the ending was a little rushed and i felt that all the gaps in the story hadnt been filled in
still compared to the bulk of games that are being released today this is a great find and a worthwhile buy
if you like older adventures sanitarium is a mustthis game is awesome
i remember getting this game and being extremely excited because it was rugrats
this really is a great rugrats game the best that has came out
in this game you can play golf and even walk around tommys entire house and backyard
this is a great game that is a lot like the show
rugrats in paris the movie for teh n has got nothing on this game
buy this for anyone that is a fan of the showthis game brought back a lot of fun memories that i had as a kid
the only thing i can say is that you will have a hard time playing this if you do not have a playstation controller with an analog stick
the controls are extremely difficult
im not sure if im just used to the modern age stuff or if the controls are supposed to be like that
anyway good lucki ordered this game a few months ago and my son beat this game in one hour
this is not the game for you if you are over the age of   the game would just be too easy
if you have a son or daughter under  years they might like itthe game is about when tommy loses his puzzle pieces so with the help of his friends he has to go get them back
this game has  missions that ranges from getting a cereal box in a store to getting your grandpas teeth from a goose
they are really funny especially in grandpas teeth when chuckies yells hellllllllllllllllp
in a texan accentthese games graphics are good for its timethe sound is very great and very bad at the same timeoverall this game is real good and i recommend it to anyone who has little kids who like rugratsi was feeling nostalgic so i bought this game along with a few others to relive my childhood
its as much fun as i remember
a bit repetitive as there are only a few levels and most are quick but its definitely entertaining the whole time
totally worth the buyi was a little disappointed with this game after playing both it ans civilization call to power
ctp had a crisper feel to it and went further into the future
still i enjoyed it overallone of the best things about the wheel of time book series is the very well designed magick system
however i can see how such a system can create a problem for computer game developers
the magick system in wheel of time is very loose it is not based on having so and so number of spells but rather a person have so and so much magickal potential and they can do whatever they want with it
i think the solution they have used in this game is a good one instead of mangling the wheel of time magick system which a certain rpg game have done to make it manageable they have avoided the whole issue the main character can only channel a trickle but she uses terangreals magickal artifacts with great proficiency
they might be boring to those who was hoping to see the very free and lose wot magick system in full display on their computer screen but i think it is a good solution as long as technology have not gotten far enough to let a game support such a powerful and loose systemthe story of the game is quite good it mixes in well with the setting and do give the wheel of time feeling the characters are well done though some may complain that here and there the story do not fit cannon these little slip ups are small enough to not detract from the fun of the gamethis game is a one person shooter with unusual amounts of story for such a game but there are many and varied game areas the enemies are nice there should be enough here to entertain a shooter fan to who have no interest in wheel of time but i do say that the game probably will be most entertaining for someone who like the wheel of time settingmy one complaint about the game is that it is to hard
i am sure experienced gamers will swoosh through it but this game to caters also to fantasy fans which might be just casual gamers or not gamers at all they just want to get the story of this wot product
there should be an easy modus which is actually easy enough that casual gamers do not need to use cheats
however there are enough cheats out there to this game that anyone will make it through the game if they really want toall in all i think this is a very good game which do a good job of recreating the feel of its parent setting
the story is wonderful the graphics was good for its time it is definitely worth getting if you like wheel of time or first person shootersas of now this game has been out about  years
this will lead a lot of people to believe it feels dated
not the case
it  more so feels like a classic
the atmosphere is very fitting of the layout of the book s
very intense fighting with a proper soundtrack flowing in the background
nice particle effects for an early  game
overall the atmosphere overtakes the graphics and music
that is what makes this timeless
you feel exactly what the author wanted you to feel immersed in his world
very long program with incredible cutscenes
if you are not a fan of cutscenes do not get this
this baby is chockfull of very well craftedand acted cutscenes that add even more reasonance to the world you will never want to leave
i had no trouble getting this to swap from my old windows  system to my new windows xp system
thats a huge plus
i still have the honor of playing one of the top  pc games ever made
in my opinion
and no myst is not on my listwhy is everyone upset with this game
im not sure but im not one of them
i guess everyone expected alot more than the original total annihilation and what they got was something designed a little better
maybe a little too pretty
here is what the game has going for it
excellent detail to the each unit building and the surrounding terrain
a good story
units with special attack features and some of these are really cool
the gameplay is pretty good also
the online gaming at boneyards
this is where the game really excels and is probably more competitive
what couldve been better
the soundtrack wasnt very good
there was too much quietness when playing
and in some of the battles the only way in was a narrow passage where only  units could stand side by side
the computer would just pack this passage way and it would take forever to get in it took me over  hours on  such battles towards the end of the game
i would probably rate this closer to   stars but i did enjoy this game
lots of different characters and some pretty good battlesi see alot of people on here griping and nitpicking about what this game has and doesnt have
is it something groundbreaking
nah  is it something that hasnt been done before
nah is it still a pretty darn nifty game
you betcha
its a rts period and all rts games seem to suffer universally from similar ailments
these being certain tactics units et al that are very powerful yada yada just play it
i happen to think the graphics are pretty darn nice myself and the elevation changes are quite good as well
four sides to choose from gives a nice variety of units and such
not alot to be said some things could have been done better but its a cool game
i think however that the quotsuper unitsquot could be all together bypassed if cavedog and other designers blizzard for instance would adopt the tech level variable a la command amp conquer for multiplay games
sometime i wana just batten down and have an allout slug fest with the basic grunt units in the game
all the upperlevel stuff is cool but it really does detract from the fun of the games because theres no strategy involved in dropping a nukemagic death spellwhatever on your opponent
anyhow i ramble hehehe did i mention this is a good game and you should buy itthis was a curiosity purchase that sat for awhile
i finally fired it up on an xp machine
do get the upgrade if you can find itthere are  scenerios in the self play
the ai is ok  if you are a defensive player you will like this gamethe scenerios range from what feels like a demo of new features
for example when the cannons first appear you get one scenerio defending a pass
i didnt ahve to do anything as the cannon fire wiped out that attackers that kept charging into the gunsthe hardest scenero for me was vengence
you are warned to set up before detecting and it is true
i got noticed and was swarmed
i built of up defenses in order to build the army
unfortunatly the ai dug in rather well and it took a constant barrage of air armadas of dragons and fairies to defeat the well placed towers
each tower was coverd by the othersthe gui can get annoying as if you dont pay attention and click you will send units or builders in a direction you didnt intendthe gold dragon was a fun introduction
though i will admit it made the fighting easierthe story line is good
however you will switch between sides during the play
it gets a little strange at times as you invade and set up a base
then the next scenerio you play the otherside and are supposed to destroy the baseoverall its not a bad game
especially at current pricesi am going ot look for the addonthis game was a lot like warcraft ii
interesting story and pretty fun to play
much like any of the rts you build structures create units and try to wipe your enemy out any way you can
this game is certainly worth the  bucks amazon charges and while you are at it pick up the iron plague expansionalthough i felt it wasnt extremely compelling each mission had a voiced briefing that indicated the changing situation even if it wasnt necessarily clear that this was a shifting galacticscale conflict
the fact that the only battlefield not held firmly by the enemy is where you are coming from is part of the issue but it was enough to make sense of the twosided galactic war with generous suspense of disbeliefstory total annihilation was not a surpassingly impressive game in its heyday and now it shows its age
however it can be played relatively easily on most machines and you can still find plenty of mods that upscale units besides adding more raising unit limits etc
the interface is gritty but mostly straightforward and an ingame list of all keyboard shortcuts as well as the ability to modify most of them to suit your tastes helpedgraphics going back to replay a skirmish surprised me with the staying power of the effects
many of the sounds are underwhelming but are logically tied to weapons that arent that outstanding and hence it makes sense
explosions especially from nukes are underwhelming and the lightning bolt weapons dont have much of a zap sound but mortars sound fitting enoughsound many games end up being muted so i can listen to the playlist on my computer but total annihilation actually has a decent score and it will automatically change depending on whether youre building up or in the thick of combat
unfortunately theres only a few tracks so youll end up cutting the music sooner or later to listen to your own tunesmusic total annihilation has a rabidly loyal fanbase and realtimestrategy gamers should know why even though both sides are almost exactly the same almost all equipment mirrored if just with a different name and coat of paint but the focus on either applied attrition or maneuver warfare makes for games with a much more powerful sense of speed activity and clashing titans of armies navies and what aircraft exist
resources are also dealt with on a persecond instead of blankunitcost basis allowing you to intentionally overstretch your metal or energy for a critical push when games like command  conquer or warcraft make you wait until youre ready to build the whole kit
being able to make absurdly long queues also removes a lot of the difficulty of micromanagement besides ai that you can tweak for precisely the aggressiveness you want starting from the factory or on each unit you selectgameplay while its a lot of fun to go through slightly lessso with many of the campaign missions even though the variance of multiplayer with humans helps eventually you realize that both sides are identical
creating new units is possible but not easy and the fanbase is drying up judging by the plethora of inactive websitesreplayability the physics engine is more thorough that even the spiritual successor supreme commander  if aircraft arent careful a determined squadron of tanks can shoot down brawler gunships and doing things like pounding an entrenched beach with a flotilla of frigates and battleships has intensity only matched by warship gunner
the variety of strategic warfare will take a while to grow stale this game is a staple of the genre and no rts fan should go without having played at least onceoverall i have owned this game for several years and decided to buy another copy for a friendstrategy is somewhat the most important role but knowing what to build and what to destroyan annoying thing i realized is that sometimes you just cant defeat the other opponent even if you rush in with  aircrafts if vehicles kbots or ships cannot do so
there are times when it will seem to be like a tie and i save the game and deal with it later
im talking about playing against the comp
btwplaying against other players is great when you learn more about the gamethere are some overpowered items in this game so i find that if you attack in smaller mobs than come in in a large group you might be able to slow down their building of weapons
when they have the most advanced weaponsrobots you cant really beat them and neither can they beat you as you would probably have the top items as well
thats the only problem i really found in this game against the computerthis is an amazing game and youll be playing it for hours since its so much fun
some weapons are really cool and you basically just own tons of enemies with them
i find ships useful for defense since some have powerful or fast attacks
vehicles are what i used for to attack in smaller groups
bombing aircrafts literally wipes out a group while only sacrificing a few of your own robotsif your into strategy action games you must own this or at least play it a couple of times
whats more fun than blasting metal while using your brain to defeat themok i remember playing this game a long time ago and loving it
but after installing the latest patches and giving it another go i have to wonderwho decided to make the enemies be able to shoot you from so far awaywhoever did that and made that decisionruined the game
i am going to uninstall the patch and play again and see if it changes things because i swear it wasnt like that when i played it the first time around
i will update after trying it sans patchupdate the problem wasnt the patch it was my memory
my apologies to any this review affected prolly like  people lol
this is a great classic game and i hope you try iti like this game a lot
the multiplayer either skirmish or with some friends is among the best out there
the game allows for many different ways to attack like ground invasion missiles air strikes artillery fire or just nuke the enemy bases
plus every attack has a defense so good players can stop just about every attack against them
this can lead to very long matches with no clear cut winnersthe largest flaw with this game is its age
the engine doesnt allow zooming in or out
most commanding happens through the minimap which can take some adjusting
however a more advanced engine that supports total annihilation maps and mods has been released
its named ta spring
i highly recommend that engine as well
aside from the engine there were no major flaws to this game
it is one of the best rts games ever madequotsilent hillquot is one of the best survival horror games out there even better so than quotresident evilquot
as earlier reviews have pointed out this game is not for the faint of heart
the story concerns harry an average man who comes to the small town of silent hill a town with a scarred history
he is on vacation with his daughter cheryl and on their way there is an accident
when harry comes to he finds himself alone his daughter missing
add to this the town is deserted
as you might expect there are dangerous monsters lurking about
the purpose of this game is to find harrys daughter and unlock the secrets of silent hills past
it wont be easy thoughquotsilent hillquot is better than re in that it provides much more realism
harry is an average person like you or me not a hero or arsenal on two legs
like most humans he is not an expert at conflict so this makes the battles much tougher
the atmosphere is where this game reallt excells
the deserted town is creepier than anything out of a horror movie with fog so thick that you cannot see  feet in front of you
the snow falls steadily
the music is subtle adding to the creepiness
the monsters come out of nowhere and there are many occasions that will make you jumpthere is less action than the other survival horror games but in a game like this it is not a big loss
the game is more about solving puzzles than blowing monsters into oblivion
unlike rpgs there are no  experiece points no levils no benefit to fighting every single creature
running from fights is often the best movethe one big flaw which prevents this game from getting five stars is the clunky controls
i pity the person who plays this game without the analog joysticks
harry is very difficult to move around thanks to the complicated control system
it takes a while to get used to them but by that time you will have gotten killed a few times
the monsters come out of nowhere and you have mere seconds to react
with controls this complicated battles are really frustratingbut all in all this is a fantastic game
lots of depth thrills and scares
sadly this title is out of print so grab it if you can find it
but it comes with a warning it is violent and disturbing
use with cautiontheres pus spewing from the kitchen sink the walls are bleeding the fog is so thinck you can cut it with a knife and this is during the daylight hours
things get worse at night as a demon world attempts to merge itself with our own
this is the premise of the story as harry mason navigates his way through this errily bizzare town that his hauntingly a lot like something only the most twisted and bizar mind could create
resident evil has its shock moments but regardless of what anyone might tell you for a real scare the original silent hill is the game to play
this is hands down the creepiest game and while it has few of the zombie jumping through the window sort of scares there is a great deal of darkness and erie sounds to compensate
this is a different kind of horror than re a game that bares no resemblance to this original master piece with the exception of the irritating control style but thats where the similarities end
re relies on catching you off guard sh requires you to constantly be on guard and plays on your paranoia the entire time especially with the radio
while re comes off as a fun bmovie sh comes off as the darkest dream you dont want to remember which makes it a worthwhile experience well worth the moneyit also features some of the finest fmv sequences to grace the ps topping the work of final fantasy viii
the in game graphics leave a lot to be desired though
this is another game i would like to see remade for gcn however konami has taken a very stubborn antigcn stance the likelyhood that this will happen is slimas with most survival horror titles this game packs an awkward control style that is even more devistating to the overal game than the re control because the camera moves as though it were stalking you a cool effect that is hindered by the horrible control set up a problem that was adjusted in the psxbox sequel restless dreams
aside from this complaint the game is brilliant and every horror fan should pick this title up
however this game is not for kids nor is it for the weak in stomach and faint of heart
it takes a strongh stomach and even stronger will power to get through this game
i dont care how strong you think you are this game will scare youi played this game right after i finished metal gear solid and while i was a little let down from the switch i found the game entertaining
i played it at like  in the morning with the lights out and it can kinda freak you out
it is an old game now but if you liked the resident evil series and never got to try this one pick it up for your ps or ps
also if you are thinking about getting sh definately play this game cause it helps you understand the townas you could guess being a film student and all that i prefer slightly the cinematic fear of the biohazardresident evil series over this much more eerie style of fear but that doesnt mean that this game didnt scare me as much if not morewhats so great about silent hill is that the danger has a sense of reality to it unlike in resident evil where you really just fight some monsters who jump through windows at you and watch some highly entertaining scenes
the fog adds a new element of fear in which something might be out there and with the radio you know when there is an unseen terror lurking in the shadows or precipitation
real life is more like that where you cant see your enemies not where they are just big enough to withstand several direct shotgun shotshowever enough comparisons to the horrorking series because this game is neither better nor worse
this game is simply different
your hero isnt a cop and the disaster is much more philosophical and fantastic than scientific which isnt just resident evil but also parasite eve
this isnt as much xfiles as it is the twighlight zonethe story is about harry mason an average joe coming to the resort town silent hill with his daughter
what he doesnt realize is that at that very time the forces of darkness are struggling almost fighting one another
as a result there are many dead people around and the town itself is now pulsating with evil
sometimes hell leave a building where the time of day or the design of the town will change within seconds right before his eyes
however after each boss battle all the superlevels of darkness will subside and the daytime will come about again where the danger is much more scarce its kindof like castlevania ii simons quest a true classic where there are times of light evil and times of overwhelming evil
however unlike simons quest you cannot just wait it outthe main point that im trying to make is that this game is easily as scary as resident evil but its less in the real world yet it has a strange sense of familiarity to it
however if you were brought up with the other survival horror world than dont expect this to just me one of the better entries this is its own unique bloodline well fear effect was similar but this is much much better
i know horror players who have given up on this game due to the fact that it is too scary
i have myself and im sure all these other reviewers did as well
you will too but that doesnt mean that you wont like iteven as a  year old man this game can still creep the crap out of me
happy as all heck to have it againzombie babieszombie babies its what makes the game tick
the controls were quotsloppyquot but i really didnt mind cause the graphics were awsome
one of my favorites i really enjoyedbeing the survivla horror fan i am i have to start by saying that if you happen to see this at a discount store or bargen bin pick it up and hold it close as the game has become very rare in many areas of the world
this was konamis answer to capcoms resident evil and still is one of the most popular horror games today
the game unlike resident evil or many other horror games chooses to scare you in a more mental quiet sense not to say resident evil is bad im mearly saying sh and re are very different form one another
the game is not for the faint of heart or those with out a healthy ammount of patience as the game focuses mainly on puzzle soving and exploration
although the graphics are dated by todays standards this is easilly overlooked once you start playing
although the game offers a fantasic story and haunting atmosphere i highly recomend silent hill  over the orrigional as it has better controlls smoother visuals and an even better story
i have played many horror games and believe me when i say that this one and its sequels stand out amongst the rest and shoud be added to any games collection
silent hill is not a game to missbefore silent hill was released all we horror gamers had to scare us were the resident evil biohazard series of games with big flashy chills and spills and the alone in the dark series which were just plain bad console conversions of average pc games
it just goes to show what can be done with a genre when a development team sits down and outs their heads together properlyeclipsing resident evil and all other competitors in terms of scares character development and sophistication silent hill upon its release in  was unfairly ignored by the general public even though critics were highly impressed with its blend of psychological methodscares and realtime environments
the public used to zombie dogs bursting through windows and supersharp prerendered backdrops couldnt seem to get into a foggy realtime atmosphere where what you heard was scarier than what you saw
however thanks in no small part to its sequels the standardsetting silent hill  and the graphically amazing slightly hollow silent hill  the original silent hill now enjoys something of a classic status and i have to say its very welldeservedyou play harry mason a widower whose daughter cheryl goes missing en route to their vacation in the resort town of silent hill
along the way you encounter allies and enemies cybil the cop dr michael nurse lisa and the memorable dahlia gillespie one of the series coolest characters to date and unravel the ghastly truth behind the desertion and possession of a seemingly innocent townthe graphics havent aged well but still have the ability to scare
one of the first survival horrorgames to utilise fully modelled realtime environments the camera angles and darknessfog make for some truly chilling views
you find your way with the aid of a map torch and a radio that emits static only when an enemy is close
since darkness and fog are very cleverly employed in the game ostensibly to keep the slowdown to a minimum it also serves to heighten the tense atmosphere what you hear and do not see is a lot scarier than what you do see
there are also several of the truly cool nightmarish vignettes that the series has become famous for  pyramidheads in steel cages the mark of samael and terribly wasted corpses cling to walls and ceilings and give us a deeper sense of the ravages of satanismthe gameplay and controls in the game while doing nothing really new for the genre are loose and easy
this is a system that will never be perfect lacking the fluidity of the tomb raider games and the precision of pointandclick adventures but does the job nicely
the autoaim of games like residnet evil isnt present so shooting can become a tense and exciting exercise  but youll more often than not end up running scared from whatever it is you cant seethe characterisation is superior thanks in no small part to superb prerendered cut scenes and excellent voice acting
konami have taken great pains in all of their silent hill games to make sure that we understand the characters in the game and the original is no exception
our protagonist harry is the dullest of the players but hes still a likeable and wellrealised character
cheryl is not the stereotypical bugeyed manga cute girl weve come to expect from japanese games and shes all the more realistic and endearing because of it
nurse lisa is sinister and forbidding in her surroundings but her innocence and frailty is heartrending  i defy anyone not to mist up when she makes her exit in the game
and dahlia gillespie is a masterpiece shes a scary eccentric old woman that will stay in the memory long after youve finished playingi hate giving away plot points in my reviews and i wont here either but a word of advice from a survivalhorror completist  conserve your ammo
depending on the ending you get one of a possible five you may have to fight up to three endofgame bosses
and nothing spoils your enjoyment of a game more than having to replay the final half for more ammoall in all silent hill is a convoluted enthralling game
it may be slightly roughlooking in places but its wellworth the ride and an absolute must if you intend to play the laterst installment
highly recommendedoverall this game is the creepiest videog ame i have ever played
the environments enimies and gameplay are designed to keep the player interested and a little on the edge
the only true problem with this title is that it offers nothing new and relies very much on the style of playing created by resident evil
not that this style is bad but within silent hill the gameplay just didnt feel quite as great as it did with resident evil and at times i got a little bored with the wandering around the level that must be done from time to time
despite these few complaints this is an excellant title that fans of the quotsurvival horrorquot genre should enjoyits awesome if you love metal gear solid especially the first oneas much as i do
packed with unlockables like the ability to play as grey fox
big time investment however which is a good or bad thing depending on how you look at itthis game doesnt have a story but that is actually a good thing
vr missions is great for those of us who have to wedge game playing between an everchanging schedule
most levels take anywhere from  seconds to five mintues and you can exit anytime and save your game
so if you have to get up and run you really havent lost anything if you take ten seconds to exit and saveit has all the classic moves from mgs and some fun levels like quotmysteryquot arrest the right murder suspect puzzle think enemydominos and round after round of weaponbased combat so you dont always have to sneak aroundid say pick this one up with a tendollar price tag there isnt much of a reason not tometal gear solid vr missions  circa good great way to hone your metal gear solid gameplay if you loved the vr training missions in metal gear solidbad graphics are pretty dated no story think of the game more like a great big metal gear vr test if you hated the vr training missions in metal gear solidwill it fit your taste only vr training missions hundreds of missions and training exercise to performgame its most assocated too metal gear solids vr missionsadditional notes the cyber ninja is a playable character if only for a few missionsi have always been a diehard mgs fan so i had to buy this game
it was very appealing at first beacuse the missions deliver a proffesional touch to yoursnakes abilities
the proves to be challenging and requires a quick tactical sort of brainthe game needs to be played bye someone who can devote time to play it also as it gets very frustrating at certain times
i found my self beating the controller on the floor at times do to having to try over and over and over again to beat a level that is extremely intimadatingthis game would have made a better prerealease game because it prepares you for the most grueling parts of mgs
so if your a new comer to the mgs series get this game first its ideal for training you for the real gamein  hideo kojima single handedly changed the scope of gaming with one game metal gear solid
within metal gear solid there were ten vr missions
surprisingly people spent a lot of time with these vr missions trying to clear them as fast as possible and honing their skills
when word of this got out konami developed metal gear solid vr missions
a game that consisted of nothing but vr missions for the gamers that wanted themif anyone expected any story out of vr missions youd probably wonder what they were thinking because vr missions doesnt have a story
the game is exactly what it says it is vr missions
metal gear solid vr missions consist of over  missions
at first you can only do very basic missions including the same ten that were included in metal gear solid
as well as training with weapons
the more missions you complete the more that will open up including missions that can get into the bizarre like fighting a giant soldier and super soldiersin terms of variety metal gear solid vr missions does a great job
there are so many different varied missions here to keep you busy
youll also be able to unlock the ninja and a couple of other secrets although none of these things is very lucrative
while its great to play as the ninja the controls are a little sloppy and there are only three incredibly short missions
as i said however there are a ton of vr missions here to keep you busy for a long timevisually vr missions is on par with the original metal gear solid the only real problem being that they didnt opt to create more different looking levels
so much of the stages look fairly generic save for a few missions where youll find yourself in some familiar looking areas from metal gear solid
you can only stare at virtual space for so long
much of the music sounds very good though
while the soundtrack isnt exactly huge it plays a good part in letting the player know that through and through this is not an action game
it is definitely a puzzle gamethere are two things about metal gear solid vr missions that can cause some alarm though
the first being that many missions are fairly short meaning that this game only really serves as an expansion of metal gear solid
its a mystery why konami didnt just start packing it in with the original game after a while
it never really happened
the second huge problem is that the game advertises that it has  missions
what they dont mention is that many of those missions are the same
youll undergo one mission and then be expected to do it again in a time attack
to the developers this serves as two different missions but its the same mission
the only difference is that youll be doing it with an additional challengeas a puzzle game metal gear solid vr missions is fantastic
it gets repetitive having to do some of the same missions over and over and it may only really just be an expansion of one of the bonuses in metal gear solid but it still serves as a fantastic game for those who crave to do more vr missionsfirst of all  missions sounds like alot but after playing it for a while you realize that you have completed more than you thought
you are training in a vr world with solid snake and other characters like meryl and the ninja
although the ninja only has  missions they are pretty fun
you can use alot of different weapons in different areas
but the reason i gave it only  stars is because the first one has a really in depth story and this one is just training
i recommend that you play the first one to really have fun with this onethis is a very good game
although the controls are not good you can set them how you like them
it is also very scary for one every time you turn around the corner you see a vampire
i give this game four stars because it is not my favorite game but it is very cooltheif the dark projectthe known your a theif and take on many jobs by your employer
before each level there is a cut seen that sets it up
simple but nicely done
being a theif requires many theiflike equipment
your trusty bowthat zooms in when you hold the string back long enough blackjackknock out club a variety of speciality arrowsincluding a rope arrow
etcbeing a theif you rely on darkness hence a visiblity gauge
if it is bright then you are in to much light
theif also has a sound gauge
if your walking to fast or on noisy floors like metal grating tiles or gravel the noise will be much greaterthe game runs smoothly and is very immersive thanks to the great sound effects and good graphics for the time
one thing that some reviewers overlook is the stat summary at the end of the level
it is a nice to see your total and level timeloot killed bodys knocked out bodys and discoverd bodysyou can pick up the bodys and hide them to reduce suspicion of other guards
this adds to the feeling of not just going level to level and actually working for a goal
a goal which could simply be saving money to buy equipment at the start of the next levellevels are layed out nice
with this point alot of people complain about the zombie levels
is that because its not realistic
not a setting that a theif would normally be put into
or the fact that they scare the  out of you
i will never forget the first time i played the second level and saw a corpes
i bent down to inspect it
well what do you know it started getting up and let out a grotesque moanthe sound makes this game
without it the game would be reduced significantly
with that said use headphones and play it in the dark
your heart will race and you will jump when guards see you or you come across something you where not perpared forplayablity
play it every once in awhilelike combat flight sim and it will keep your interest
with the total time stat it will give you an incentive to try to beat your old timebottom line
 stars for a truly immersive game even compared to the glamour of the newer games
get it
it deserves to be in your collection and will not set you back any moneythief the dark project in my opinion was pretty tedious compared to the fastmoving sequel
it started out fine but it got really dull and annoying when i reached the zombieinfested parts of the game which include levels like down in the bonehoard and the haunted cathedral
i loved it at first seeing new types of opponent apart from the usual guards but the fun dies out pretty quickly because of the level structure
this isll be a complete nuisance if the difficultys set on expert
the objectives of levels which have zombies and burricks are pretty demanding and theyre all not located in convenient places
it requires a lot of going back and forth which means that sometimes you face the enemies all over again as its impossible to kill more than  especially since they move around in groups so a quick glance dart and hide is done mostly throughout the gamethe other levels are pretty civilized which involve reasonable objectives and most of these are taken place in the city where its mostly guaranteed you wont see mythical monsters like the zombies and the burricksthe reason why this game mainly revolves around these monsters is because of the storyline
garrett the thief you play finds himself being involved with dark pagan rituals people who worship the forces of nature and live in woodsthe graphics and lighting are amazing and really set the atmosphere
i recommend this game but a getting a lot from it is not to be expectedlots of combatibility issues however those looking to by this game because they used to play it get it
it is still awesome
this game set standards and introduced many new concepts for games to steal since it was released
make no mistake assasins creed elder scrolls and many other games took themes and ideas from this game
this is the original and it still kicks aswhen it worksthis game failed in so many ways it has become a legendwhere should one start
the mid s gamingindustry primadonna john romero with his touch of midas and fleet of ferraris spearheading the development the announcement of the greatest gameeverexperienced the impossible schedule to be in stores before christmas of  with less than  months in production the inyourface advertisements that overhyped this game like no otherthen came the delaysand the postponementsand christmas of   and then quake iii came along and everything felt so yesterdayto be fair this is not as bad a game as its reputationtrue i hated the sidekicks so much total lack of any intelligence  with the exception of finding ways to getting themselves killed and ending the game
i had to let it steep for a whole summer before finishing it off
true it was not fast enough or graphically impressive enough to compete by on the other hand most of the weapons were imaginative the gameplay was innovative at times incorporating some puzzles in an fps game above the level of finding theblue and red cards the settings well designed having to travel in different eras is not common in a futuristic games
what i really enjoyed though was its constant japanese undercurrents from weapons and sceneries to characters dialogno game collection is complete without it i am afraiddaikatana was reviled by virtually everybody back in the day
thats why i never got around to playing it until now
people hated the save gems hated maneuvering the sidekicks and hated the performance glitches
things have changed since then
currently this game can be downloaded from gogcom for  and often goes on sale
i paid  for it
i suggest bypassing the discs and getting it from that site
that version runs perfectly on todays computers and has an option to allow for unlimited saves which is what we all want
as far as the sidekicksyes they can be a headache at times
there are times when youll have to control not one but two sidekicks
who thought this was a good idea
but not always and once you get the hang of it it isnt too bad
more often than not youll just command your sidekicks to remain behind while you clear out an area rather then have them die fighting alongside you
because if a sidekick dies its time to hit f and reload a save point
not a problem just remember to save often
the gameplay is fun though
i found the levels interesting and at times the game reminded me of the first halflife and quake   its an old game so the graphics are on par with those two
there are a bunch of secret areas to find also which is always fun
cool weapons and lots of creatures to kill as well so whats not to likei will warn everyone that if you dont patch your game it will crash like crazy on the st level and apparently there was ai issues but you should buy this from gogcom where the game is already patched and ready to work on modern pcs or if you have windows xp it will work but if you buy the disc then just be ready to patch the game
the game on the otherhand without glitches is not too bad but i had some fun with it until i ended up being lost in the game not knowing where to go
my conclusion is that this game is meant for people who enjoy fps games not matter how cheesy or bad
anyway  i hope you enjoy the game if not then find something you likeoriginally attracted by the box which youve got to admit is one of the bestlooking around id been thinking of buying revenant for ages but considered it vastly overpriced unlike black isle games which seem to drop in price by at least half when theyve been out for a remarkably short while
recent lower pricing along with the long wait for the release of baldurs gate  saw me grabbing a copy loading it up and setting off on a short but immensely enjoyable quest
it turned out to be a great time fillerin the single player mode your character is locke daveram dead for  years but because of unique skills brought back onto the mortal coil to rescue the kidnapped daughter of the head honcho of misthaven the main town on the island of ahkuilon by a mysterious magician with surprise surprise
his own agenda
during his quest aspects of lockes past gradually reveal themselves and his visions start making sense by the end
sounds like a poor mans planescape torment you might think but since nothing can compare to that epic forget it and judge it on its own meritslikened by many to diablo this game is superior in that it actually has a reasonably compelling storyline though badly voice acted and the combat system is not your average hacknslash  you learn new battle techniques from the master as you advance
the use of a game pad is strongly recommended though i survived all the combat encounters by pounding the hell out of my keyboard while moving about with the mouse
the scenery is beautifully rendered the lighting is a real feature and animation of locke and his enemies is superb though a tad repetitious  like the giant spiders getting stuck on the sword and having to be removed with obvious difficulty hilarious the first time the death gurgles of the ninja guys got old very quicklythis is the only game ive played lately where you can carry everything you find  there dont seem to be any weight limits and there are millions of slots especially once you have a few pouches which you really need to negotiate the huge inventory you end up with i had about  full suits of armour at the end  i was too scared to sell any in case i needed their special properties
even though the armourer and weapon smith promise bigger and better equipment you actually find the best stuff during the quest though you need to buy some stuff to start off with
unlike many other games except at the very beginning i always had enough cash to buy any potions etc
that i needed
in fact at the rather abrupt end i had about  unused potions of various sorts and about 
also your character is usually strong enough and well enough equipped to survive most encounters pretty easily
i found the fact that he wasnt constantly being killed quite refreshing
none of the puzzles were too taxing though i had to redo one level for the want of one vialeven though the price was reduced it was still fractionally more than i paid for planescape torment or for that matter baldurs gate each of which provided rich and stimulating entertainment for a couple of months
i spent exactly a week getting to the end of revenant and since id been having such fun i was totally unprepared for it
remember how disappointing the end of diablo was
ditto for revenant  the final encounter was quite easy for my impressively armoured wellarmed and richly provisioned character and the whole thing was quickly wrapped up in a movie sequence
it left me feeling the story was only half told and that the developers just suddenly decided to get it to some sort of conclusion and out in the shops while they got on with something else
i wish theyd just gone on with the next chapter  despite any shortcomings mentioned above i thoroughly enjoyed it
this is the game to play when youre half concentrating on something else  in my case live coverage of the sydney olympicsi got a good deal on this game
i purchased it  at a local retailer and the thought if it sucks im not out much went through my mind
i brought it home and installed it not expecting much out of this game
once i started playing though i was blown away
this is a great game in the spirit of diablo  and nox
you start out as a revenant a resurrected spirit with no recollection of your past
you must fight an evil cult and rescue the kings daughter at least i think he was a king i didnt really pay much attention because the dialogue is annoying in this gameaside from the annoying dialogue and it is very annoying the rest of the game rocks
the way spells are cast is interesting and different from normal games where scrolls are memorized or written in a magic book
the melee combat is good because your character has  different attacks instead of the one slash attack in diablo   granted he cant learn a whirlwind attack or leap attack but who cares
thats not realistic anywaythe graphics and sound are both very good
the only problem is sometimes i have difficulties picking up items off the ground especially if they are hidden behind the leaves of a tree
also sometimes you will get stuck behind a rock or the edge of a fence line and it takes a bit to get unstuck but you never remain there foreveri also like the way i can see enemies on my map so if my health is very low and i have no food or potions i can avoid them making my way back to townthis game is worth as much as 
i might have given it a few more dollars if it werent for the annoying dialogueyoure a huge robot running through a city demolishing stuff
whats not to like
graphics look good and the gameplay works welli tried this game by chance a decade ago and boy so  much fun and time well spent on this now classic turn based role playing gamebuild your armies develop your heroes your towns
the pace of heroes progress the depth of the universe stories artwork graphics for the time a real addictionthe expansion was excellent toogo try it or heroes after playing heroes of might and magic  for years i was excited about heroes  but after i got the game i thought it was just heroes  all over again
all that was really done to the game was add several creature take away a few creatures mix the towns up a little and slap better graphics on it
though i must admit that it was just as fun and pehaps even more fun than heroes  one of the greatest things about this game is the plot and story much better than heroes 
if youre thinking of buying this game and dont have heroes  then know that it can be very addicting
if you do have heroes  then only buy this game if you want better graphics and a few new creatures then go ahead and get itthis normally takes a long time and is purely strategybased
there are at least  different creatures you can fight with each with special abilities and statistics
you send quotheroesquot to bring these creatures around the map to gain resources experience artifacts and other treasures
then you use your cities to make more creatures
generally the idea is to wipe out your opponents in stunning turnbased battle sequences
the heroes are generally few and they often just explore and wipe out uncontrolled creatures which may flee attack you join you or offer themselves for hire
the games take a long time depending on the map at least  hours
you can make scenarios and the editor is pretty friendly
i recommend this game for people who want a slowpaced strategic challengeim giving this game  stars out of the gate because its pretty much just like mm  and thats definitely a good thing
mm  in my opinion is one the the best in the series and so far  has got me wanting to continue more of the late night session i spent with its predicessor
oh and by the way if you are having trouble getting this game to runread on a few reviews down if you are reading the reviews in order of the date reviewed youll see a very simple solution shared by one of the reviewers that works
fret notthe game does run on xpyoull just have to have a little know how and a little patiencedarviusi am a longtime mampm devotee
i played every game of this gorgeous series
on the last mampm  it is put on a new high level
but in this sequel it seems to do the same thing without new surprise
to be fair  this game is still lots of fun
i like the storyline very much in the  game whevever you are so careful you must choose your route between good  or evil and then become the foe and the killer of the other side
this is  life
and numerous quests make you always has something to do
the most  disadvantage of this game is the unnecessary lots of monsters
i hate  myself doing the same thing again and again accept a guest kill the  monsters get the item
in fact i am not killing the monster im killing  my time if do company know this this game and the following  sequelsmampm  would be far more better
but alas i just  purchased a copy of mampm  and the monsters seem to be even far morethis ones my favorite out of the first  and i liked them all couldnt get into chronicles or the others after
this one has the best looking tombs in the series and theres more tombs here than any of the others until you get to the city of the dead more than halfway through
then the game changes quite a bit
it becomes dark and drearypuzzles are harder here
many times you have to reenter levels to solve them
itll take patience
but its all egypt and really interesting
on the other hand you can save anywhere and theres far more items you can find in lr compared to the previous three
you really have to be doing something wrong to run out of itemsfour stars for this cause like i said the city of the dead the game changes dramatically all the way to the end
but the first  of this game was excellentjust want to respond to those who complain about the controls the controls in this game is no different than the previous tr games
rope swinging was difficult but other than that it is the same
you can complain about trs control scheme all together but those who didnt mind will enjoy thisi have enjoyed this game very much
its fun and exciting and the story is a big step up from the previous games
graphics wise this game has a few improvements added but otherwise its similiar to  amp problems include glitches falling through walls and losing saves in fact that is the only thing keeping me from finishing the game
the rope swinging is also a problem
its hard getting it to swing as is aiminggraphics sound control fun  and its not just because the fanboys like her exaggerated assets either
im more a roleplayer than an action gamer but theres enough character involved in the tomb raider series to keep me interestedlaras adventures follow the same basic mold as the mummy or the indiana jones movies she goes poking about in ancient sites and gets involved in things man was not meant to know and that woman was meant to put right apparently
being actionoriented the game gives you a wide range of motion and does a nice job of making you feel the difficulty and danger of some of her feats  jumping over pits filled with spikes swinging on ropes over chasms climbing sheer cliffs swimming through sharkinfested waters and so on
in the last revelation the dark egyptian god set is unleashed upon the world partly through laras ending up somewhere she shouldnt have been and so lara has to put a stop to his rampage
normally one human against a god would be a silly idea but then again the last time set was loose human beings didnt have fully automatic weapons bazookas and grenadesthe game fails to get a perfect rating from me based on my own preferences and skills
firstly because it is an action game many of its challenges are based simply on your being good enough to do some particular set of actions very very well
im not the greatest in the world at doing some of the more complex sequences and this means that it can take a frustratingly long time to get past one challenge  in some cases days to either figure out the precise sequence of moves which will get me from one point to the next or to actually perform the sequence of moves once ive figured it out
timing is critical and restarting the game from the last saved point can take an annoying amount of timesecondly because im more a roleplayer i find the lack of choices in actions somewhat stifling
yes i would as a rule choose to go and do the heroic thing but you dont really get any choice to even be reluctant go get help or anything else
you work alone you volunteer automatically and so onstill playing a couple of lara crofts adventures showed me why this series still continues it delivers exactly what it promises and does so with panachefear effect is excellent
the graphics are fun the storyline is great the gameplay is exciting  it is the best game i have played in a whilethe downside the game has very little replay value and it is not  very long
it only took a few hours to beat
the game is fun though   once i beat it i went right back to play through in hard mode
after  that though there was nothing more to the gameverdict  you should  definitely rent this game if it interests you at all you will not be  disappointed
i would not recommend buying it thoughfear effect is a fun game that is challenging and quite good value for just 
the game is sometimes very tricky though
some puzzles go beyond hard as the game progresses
the bosses and enemies are already hard in the first levels
the game goes by pretty quick even with the challenge though
buy this game if you want a good animated action game that will leave you wanting to play fear effect forget the standard final fantasystory line
in thousand arms you play as mice triumph a letcherous young man on a quest to regain his kingdom and woo any young woman in his path
the game features the best voice overs in any game the playstation has ever made and the graphics are a culmination of lunar  and final fantasy vii
for anyone who wants to have a wonderful story in the tradition of anime and laugh for hours at some of the funniest dialoge yet then look no farther then thousand arms
warning the game while not anymore violent then any of the lunar games does contain quite a few sexual innuendos partly spawning form the unique system of this game where you can go on dates with each girl and try to win her over
this game is suggested for an audience  and upfirst off if you are an old school rpg fan like me you will at least like this game
i do not want to add any spoilers so i will give a quick synopsis
this is a typical old school japenese type rpg
it starts in a castlemy personal favorite 
this game features voice acting although its not the best
the graphics are very good for an older game
the fighting is your typical turn based style
the story is average again nothing to write home about
i would say this game is an above average jrpg and is worth the purchasei would rate this game it can get very quotstupidquot at times but there is a lot of fun in the game and many funny parts in it as well
females might get quotoffendedquot by some of the dateing parts in the game but please remember its only a game ok even if the game is a bit quotpigishquot
very good cartoon graphicsfirst off im just gonna say that this game is very weird one of the most unique games ever
you will probably never play any game like this unless there is a sequel
this is because of the way you learn new spells you date women
this is very funny because of what they ask and their different reactions and it is in dialogouge and interactive anime
my complaints are in the battle system factor it is just kinda dumb
your three characters are lined up in a row and when on dies the other comes in so you only fight with one character at a time
this game is very fun and it can help all those desperate guys out there who arent gettin any actioni played this game a long time ago
and i am reviewing it just because i am currently playing gta this game reeks with coolness
but me and most other gamerspeople want to know how this game managed to get a quotteenquot rating
it is just as gory and profained as gtahere is how i rate gta sound graphics gameplay fun difficulty easy to hardoverall  eight out of tenfolks this is the gta my generation grew up with not the cheesy d versions that exist today
while i do not dismiss the greatness that comes with d the d birds eye view was a great experience at the time and even today
the game was pure fun with little decadence compared to the modern installmentsthe pc version is much better though but do not get it from steam if you own an old pc equipped with a dfx accelerator because the steam version does not come with dfx supportthis was definitely how i remember this game
classic played it a lot when i was a youngster and decided to get some classics backhonestly i am only getting this to play for a while and add to the collection
it was pretty good but nothing like gta  and laterspec ops stealth patrol puts you in the life of a ranger
this proves to be quite the task
the first level turns out to be amazingly hard with enemies running around everywhere and almost no medipacks at your  disposal
the solution
call a friend and beat the game in twoplayer mode
it turns out that its a really really fun game
kneeling and laying on  your stomach become your best friend when dodging enemy fire
learning to  search around the area and sneaking up on soldiers shows that medipacks  are equaly spread throughout levels
choose your men wisely as some  missions need someone that can use a scope to take out those irresistible  mines
the graphics sound and game mechanics are really great for only the price
the only drawback i have is that when youre calling your buddy to  follow you he can get hung up on things like trees or cliffs and the  game could go much smoother without mines on every inch of ground
overall  your  bucks couldnt go to better use
nothing feels better than seeing  an iraqi through your scope or watching the little red sights appear on a  vietkongthis is one of the best games from ps
i love to play it to players because its interactive and we have to pass order on what to do like a real mission and cover each other like a real war missionof all the war games me and my sons have played
this was by far the one of the most fun i loved how the enemy soldiers were programmed to respond to noises and attacks very realistic
no matter how many times we played a level trying to get off it never got dull because the enemies didnt respond always the same
it was very fun making mistakeslike accidentally throwing grenades at my partner or setting explosives to close and for getting to tell my partner
the only disapointment was not enough levels but for the price this game was well worth itok i have to be honest
this game totally rocked
the graphics were surprisingly impressive and the combatives that you use such weaponry as the soul reaver kain reaver ariel reaver fire reaver etc is impressive and totally sucks you in
there are two reasons that i gave this game  stars instead of five stars it can be very hard due to the puzzles and lack of direction and plus it can be boring after a while because the enemies get pretty redundant after the first couple of levels
on the other hand this game is worth buying
i enjoyed exploring the  dark scary gut wrenching and yet unique world of nosgoth and i am hoping to get blood omen   either way this game is fun
its impossible not to enjoy this gamelegacy of kain soul reaver was one of the first games made for playstation and to this day is still one of the bestsoul reaver follows the story of raziel a badass vampire whos trying to get revene on his former master kein
raziel must travel through the spectral realm and the real realm defeating  vampire tribes to get stronger and defeat keinwgat makes this game fun is the fact that you can go anywhere you want at anytime
also the graphics were way ahead of its time
the fighting is this game is amazing you get to use raziels brutal vampire attacks and you can use spears which can either throw for a one hit kill or beat the living crap out of your enemiesthe bad things about this game is that there is absolutely no sense of direction in this game
i had to refer to the internet many  times to figure out where to go next
also i heard that the ending sucks
i never beat the game because i couldnt get into keins lair at the endthis game has a few flaws but as long as you have a strategy guidej it can the funnest games youll ever playi loved this gameopening was goodgame play was goodthe only thing i did not like was part of the storylineif you are as into the story line as i am you know that raziel was never in the first blood omen but in this game they said he was
 even placed him in the room with the orignal pillar people  hehe  you will know what i am talking about  when you playhe never had a pillar and he was never in the first oneguuuuurother then that the rest of the story line was very nicethe ending made me want to cry as wellwith that aside i say yah hooo this game rocks
you need to rent it or buy it or get someone to play it for youlegacy of kain soul reaver  circa good mature and dark foreboding story based on blood omen legacy of kain with lots of twists and turns voice work is really good large gothic world to explorebad graphics looked dated to today video game players raziel can really only use two weapons a staff and the sprit sword soul reaver lots of old fashion block pushing has a to be continued endingif it fits your taste lots of exploring lots of block moving an original take on the vampire story takes place in a medieval type of world similar to dungeon and dragonsgame its most assocated too tomb raider  vagrant story castlevaina symphony of the nightadditional notes this is the first game in the soul reaver franchises but a spin off of the blood omen franchises blood omen and soul reaver are two different franchises that fall under the legacy of kain franchise a version of this game was also made on the pc
and dreamcastsoul reaver is much improved over blood omen the graphics being the most notable improvement
the story line is grusome yet completely involving
you can do alot of damage to your opponents and kain is probably the most dynamic and pitiful character appearance wise to date
the dark moody atmosphere is not only necessary it is downright cool and adds a great deal to the game overall
the music score is fairly decent and controls are tight
load times have been much improved as wellthe only real problem with the game is lack of direction
it is never quite clear what you are supposed to do next so you spend alot of time wandering around waiting for something to happen
other than that its a good game
also replay value is fairly low because nothing really changes
all in all a good easy and fun game to kill a few hours withthe graphics tend to be a bit bland but this is a port of a pc game from back in the day
you cant expect much to changethe sound though is much better from reloading your weapons to the sound of a flash bang the atmosphere is lovelythere are some minor glitches such as getting stuck on walls while climbing or stepping something very hindering when you get to later levels that require stealthand the difficulty may put some people off
first off you must spend several minutes in planning before each mission
the problems come when you start the level and most of your teammates just run and get themselves killed no matter how well you planned it out
i find myself just having everyone hold while i do it myself which is difficult seeing as how the enemies will kill you the instant you see them leaving you with the options of shooting them in the back or tossing a flashbang everytime you enter a roombut that aside the game is pretty fun
and you finally get to play as dingstory graphics sound fun lets rundown the standard list of gripes for this game
first off quotthe graphics are awfulquot  no for the most part they are not awful perhaps a bit polygonal but they are almost  years old
let us remember that this is a port of a pc game not an update or any sort of improvement thereofnext is the complaint that this game is too difficult to control
keep in mind that the developers had to map dozens of keyboard commands to a single sega dreamcast controller and they did the best they could
and actually it works fairly well at least after some initial learning curve
lets remember that you wont need every command every second
as long as you know how to move and how to shoot the rest can be accessed without hot buttonslastly there is the complaint about gameplay itself which also presented itself when the original pc game appeared back in 
the realism is true to life as you cant simply stand  feet from an opponent and unload rounds into them until their quotlife barquot runs out
this game works like real life you get shot once youre incapacitated twice and youre probably dead no ambulances to the rescue here
a less realistic situation occurs when your fellow troops get mowed down by a hidden enemy without so much as an adjustment in posture like lambs to the slaughter who dont realize that quothey that guy in front of me ran down the hallway and got shot and theres a good chance ill suffer the same fatequotmake no mistake this is a very good game
theres a reason that sega chose to port a year old pc game to its console
its a challenging game and as a result a very fulfilling one
if you are worried about the lessthanstateoftheart graphics then you arent paying enough attention to the gameplay itself which is king here
it rewards careful attention and an eye for detail
dont expect to go quotrunnin amp gunninquot a la quake iii because you will most definitely be disappointed
this isnt a game for those with short attentionspans
it is a very grownup game with very grownup tastes and methods
it demands a lot but it gives a lot in return
take the time to enjoy it and you will be richly rewardedthis was a rebought purchase as i lost my original copy
this one works wonderfully and much better than my older one despite the lost files on it that i had to recreatethis is the first video game ive played with no violence
it even encourages and insists on making sure you are loving to your animals
you play a farmer and keep busy raising crops different kinds in different seasons taking care of your animals attending festivals and more
you decide how much work you do i recently had to cut down for myself i was too busy
this game is addictive but i did get to a point where i wondered if i had any more goals to strive for because after awhile feeding and brushing your animals day after day gets mundane
then i realized i could have a carpenter add on to my house so i am busy collecting lumber every day
your farmer can get too tired and even get sick so be careful how much work you do
this game would be very appropriate for children as it teaches responsibility and lets them choose what they want to accomplish and everyone in the game is nice to you
good for adults too of course
a peaceful change from highstrung action gamesin fact extremely overpriced
i saw a few copies this game at a vintage video game store the other day for 
i understand its an amazing game but to paying  for something that came out nearly twenty years ago
thats a little much
i mean you can buy new games for that price tag
its ridiculoushowever do i adore the game itself
i used to play it when i was a kid and i still play it
its that good
if youre willing to pay the price go ahead and order
you wont regret itif you are familiar with the harvest moon series or even if you are not and you enjoy rpgsimulation games this game is a good addition to your collection
in harvest moon  you play as a guy who gets to run a farm and have a personal lifethe method of farming in this game is completely done by your character you till the land plant the seeds and water them until plants grow
and you have to do everything in  minutes and  seconds because you wake up at  am hours in this game are  seconds long and the person that picks up the crops comes at  pm  however time does not pass while you are in buildings
if you do to much without eating or sleeping sleeping brings you to the next day you will not be able to use toolscompared to the harvest moon for the super nintendo this game has a good number of new features tools powerup with the amount of times they are used as apposed to completing a certain event in the game that gives you a stronger tool you have to buy your groceries the food you automatically eat when you wake up and at noon you can raise sheep
the money comes from their wool there are new competitions that include racing your dog or horsei could go on and on about the new aspects of hmhowever in hm there is a lot of misparagraphed text and there are also some bugs in the game
one bug in particular that i have found is that at some point in the game elles grandmother may die if you talk to her usually during spring
make sure this never happens on a day when something is happening new years etc
or your game will freezeeven with the bugs try to avoid them
 this game still stands out as a great real life video gameokay i use to have harvest moon for the gbc and in the game you talk to alot of people you get a pet and you do a bunch of farming all in all its a really great game and can be played on the gbc original gba and gba sp
so if you like farming and talking in games then get this game youll really enjoy when i first got this game from a friend i couldnt put it down for almost over a month
oh and plus theres a photo album in the game that you have to play the game for a while to unlock each picture and if you have a game boy printer which you can get off here amazon then you can print out your pictures and you can play as a girl or a boy in the gamewhen it comes to the playstation there are games that have improved when they were remade for the playstation  and there are games that look and play far better in the playstation  version and tetris plus is one of them
unlike tetris worlds where you may get different modes of the game it didnt feel like i got as much to offer or only so much of the feel of tetris when i tried this game for myself
on the other hand tetris plus had the more colorful classic mode the puzzle mode with  different puzzles not to mention the option to create and try your own puzzles and the vs mode to test your skills against another player and all had the exact feel and challenge of tetris as i remembered it
if you want a tetris game for your playstation this is by far still the better choicei am a tetris fan and playing on the playstation is no exception
i bought it used but still a favorite of mineto modern eyes this adventure is bound to look somewhat primitive but just like a good text adventure its evocative storytelling transcends technology for those who can get beyond the dated graphics and movement  modelit is a pointandclick game with a little too much  pointpointpointpointahaclick and it suffers from mild  adventureitis but there are some downright spooky moments and great  ambient noises which build and maintain an atmosphere
here we see one of  the adventure games basic flaws inability to render sentient characters  realistically used cleverly to create a quothauntedquot feel
we also  see one the adventure games primary strengths the ability to compel the  reader to piece together a story used to good advantagea good one for  late at night with all the lights off and the headphones onthis game actually scared me a couple times as i witnessed supernatural phenomena via the various monitoring devices and i wondered what was going to come find methis is a great game to play if youve ever wanted to be  a paranormal investigatoryou get to play with some of the funnest toys  since the ghostbusters movie
the only reason i didnt give it more stars  was because it seemed way too short
its still a great buy howevertheres a ton of firstperson adventure games out there thanks to myst but theres nothing wrong with that
what matters is if the game is enjoyable to play and in the case of amber id most definately say  yesamber journeys beyond is a first person adventure game with  somewhat simple graphics and animation but at the same time the plot and  story hold your interest
the premise is that you are checking up as a  favor to a friend on a woman who bought a haunted house so she could study  the paranormal
she uses a headset called the amber device so she can  observe the ghosts and actually travel in the spirit realm
when you find  her shes in a catatonic state trapped outside of her body with no way of  geting backyour job is to help your friend by guiding the other spirits  in the house to their final rewards by either helping them realize that  theyre dead finding an item that they lost or helping them finish  something they never completed in life
theres three people you need to  aid before you can help your friend and no particular order in which to do  italthough the game is only on one cd and the graphics are simplistic  amber is still an impressive game for the value
it has enough ambiance to  make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up more than once imagine  walking into the bathroom and seeing words write themselves on the mirror
amber can scare you but it does it in a subtle way instead of shoving a  bucketload of gore in your face
the gameplay is a bit short but still  much more than youd normally expect in a single cd gameif you want an  inexpensive yet interesting adventure this is the game for youit was defenitely way too shorti bought  played this game back when i was on win use winxppro now and i had no problems whatsoever
this game was fun exciting creepy and kept me wanting more
even after i found things i needed in places i was still curious to search more and just poke around
the stories were sad and haunting but so entertaining
i was very dissapointed that this was so short and i have been searching for a similiar game ever since with no luck at all still i dont regret buying thisi mean its been forever and im still searching for a game that can entertain me like this did
i gave amber  stars only because of game length other than that i say you have to play this gameamber is the first game i ever completely made it through
i bought it and completed it in about   to  hours
i used a walk thru to help or else i wouldve been totally lost
kudos to hugh forest on their choice for the actress who played roxy verrrry nice
also i found brices world to be the most disturbing of the three stories due to his obviously sad state of mind
the first story was great in that it was very environmental and in made you feel you were back in the s especially with the radio announcer in the background
i recommend this game for everyone
it is creepy but not to the point where your kids cant watch you play
only a couple of scenes really gave me a cause to pause and feel sad for the victims
well done on an emotionally charged game
i look forward to another from this companysystem on which this was tried out pentium iii  mhz nvidia tnt  pro  mb ram win with a monitor with  x  resolution
designed for winwhen amber journeys beyond is run it automatically runs its opening credits and startnewgame routine if you want to reload a saved game youll have to invoke the menu yourself
you can also save different states of the same game though you really dont need to  youll never get stuck in any unwinnable positions
the effect establishes the atmosphere nicely for a new game though  the opening shot is of a friends email message to your character complete with modem sound effects with voiceover to keep you from thinking the game actually did dial out
a mutual friend roxy dr roxanne westbridge runs a small company biopsi technologies thats developing a technology for tracking paranormal activity
while joe hasnt been able to say much about their new product line lets just say that the latest stuff goes beyond tracking
way beyond
roxy has always intended to run tests herself and she bought an old supposedly haunted house in the carolinas that can double as a lab  although its pretty isolated has a subpar electrical system and she only has early prototypes out there
nice touch naturally roxy is also reviewing draft documentation for the prototypes and keeps records of her own work although youll have to search for it
joes message dissolves into your viewpoint driving through a rainy afternoon through evening to roxys house  only to have a car accident dumping the car into the lake in front of her house when a sparkling apparition suddenly drifts into the road
you take over and begin the game by getting to your feet on the dilapidated dock just downhill from roxys placethis first person adventures movement system is mystlike with the addition of an inventory
the viewpoint doesnt take up your entire screen  the inventory is visible because as you search the property for clues to roxys whereabouts and whats going on youll have the opportunity to pick up some of roxys prototypes which will give you more information
for instance roxys got video surveillance through the house tied into a system that detects paranormal activity  if youve got the right gadget itll basically page you when any of the cameras pick up something and youll see the video output on its display
you need to move around a lot searching for clues and this ensures that you wont miss any interesting poltergeist activity while youre in another roomthe bad electrical system at roxys place forms an integral part of the atmosphere and plot  it tends to blackout whenever any interesting experiments requiring a lot of power are being run something very suggestive given that its blacked out when you first arrive
roxy unfortunately rashly ran an experiment with the amber prototype without waiting to install a new part that might have made the experiment safer although any gadget that basically puts a living persons mind into a ghosts world isnt exactly safe to begin withthe player essentially has  scenarios to work through
first the main problem of finding roxy and rescuing her from an experiment gone wrong
second through fourth though is that you must help the ghosts with their issues before you can really help roxy  theyre stuck in their own subjective little worlds because of unfinished business
they dont really realize that theyre dead  theyre suffering from a kind of amnesia and when you reach each ghost you need to locate the clues thatll help them remember what happened so they can move on
their problems can be tackled in any orderthe presentday real world is more creepy than most of the ghosts perspective  plenty of sound effects but no music
the game has music but mostly tied up with the ghosts apparitions and their perspective
imagine searching a haunted house and grounds at night where the lights might go out at the drop of a hat where the only sounds you hear are your own footsteps humming electrical equipment creaking doors and the ghosts activitiestheres some blood  two of the ghosts committed suicide although they dont recognize their own dead bodies  but little gore although their situations are tragic  the third ghost was a child who drowned in an accident
seeing the world from their subjective points of view excuses the peculiar nature of some of the puzzles
one ghost hanged himself  you have to find out why  and he had some odd beliefs including a superstition about bees so from his perspective a stirredup beehives noises sound like words
another ghost a woman who shot herself during wwii is voiceacted by one of the cocreators of the game
very nice atmosphere for the wwii sequences complete with radio broadcasts posters rationing and so on
most of the replayability value would be in looking for details you missed in an earlier session there arent any random factors combination locks never change their codes for instance
however the basic premise couldve been used to create a whole series around biopsi technologies  plenty of material therenote the installer allows you to pick the games directory on disk but not the menu into which the icons will be added
the game requires quicktime and comes with version  but will give you the option of not installing it if youd prefer to experiment with another version
the jewel case includes a leaflet with troubleshooting suggestions the only problem ive run into is that in a couple of sequences where another character is speaking the audio got out of sync with the videoi really enjoyed playing amber
the graphics are good the sound effects are great and the storyline dealing with paranormal research makes the most of what draws me to the adventure genreto have the best experience with this game you really need to be patient and pay more attention to exploring your surroundings rather than just want to get through it
there were several times that i missed necessary items or possibilitites for interaction the first time through a room
but there are no really difficult puzzles so rather than run to a walkthrough if you cant find something its a good idea to just keep looking
everything is pretty much in the open
also there are a number of optional activities that a walkthrough might not tell you about but that it would be a shame to miss
this is one of those games where the rule is pick up everything you can and interact with everything you can
doing so can only heighten your experiencethe first half of the game is truly spooky with numerous close encounters of the ectoplasmic kind and lots of paranormal activity showing up on your equipment
one such encounter actually made my heart stop for a minute even though i was expecting it
another that i wasnt expecting made me afraid to go back to the game for a minute
the atmosphere of weirdness is aided by the sound effects which are used subtly and with great skill
youre always thinking youre about to stumble on something unexpected and sometimes you do
nothing is very grotesque or frightening in and of itself but the atmosphere of suspense makes even the ordinary seem hairraisingthe second half of the game is much quieter
entering the three actual ghost quotworldsquot is almost mundane and somewhat anticlimactic
when things are spooky its more because youre experiencing the reality of a person who is himself creepy than because the actual events are scary
i found this both a disappointment and a relief after the excitement of the initial half of the gameamber is a slide show game in the style of myst but i didnt miss the d presentation or  degree vision of more recent games
navigation was generally pretty easy although there were one or two places where i had a hard time getting to where i wanted to go
one ghost world utilised a special diagonal cursor that was very hard to understand  another featured a view of the world that was pretty distorted in more ways than one
again in these spots patience was necessary
also the screen size is small
setting my monitor to  x  helped some but i at least found i had to do that manually before playing  the game doesnt do it for you as most domy main complaint with amber is that it was too short i finished it in under  hours
you spent a lot of time setting up and very little actually accomplishing anything
also the few real puzzles were very easy
sometimes i felt like i had barely begun to look at them before i accidentally solved them
the ending was also a little abrupt
i wanted moreif you like games with lots of atmosphere you will probably like amber
if you like lots of challenging puzzles you might not
still at under ten bucks its a worthwhile way to spend a rainy afternoon or twothis lizard you are has a filthy mouthhe says a lot of sexual innuendoshe goes through a lot of really cool boards like haunted housesold cartoonsold chop chop movies and loads morehes very funny and has cool movesif there was a award for best use of a tongue in a video gamehed win hands downhed every nomination and trophyhe rulesso i had to actualy loosed the cartridge and clean it out a bit buying a used copy because when i first put the game in it was not working after doing that the game works greatone of the very few nintendo  games that i have actually masteredrampage  is a fun game to playfirstyou get a choice between six different destructive creatures to go from city to city to smashdestroy buildingsvehicles and consume peopleyou get the option of saving the game youre playing right at every five gamesstarts out in denver and you go through what i would guess like about  cities in the usukeuropeasia and australia before hitting area the moon and a couple dozen planets and asteroidsnotethe wolf moves the fastest while running through a city and the rhino seems to be the most ruthlessalsoif you hit the l buttonthe blue button and the z button at the same timeyoull see that each creature puts out their own special fifteen second source of damageonly downside of this game is it may be to easy for somerecommendedi remember my friend and i playing rampage on the n he has it but then we went to rent a game and we rented rampage  so we played it and noticed that there are different monsters now and you have to unlock the original  we couldnt save the game my guess was he didnt have a memory card for his n and it was just like the first game but graphics were better and other stuff i dont remember we played this like  years ago and i was the rat and he was the rhino
around level  we both got game over
in the first rampage for the n there was no game over unless you quit but hey atleast this had bonus levels too
later i got rampage world tour the first one and played it with my friends and i beat it like twice
get the first one insteadthen go for this one because the first will get boring over timerampage  is awesome
its more of the same from the orginal but moooore monsters
i was up all night with this game plus theres a twistyou have to save the monsters from the original in order to earn them
thats pretty friken awesome
the  new memebers of your team are a krab dude a ryno dude and rat name kurtus i think
i dont remember there names because i played this game awhile agothere is also another monsters thats and extra for the game
i think the monsters name is miyakis or something like thatway to go midway
this was a great gamei hope they make another sequal in the future rampage  which takes place in iraq or something like that well that would be mean i guess if they do thatall im saying is they should make another sequal
its bin to longthe sequal to the original is better if not just as good as the originalover all this is an awesome game for any n playerrampage  ruleslaterbecause of the new mortal kombat shaolin monks game coming out i decided to get all my old mk games out to play
among them was mortal kombat mythologies subzero and this lil gem
despite what everyone has had to say about the game special forces isnt that bad a game
i mean if youre any mk fan at all youre going to get this one just to keep up with the mortal kombat mythos
i especially enjoyed the game because it explained alot of the backstory as to how jax and sonya first got into mk
ill admit however why they chose jax to have a starring role in an mk game of his own is beyond me
not that jax is a bad character and fighter in the game hes one of my favorites
its just there are other more beloved characters from the universe that they could have used
when you think about it that could be the reason why people didnt make this a big seller at the time
at any rate i loved the game
for the first time it was a mortal kombat game that took place in an actual d environment
fighting is intense with the basic special and combination movesthe only reason why i gave the game  stars was because of certain control issues it had
they really hindered my enjoyment getting into the game at timesother than that mortal kombat special forces is an awesome game
its a game any respectable mortal kombat fan would and should add to their collectionthe d environment is great
its definately better than mk mythologies
i like the fact that you can use weapons too
the only problem is that sometimes the camera angles are bad making it difficult to see whos shooting at you or where youre going
i hope they include some characters from this game in future mk games like no face tasia and tremorthis is a pretty fun game if youre in the mood just to destroy tuff
there really is nothing to this just destroying buildings
it get boring in a while but its funim gonna start out with this so much violence on gbc its absolutly crazy
i mean that with every fiber of my being
whats that
you dont understand
let me explaingraphics strange as it is the graphics arent up to par with its more than successful big brother mk
the violence i mentioned earlier comes from the full motion video fatalities that mk has to offer
the videos are about  seconds long and return to humble beginings with black and white picturesound same old same old bones cracking people screaming the usual
the game does have some pretty nifty voice acting on the part of the announcergameplay limited movement and a rather quick frame rate wierd blend but it works
fatalities are easy to pull off so dont let me hear i never could pull that one off
in conclusion its a great addition to anyones gbc library and if you dont have it get ittalk about a strange marriage
mortal kombat the medias favorite whipping boy when it comes to showing how violent videogames can get meets the worlds most popular game platform for kids
of course were talking game boy here so dont expect copious levels of gore and violence in the first color handheld incarnation of the arcade fighting hit
lets face it with its merely average fighting system the mortal kombat series owes a great part of its success to the fact that it combined fast action with overthetop violence and buckets of blood
but how does this translate to the game boy
in order to reach a broader handheld audience and receive a teen rating from the esrb midway had developer digital eclipse is there any game these guys arent programming
tone down the gore level to a minimum
gone are the puddles of blood from the arcade and console mk incarnations and were left with barebones quotkombatquot before drab backgrounds with short quotfmvquot fatality sequences that are little payoff for braving the games boring fights
the eight characters that made the cut from the original mks  are recognizable thanks to the large tricolored sprites and the animation isnt bad
but the large sprites have their price and the game just doesnt feel smooth fast and responsive enough to call itself mk
running is easily executed by holding a and b a throws a punch and b triggers the kick while the start button blocks attacks if you can reach it without hurting your thumb
entering key commands to pull off some of the few and rather unspectacular special attacks is simple
three strokes do the job for the special moves and a maximum of four commands on the directional pad unleash each characters fatality on a stunned opponent
in the sound department mk disappoints with annoying quotpercussivequot tracks and weak sound effects but at least the game spits out a few amusing voice samples such as quotfightquot and the ubiquitous quotfatalityquot sadly mk doesnt support linkup gaming which means you can only beat up on the computer
to make thing worse the computer ai in the oneplayer mode is simply laughable and fails to present a serious challenge to any game boy fan
while it may appeal to diehard kombat fans everyone else is best advised to skip this below average pocket fighter
i enjoyed mortal kombat  on the console systems quite a bit but the game boy version just doesnt cut it for me
playing alone with an overly limited set of moves against a dumb computer drone gets old real quick
the inclusion of lots of kombat kodes is nice but its just not enough to energize this lifeless portmk finally comes into the d realm in this game
i only wish there were more characters and i miss the animalities babalities brutalities and friendships
but overall its goodunlike the earlier mk games this one featured some d graphics and it also has weapons which are available to use or throw at anytime
this is not as good as the nintendo  version but its a great fighting game nonetheless and i think its better than any of the mortal kombat games thatve been coming out since  great graphics great controls and a fun practicing mode which you can fight for hours if you want to with the same opponent
but unfortunately after this one the mortal kombat franchise went completely downhillthe only reason i gave this game two stars is because i am an mortal kombat fan but this game sucks
it was way to easy you know i loved mortal kombat trilogy because it was hard as hll and when i beat it i was so happy and said to my self i cant wait till the next game
yet this is just bad you dont even have to learn the peoples moves any more
you just have to take out your weapon and hackem to death it just sucks
then i went and rentid mortal kombatda and i do admit harder then this peice of ht
yet still the weopons are still there and now you can stab them in the gut and leave it there so the person you fight slowly dies
so what im saying is stick with  and trilogy they are way betterthis game is really hard
you could beat the game with kintaro and goro easily
when you battle shao kahn with sindel its really hard
i still like it thoughthis game is very good
it combines the good things of the original mortal kombat with few good things of the later mortal kombats such as mk  mk ultimate
it is worth buying if you still play your playstation or if you are a die hard mk fan and you still want to play it on your ps if you have onebefore there was tekken and soul blade and the rest of the current fighters there was street fighter and mortal kombat
mortal kombat was easily the best in terms of richness of the game
the characters moved  fluidly the voices were understandable and there was blood
the series  progressed nicely with great additions and secrets added every step of the  waythis title is a great nostalgic look back at those times
being  able not only to play any of the characters from the first  games but  also as their different incarnations is huge
when the genesissuper  nintendo became obsolete i feared the loss of these games
but with their  release on playstation especially in this title i am happy
the game  play is great and packed full of surprises
as far as d fighting games  goes this is the best and is better than many first generation d  fighters
if you liked this in the arcade youll like it here
granted  it has the usual translation problems with the buttons in the  wrong places  and more difficulty moving the stick but you get those problems with any  console gamethis game is da bomb
forget about mortal kombat trilogy on the nintendo  the playstation version blows that one away
you get to pick more selectable fighters including goro kintaro motaro shao kahn jax  kung lao from mk  and raiden  kano from mk  plus the sound fx and music are equivelant to the smash arcade hit
and speaking of the incredible soundtrack you can even stick this disc into your cd player and actually listen to music from the game
in other words mkt is both a video game and a music cd
of course this thing is loaded with plenty of blood and violence but that should be a real treat for gore hounds
diehard mk fans will definetly get their moneys worth
the options menu offers you some pretty cool stuff including automatic combos
thats right you can do combos simply by tapping one button
that rocks
the graphics  animation look pretty good for a d game and the controls and gameplay work together nicely
however this game does have its cons
the game only has one cheat menu which kind of scks
the onebuttonfatalities mode messes up sometimes
the game itself freezes sometimes and you have to reset the game
if you have both a ps and a ps avoid playing this game on your ps
instead play it on your ps
this game messes up a lot when played on the ps console
im not sure why but it plays good on the regular ps
all of the stage fatalities are here except for the pit  fatality but i can do without it
the bosses are incredibly hard to beat unless you play as one of the bosses yourself
you can beat shao kahn best with noob saibot by shooting your ring at him and doing combos on him
the bosses dont have fatalities but they sure are tough
the storyline on this game scks and doesnt go into detail like mk did
however each character has their original tournament outcome when you beat the game which is cool
other than that this game is still da bomb
straight  simple
if youre a diehard bloodthirsty mk fan then get this freakin game now
otherwise steer clearthe reason i give this game  stars instead of  is because the slow loading times in beetween fights
if you owe a ps go to ps driver and change the texture to smooth and disc speed to fast
the loading times are reduced by quiet alot
overall this game is great but the morphing of shang tsung can get frustrating because it has to load everytime you morph
this game is great for beginners but if you are a true hardcore mk fan get armageddonthis was a really good mk game at the timeheckit still is goodits got all the characters from mortal kombatultimate mkplus with the fatalitiesfriendshipsbabalitiesectbut there are some problems with this gameit does not include every single background from the first gamelike it does with mk ii and mkumk
its got the courtyardthe pitthe pit bottom and goros dungeonbut where are the rest
i found that to be a major issue for meanother problem i had with itis alot of the backgrounds dont have the music in themfrom the original gamesit seems all kind of shuffled uplastlyanother little issue isyou cannot perform a stage fatality in the pit that was orginally in mk iiwhich imowas the best stage fatality out of the first three gamesincluding umkoh and why is johnny cage all of a sudden fighting with his shades on
but overall thoughif you can overlook the little flawsi guess this is a good gamebut imo in could have been somewhat betterthis game is very nice it was hard and it took me a month to beat it
ok i do admit some of the charecters from  and ultimet suck so i dont pick them
yet i cant help but love it when i do scorpions attacks and defeat kahn
yet number two will always be the best i think unless midway goes back with the old charecters and get some real writers for a better plotfinal doom is an excellent game
i own both ultimate doom  final doom for the playstation and enjoy playing both of them
this game is a lot more exhausting than ultimate doom too
most of the levels are huge extremely mazy and difficult so youd better be a good thinker
thats right each level is a dark scary labyrinth of evil soldiers  monsters so youll need to use your brain if you plan to make it out alive
the whole key to doom is survival and its not going to be easy this time
the graphics are a bit sluggish which is why i give the game  stars instead of  but everything else sound fx music controls gameplay factor is fine
the soundtrack in this game is very disturbing to say the least
it helps create an incredibly eerie atmosphere that few games have ever done
the sound fx are realistic and the gameplay factor is superbdo i recommend final doom for ps
yes i do
so order it now while supplies last or be doomed foreverthe  new  level episodes for doom  should not be bought for the pcwhyyou askfor oneback when it was madeyou had to pay    bucks for only when you could download more than  times that much levels off the internetlike a growing athleteit is time for doom to say goodbye to the spotlight
buy this for ps if you dont have a pcwaiteveryone has a pcfinal doom is really the third doom game so doom  is really doom  anyway this game is great
thirty brand new levels with tons of tricks and surprises
the only drawbacks are that there are some invisible walls which demons can attack you through but entering these walls can be fun
also it seems like you can never pick up a key or open a door without a wall opening up with a dozen monsters behind it ready to attack you
but the gameplay is flawless
i highly recommend this gamei have to admit despite not being a fan of the first person genre i love doom
there is something about the exploits of a lonely space marine singlehandedly taking on the forces of hell that draws me in and refuses to let go
still as enjoyable as doom and doom ii were these games generally dont deliver on the challenge front for a seasoned player
while some may consider that a drawback it was a nonexistent problem to me since challenge isnt the most important thing i look for in a game
however for those that do they can easily up the ante with final doomto some final doom for the playstation will never be anything more than a haphazard potluck
this port doesnt contain every level from the two thirtytwo level pc campaigns nor does it contain every level from the twentyone level master levels expansion
in other words out of pool of eightyfive possible levels only thirty make an appearance here
so how does this affect the experience
the answer depends on which episode ones talking about and which levels made the cutthings start out with the master levels where thirteen of the possible twentyone levels make up the core of final doom
these levels are meant to test ones mettle with relentless enemy attacks and complex level design something they do quite well
players will find a level like vesperas is hard to tackle regardless of what difficulty level their playing on
still the real attraction of the master levels beyond the challenge is the fact the player can carry their status and weaponry from level to level
this isnt possible on the pc since the data for each level is its own file something that was purposely done so each map would be considered its own separate entity by players
final doom on the playstation proves how unnecessary this was since each level still feels like a separate experience even though they follow one anothernext up is tnt evilution the first of the two doom ii followups presented in the pc version of final doom
taken as a whole tnt evilution is an excellent and balanced expansion that just cant make its case with the eleven levels presented here
it could have been better with a better selection of levels but its just better to buy a copy of the doom collectors edition for the pc and play it in its entirety
additionally while i have nothing against the ambient score whipped up for the playstation versions of doom i just dont have patience towards it when reflecting back on the wonderful midibased soundtrack team tnt created for the pc originallast up is plutonia with six levels
cruel as it may sound im absolutely thrilled this episode got the short end of the stick
take the challenge of the master levels throw in every cheap shot and tactic in the book and youve got plutonia in a nutshell
challenge quickly eclipses entertainment when it comes to levels like congo ghost town and onslaught
that said if youre really serious about tackling the hardest levels doom can throw at you id again suggest going the pc route so you can save your progress at will
regardless while the levels are still well designed at this point i have no problem billing plutonia as dooms weakest and ugliest linkthe shortcomings of its experiences aside final doom is a worthy and refreshingly different followup to doom
at its simplest level it may be more of the same but those who immerse themselves in what it has to offer will find it contains a feel all its own
its not always fun and some parts are of more value than others the master levels being the main draw here but those with a little patience will have little problem in adding this to their collectionmortal kombat mythologies subzero is perhaps one of the most underrated games in the mortal kombat lineage
the gameplay is not too far off from mk
the only issue with gameplay is the turn around button
otherwise it plays just like  with platforming
the story is excellent although some cinemas seem a bit campy
the difficulty is a bit ramped up which is annoying but the story is worth the aggravationthis game was ok i mean subzero is my second favorite charecter my first though is scorpion and he is one of the resons i rented this game
it was an ok story but nothing really cool so i guess by it if your favorite charecter is subzero other then that you will just bth about how hard it isi have used rd party controllers for a while now and this one by mad catz is by far the best
though it is large it has a rubberized grip as well as two turbo buttons for fighting games
the range of motion on the toggle isnt as good as the original by sega but there again this is a rd party
i think it feels better because of its size and the feel of the controller as well as the lower priceif youre a fighting game fan and dont need an arcade stick you basically need a pad with six buttons and this is the only good choice
its easy to program and comes preset to most capcom games anyway and the analog stick is much firmer than the sega one also good but unfortunately anybody with small hands will hate this
its really big and the buttons are laid out badly instead of repositioning the original  they stuck on z and c
the dpad is very nice but the buttons dont go down easily
all in all though if you absolutely must have the extra two buttons which you do for most capcom stuff this is the best option next to an arcade stick
otherwise dont bothercontroller works
no oo oo oo o o o o o  o oo  ooooo  o  ooooo o oot too shabbythe only reson i got this controller becuse it was the only ones they got and i dont want to wait to go out of town to get a fist party i dont like how it feels pushing both triggers down and hard to remove the vmu other than that it fine but i worried it will brake in like  to  years timelike my firends the had mad catz controler for play station they said it us mess up after a few weeks with the lights but hoppfuly this will last mush long senic the it has progarm abliy they had to use better parts the psx mad catz controller do not summerised in one intergated chup like the fist parties do if can get a fist party controller get it they last for very time one of those rare cases where a game developer doesnt compromise gameplay in favour of graphics
omega boost gets the best of both worlds
though the degree environment can make you dizzy the addition of the quotface forwardquot button drastically improves ease of controls
and the backgrounds and characters look sharp but remain responsive which makes for a great fastpaced shooterif anything i might have wished there would be a little more diversity in terms of weapons levels missions and some kind of a story
imagine the customizeability of armored core coupled with the furious action and beautiful graphics of this game
however that didnt seem to be the intention of the designers
as an oldfashioned quotbloweverythingupquot shooter omega boost ranks among the best there is to offerin omega boost you control a mech in space with fully rotational dynamics making for fun gameplay
the dpad and buttons make the controls in this game comfortable and a breeze
the opening movie sequence is also classic so take a look at that as it might sell you on how awesome the game isthis game itself is hard as nails and it doesnt save on a ps memory card so keep that in mind
theres two bosses on every level from what i could tell and i couldnt get past the rd level
i returned it because the seller listed it as new and forgot to include the box and artwork leading me to reconsider the purchase
i would buy omega boost again for a decent price because it is fun but ill probably be trying other new games out before i retry this onei first got in to ultima thanks to my dad buying ultima iii exodus for a thennewly bought atari xl back in  remembering this was the s i got hooked on the game rather quickly and in  i was able get ultima iv for the same computer and found it even more challenging
after that i wasnt able to get any more ultimas mainly bacause ultima iv was the final ultima made available on the atari bit and i never was able to get the first two
far more recently in bought the ultima collection cd package and i am not one bit disappointed
its nice they included a player reference card for all the games included so you know the commands how to read runes answers to questions someone might ask you on ultima vi vii the black gate and vii serpent isle and other important tips
my complaint is they forgot to mention the abilities like strength dexterity intelligence wisdom etc
of the humans fuzzies elvies dwarves etc
on ultima iii like the original packaging did
they also included an ultima atlas for all eight of the ultimas although ultima ii would be easiest to find things since it was set right here on earth
there is one drawback and that ultima iii and iv both lack music on this version iii had music for the atari bit iv didnt although music was featured on the commodore c version
ultima iii if you were lucky to own the atari xlxe or the commodore  was the very first ultima to introduce music so its a bit strange to not hear music when you play this pc collection
for those raised on pc games of the s and s many will be turned off by the crude graphics
ultima ii and iii particularly show their age ultima i included here is not the original from  but the  remake from origin in which the graphics were updated to ultima iv standards
but if you grown up in the s like myself the graphics will come as no surprise
ultima i and ii dont take very long to win
in fact on ultima ii it isnt even necessary to explore dungeons or towers to win or even visit every planet although its nice to because there are more towns and castles to explore but there is one planet that is a must to visit in order to win
dungeons on ultima i however are crucial to winning the game especially if a king from a certain castle tells you to kill a certain creature like a liche balron gelatinous cube etc
ultima iii was the first to include a multiplayer party system up to four players plus a maximum hit point system where you need to go to a healer to heal and a separate battle scene
ultima iv featured better graphics because you dont get cyan and magenta vegetation and water and this was the very first ultima you dont kill an evil ruler like mondain minax or exodus to win
ultima vvii continue to use the same britannia with each of the series becoming more realistic v introducing the day and night cycle for example and vi and onward featuring more bit super nes style graphics
ultima viii had been the most reviled of the series many named it quotsuper avatar brothersquot because of needing to hop over platforms to go places
to me the game isnt bad and the graphics are stunning for  standards
ultima viii was the first ultima since ii to feature only a single player
there are drawbacks to this collection
you must run any ultima after vi through msdos
moslo which is luckily included is needed for all the ultimas except viii and depending on your system even moslo wont work right as it might end up being a bit choppy
ultima ii works best if you download a program to make it more windowsfriendly
akalabeth the  precursor to ultima is also included in this package
luckily they made this program pc and windows friendly no need for moslo here
basically akalabeth is only a historical curiosity there dont seem to be much here except go in dungeons and kill monsters particularly the ones lord british tells you to kill
anyway despite a few drawbacks and if youre feeling a bit nostalgic for your childhood days of playing ultima or if youre an ultima fan with a curiosity about the games history this is the collection to getof all the ways in which ultima is great the stories you will experience are by far the best part of this series
you will go places you had never thought possible
these arent simple hacknslash rpgs or even the somewhat stale highpolish epics of final fantasy
instead these are tales of corruption predjudice redemption and virute
through this series you can watch an entire world and hundreds of people grow and evolve
the individual games are mostly what you would expect  they get richer and deeper as time goes on with a fewer gems in the beginning and a few stinkers at the endi amp ii  musuem pieces
load these up just to see what they were like
hardly any storyiii  the game that taught the japanese everything they know about rpgs
turnbased party combat
a deep and complicated world
if you enjoy playing nethack youll love uiv  the first truly great ultima
garriot abandons pure hacknslash for a quest of virtue and personal excellencev  a story of political corruption and intrigue
not my favorite but not bad
the last black amp white ultimavi  the best story in the series
play this one if any
the world is beginning to reach epic proportions now
the graphics are color but will seem outdated at firstvii  the nd best game in the series behind u
the world is huge and detailed and the plot is wonderful
even the graphics are pretty good and the game uses a mouseinterface  always a plusviib  a bonus for when you finish u and wish for more
same basic engineviii  a mixed bag
parts of this game plain stink
you will get frustrated
the basic plot seems like a rehash of ub
still the graphics are the best in the collection and the story can be good at timesthe only bad thing about this collection  the ultima worlds games were not included
that stinksgreat series
my all time favorite was ultima   with wintendo  as the requirement for the os im thinking of trying to make this work with wine under linux maybe even use transgaming if that failsthen i can make it work with my mythtv mythgames
my kids are in for a surprise with all due respect to the pc version i believe the playstation one version of quake ii is the ultimate version
yes the playstation version has loading times but theyre not that big of a deal
theyre extremely short and hardly an inconvenience
also the rooms were more colorful and it was easier to see what was in front of you in the playstation versionthe pc version misses out on those things but it does make up for that by having better animations from enemies and bosses
but the controls arent as good as the playstation controller either sorry i need a controller for a video game console because thats what ive grown up with
the pc version also has some more rooms to explore so thats nice as welloverall either version is a good purchase but i personally like the playstation version morethis is great and i prefer this to quake  this has great music that goes with the action
the story mode will keep you going for adgesquake  was one of my first pc games and i loved it even after all these years i still play ita littlethe games plot is alright in some specksi really didnt care for the story to be honest with you but the graphics on this game were great for the year it came outthe game play was just off the hook
the game plays like doom but better
the enemy ai was good toonot the best but goodthe best part of the game is of coursethe guns
the guns just plain kick aalso the game is fairl longi enjoyed itthe game is pretty oldprobably  years old now
i doubt you can find this game but if you can get it
this game is not the best game ever made but it will be a solid fun filled game with top notch violenceyea the games pretty violenti havent seen many fps like doom or quake there great gamesif you can find it go out and buy this awesome game
gameplay graphics for its timelength over all out of laterthis game gets my vote as the best nonsega arcade racing game to ever make a home conversion
what do you have
a perfect recreation of an awesome arcade game complete with soul calibur quality graphics sweet controls crystal clear sound and awesome arcade gameplay
of course the best thing about this game is that you wont have to insert any quarters time and again in order to unlock all the awesome hidden vehicles and tracks
it does get hard later on but isnt that what an arcade game is supposed to doperhaps the only real problem with this game is that the interface needed a little more work
if this game let you restart a track from the pause menu instead of backing all the way out to the main menu it would have been perfect
as it is its an awesome awesome arcade conversion that arcade racing fans should definitely not missi was that  year old kid who loathed final fantasy viii when it was originally released for every reason that made it unlike final fantasy vii
i still prefer vii in nearly every regard but recently i purchased viii to play on my ps and psp
ive finally gotten around to playing it thanks to this wonderful recession read im now unemployed and have put nearly  hours into the game in a week and a halfthe story is relatively mundane evil sorceress turns out to not be all that bad but another evil sorceress is actually evil
the foreshadowing phones in all of the supposed twists and turns but thats okay
the characters are fully realized and have depth and emotion but when it comes to battle you really dont need to use any of the females because all of their limit breaks are worthless when compared to squall zell and irvine quistis limit breaks are occasionally usefulthe junction system is wonderfully complex but when you have figured it out in conjunction with triple triad a card minigame then ffviii becomes too easy
seriously
im on disc three and none of my characters are over level  and im not even trying to do a low level game
the battle system discourages leveling up which is in stark contrast to ffvii where i fought tooth and nail to get all of my characters to level  before the end of the first disc for story related reasons i wanted to be a completionist to the nth degree
tangent
back to ffviiinot only does this game discourage leveling up it discourages using magic using guardian forces in battle this game discourages playing it as though it were any other final fantasy
i love itthe short of it  intimidatingly complex junction system gives way to a joyously refined magic and battle system once you get passed the learning curve
the graphics are great for the psx psone for you noobs the story is a little weak the characters are worthwhile and the sheer amount of things to do in the game is great
to all of those usedtobes who formerly hated this game give it another shot it may not be as good as ffvii or xenogears but its definitely a worthwhile adventure
its certainly better than  of the rpgs available for the current generation of consolesup to this ff ive always been able to replay the game several times but for some reason this one didnt really entice me enough to play it again otherwise id give it a 
the game was actually pretty cool but some of the play was too drawn out
i did like the fact that you could attach your magic spells to your weapons and armor especially the armor portion because you could get to the point where you werent affected by any status changes even sudden death
if youve never played this game i say its pretty good if you have some time on your handsthis game is a lot of fun but its got a lot of problems too
the characters can get annoying the gameplay can get repetitive the storyline has a lot of weird momentsits a good game overall but even though i still own a copy im not sure if ill ever take the time to play through it againfinal fantasy viii is by far the most innovative rpg i have played in a long while
so many new idea where to startltp the battle system is active time each character has a meter in battle the meter fills up faster or slower depending on the characters speed when it reaches the top the character can select his action
but heres the catch enemies also attack according to their speed and the meters do not stop while youre selecting what to do  you will get attacked while digging around in the menus
as you can imagine this adds a certain element of excitement to battleseverything depends on your guardian forces which you must properly junction in accordance to the complex junction system
obviously the system would be much more of a joy to learn if not for the fascinatingly confusing manual
luckily there are numerous ingame tutorials that are far more helpfulbasically to understand the system you must replace each instance of the word quotjunctionquot with the word quotassignquot
you must assign a guardian force to each character and then choose the character abilities from the ones that the force offers
pretty much the only command you can have without the gf is quotattackquot
with the help of gf however you have a sprawl of options you can assign specific magics to increase attributes or to give special effects to your attacks you can summon the gf for a great attack
you can refine magic and items etc etc etc
each gf can learn a slew of abilities further expanding your optionsmagic has nothing to do with mp
spells are quotdrawnquot from enemies
you can either draw multiples of spells and store them for future use or you can draw a single spells and cast it immediately
likewise spells can be linked to attributes to reinforce themthere are a few gripes however combat is very easy because you can draw poweful spells ad infinitum or just summon the gf a few times which is free
nevertheless the possibilities make it all worthwhile
also you cant see the maximum hp levels in battle only the current values which makes healing into guesswork
it only takes  exp to go up a level although your foes level up as you do
the submenus can only hold four items per page making quick picks in battle an exercise in frustrationalthough the plot might seem uninteresting at first the small things will eventually win you over you dont just get from place to place as need be  you buy train tickets rent cars command spaceships
each location has a dynamic population
people move from screen to screen walk by you etc
if you approach you can listen in on conversations without interrupting them
the superb graphics reinforce these wonderful qualities as an example the train sabotage scene on the first disk would be a lot worse without the realistic backgrounds rushing past youfinally to the card game this is by far the deepest quotminigamequot in any rpg to date and like its been said before it is better than some separate games
theres a slew of cards of various kinds especially because you can turn any of the numerous monsters into a card with a special command
there are rare cards to be found
as you travel you will wander into locales with different rules
it can seem overwhelming at first and it probably isfinal fantasy viii is a crowning achievement for square especially since the developers had the gut to break free of so many standards like purchasing equipment for example that its scary
the game deserves to be played just because of its great originality if not because of its geniusi loved this game
while its true its not as good as vii that is an unfair comparison as vii was a milestone
now back to viiistory  the story is good passable but not brilliant
certainly not the games strong point but it does have its moments and further expands upon the love story element touched on in vii
the story progression is rather refreshing as it is more character driven than event driven when compared to other games in the series
the personalities of the main characters are fleshed out rather well and you learn what motivates them to do what they do
there are no secret characters to obtain other than by use of a cheat device but this keeps the narative running at a steady clip
though not as endearing a story as some it still provides a decent adventuregameplay  this is where the game really shines
the character customization is deep making full use of the gf guardian forces this games summons and magic systems
the game forgoes the mp system in favor of requiring you to draw or absorb your magic from enemies and draw points which are then stocked in your magic menu like items
 can be stocked for each kind and your magic can be junctioned to your stats for increases in your hp atk etc provided your junctioned gf has that ability availablegfs can be summoned into battle and have their own hp
when a gf is summoned a time bar appears similar to your active time bar that depletes at a speed that is directly tied to your compatabilty with the gf youre summoning
once the bar empties the gf appears and attacks your foe
the higher your compatability the less time it will take for your gf to appear
the compatability can be increased by using your gf in battle or using certain itemssome have complained about the draw system but once you get further into the game and aquire the required abilities you can synthesize almost anything you need from items you pick up along the way from magic and potions to items that enhance your statsthe money system has also changed
instead of earning money in battles you earn a salary based on your seed ranking which you can increase by performing certain action throughout gameplay and by taking the seed ranking tests at balamb gardengraphics  i wont rate this since its a psone game but they are good for their time periodaudio  superb as always
sound effects and sountrack are standard squaresoft qualityi mus tbe bored to bother but i just replayed this and was reminded of how this games plot must have been written by a love starved  year old
still it was fun even if the inherently mysoginistic storyline made me hit my triteness vomit buttonin terms of the overall feel of the game final fantasy viii is about what fans of the series have come to expect
you walk around randomly youre attacked and you do a lot of battling to level up and become more powerfulwithout wanting to ruin any details much of the plot is great
squall is a fun main character mainly because hes such a withdrawn character that he rarely seems to desire to be the center of attention and the leader of everyone even while hes clearly brilliant at it
i did find the romantic subplot to be a bit of a stretch at times but it wasnt too terriblethe only major problem is that special ability system they designed for this installment of final fantasy tends to encourage an awful lot of wandering around killing huge numbers of enemies so there are larger blocks of time than id prefer which are devoted to mindless battles rather than the plot itself
this seems to be a style that squaresoft has moved away from in later games in the seriesstill on the whole i enjoyed itfinal fantasy is a name that many who classify themselves as rpg gamers have come to know and more importantly a name that gaming companies have come to respect
indeed any company who is lucky enough to employ a final fantasy game designer or artist such as kartia the word of fate or the recently released blue dragon of the xbox  is very quick to publicize their acquisition in an attempt to gain the respect of hopeful rpg fans
since final fantasy i was released in an attempt to save squaresoft from impending bankruptcy to final fantasy sevens standard setting release the series has captivated roleplayinggame fans around the worldthe history and success of the series leaves little to be disputed but how can you be certain that these games are for you
after all despite their masterpiece qualities they are after all designed to entertain fans of a certain genre
so the question is in fact not whether these are great games but are they great games for you
there are some simple questions you can ask yourself to find out
do you enjoy fantasy
role playing games rpgs are games following the story and development of a particular characters
in many aspects these are quite like interactive novels and as each novel has a genre so does each rpg
final fantasy though often dabbling in science fiction is primarily based in the world of fantasy for which it was named
though individuals who dislike the idea of any unrealistic story may find themselves looking in the other direction most people who have no problem with fantasy and science fiction may very well come to love this game
do you enjoy reading
final fantasy games  have no character voice acting making them far more the interactive novel then their successors
that isnt to say that action is nonexistent quite the opposite but rather that it is the games story that drives the final fantasy games forward
any game can have sword fights magic and the such but it is the brilliance of squaresoft now squareenix that has not only combined but mastered these two very different aspects
do you enjoy freedom in your game playing
final fantasy though often linear in story always allows for what has quickly become known as sidequests and minigames
it allows you to divert yourself from the main story should you ever find yourself in need of a break or even a more fulfilling gameplay
though it is true that you certainly could play all the way through ignoring any sidequests and minigames but most fans would agree that they add a broader and more fulfilling gaming experience
do you have time
because rpgs focus on story and character development you often find yourself playing for long periods of time always wanting to know what happens next or going around fighting nonessential battles in order to progress your characters attributes usually known as leveling up
for this reason rpgs have become infamous for the amount of time they take up
it would not be reasonable to only play ten minutes than go on to something else
usually a minimum of at least a half an hour to an hour is needed to not only get full enjoyment but also to be able to save your progress
do you enjoy having fun
do you enjoy romance
do you enjoy action
do you enjoy personal triumph
do you enjoy saving the world
if you answered yes to any one of these questions then theres a final fantasy game for you
but why stop there
the beauty of final fantasy is that there is no final fantasy
there will always be another one for you
so go ahead
try the game
you might be surprised how much final fantasy there is in you and how much of you is in final fantasybrandon s johnsona friend had warned me away from this game so for years i hesitated getting it
now i am glad i picked upit definitely has its faults
 too much teen angst
  it is too often unclear as to where you need to go next with an inability to distinguish what is simply scenery and what is a pathway for you to use
also the characters are not equal zell and irvine are nowhere near as good as zell quintis or rinoa
plus you dont get the rush of quotsaving the worldquot that you do with other ff gamesbut it is still a step up from ff
the animation for characters and gfs are far better
not having to use mps and instead drawing magic gives the player more fun with magic
the limit breaks give each character their own flavor
you will definitely feel that youve earned your victory over the final boss with the final fight being neither too easy nor too difficulti love this game
its possibly my favorite ff
yet i have to agree with the other reviewers the plot is terrible
so what is the source of my adoration
quite possibly because this was my first final fantasybut it still isnt as bad as everyone says
its just different
i personally enjoy the junction system and the music is fantastic
i also enjoy the fact that there are many different types of enemies
there are a lot of excellent elements to ffviii that square neglected in its following games the foremost one being that enemies level up along with your party providing more challenge
the summons were done well although they were a little too intristic to your characters
it took me hours of pondering stats and abilities to decide exactly who to junction with what gfs and magicthe biggest thing i see in the plot is wasted potential
squall would have been a great characterif you learned and worked through something terrible that happened in his childhood that caused him to become so miserable
the sorceress edeaultimecia would have been a dreadful enemyif you ever found out just why she wanted to destroy the world
rinoa should have become a sorceress very early on instead of at the end and gained maturity and depth as she struggled to learn and harness her powers
instead the plot came out as quothey were some military college students
now lets save the world from this evil lady
chaaaargequotthe best way to sum up ffviii is a work in progress
it reminds me a lot of a very very early draft of ffx with the same kind of futuristic dark theworldisending kind of plot and many of the same character types squall is kinda like a young auron zell is similar to tidus selphie is rikku
but i still love playing it and i dont know whydespite some weak characters and the confusing gf system which once you learn makes the game a little more fun albeit repetitive this game is good
the story is worthy and the dialogue is well done
and there are some characters i like irvine quistis squall who im half and half on after the first disc he becomes a much better characteranyway just to go over some aspects of the gameprosa game on the playstation that finally has some decent graphics this game looks good and the gf animations are incredible the first few times you watch them really good movie clips the fma is well done and clearly toiled over simple game play long time gamers and new gamers can get into it dream sequences add to the story very original and a lot of fun about as mature as its predecessor game its look adds to the feelingconsboring intro the first  hours will have you sleeping character development is a tad slow in the first disc you seem to get stuck even more than in ffvii its a game you have to keep working to beatthe story follows squall zell and selphie three characters who just graduated the seed program at balamb garden quistis trepe an instructor at balamb and irvine a sharp shooter who cant stop hitting on girls in their quest against the evil sorceress edea and seifer who graduated the seed program and turned against gardenall in all this game is a lot of fun its not as good as ffvii which i believe is the best final fantasy since the first on the nes which is a classic that everybody should get in some capacity
definitely get this game but ffvii should be first on your prioritiesi was really excited when i picked this game up at a local animevideo game retailer
i had been waiting to try this game out since i heard it was great in almost every category rpgs try to fulfill
after a couple of days of gameplay i was both blown away and a little disappointedfirst the quotblown awayquot part
the graphics are simply breathtaking
i particularly took special notice to the dance scene between rinoa and squall
also i certainly loved the opening to the game
however me and my friends started to mock it for its long long intro believe me if you want to restart your game be prepared to be patient
the designs are very lovely the the beginning confused me i didnt know she could change flower petals into feathers
during the quotepic battlequot sequences the graphics are also very good
but during regular gameplay it starts lacking just a bitthe story was excellent and i thought it was very involving
though bits and pieces resulted in a headache i enjoyed watching the characters
rinoa is my favorite but squall comes to a close second
i have this thing against his scar shuddernow to the disappointing part
well i was starting to get bored after i got stuck in one part
the battles grew pretty tiresome and i felt like i was playing a pokemon game
everywhere i went there was a goofy looking monster to battledont get me wrong with this review
i absolutely enjoyed playing final fantasy viii
all this review is showing you is the highlights and some of the downfalls
if you are an avid rpg player with little or a lot of background ff will definitely impress
but if youre a wandering video gamer with no clue as to what this game was when you look at a shelf dont bother picking it updoesnt really live up to its hype but it is definantly worth a buy
the story is great just as any other final fantasy game
one good thing about this game is that the characters seem to be deeper and more emotionbased
the graphics are acceptable and the soundtrack is another hit
the world is beautiful and actually fun to explore
the bad side of exploring the world is that there are too many random battles but there needs to be because leveling up on this game is difficult
the most dreadful part about this game is the battle system
drawing magic from enemies can get very annoying and tedious
this is a good rpg and an overall wonderful game
i recommend iti finished playing through this game my senior year of high school after having abandoned it in th grade
i can safely say that despite some rather large flaws its a game worth playingthe goodthis game is huge
huge on a scale you cant imagine
the story is pretty deep and epic with some nifty twists and turns
theres plenty of story great music although by no means the series best and pretty graphics to keep your interest if you can deal withthe badthis game has a few damning flaws that keep it out of the better ranks among final fantasy games
one of these is its battle system and by extension the horrid junction system
sure its complex on a level comparable to playing d  d but is it fun
no it in fact is not fun to spend endless hours in menus equipping various magics to various attributes magic you have to draw one or two spells at a time out of your enemies
the junction system makes your traditional levelingup pretty much useless
your characters can be at level  and it does you no better off than being at level  unless everything is junctioned rightalso upgrading your weapons does not increase battle power it merely changes your limit breaks
i wasnt sure whether i liked this or not but at least squalls lion heart weapon had a groovy lightsaber glowanother problem summons last around as long as it takes the average person to slowcook a turkey so youd best have a book ready after the first two or three times you watch themthe card game is more or less a waste of time id rather have things like viis snowboarding and motorcycle minigames
unlike either of those it is neither fun nor easy to get into
if you want to commit even more time to this game then by all means master the card game
dont say i didnt warn you thoughmore goodtheres plenty to discover in this game and perseverance and inquisition are wellrewarded with nifty little tidbits of character history and cool bonuses
the real reward of this game for me though was the final area of ultimecias castle the music and graphics just come together so perfectly that it makes it all seem worthwhile and your victory is also well rewarded with a lengthy fmvby all means play this game
its worth it for the story
just dont expect to play it more than oncefinal fantasy  is a really great game in a lot of ways
in terms of story and character development it can scarce be beat
however its gameplay mechanics while fun and interesting for the first  or so hour get old and stale toward the end of the game
battles become tedious and they just start to take way to longso a great game but not without its flawsdont let the title mislead you
this is an awesome game
the plot is amazingly creative the characters moves and spells are cool and the addition of powerful allies known as guardian forces that you can use in battle are a nice touch
however the magic system is a little confusing and impractical
you can drastically increase your stats and build up immunities to bad status effects by junctioning the spells in your inventory to that statistic or immunity
the problem is this
in order for it to have an effect of any kind you need a tremendous number of spells
rather than learning spells however you have to draw them from multiple draw points along the map or steal them from enemies
also rather than use magic you can summon massive beasts to kick some a for you
the problem with this is that you will begin to rely on these things too much as using them costs you nothing no mp no hp you just get to do massive damage for free and then when you hit points in the game when they become unusable your other skills are horribly underdeveloped
once you get past this though the game is an absolute blast but vii is still the king of all gamesafter the very popular final fantasy vii this game was definately looked forward to by rpg games all over
final fantasy viii brings together a great cast of characters a great storyplot and some of the best graphics on a playstation game
while the magic system is a little different in this game compared to the original final fantasy and even final fantasy vii with the materia
final fantasy viii will definately keep you hooked on the game until you are finishedyou find yourself actually caring about the characters
when something dramatic happens in the plot you will either cheer or moarn with the characters on the screen
squall is possibly one of the best heros in a final fantasy game
he is a troubled youth who doesnt exactly know what he can do to help
as the story progresses squall with the help of his friends learns to express his feelings and evenfalls in loveas i mentioned before the magic in this game is a little tougher than the previous games but it doesnt take away from the fun of it
this game is definately fun and exciting with a wide cast of characters all with a wonderful list of weapons and attributes it will definately prove to be a fun gaming experiencethe unlikely group of heros must face an evil that is much more that it seems
the gameplay is smooth dragging you along with it until the credits begin
and after you beat the game the ending will not disapoint you
the final cinema is about  minutes long and is one of the best endings to a game that i personally have ever seen
if you are a fan of rpgs and most of all final fantasy this game is a mustyes it is a good game
but admittedly square didnt do as good as they could have
junctioning tends to be very tedious far outclassed by ffs materia
the story is somewhat lacking the characters are just very dullon the upside it is still a good game with great graphics and some incredibly cool moments
id give it  if i could but i guess  will have to doany diehard final fantasy player would have to give each game some credit
personally i think this one had its flaws and its amazing moments
better than vii
let the critics decide that
me
here we goprosgreat plot
developed slow but it was worth itgraphics were good for its time and i cant criticize them for that
plus the d at the end was pretty realistic
nothing like kingdom hearts or some other famous current rpgsfunny characters
you cannot tell me that you cannot relate to squalls stubbornness
or zells funny attitude
barret anybody
omega weapon anyonei love how they have optional bosses in this game like vii
if only the other bosses compared to his difficultynow the consbosses way too easy
ultemecia was supposed to wow me with her amazing power
the battle just dragged on
woohoo
ultimate weapon
give me a break
i like how they give optional side quests like that for bosses but bahamut and ultimate weapon were pathetic
i was about level  going into both battles and wiped the floor clean in under  minutes in both
cmon square enix make them omega weapon toughside questsonly worthwhile side quests were the boss ones
the other few were quite boring to try and were either overeasy or just gave stupid prizesoverall i know i give the impression of a  but this game could have been better on the difficulty scale
vii gave me some difficulty and i normally undertrain but this was patheticon the fun scale a  only seems reasonable for its easiness as well
it was a great game and i would definitely play through it again
it was worth the ten dollars i payed in fullafter the tour de force of ffvii viii had some massive shoes to fill
it knew however that it probably was never going to fill such storytelling shoes but i dont think the game was a complete loss either
ive often heard it told that many fans didnt like the story since its a love story as opposed to a story where you have to save the world
granted theres a bunch of sorceresses running around messing things up but it is generally agreed that it takes a bit of a seat in the back compared to the more involved psychological story of an antisocial kid destined for great thingssquall leonhart is our protagonist
our holden caulfield
our kid that wants to make everything better but doesnt want to be at the forefront of the stage
unfortunately his talent quickly pushes him to the front and he is forced to lead his compatriots seed and one young love interest thats part of a rebel alliance to restore freedom to destroy the sorceresses
he is more about questioning the world and his place in it very teenage instead of beating the crap out of the threat to the world
a lot more effort was put into the questions of memory place in the world purpose and love
this although brilliant for character development left little time for us to enjoy or even feel motivated to kick some sorceress butt
for that reason the game gets four starshowever there are still four stars to talk about
the story is well thought out if a bit obscure and sometimes too convenient all orphans really
we feel for the characters and may even feel akin to them and their internal or sometimes external debates
the graphics for the time of good ol  are amazing
a mere two years after ffvii the graphics took some serious leaps and bounds
the gameplay graphics are almost identical but the cg spectacular that you will be graced with was ahead of its time as proven by ffxi
the gameplay is fun and there is plenty to occupy your time
the draw system can be a pain in the ass and then you never want to use magic cause it boosts your stats but summons guardian forces gfs and weapons prove to be more than what you need to not only get through the game but excel at itits no vii but as a separate entity which is often difficult to convince oneself to do it is a decent game
its getting progressively more difficult to find hence the price but if you want to blast away  hours and reminisce on games before the s id recommend this one most definitelythis game is a lot of fun
the story graphics and sound are great but this is to be expected from final fantasy
my only complaint about this game is the combat  random encounters are very frequent and theyre on a turnbased engine
square would do best by incorperating a variant of final fantasy xis or parasite eves combat system into their future rpgsthis game is pretty good
but in my opinion it is not as good as final fantasy vii
ffviis storyline and endurance were much better for me
ill just say this is not the kind of game that you would want to play for like more than two times
but ill have to admit the graphics and movies in ffviii is a lot better than that of ffvii
the characters are much better looking
overall this is a pretty good rpg game
but if youre planning to buy this game and you have already played ffvii you might be disappointed
but if you dont own ffvii already buy them both
i suggest you play viii first though save the best for the end  these are great for the collection of great rpg kicksthis is a great game overall and will keep you busy for awhile the onlt problem with this is 
you get command to heal party completely for  mp
menus design sucks and is bland
no different mode to pick like  hard  very hard  extremely hard for a game thats nearly a decade old this classic rpg stands up to the test of time surprisingly well
originally released for the play station i was luck enough to be able to relive this games fantastic story by playing through it recently thank you backwardscompatible psthough not the best final fantasy game by my standards this title has some features that were new and innovative to the series and the rpg world upon its release
while some of those features seem archaic today replaying final fantasy viii brings me back to a simpler time in video game historyi would recommend this game to any rpg player or anyone who has access to a compatible system and hasnt played it beforeto start this off let me say i seem to be one of the few that enjoy this version as well as the others because it seems that if you like  you cant like  or the other way around
i enjoyed  a lot when i was a kid and still do today and it is the same with this one
the graphics are a great improvment from  to  and anyone can see that
the story is good at times and slow at others and at times feels slow when your playing it but that happens with all games
it still was good enough to keep me intrested
the junctioning system was different and i didnt mind it but it had problems
it was easy to figure out what magic to junction to make my health maxed out and when i got it maxed out i found myself not useing magic through the entire game so it wouldnt bring down my stats
so if always felt like it was missing something since i never used magic through the entire game so this bothered me but not too much
the other thing i had a problem with was the world in wich the game takes place felt empty
most final fantasy games have a lot of areas to explore and visit and this one had a lot of empty space
it didnt effect the storyline but i like to do side quest so it felt like thay coud have added to ithowever i still enjoy this game and still enjoy playing it today so to me it is still a great game maybe not as good as others but still greati loved it until the first disc ended final fantasy  is just too much
the only really lame thing about this game is the whole orphanarium thing and final fantasy  honestly reminds me of laguna beach or some show
lol dirtbag jason  antisocial squall
oh yeah and squall is annoying smexy but sooooo annoying
seifer and rinoa make this game awesome
i love seifer
uhh 
thats alli really enjoyed this game but only after i finally figured out how to use the basics of it
to give you a slight back round this was the second final fantasy i have every played with final fantasy  being the first
many agree it is the most user friendly when it came to setting up magic defense spells and weapons effects
in final fantasy  this is a very long and drawn out process which takes up much of the first quarter of the first game discit does have game play durring this long drudge so hang in theregame play is good seems to have good control as well as smooth graphics but i agree with the editor that the battles are quite frequent and sometimes sinisterfor those who have played the card game in final fantasy  fear not its in here to but in my opinion i feel its not as good infact i couldnt win a single hand
the thing i hated most was almost every town had its own rules and then some towns used rules from many towns at once
to confusing for me but some people i hear really got the hang of itstory line is incredibly intersting and you do feel like you literally have been with them in person
at times you want to ring your hands around the lead character squalls neckthe pay off is great if you can make it past the first  discs the game really does take off even tho you may want to throw it out the window at times final fanatasy viii is a good game with some flaws
fans of final fantasy vii may be dismayed with the many differences between the two gamesstoryline ffs storyline is a great romantic yarn that is the highlight of the game
however the pacing of the story is very uneven which leads to some stretches of boringness
also id say some of the characters are undeveloped as far as their backgrounds go when compared to games like ffmusic the soundtrack is one of uematsus best although he does reuse a few motifs quite a bitbattle system early on ffs battle system is a chore requiring you to spend battles drawing magic from enemies in order to increase the power of your characters
once you get the airship the junction system shifts to the opposite end of the difficulty spectrum allowing you draw a potentially unlimited number of powerful spells that make your party pretty much invincible
for the nd half the game i didnt use magic or summons at all because my characters were superpowered from all of the magic i had summoned
to be fair any ff game can become ridiculously easy if you spend time levelingup your characters
with that said the battles are still pretty fun albeit shortlived even after you spend time drawing magic to increase your partys powerpacing along with the battle system ffs pacing is its biggest problem
instead of throwing you right into the action ala ff ff starts off rather slowly with the main character being a student in school
to be fair there are plenty of exciting sequences in the game but there are also several slow segments which caused me to quit playing this game for long stretchesif you liked other ff games youll probably enjoy ff to some extent
however my brother loved ff and played it for  hours but quit ff after a few hours so who knowsthis was not the best of the series in ff but it didnt fall on its face either
it kept me interested through the game and i have played it more than once
i just wouldnt list it as my favorite thus only  starsi have been a fan of the final fantasy series since it first came to the us for the nes
this episode of final fantasy has amazing graphics for the time and even for some games coming out in this day and age
the story is a decent and straight forward one that has some decent characters
the game is overall a lot of fun with some new ideas in game mechanics
i would recommend this game for anyone that is into scifi and rpgsok so im only on disc  of ff vlll but i can tell you this it is by far one of the better ff games out there
first off lets not get too much into the graphics its a ps  game so that should tell you the graphics are not the best but they could be a lot worse
the story is very suspenceful it constantly keeps you wondering whats gonna happen next how is squall and laguna connected and what evil plan is the sorceress edea going to come up withmagic points used for casting magic is null and void in this game
instead you have a draw system
you draw magic from your enemies which you can either stock away for later use or you can actually use the magic right then
leveling up in this game doesnt mean a thing really seeing how when you level up your enemies level up as well
i kinda like that makes the game more challenging
also you dont earn money after every battle but instead get a steady paycheck at set times throughout the game
the amount depends on what skill level you are on the higher the level the more moneyyou also have what are called guardian forcesgf which you junction to your characters to make them stronger and to learn new abilites
but understanding this at first is a little frustrating also you are constantly switching the junctions around with other characters which that also is irritatingoverall this game so far has been awesome
my only complaint would be what i said earlier about switching the gf junctions around but that is just a small matter with such a wonderful gameits been awhile since ive played this game i dont remember most of the characters name except squall and zell but i still love it and its still a good comeback after  even before it came out i didnt think it would be as good as  and i was right
the graphics of course are a little better but the main thing that i didnt like is that the villan with the blond hair cant remember his namewas nowhere near what sephiroth was not even close
i know i shouldnt compare the two but i cant help it
this is still a good game to have in the collection good storyline and great charactersfinal fantasy  was one of the best games when it was released and still is widly played
it steller graphics was the best one in the series until the release of  and  it brought the rpg gamer to a new world of playing
the junction system was the biggest downfall to the game
certain magic raised attributes higher than others but you could not carry every kind of magic with just one player
having to keep a higgh supply of the magic the increase the attributes of the characters turned out to be a constant pain
the hidden drawpoints hold powerful magic spells that any gamer would need to survive
final fantasy  brought not really the best summon graphics but the best summons to see
seeing odin crush enemies across the plains with his sword was nice to see
eden summon was by far the best
the best part of the summons was the ability to boost them which with eden will get you around  damage done to the enemy
being able to make every characters ultimate weapon was better than having to search them
to level up quickly go to the island of hell with quistis
use her her degenerator to vaporize the toughest of monsters
the card game was a neat minigame to play but doing the card queen quest took a lot of time
the house where you fight all the bosses toward the end of the game can be confusing and deciding what ability to unlock after winning each boss fight can be quite nerve racking at times
fighting omega weapon is a challange of the best of gamers
unless you have squalls lion heart limit break do not even attempt to fight itstoryyou play as squall leonhart who is part of an elite military faction known as seed
seed members work for those who they are contracted to in order to collect funds
squall is attempting to pass his seed exam with careful guidance from his instructor quistis trepe
he meets several other students along the way some of which are zell dincht a lively martial artist and selphie tilmitt a cheerful nunchakuwielding girl
squalls ultimate rival seifer almasy accompanies them on the exam as well
after passing squall is assigned to work with a rebel group whose leader is rinoa heartilly a beautiful and bright young woman
what starts as an average mission turns into a complicated and tangled web of love and deceit as squall begins to question his values and the values of seedbattle systemas with previous final fantasy titles fights are turnbased
random encounters will occur as you walk around the world map
each character on screen will be allowed a move every few seconds including your enemies making for fastpaced and enjoyable battles
during these battles allies can choose from several different options
the basic function is attack which allows you to strike the opponent to inflict damage
another option is magic which enables you to cast either offensive or curative spells
draw is a somewhat unique feature
in final fantasy viii magic spells are not gained through leveling up or any other such process
magic can be drawn from enemies and stocked like items
the number of spells you have will decrease by  with each use
gf is also a useful command
ffviii features gfs or guardian forces which can be summoned at any time in battle
they deal massive usually elemental damage to enemies and carry their own health bars
gfs level up through gaining ap at the end of a battle and new abilities can be attached to your characters through the junctioning of gfs
the allies in your party each have their own unique abilities and weapons that can be upgraded and changed throughout the course of the game
the job system from previous games is virtually nonexistent but each character has their own attributes which make up for the absence of the class system
after battle characters will gain a certain amount of experience that allows them to gain levels
the battle system hasnt been changed enough to be unfamiliar to older players but allows new ff fans to pick the system up easily
after a while battles will become a test of strategy rather than pure strength and even grinding is fairly enjoyable with enough varied optionsgameplayto be honest there isnt much gameplay outside of the constant battles
while squall is wandering around the world map he will be periodically attacked by various monsters making for slow progress while traveling on foot
in towns and dungeons you may move from one area to another simply by reaching the end of the screen
whenever this occurs however the screen must slowly fade out and then in again which may annoy more impatient players
another thing which bothered me while walking around cities was the complete absence of any map screen
i found this irritating to deal with especially when exploring more expansive locales such as deling city
the towns however only serve as rest stops before larger and more epic fights
ffviii is basically a string of encounters laced together with a giant world map to traverse and a rich plot to unravel
there are many vehicles that can be acquired or rented to make your way across said map including cars trains boats and the everpresent airship
as with many other final fantasy titles jumping is nonexistent unless you are so prompted to do so
despite the fact that the world map lacks much in the way of sightseeing it does its job of providing the player with the feeling that they are traveling through a land larger than expected
i dont have any qualms with the controls as they are basically limited to rotating the analog stick and pressing x
as with almost every other final fantasy game there are a number of sidequests to complete as well as a strangely addictive card game by the name of triple triad
there are an amazing amount of regional rules to consider when playing ranging from reasonable to extremely frustrating such as the ridiculous random rule
the gameplay satisfies and the cutscenes are to say the least beautiful
its good oldfashioned rpg excellencevisuals characters and charmthose of you who are used to being spoiled by more recent rpgs such as kingdom hearts or persona  wont find much eye candy here
the cutscenes as mentioned before are obviously impressive but the rest of the game fails to deliver
ingame graphics are decidedly less detailed
as this was squares first adventurous leap into character models that looked realistic im willing to forgive a few of their more obvious flaws
to be honest the characters are justugly
i can find no other word to describe them
from a distance theyre indistinct blobs and when viewed up close they dont appear to have much detail on their clothing or their faces
i can accept this to a certain extent but ive noticed that the backgrounds themselves are usually much more appealing than squall himself
the settings appear to be well designed and the environments are interesting
yet theres something distinctly wrong with piloting a mass of pixels around landscapes which quite frankly make me feel as though they deserve something better
on the other hand character dialogue is wellwritten and there is significant development of squalls personality throughout the game as well as changes in character relationshipsoverallill admit i have a soft spot for final fantasy viii since it happened to be the first one of the series ive picked up
since then ive played a multitude of rpgs each with their own merits and flaws
but when all is said and done the simplicity and familiarity of ffviii gets me every time
if you enjoy beautiful cutscenes wellcharacterized party members and expansive world maps pick this one upthough this is a true rpg
but the battels are dramaticly exhaustic
and the story gets tiresome
but overlall this is one of the best rpgs ever made
not as good as quotlegend of the dragoonquotin final fantasy  the main character is squall he is perceived as a cold noncaring person
i dont like him that well he is mean to rinoa who is a beautiful woman i dont see who could be someone who looks like her
the only reason this game gets  stars is because the main character is not one of the best of final fantasythe game is about squall who is a member of seed a special force of his garden which is kind of like a school
he is instructed to a mission in timber with the help of  other seed members zell and selphie two of my favorite characters
soon they all are thrown into a mission to assassinate a sorceress and then it turns into much more
but thats what final fantasy games are all abouti love this game and i have played it many times im now in the middle of ff and i love it all the same
pretty soon ill write a review for that toothis game was quite a bit different from others in the series
it was released only about two years after the previous version of ff but was released on the same game system  playstation one
when it first came out most of the lovers of the previous version were pretty angry at the new battle system that was different
while the story was a bit different than the previous one with the main character squall a brunettehaired inamorato who was constantly battling with seifer and suffered a scar on his face from a battle at the beginning it still had a long quest and when they werent battling there was a lot of dialogue drama romance trade card game playing leveling up and plenty of monsters to seeive played other games from ff on snes ps ps and this game differs by video music the soundtrack was great graphics bit instead of bit or bit and length four disks of cdrom rather than a cartridge or dvdthere is a sort of confusing conversion from ff
it was on the snes as ff but released in japan as ff yes they typically translate the gamesi personally preferred this game because i was a teen when it came out  most of the characters were teens but there were also some adults in the game but i dont remember seeing many childrenill preface by saying that im a huge fan of rpgs and of the final fantasy series
turnbased action japanese or western oriented rpgs  it makes no difference to me
a good game is a good game and i always try to completely experience a game before rendering judgment
that said i first purchased final fantasy viii shortly after it was released in  however for various reasons i never finished the game
only recently did i decide to pick the game back up and finish what i had started so many years agofor a game that is over ten years old the graphics in final fantasy still impress
though ill admit that graphics arent really a top priority to me
typical for a ps era game ffviii uses prerendered backgrounds with polygonal character models
the backgrounds look mostly great though the character models definitely show the games age
still the models are a huge improvement over those used in ffvii
square has always been known for their great cg movie sequences and ffviii displays the developers masterful competence at creating short but moving cg sequences
throughout the disc adventure youll be treated to a wide variety of jawdropping cg sequences that help move the story alonggameplay is final fantasys breadnbutter
ffviii features an incredibly deep and customizable system that i only now realize was far ahead of its time
characters dont gain the ability to use magic in the traditional levelgrinding ways
instead characters draw magic from enemies
in other words as you battle enemies you can siphon magic from the enemies own reserve
theres no limit on the amount of magic you can siphon from one enemy however generally speaking the stronger the magic the less you can draw
there is a lot more to the system including your character levels which directly impact the level of enemies and thus the magic theyre carryingthe popular summons make a return though in altered form
in ffviii summons are called guardian forces or gfs for short
the great thing about the gfs is that each must be defeated in battle before gaining the ability to use them
its a fantastic design decision by square that lends to a sense of accomplishment
gfs in ffviii are similar to party members in that they have levels and experience points and can take damage in battle
each gf also has a list of abilities that can be learned by earning ap ability points in battle
the abilities include things like upgraded hp or increased attack power to very specific abilities that can be utilized by your characterseach gf is attached to a character via the junction system
this system provides a deep customization mechanic where you can not only junction a gf but also specific magic to each character trait
for example a powerful spell like ultima could be junctioned to a characters hp thus rendering a large hp bonus
or that same magic attached to a characters strength for added physical damage to attacks
status effect magic  bio sleep confuse etc
 can be junctioned as well to a characters attack or defense rendering the ability to inflict status effects by attacking or gaining increased defense against those same attacks
like i said its a very deep systema memorable musical score is present in ffviii and while its not my favorite soundtrack the music is always fitting for the particular event ingame
as far as sidequests and extras go ffviii is bursting at the seams
there is a fullfledged cardbattle minigame called triple triad that could have probably been released as a standalone title
there are plenty of optional gfs to collect including the most powerful gf of all  eden
there are chocobo minigames and many other final fantasy staples too
there is even an optional weapon battle for those familiar with the battle against ruby  emerald weapons in ffvii
this time around the challenge has been turned all the way up for omega weaponall that said there is a lot to like about ffviii
but there are a few areas where i felt the game was lacking
mainly i feel that the story is somewhat disjointed
not wanting to spoil anything here ill keep out a lot of the details
but the basic story pits you as a seed  a sort of elite mercenary group created for the purpose of quelling the powerful sorceresses that influence the land
it sounds great but i feel that square never really delivered in making my party of teenagers a believable band of elite mercs
the basic motivation is there but its presented in an awkward way
often characters make the strangest decisions or say the goofiest things that can probably be attributed to some cultural differences between japanese and american cultures
i think this game could have used some additional polish and time in localization
the ending in the game is just outright poor in my opinionmy last complaint is a bit more minor but still valid
whereas past final fantasy titles felt like actual livable worlds with lots to see and explore ffviiis world is a bit more sterile
most of the landscape is barren with little of interest
for the majority of the game there are only a few sporadic populated areas
it almost feels like the game is based on an almost extinct planet
its a strange feeling that i couldnt shake the entire time i played the gameill stop short of comparing the game directly to other final fantasy titles
i firmly believe that this is a quality game and worth experiencing to any fan of the series or rpgsi had high expectations for this game
graphics story general presentation  it all falls shortthe cinematics are excellent
the first one really got me pumped
i was convinced that i would be playing a game onpar with final fantasy  shortly before disc  ended though i was having trouble caring
caring about the characters caring about the story caring if i finished the gameill attempt to play this game again sometime this year
admittedly i am more mature now than i was during my first attempt
maybe the change in outlook will brighten my perception of this gamefinal fantasy viii is one of my favorite video games
the characters are so life like and so are the monsters
you can turn your enemies into collectors cards wich is a unique and interesting feature in this game
it takes some getting used to at first but then it is a rewarding and challenging game once you into it
i got stuck at a pretty much advanced stage in the gameas where i could not solve a certain challenging event
i waited for my son to come visit to help me solve that particular part of the game
when he finally came he had brought me a new video game
i wanted to start the new game first instead of letting him help me with final fantasy viii
in that process the new game was saved over my advanced level of final fantasy viii game
you can imagine how horrible i felt
now i had to start a whole new game
it is exasperating
i hope nobody else makes the same stupid mistake i did
its a tough game to play but also very rewardingi really enjoyed this games storyline fmv sequences and gameplay
but this game had problems too
this game to me is shorter and not quite as good as ffvii
they dont have the cussin as much as they did levelin up is too easy not challenging it makes it seem like there are too many random battles because sqaull walks so damn slow
limit brakes are easy to git if u keep your hp at 
bosses arent challanging at all unless your fightin ultamecia cuz shell chose the  starters and  of the time the odds wont tip in yo favor
the best thing about the game is that the storyline makes me want to find out what happens at the end
id give it a  but the dont have that so i rounded it to   if u a bif fan of ff u wont be disapointed if you liked ffvii and want to see whats next i suggest u shud borrow it or rent it
but its a good game nonthe lessthis game is the black sheep of the franchise
you may love it
you may hate it
one thing is for certain howeverit is better than most of the other final fantasy gameswhen final fantasy vii debuted in  it was hailed as the greatest of great rpgs
when final fantasy viii came around in  it had so much to live up to
so much hype that the bar was set too high even for final fantasy viii to hit
almost ten years later its a little easier to look at final fantasy viii with fondness
in part because that bar it had to reach is no longer there
the hype has settled
we can now look at final fantasy viii for what it is
its a great game to be sure but it still has some problems it has to addressfinal fantasy viii is first and foremost a love story
it takes a moment to get going but when it does about halfway through it turns out to be good
final fantasy viii is about squall a young member who attends the balamb garden academy and is about to undertake a field exam for an elite group called seed
when he finally gets in his first mission to help a resistance group lead by a young woman named rinoa
the adventure eventually leads to an epic good versus evil battle as squall and his allies realize a sorceress is plotting world domination
for the most part the story is good but even now its hard not to notice how it skimps on certain things
squall is a well developed character but final fantasy viii does little to develop its other characters
you come to like squall and understand his angst but youll hardly come to understand the other characters quite as wellfinal fantasy viii also utilizes the atb battle system which has been in place since final fantasy iv
the eighth installment in particular tries to differentiate itself from the rest of the series and succeeds
very well
first theres final fantasy viiis junction system
rather than having the convential level up system this game opts instead to have the enemies raise levels with you
it seems like this will make the game harder but the junction system serves as a balance
first theres drawing spells
in battle characters can draw spells from the enemy
its a tedious task and often gets boring but you can use any spell you have to increase your statistics
but theres more than that
you cant junction spells to your stats unless you junction guardian forces final fantasy viiis summons to a characterjunctioning isnt just a gimmick however
its a necessity to getting through the game as your characters stats wont grow fast enough
different spells also have a different impact on certain stats
more powerful spells will do a better job than their weaker counterparts
you can also junction to increase your defense against status ailments and even increase your elemental defense enough to absorb spellsthe junction system is a great addition but its overly complex
the big problem with it however is that the game never gives you an incentive to use one character over another aside from their limit breaks which are very powerful attacks but only useful if your hp falls into the yellow or you cast a certain spell
battling in final fantasy viii can be fun but the biggest problem is that it never encourages you to take advantage of it
you can draw spells but depleting your stock of spells also depletes the stat its junctioned to
in short if you want to keep most of your stats in tip top shape youll want to refrain from using some of the games more devastating spells as theyll be used to junction
the junction system does work however in letting gamers challenge themselves
you can make the game as hard or as easy as you likethere are also abilities that each gf carries that allow you to learn several abilities
some can give you new commands in battle while others can also help increase your stats by a certain amounttheres quite a bit more to final fantasy viiis gameplay
theres also a card game called triple triad you can play
its a simple game complete with complex rules
its also incredibly addictive
there are a couple of other minigames but where final fantasy viii really succeeds is its unremarkable number of sidequests though most of them become locked on the final disc
theres a ton of optional things to do hereif anything did go against final fantasy viii it would be some of the things at the core of its gameplay
as mentioned earlier drawing is downright boring and long
theres little incentive to use magic and theres not much point to level grinding or any incentive to actually work for abilities either why bother if enemies will level up with you
the biggest problem is actually getting new weapons
in most rpgs weapons are found or bought in item shops or earned as rewards for defeating certain enemies
final fantasy viii does away with all that and makes you scrounge for items to make weapons
at first it seems creative but getting some of the more lucrative weapons becomes very taxing and repetitive
you might find yourself getting into several battles just to get one part for a weapon
its helped a little by letting you change items and cards into tools but some can only be obtained by defeating enemies
getting new weapons and making characters more powerful should be a bit more fun than this
final fantasy viii manages to turn it into a choregraphically however final fantasy viii is a milestone for the playstation
while its environments can be a little grainy its character models are very beautiful and actually very human like
the game doesnt look smooth however and some of the art design doesnt look as good as other final fantasy games past or present
its a visual looker having some incredibly detailed towns and dungeons and even some incredible looking spell effects and limit breaks as well as some top notch fmv sequences but it doesnt always set the mood the way previous installments have
as much as some may not like to hear it final fantasy vii was a greater visual achievement
final fantasy viii is incredible to look at but some of its visuals just look a bit sloppiermusically final fantasy viii sounds good
it doesnt sound quite as good as final fantasy vi or final fantasy x but the tracks that stand out are among the most recognizable in final fantasy history
much of it has the love story soundtrack going for it
theres a lot of slow low key musical numbers
for some gamers this probably wont cut it
especially when compared to the more lively and upbeat soundtracks of the other gamesfinal fantasy viii isnt a bad game but its one that tries so hard to be different from the rest of the series and tries too hard to be better than its predecessor
the truth is when a game gets labeled the greatest of greats its probably better not to try and out do it but to focus on what made it great in the first place and continue in that direction
final fantasy viii is a good game
a great game even but its gameplay issues make quite a dent in the game as a whole
its an amazing experience but with these issues it keeps it from being the best experience it can bei may be really set against ff being remadeas mentioned in my review for it but ff would really benefit from it since they had already significantly progressed graphically from ff to be more realisticperspectivewise and being less legolike than the ff character graphics
of course to do it with voice acting you wouldnt be able to name the characters but so what
i wouldnt care
and having gotten ff earlier this month and played itits been over  years since the last time i noticed similarities like the rebel faction and the trainboat ride with squall zell and seifer in ff and the train ride with zack cloud and sephiroth in ff
and since i brought up that scene in ff this game immortalized for me the phrase chicken wuss though i believe an expletive was to follow the term
a good update from ff is being able to switch equipped items between characters
i found the back and forth between the present and past a bit annoying at times
junctioning magic was interesting except it meant if you used the magic your player stats would go down
the card game would also annoy me i had trouble with the sameplus rules
not saying i didnt like much about the game there was plenty of storylinegrowth for the characters with the exception of zell and selphie and the game was pretty straightforward which i liked nonlinear games give me headaches
was glad to have summoning in this game and the boost feature for them
im giving this game  stars because it loses a star for me by having the squallrinoa romancei dont know why though tidusyuna in ffx didnt bother me but squallrinoa doesfinal fantasy viii in my opinion has always been underrated
a lot of people dont like it because of the junction system others because of the characters or story but i think its one of the better ffs squaresoft has madereleased in  ff viii was the next in a long line of ff games
it had a more futuristic setting than any ff before it and squaresoft was really looking to try something new
you no longer equip new armor or accessories to your characters instead there is something new and different called the quotjunction systemquot you can junction magic and gfs guardian forces the summons in ff viii to your characters which in turn will increase your stats and allow you to summon the gfs which will teach skills
the gfs can level up as wellthis was really the first ff with a love story as the main theme of the game
sure earlier ffs hinted at it but this one took it to the extreme with one of the greatest love stories in any video game
most of the game revolves around squall and rinoa and the story gets better as you go alonggraphics and fmvs are top notch in ff viii too
the characters look very realistic and the fmvs will keep you on the edge of your seat
music isnt the best ff music actually its below average when compared to other ff music but its still pretty goodside quests include the wonderful card game triple triad optional bosses optional gfs the usual chocobo minigame its average in this ff and improving your weapons by refining certain items you win in battle find etc
this ff will take an average of  hours more if you decide to finish everything which includes leveling up everyone to level  which isnt really necessary since enemies level up along with youthis was the first truly different ff and while i do prefer the fantasy setting its nice to see something new
the only reason i gave ff viii  stars instead of five is the fact that the story while it does get better as the game goes along starts getting worse toward the end and pretty confusing
other than that ff viii is a nice addition to the ff series and totally underratedsometimes i feel the urge to play an older game
i dont know its just that today some of the titles require such highend stats and make you wade through more menus that i yearn for the days of old when games were just much more straightforward
in addition theres just not that many singleplayer games in production these days and i remember a time when it was the singleplayer mode that a game was rated by multiplayer being more of a noveltymechwarrior iimercenaries is a reasonable translation of tabletop battletech to computer gaming
i say quotreasonablequot because there are finer nuances that have been altered to make the computer gaming experience more palatable
more on that in a second lets give this game its due
building on the slightly older mechwarrior ii and expansion pack this game gave you the viewpoint of the inner sphere is domains
coincidentally most battletech players ive ever dealt with play is in one form or another and so the first mechwarrior ii while pretty seemed a little odd
no mechwarror game since this one has covered the clan invasion of  and its a crying shame more classic combat scenarios came out of that era than any other hands downyou start out as a mercenary commander your co blown away in the awesome totally battletech inspired intro
over the years you acquire better mechs and weapon systems salvage partially destroyed equipment and even more mechs and spend your money wisely upgrading
you can also hire up to  lance mates although as a battletech purist i really would have liked to have had  a lance being  mechs in number
you can also hire a single aerospace fighter or bomber pilot flying the classic  models stukas lucifers corsairs and more
as the game progresses your stature and fame in the is grows until strange stories come from the periphery of a marauding army of souped up mechs destroying all in thier path
in one of the most memorable game sequences i ever played ever to this day you escape with some periphery pirates common enemies make strange bedfellows eh
and flee in a stolen pegasus light hovercraft to a perfectly taut soundtrackthe cutscenes were wonderful and the game exudes pure battletech
the new mercenaries captures a lot of the dynamics of running an independent mercenary company in the bt universe but just doesnt take it from this era which is a shamethis game good as it is still has some flaws
if you flip through your  manuals youll see most of the mechs are here save for a few notable ones like the rifleman warhammer phoenix hawk and my favorite the hatchetman
my understanding is there is an ongoing licensing problem with some of these designs basically carbon copied from the robotech universe
weapons dont seem to do as much damage but i understand thats a necessary evil of the design
on a tabletop the average life expectancy of some units isnt even a full minute and so while you may expect to obliterate that unwary commando with your ac in one shot its a little dissappointing to see it take up to  your lance members oftentimes dont know where theyre going although admittedly they can hit thier targets
the vaunted aerospace pilot works for only a few missions and then simply ceases to work simply hovering in place over the battlefield regardless of how many times you tell him to attack
and i wont lie there are a number of impossible missions that will have you scouring the web looking for invulnerability cheats the first and foremost on my mind being the set of missions on the ice freighterthis game was so good though the soundtrack was absolutely incredible the graphics for its day were great that i simply cannot give it anything less than   stars
my hats off to fasa activision and hanse davion
miss ya budthis game is alot of fun to play and unlike quotstarfleet academyquot your ship does not move like a fighter and you really do command your ship like it is a large spacecraft
the damage effects are great
you can poke holes in the enemys hull knock out crucial subsystems and blow off warp nacellesthe single player campaign is ok but it is not that rigid
it will allow you to make bad command decisions and still finish the missions
i spend alot of time playing with the quick battle simulator
this is where you can command any ship pick your opponents and choose your battle environment which is really alot of fun
i enjoy luring klingon warships into a planetary ring to watch them bounce off of the rings ice boulders while trying to attack my starshipremember ka is a star trek game so you know its going to have bugs
if you do not install the latest patch the game will freeze during heavy battles
this is bad since the game ai will constantly be playing quotbumper carsquot when it starts to lose a fight
if the enemy ship is smaller than the vessel that you are commanding then this is more annoying than fatalquake  arena needed a solid single player experiancequake  was meant as a multiplayer game and it is sucsessful on that level because that is ultimately what you end up playing when all is said and done
the single player mode is merely ok as it is a warm up for online play but online play is some of the most exciting out there
im talking deathmatch here
you see if you are not good at fps type games you might actually like and enjoy the rush of quake  deathmatch
there is no strategy you just seeklocatedestroy the nearest person
not many games can match the level of intensity in quake  deathmatchthe graphics are indeed quite stunning
id softwares quake  engine is still i think the best out there
other game engines have come close but the quake  engine still is a thing of beautyif your a regular fps fan then by all means get this game
it is a must own for all fps fans
i dont recommend quake  if you are more into teamplay
but if you like deathmatch quake  is the undisputed undefeated kingive played unreal tournament rainbow six quake  arena and halflife
halflife has the best single player game thats not in dispute
unreal tournament has all the eye candy and colored lighting along with nifty weapons
rainbow six has the grave sense of realism one shot one kill
but for all and out motion and complete absence of popup bezier curves and moving action quake  is the archetype for everything that followsunreal tournament is sophomoric with its obnoxious taunts and zero gravity jumps
reminds me of how people used to complain about virtua fighter jumps before they toned it down in   the character models are rigid and identical in size and shape
it simply doesnt have the same freedom in character models
it feels like a shareware game
the multiplayer server is a joke
it takes me about a minute or longer usually about  minutes to get into a game
with quake its click click im inif youve ever been in a multiplayer game of q with  different human players running around like chickens with their heads chopped off you know what the experience is like
granted there is not as much of a variety in weapons as one would like but this is like the classic set that you learnif someone is running around with a machine gun you can pop them a few times with a shotgun to put them down
if someone has a bigger gun then you you can run wait and then grind into them with a gauntlet around the corner
getting the last frag in a tight match is thrilling
jumping off platforms down something like  feet never felt more real
the difference between quake  and unreal tournament is that one obeys the laws of physics and the other loosely follows themsmoother more refined and much more reliable multiplayerthats quake iiii have gotten this game for christmas
the graphics are fantastic however the game itself are played out
for every arenas you passed it seems like your are playing the same identical enemies in the next
just some slight varations on the weapons of choice but the story line are basically the same
if you gamers are into d graphics and sounds this is the game for youthis game has amazing visuals that are some of the best ive ever seen
the only reason i gave this game  stars is because  the single player is so short that you will be done with it in about  hours of playing
the multiplayer is amazing though
i feel that it is even better than uts multiplayer
if you like frags then get this gamebut still one of the best
tho i wouldnt bother buying this now mainly bekause quake  is gonna kome out sooner or later and it looks awesome
i still play this game
konsidering how old this game is u gotta give it some kredit
the graphiks tho now beat by doom and halo etc
are really not bad
the game maintains the klassik evil statanik kastle type maps which in my opinion bring out the fear and the kill or be killed type atmosphere
and the bots
this may be bekause of the way the maps are very konfined but i find the bots in this game much harder to beat kompared to the bots in the ut series
and wahts more u kan sometimes seem to grasp what even sounds like a konversation with some of the bots like crash
this is very unlike singleplayer ut where u never touch the chat button
try it out it kan be funny tho it usually doesnt work
the weapons are simple and easy to use some sekondary fire would be interesting tho
a few weapons needed in my opinion are mines maybe molotov kocktails flamethrowers and the ol nailgun
i kant komment on multiplayer it doesnt seem to work on my komputer but neway i kno that ut has the best online gaming unless kounterstrike is better ive never tried that one
if u dont have this game now i suggest u download the demo its basikally all u need
it has the only map i play singleplayer qdm i think however
another good thing about this game is the fakt that there are so many mods
modifikations tho now i would suggest people to buy ut it has the best mods quake iii has kountless downloadable skins maps etc etc etc
this game is a klassikthis time around id has taken a different approach in developing their latest installment of the quake series
quake  abandons the traditional findthekey and navigatethemaze format and adopts a strictly death match oriented style of play
thats right theres no plot herejust a frantic and messy race to kill or be killed
while the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is solid for the most part it doesnt feel like theres much strategy involved
i often found myself just scrambling around the arenas shooting everything and everyone in sight to stay alive when i expected to be able to strategically place myself for an ambush ect
in addition some of the guns have unbalanced power
the gun you start with an automatic machine gun is extremely weak and is therefore useless against opponents in most cases
unfortunately quake  was meant to be enjoyed online with other players so the one player mode of the game gets stale after a while the ai is cheap and the ending is a joke
still if you have a pc with a d card and love first person shooting games quake  is worth looking intoyou miss you die
this is basically the premise of quake arena
id software shows once again whos king in the fps deathmatch arena
there is basically no replacement no contender for quake arena which sets a new standard for the deathmatch experiencequake  is completely different than the first two quake and doom games
this game is really more multiplayer based although id rather play alone since most people who play it online do nothing but write filthy words and insults instead of playing
but i find myself liking this game better than the new quake  this one happens to contain several very fun mini games like capture the flag team arena must buy expansion from store and team deathmatch in which youre on a team of gladiators all with the same color uniformthe story to this game is basically just that an alien named xaero likes to watch people kill each other so he captures all sorts of gladiators from all over the universe and puts them against each other in combat
the character you start with is sarge and i suspect hes the same sarge from doom  you also get to use ranger who was the character in quake  and also the character from the original doom whos name is doom
basically the characters in this game comprise of soldiers aliens demons and cyborgs all of which come from the other doom or quake games and a few i dont recognize
but i cant figure out why people keep comparing this game to unreal tournament
theyre two totally different games and shouldnt be compared
this is a quake game and ut isnt
but all in all i found this game incredibly fun
ive spent hours just playing through it multiple timesthis game is fun for the intrigue of story and the characters are enjoyable as well
aside from data your primary contact and picard you are a unique sort of vulkan with some special abilities
you interact with npcs like a graphic adventure and explore in detail what the movie didnt show you
though to my memory you do little inter action except with data and picard with no real interest in other npcs and no other star trek crewthough this is always forgivable in such contracts being a difficulty
npcs other than the two mentioned are generic though your play character has an interesting backstory and some unique abilities aside from the vulcan nerve pinch
not to mention as with elite force he has well voiced spoken dialoug writen as good as any not just yes name can i get fries with that order 
whatever like so many role play games and many adventure games which pit you to play nobody in particular in a setting
and though picarddata and your character dialogue is interesting most of this game is not dialogue and it is more about exploration of the underground partaining to the pheonominan that is based on the movie insurrection
it is also difficult to get it to run on modern day ospros    hidden evil has a great story line bringing hints from the television episodes to culmination in the mysterious quotbriar patchquot from the recent star trek movie
i wish the game had contained  even more of these interwoven story elements
the graphics were very  easy on the eyes though not as remarkable as those in prestos previous  game quotjourneyman project legacy of timequot  the cutscenes in  hidden evil were extremely well done
its obvious that great care was  taken to maintain the authenticity of the star trek universe  trek detail  was as good as it gets
i felt i had plenty of interaction with  picard although data dropped out of the game pretty quickly
the  character of ensign sovok was well developed and engaging
the game did a  very professional job of making me feel that through believable twists of  fate the future of the galaxy rested on my shoulders
i found myself  wondering how my favorite trek characters when facing similar challenges  always manage to stay alive and make the right splitsecond decision every  time
i felt drawn into the star trek world to a degree i have never  experienced beforecons    this was my first true action game
although i primarily enjoy myststyle games i had always wondered if i was  missing out on something by not playing action adventures
i managed to  get about halfway through this game before i admitted defeat and used a  cheat code that gave me invulnerability
i thought that this code would  eliminate the combat but instead my character just kept getting shot over  and over while grunting and spewing bits of impact debris all over the  place
and i still needed to shoot other characters in order to progress
although using the cheat code helped me get through the game i found that  it did not increase my enjoyment
i guess i just dont like killing  things not even virtual things not even evil virtual things  i  thought that the keyboard interface was by far the most difficult aspect of  the game
although ive used the keyboard in other more traditional  adventure games no other game ive tried demanded anything even close to  the coordination and speed necessary here
sometimes you are running  firing a weapon and trying to access inventory all at the same time  you  really need three hands
and its a good thing i couldnt fall off cliffs  into the abyss  i would have spent so much time restoring my game that i  probably would have quit outright
maybe the designers should have come up  with a crawl mode for people like me
by the time i reached the  quotstealthquot level late in the game i still wasnt good enough with  the keyboard to be able to complete the level
if i hadnt finally  resorted to using one of my sons saved games i probably would have been  stuck there foreverbottom line  hidden evil is more oriented to the  action gamer than to the traditional adventure gamer
if you are not  experienced in using the keyboard as an input device expect to face a  stiff learning curve
however if you are a trek fan and enjoy  arcadeaction challenges this game is well worth your time and moneyrayman is a solid d platformer in the vein of kid chameleon and other sixteenbit era jewels with about a hundred short sublevels divided into five themed worlds
no plot twists here shatter the six cages of captured electoons in every level to confront the master villain and save the great protoon
the colorful witty graphics and the actionpacked absorbing gameplay is where the game really shines
the packaging boasts four separate backgrounds running simultaneously
i havent counted but it seems true
the sprites are large colorful and expressive
what really amazes is the amount of interaction you may find yourself dodging enemy projectiles steering a floating berry and ducking under swinging obstacles all at the same time
not to mention the minigames and the numerous hidden items
rayman is a complete package warranting at least a lookthis has always been one of my favorite games of all time
ever since i was a little kid
di used to own this game for the playstation one when i was younger and i can still remember the levels and how long me and my cousin would spend playing this
the game was pretty awesome for its time and is still pretty neat and something i consider collectible
however as far as gameplay value goes its nothing spectacular in my eyes
the game is difficult as all hell no matter your gaming experience or age and it just gets downright frustrating occasionally
but if youre looking to fill that nostalgic void in your heart look no furtherrayman started off as a little known platform game in the sea of other platform games during the early playstation days and thanks to positive word of mouth it quickly had a cult following
thats a good thing because its sequel was released to the playstation nintendo  pc and dreamcast consoles in  its an awesome sequel and will catch gamers who dont know about rayman by surprise at how good this game israyman  the great escapes find rayman on a quest to free his friends and to stop razorbeard a nasty pirate who takes over raymans world and holds its inhabitants prisoners on his ship
youll play through many levels fighting enemies solving puzzles sliding down slippery slopes flying through the air and swinging around to reach razorbeard and defeat him once and for all
you start off with limited powers but gain more as you collect lums gold hovering balls and destroy iron cell crates which unlocks bonus levels and helps you gain access to later levels
the levels are long and well thought out so youll be spending time here taking your time and getting used to the challenge this game brings
after you finish each level you can save your progress on your memory pack
this game also uses the expansion pack to bump up the resolution and boost the graphicsthe pros this game will keep you busy for awhile as there are over  levels to explore and its challenging as well
the game looks great when you use the expansion pack though it isnt required and the sounds and music keep you in the mood
while the story is pretty basic but funny the cut scenes keep it moving and make you want to find out what happens next
its a fun game overall and youll have no trouble getting used to how to control raymanthe cons well the only real issue this game has is the camera
when youre walking straight down the path the camera shows you everything
but every time you jump on a platformedge or try to find out which direction your enemies are firing at it gets wonky and youll have to center it often
the same goes for the flyingsliding sections as it will face you to an angle where you cant see where you are going
to give you a better idea the camera in super mario  wasnt as problematic
its not a major flaw but be warned that you will have to pay attention to how it works
also its a challenging game because some levels are harder than others so prepare to be stuck in some areas and pace yourself
its a one player game and once you unlock the bonus levels and achieve the  complete rating there is nothing else to doit sucks that ubisoft has yet to make a proper sequel to the rayman series
though he is not as popular as mario and sonic rayman proved that he too can be a worthy mascot and with this game it shows
if you havent played it yet now is your chance as you can find it for a good price
trust me when i say you will get your moneys worth and shows that having an expansion pack comes in handyall i can say is i rarely beat rpgs i normally get bored maybe half way through and stop playing
i dont even known what i really like about this game but somehow it sparked my interest and kept me playing
i believe it was the games reasonable difficulty and funny story linerayman  gets just about everything right it is a game that was created  with a sense of wonder and fun that draws you right inthe dreamcast  does an amazing job of polygon pushing in this game every level is  fabulously rendered
a very interesting technique of pure d art being  place in the game selfstacking mushrooms ghosts and other things  really helps keep the game looking fresh original and not too boxy
in  the first level of the game there is a field of butterflies that you can  run through causing them all to flutter about
the camera angle changes to  help you appreciate the view
very nicethe camera was occasionally  frustrating and once or twice maddening but usually very nonintrusivemy biggest complaint with the game were the occasional levels that had  tracks in them flying on a rocket or skiing in a swamp these levels were  fun but sometimes enraging in their nitpickiness
the game is usually very  generous with waypoints though so it is not too big of a deal
once  youve hit the same pipe sticking out of a wall  times though it starts  to wear on youthe best thing rayman  does is get you engaged with the  world the true aim of this type of game in my mind
you will love rayman  his friends and his world by the end of the gamepick this game up for  the kids pick this up for yourself you will have a great timerayman  is a solid platform game with awesome graphics sounds music and gameplay
while it is not perfect i think it is a much better platform game for dreamcast than the irritating sonic adventure
the plot is decent and unlike sonic adventure and its obnoxiously awful quotadventure modequot you can just get to the next level instead of wandering around aimlessly or watching incredibly bad cut scenes in which nothing happens
when you first play the graphics will mesmerize you
the even run at a silkysmooth  frames per second and the worlds are incredibly coollooking and surreal
whether you are footskiing through swamps or descending into a lava zone the graphics will always catch your eye
the sound is excellent too
all the characters have an amusing babble thats always funny to listen to and the music is top notch especially in the bayou
the gameplay is also fun if a bit linear
it is always fun to explore the big levels and fight enemies with the games easy controlshowever the game isnt perfect
yes it is a bit short as you might have heard already but that isnt what bothered me
the problem is that the levels get less and less fun and interesting toward the end
for example the precipice is just repetitive and there is almost no eye candy
another disappointing level was called quotthe top of the worldquot which was marked by a big tree on the map
i thought i was going to exploring huge heights but after a soso zoom on a chair through the level the rest was just the ugly insides of the pirate hideout
of course you will still have fun with this game
platform fans should definitely check this one outi bought myself a used dreamcast last year and so far rayman  has been one of the best games i have for itfor fans of the playstation version it is a slight disappointment that there arent actual voices for the cutscenes which was something that added to the gamethere are some better things about it though
for one the frames per second is  as oppose to the ps versions   the graphics are very sharp and the animation is very well donethe levels are slightly different than its playstation counterpart and involves more maneuvers and features
also there is an exclusive multiplayer level found only on the dreamcast versionall in all i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who still has a working dreamcast
oh and it only takes up two blocks of memory space on the vmu so memory is not an issue
unless you only have one blocki first played rayman  on the playstation
i loved the game the voice acting most of all
when i bought my dreamcast i bought rayman  for it
i love the dreamcast version even better
the graphics are absolutly fantastic as is the music
the only problem i have with it is that the dreamcast version doesnt have the voice acting
instead it has everybody talking some gibberish language
this was a big let down and its the only thing thats preventing me from giving it  stars
however its not enough to make me suggest not buying it
youll have a pretty tough time getting everything in the game so it will make you come back for more
if youre a fan of adventure games you really should take a look at rayman  dreamcast or playstation
i cant wait untill ubi soft puts rayman  out on gamecubefor benefit of the doubt i gave corkscrew follies  stars because  was too low and there is no   yes corkscrew follies is a decent and pleasing expansion to roller coaster tycoon and offers many new scenarios  and editing capabilities to the original but it seemed slightly rushed and  there were many obvious additions that should have been made but were not
lets hope they end up in the second expansion slated for the summer of  there are a few more roller coasters and gentle rides and a great  expansion of the shops and stalls one can build
however i was a bit let  down with the minimal amount of thrill rides
also though scenery was  expanded and what was added is beautiful it could have gone much much  furthera real nice addition is the ride footprinting and the sound  files for specific rides and the expanded color options
the detail on  sprites and new graphics is incrediblenow the scenariosyes unlike  many expansion this does very well in delivering many more scenarios that  will keep you posted to your screen for hours on end you definitely get  your moneys worth here
however where as the original scenarios were a  tad easy the expansion scenarios are a bit hard at times
you are so  rushed on meeting requirements at times you dont have the time to truly  design the ride you wanted to make but rather forced to using the  prebuilt coasters in any available space you can find
this detracts from  the main function of the gamethe chance to build and experiment your own  steel monstersi received original as a gift
great sound gameplay and fun
then when i installed this on it gameplay wasnt that much enhanced
there no mode where its no worries about guests ratings or objectives until you beat the game
all it really did is add like  new rollercaoster  trill rides  shops and  gentle rides numbers may be off but thats an estimate
and then it added around  new scenarios
so its really a good game but it could have added more themes and attractionsthis is a perfect addition to roller coaster tycoon
with this game roller coaster tycoon and the roller coaster tycoon expansion pack loopy landscapes you should be able to design the ultimate amusement park on your pc
this game will work with windows xp home edition although you might have to run it in windows compatibility modethis is the expansion pack for rollercoaster tycoon
it has new scenareos new rides new scenery and other new features to add to the already cool theme parkswhile the new rides particularly the rollercoasters are much more interesting and fun to work with they dont have enough
when you consider that these are on their own cd you would expect at least twice as many extras on it
there is enough to keep the park looking great but there could have been more
the scenery themes in particular are very limited
i think that they have rushed itnever the less it is still worth gettingthis game has it all plus the original things of the first part of the series roller coaster tycoon
it has many more scenarios that means more places to put the sweetest new rides
it also has a ton of updates  restaurants rides roller coasters
from gentle rides to fast jerky and  thrilling roller coasters
its so addicting youll be wanting to throw it  away
but if you love computer games this is a game for you no matter what  kind of games you like
once you start playing the game grabs you and  doesnt let go
you can buy more land in your parks build your own custom  designs of roller coasters and build the best theme parks you can
its a  great game buy itthis game has been out for over a decade and the mod community has latched on so well that its still a pretty popular combat sim among enthusiasts
the fact that this has happened among a sea of other sims is both impressive and sad at the same time
impressive that its robust enough to allow for postrelease fan development and sad that nothing new has been released like itword of warning before starting  this aint an easy simulator
heck  flying an airplane was never easy in the first place
so dont buy this  game unless you know a think or two about gs stalls and how to avoid  themback to the review i must say that i liked what i saw
man are  some of these things even allowed for public knowledge
i thought they  were classifiedi am currently working on the software component of the  cf of the canadian air force
and a lot of what i saw in this game  matches the real thingthe details of the cockpit are astounding
even  the pilots at my workplace were impressed
everything works as it should  be
every knob every switch was in place
the displays give accurate  outputs
everything looks authentic  well almost everything
i  noticed some stuff that was shall we say quotfudgedquot to avoid  giving classified data
you cant really blame them for  thatgraphically speaking it looks good
it is far from flashy but it  looked quite smooth
try flying into clouds and youll seethe only bad  things about this game are the system requirements and the tutoriali  have a p with  mb ram and a decent video card
when i tried using  the usual  x  resolution with high details the game ran slowly
be  sure you have the computer system to take advantage of the beauty of this  game
i believe you need the extra resolution just to be able to read the  cockpits layout and read the knobs labelsthe tutorial is wayyyy too  thin
in the usaf game you at least had a copilot helping you out during  the training mission
here you are left on your own
hmmm  better be a  quick learnerso for the veteran flight simer this is an excellent  simulatorjanes fa is one of the most challenging and complex military flightsims around these days  rivaling falcon  and flanker  in that respect
here you get to fly the fe the newest version of the hornet distinguished by its larger size and square intakes one that takes the cando capability of older facs and ups everything up a notchthis sim is no midlevel game  certainly nothing like other janes fighters titles atf iaf usnf  and being much closer to the superb but daunting janes f
here you will manage the fes mind boggling array of avionics and weapons
did you think that the multi in multimode radar means that you can scan both air and ground targets
forget it  in counterair alone youll learn about acq trackwhilescan and rws modes and theres probably at least one more
the sensor suite alone requires a tutorial that will keep you occupied long after your dream computer is overtaken by the latest pentium
then theres the opposition i may just be a novice but those migs know how to work in hunterkiller teams and since this is a janes game your enemy will fire at you like youre their only enemy boys
boys
save some sams for china
then theres the games aceinthewhole the fae itself
visually the machines a stunner in every way im talking about its graphical representation i dont think the real plane is all that pretty both inside and out
to match its complex avionics the jet is blessed with an almost completely clickfunctional flight panel
on the outside you can almost smell that sheen of gullgray paint as on falcon  you can customize your jets skins
handling wise the f here reveals the extent of the games hardcore realism if you came of age playing flightsims of easily maneuverable fighter jets keep away janes f is no easy performer
instead lose airspeed and you nimble jet will become as agile as a ups truck with wings
think youre flying straight and level just because your jets nose is right on the horizon
not a chance  in this game youre either about to get holed up by a missile or pancake right into the ground
think you can defeat enemy migs using the old bankingturn
no way youre not safe using that maneuver
youre never safe in this game
this is flight simulation with an accent on flight
and lets not forget that youll spend a fair amount of time on this game learning to grease your wonderplane onto stretch of runway about as long as a football field from a speed of about  knots if you really needed to be reminded that a game about fs will require you to land on aircraft carriers its only one more sign that this is really not for youif f has one realism lapse its one inherited from janes f  theres no training module
you get the expected instant action single missions campaign and multiplayer with which you and your hightech nightmare plane can burn up the sky but nothing beside a few basic combat missions designed to teach you how to fly and fight your plane
were supposed to learn as we go in the single missions on the idea that they are simulations  but why remind us that the whole game is a simulation
they could have had you fly real flights that were designed as training hops like the paper targets in iron eagle or against drone planes or in gunnery missions against towed banners in fs with training skins highvis colors on wing tips
that way there could have been a dynamite training module which would have reinforced the games otherwise winning brand of verisimilitude
its just annoying that janes went to the trouble of crafting a truly deep and detailed flightsim and gave it nothing better to do than blow everything upgraphically the rest of the game is beautiful  especially the flaming effects of missiles and destroyed airplanes
ground terrain is nice but not spectacular while the upper atmosphere looks tantalizingly beautiful
while f fits the same genre of extreme flightsim occupied by flanker and falcon which came out at about the same time opengl graphics accelerator support sets janes game apart from those other ganmes which only really come alive under the older glide system used on dfx graphics cards falcon will fly on my system but not in graphics hardware acceleration  mode
i flew this game on my win xp pentium and eventually overcame winxp compatibility problems xp users will need to find a patch file first
both this and falcon  are worthwhile games  though the other game suffers for its slavish adherence to dfx cards
also falcon has spawned a larger cult following than janes fa which means much more meaningful rd party files on the internet
still the thrill of naval aviation and opengl are enough to keep this reviewers attention
i dont recommend you buy both programs youll have your hands full trying to master one of them only that you see what your graphics accelerator is and choose accordingly
for owners of geforce or other cards using opengl the choice is clear  janes faalthough it may not be the most innovative or the most expansive game on the market age of wonders captivates the hearts of gamers withits solid triedandtrue gameplay
even if the game borrows details from several  others it just improves so much on the gameplay that its hard not smile
while the game lacks any randomness it captures the oldschool feeling of  true feudalism
the color palette is fantastic and i was surprised at the  superior quality of the music  excellent to say the least
the units are  wellbalanced and despite the low number of different unit types the game  allows for a fascinating amount of strategy unlike the other games which  mainly specialize in getting as many units items and characters onscreen  as fast as possibleeven if a game doesnt fill your screen with  glittering effects or doesnt offer you fifteen billion different  customizable units doesnt exactly mean that it cannot be excellent
age of  wonders isage of wonders is fun for reasons i dont understand
its likecivilization andlords of magic special edition jewel casecombined
if youre scratching your head right now ill give you a clueimagine you are the wizardpresident of an empire filled with people who can onlylive in a certain element such as desert
your people literally die in any other environment
so what is a wizardpresident to do
how about cast a spell that expands the desert to the edges of your empire
thats right
your desert will literally push its way right up to your competitors snowy watery or greengrassed bordersoverall the gameplay could be improved to allow endless expansion of cities and even more elemental customization of the maps if theyre going to release an age of wonders iii but with the latest created in the pc gaming world an age of wonders iii wouldnt have that much to worry aboutthe bottom line is if youve never watched your element icesnow firelava deathash lifegrass waterswamp spread out from your one city and cover the world then you havent truly lived
age of wonders is everything that civilization is notone thing i forgot to mention is the bonus your units receive from fighting on their element in fact some creatures like the fairydragon are literally invisible on their element whereas others simply gain regenerationfans of ltigtmaster of magicltigt or ltigtheroes of might and magicltigt will fill right at home with this game since it is at its core the former made to look like the latter
while not at all original then this is still a truly enjoyable game
there are plenty of races and units to choose from and the game looks considerably better than the games that influenced it
i thought the storyline was fairly original and enjoyed the fact that it isnt completely linear the choices you make affect which races you can control along the way
the biggest downside to this game is that although there is an interesting campaign as well as standalone scenarios to play there is no random map feature
for each existing map the races you can select from are preset and some of the races arent represented very well
for example if you like playing as highmen youre stuck with playing the same three maps over and over
the game does come with a map editor and you can get some decent maps from fan sites but a random map generator really would have increased the longevity of this game
in summary if youre a fan of turn based strategy games then you should get many enjoyable hours out of this game even if it doesnt really introduce anything new to the genrei like the story behind grand theft auto
its a fun concept to play a game where you carjack and kill people
i sort of keeps you sane by letting you run over them cops in a game so you wont have to do it in real  life
the controls are a little weird because they are based on which way  you are facing instead of the screen
i got comfortable with the controls  pretty fast though
i love the huge cities to explore thats a def plus
i would recommend this game youll like itthis seems more like grand theft auto  much of the gameplay is the same and the missions not much different
the graphics have improved and the sound is better but if you have the original then there isnt much point in buying thisas a standalone game it rocks
the radio channels are hilarious as ever and morbid sense of humor will no doubt appeal to most people
this game does not invoke violence in anyone at all so dont worry
when it was first released the slogan was study this game
with the word study blacked out
i guess this is because there was uproar over the first game
man if they thought that this was violent they would certainly freak bigtime over gtagta is one of the best and most exciting games ive played in a while
its great
it brings the life of a gangster into your hands
you can hijack cars collect the latest weapons do mostly anything a gangster can  do
to tell you the truth its not that much like driver and its in my  opinion twenty times better than driver
even if the graphics arent as  good the gameplay and action are better
the first time i saw this was at  blockbuster and i just looked at the back cover and saw the graphics and  put it back down and rented driver
in this game there isnt a moment to  sit still
its a game where you have to be smart
buy itfor years now ive loved playing the first gta
i hadnt played it for a while and i ended up playing it again recently for the hell of it
the only other gta game id ever played was a demo to gta london that didnt impress me well thanks to someone telling me you can now download this game for free i figured what the hell why notat first i didnt like the vehicles apparently its set sometime in the future but they looked more like the past to me
i wasnt all that impressed untill i blew something up and loved the graphics of the new explosions
the flame thrower looks awsome the machine gun fires more smoothly and the elctr gun and other added goodies are a real treatjust like the original gta i find this game so much more fun when activating cheats for infinite lives and weapons ect if you kill people or jijack cars near cops or kill enough people the cops come after you
if you kill enough cops the swat team join in if you take out swat the special agents come along take out the agents then the streets run red with military everywhere coming at you with guns phasers  tanks
i liked that new feature it was always fun to use a tank in the first gta but there was only one per mission they could only fire on a kill frenzy and once they where gone they where gone where as in this game there is one hidden tank per level but if you get the military after you there is tanks galore its just too bad the other tanks will blow you to smitherines when your in one so get out just before it blows
the invincibilitygod mode cheat works well but only on foot if youre ina vehiclekaboomeverything else is pretty much the same as the original game do missions blow things up run from this and that take out him and her steal one of those and take it to whateveri may not like the vehicles they used for this game but the good thing about the pc version is you can do something about that
you can find various info on the net for sites where you can download new vehicles or make your own and put them into the game now im cruising around in knightrider and the general lee avoiding lambourghini cop cars and it makes the game a lot more enjoyableunless the free version is different the only thing i did miss from the orginal was the end of level movies i know they wernt much but it was at least something for your reward of completing a level
which reminds me there is only  levels in this game but unlike the first gta you only do the  levels once
but there are a whole heap of bonus games to play with this one
just a heap of bonus stages of kill frenzies galorethere are alot of improvements in this and so i still preffer the original gta over this one but its not to say this game isnt as good the only way id say this game was crap would be if they go back and make the original gta game with the graphics of this game with weaopens and bonuses and everything includedit would be nice to see an ultimate gta game where both this game the original and london where all packed into the one game
and i dont mean a ppackage where you can buy all  together or it has  discs of each game i mean add them all into the one game  or more missions start with the original  then the londons then this games and include even more to each game with itanyway this game certinly has brought out my interest to check out the latest gta games like gta  and san andreas ect and as soon as i buy them sometime this week you can check out my review of them sometime soontake resident eviljack its graphics up alotset it in the pastgive it a look like a horror movie and add sudden movmentswhat do you getnocturnenocturne is dmn near perfect because of its kick ass graphics and almost perfect soundnot many games like this come along that are this  goodif you play this game in the darkyoull have the feeling like you are  in the game and you are the strangeryour charecternocturne gets into  youand fastthe effects of its true horror it possess is  unimaginablethese effects actually stay with you long after youve stoped  playingthe only reason i kept this game from a  is the high  requirmentsthey would be p mhx megs of rambasiclly any d card  but a voodooand  gig of hdi would rate this game a  and a half but i will give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a four
overall though i think that this is an excellent game and i am very happy with it
i have high standards for games and i only like about half of what i play and i would say that this game definitely satisfies those high standardsi love what eidos has done with the roleplaying game and firstperson shooter
the idea of making a firstperson sneaker is a reality
this game hits it right on the mark
your character is weak in headtohead combat
it is hard to beat just one guard with your sword and if he summons his friends with a cry for help then you are dead in the water
in thief you must rely upon your wits stealth dexterity and cunning to sneak past or ambush whatever beings stand between you and your loottobeon the pro side this game has a remarkably easytouse interface considering the complexity of the actions that are needed
the user interface in my humble opinion kills about half of the action games out there because you always get killed in combat while you try to figure out which keys to push to defend yourself
this game is not like that at all
you can get used to the keys by the end of the first missionit has wonderful graphics animation sound and music
these stunning combinations wrap you up in the game so that you feel like you are walking around in those dark tunnels and dungeons
when you are sneaking up on a guard about to club him in the head you feel an adrenaline rush as you pray that the guard will not hear your quiet footsteps
like some other recent first person role playing games thief has been so richly designed that every square inch of each d environment has detail
the guard characters in the game are very amusing sometimes and the conversations that you overhear will occasionally make you chucklelast but not least the ai in this game is excellent
guards overhear struggles and help out their comrades in arms
guards who find blood on the ground will become suspicious and start looking for you
how long the guards spend looking for you depends upon how obvious you have made it that you are in the neighborhoodhowever the game is far from perfect
the biggest downer for me has been the games lack of variety and flexibility
the variety of weapons tools and other goodies available is low which makes your character onedimensional
in addition you carry over none of your loot or weapons from mission to mission so your character does not develop like you see in the usual roleplaying game
because of this there is a tinge of repetitiveness in each mission
interaction with nonplayer characters is virtually nil and thus you dont become immersed in the story line
another aspect of this game that i didnt like was the existence of the usual roleplaying cliches like the existence of monsters and the undeadi think that the closest game to thief out there is deus ex
i liked deus ex a lot better than thief
deus ex does a better job if involving your character in the storyline and it has a much greater variety of skills tools and weapons that you can use
in addition it has the allimportant character development aspect that thief lacks
however if you love deus ex you will still enjoy thief and it is worth buyinghalflife was my first computer game
and downloading the expansion packs was the first additional game packs i ever bought with my own moneylots of memories playing in the multiplayer modesin this expansion pack for the original half life entitled opposing force you play as corporal adrian shephard
you and your fellow us marines hazardous environment combat unit division are sent to the black mesa research facility
before you are given your objective however your plane is shot down and you are forced to fight for your life
as you venture throughout black mesa it is revealed to you that your hecu unit was to kill any one within the facility and cover up the incident that had occuredits a first person shooter and its a fun one at that
you acquire many different types of guns like the saw knife shotgun mp rocket launcher wrench grenades  satchels a portable barnicle sniper rifle some sort of alien grenade launcher and many more
each weapon is equalyl satisfying to fire off and the sound effects of each explosion and shot fired is fantastic even by todays standardsyou will be forced to fight a lot of different things through out opposing force
this title pits you against things like black ops soldiers which are the hecus nemeses shock troopers humanoidaliens that shoot electrical charges at you vortigaunts these dogtype things that send out shockwaves these giant walking tadpole sorta monsters that shoot these poison needles at you a gigantic worm appropriately named pit worm and many more
each adversary is fun to fight and youll encounter each one numerous times except the pit worm hes like a minibossin this title you are able to command different groups of hecu soldiers as you progress
each one carries different weapons some can heal you others can get you through locked doors etc
anyway each one is definitley helpful to have when you get into battles
however their ai is just bad youll want them to follow you down a ladder and they will just stand there and do nothing or sometimes even say good bye
oh wellthe ending to this game was disappointing
you disarm this nuclear bomb that the black ops were prepping and as you walk into the elevator to face the last monster you notice the gman rearming the nuke
anyway you fight this huge beasty kill him and somehow wind up on a plane with the gman
he tells you that he has a fascination with people who adapt and survive against incredible odds and has decided to preserve you for future endeavors
from there outside the plane the sky turns into what i imagine is space
the gman takes his leave and keeps you in space away from harm and away from doing harmalso this title has a lot of puzzles in it
im not a fan of puzzles but others may bei highly suggest if you havent played opposing force by now like me then you really need to get this title and play through it
its a lot of fun and certainly challenging
an  out of although significantly shorter with worse weaponpacing a lot less story and a lot of inconsistancy opposing force manages to still satisfy through great gameplay and innovative new aliensno game will ever come close to the unmitigated brilliance that was sierras  release halflife so expecting a mission pack to come even close may have hurt public opinion for this game
not helping matters is the fact that for about the same cost you get a far shorter game
additionally the weapons are all apprehended too quickly and a lot of the plot which dissapears all too quickly meshes with the original gamein op you are adrian shephard a corporal sent in to eliminate all traces of the debacle at black mesa
however shortly before reaching the lz your helicopter is shot down by weird creatures and you are separated from your squadmates
the military has realized its in over its head and pulls back but you are left behind trying to stay alive with other remnant forcesdespite all the negative reasons i have listed above and the anticlimatic seemingly rushed ending this is still a very fun game
it keeps some weapons and adds innovative new ones
it keeps almost all the old aliens and adds brilliant new ones and action sequences that are difficult and entertainingi would reccomend that anyone new to the halflife family purchase and enjoy the original first but this is still a worthy game and highly reccomended to any halflife devoteethis is the first expansion pack for the five star new standard bearer fps half life  the bottom line is this is a great expansion packyou are a marine corporal adrian shepard sent into the black mesa facility after half life s protagonist gordon freeman uh accidentally created a rift in space  time and brought aliens in
everyone talks to you in the game without cut sceneswhen you start the game gordon in half life  is still there and your mission goes from being sent to kill him to fighting for your own survival
you visit portions of the first game yet changed such as you will visit some of the entry tunnel from the first segment of half life  you will visit the dam from the original game
everything changed with new challenges in each
there are plenty of puzzles some are different than the original game and others are more complex
such as instead of having to use a push box once you need to use it x pushing it from room to roomid say those old environments destroyed with new challenges are maybe th of the map content
the new environments feel fresh and they use a lot of lighting to make it look different
it feels fresh because the other universe is starting to be integrated into our own universe through the aliens making it and because black mesa had creature exhibits
there are new textures youll go through vine covered sewers where giant fat aliens have their neststhere are also new gameplay elements that you will be introduced to in an optional training course
the training course is a very nice tutorial that will show you everything new such as ropes to climb and swing on
its a very nice mechanic
the flashlight has been replaced by night vision goggles which are very nice
you also have new squad mates to find in the game that will aide you like the medic who can heal you on command the engineer who will blow torch his way through some doors and your standard commandos
each of these three will fight intelligently and wont just stand around getting shot
they will defend the territory if you command them to stand therethats another thing the enemy and friendly ai is great as always from the game
ai will run from grenades throw their own grenades flank you run from your fire and other things
its very nicethere are a lot of new weapons
i was surprised
you start with new melee weapons a new pistol with an optional laser sight a new sniper rifle that can be quite useful new alien technology if you dont want to hear just skip to the next paragraph such as an electrical gun a cannon that looks like a bfg from doom only more awesome an acid spitting alien and a ceiling grabber yes the enemy that can be used as a hook shotall the old enemies are here too but there are a lot of new enemies too if you dont want it spoiled skip on
 the new enemies seem to be faster and more dangerous
from waist high creatures that run to you to taller electric shooting aliens controlled by ant like parasites giant fat electrical discharging enemies and their offspring the list goes on but youll be surprised at some of the things the expansion comes up withwith a  hour play through the first time i do wish it was a bit longer so they could divvy out the enemies a bit slower
but hey its an expansion pack
the graphics are not improved and they still have bugs like getting stuck in the floor of elevators and lifts but all of that can be overlooked
a lot has been added to make this expansion worth anyones time
great expansion packhalflife opposing force is the expansion pack for half life but not by the creators of the orginal game valve but by another company called gearbox
to install this game you must have the orginal game half life installed on your system
you dont play gorden freeman here you play adrian shephard a  year old marine sent to the black mesa to deal with the aliens and gordon freeman he and his men crash into the black mesa and they are rescued by the scientists now he must fight his way out of the black mesa with the help of other marines but unfortunatly the aliens are not the only ones he needs to deal with the goverment has sent black dressed assasins to kill all the marines he needs to deal with them too you could see gorden freeman too
the level design is good but nothing compared to the superlative halflife level design which has an infinte replay value
while halflife started and ended on a tram opposing force starts and ends on a helicopter with the same endingopposing force is built on the same quake halflife engine almost everything from the main menu is the same as half life there are many new weapons but not any cool weapon like the crossbow even the crowbar is not here
the grenade is looks much smaller here maybe gorden freeman has small hands or maybe adrian has large hands
many new monstors but none like gronarch
many new charecters but i did not like the new security gaurd the one who opens the door to let shephard out in the first level
compared to hl the game is quite short and linear the load times are quite longer and the story is quite unbelivable and some sences are very silly
the puzzles are good but most of them are inspired from the orginal game in one level you need to kill a monstor the same way you kill the tentecles in the hl level quotblast pitquot
i did not like all the silly jokes too no aliens were harmed during the creation of this game gearbox this is supposed to be an expansion pack for half life not quake
just like thief you need to climb ropes too but climbing and swinging ropes is quite badly done and not as easy as thief
opposing force is not an awful game it is a very good game and a must for half life fans but it lacks the great story superb gameplay great puzzles level design superb action and orginality that made half life so great
it does not live up to the expectations it created as the half life expansion packfor the price i expected this to be longer
it was very well done however
good new weapons monsters plot etchl opposing force is everything the original halflife should have been
an fps with a cooler hero cooler weapons and somewhat lessannoying puzzlesthe fact that you can guide other privates into battle not to mention boss them around is a nice addittion although the ai dissapoints a bitin short i liked most of everything about this game from the opening sequence to the laseraim pistol to the infrared vision analogous to that found in alien vs predator to the new abilities the hero boastsvalve has made up for the often boring halflife whose only pro was the custom game option such as this oneworth the investmenthalflifeopposing force takes place as your charecter being adrian sheperdarian is a corporal in the army and is being trained for a missionthat mission leads him back to where gordan freeman wasyet not in the same placesduring the game you once again see the gman that just  appears somwhere and stands there clamly atchingthen walks  awayhalflifeopposing force goes to the places gordan wasntyou do not  fight on xen anymorebutyou stay back on earth and experiance what happend  while gordan was goneas the coporalyou command a squad of soldiersbut  you dont just start off with themyou have to find your friends for no  apperant reasonand the so called quotimproved aiquot i found  nowhereduring one point in the game you ahve a medic and and enginerthe  enginer opens a door and there is a drone gun waitingsuddenly he runs  straight for the drone gun without shooting or anything yelling quotwere  gonna kick your assquotat that point he falls down dead because he has  just been pumped full of leadenemy ai isnt better at allwhen you dieand  die againand again and again you begin to notice patterns in every move  the enemy takesi got his game for christmasand beat it the same day in   hours using the meduim difficulty modethat is how short the game  ishalflifeoppossing force isnt a dissapointment thoughits a very good  game that should satisfy anyone that like halflifethe first and main halflife game when i first played it i really enjoyed it then i got opposing force and it was to me a fantastic addition to the halflife mod collectionfinnaly fight along side soldiers and as one the marines that gave you trouble in the first game you are now one of them
opposing force is packed with new weapons and aliens plus more advanced marines than the last halflife use engineers to cut through sealed doors the medic can heal you and your friendly soldiers but only for a limited time besides the point there is one thing that disturbes me about this game like the last one the ending no not the adminstrator gman again
he follows you everywhere then talks to you about sending you to a place and the end
but i would reccomend this to gamers who are halflife fans  and to the ones especcially who like marinesgraphicsnot much changed from the last onesoundnew sounds but not much changedcontrollike the last gameoveralla fun fantastic gamepsmultiplayer rocks just as much in this one as the last main game as welltomb raider the last revelation is a lavishy designed game
the game starts out from  year old lara
the game is based on real places in egypt
the graphics are great
the ai are also more intelligent
after  every stage there is a great movie to watchits like watching the quot  mummy quot 
in the game  lara awakes set and now must savethe world  before the year  many interesting puzzles with one mistake while  solving these puzzles you may have to go to the previous stage to push a  button or somethingthis makes it so frustratingyou will never know  when the levels ends 
and i agree this game is impossible to complete  without a guide or cheat codesbut still the storyline is greatget it  to celebrate the closing of  years first i just have to say that i love this game
love it
the plot is very interesting i think its probably the best one yet
my only complaint is that in most of the levels you need to get certain artifacts that you must have later in the game
it might be a little better if you cant exit the level without it but you can so youll never know that you need that artifact until youre frustrated with yourself three levels later unable to move forward in the game
so save often look everywhere before proceeding and if you dont trust yourself i would suggest getting a walkthrough
at least just to read over and make sure you got everything
despite that as i said its my favorite of the tomb raider series
the quality is wonderful her selection of weapons is great and its extremely addictingpharaoh is very similar to its predecessor caesar  while caesar  is roman style pharaoh is in egypt
just as caesar  pharaoh is the game for fans of any simulation game
as the location of this game is mainly on desert you have to deal with small green area where you can put well on it to distribute the water to your citizens
one source for the food is the ostriches that are located in certain area on your map
therefore building your city needs a good plan to make sure your citizens are not short of food and water
i really like this game and you may too
i was playing this game for months a few years ago and now i miss this game and want to play another mission
dthis game focuses on government
you are required to balance the prosperity health and some other things in your city
make sure that your citizens are employed healthy enough well educated have access to entertainment facilities to keep them happy
you can adjust taxes hold festivals open new trading route and many moreif you have played caesar  youll find that playing this game is very easy
all the controls units and gameplay is very similar to caesar  although pharaoh is not a new game yet it is fun to play
with a few bucks you can get great simulation game that might get you obsessed on itive owned and played this game for a number of years and it still holds up
this is the best of the city builder games ive played
i loved ceasar iii but it was plagued with some annoying bugs
pharoah has solved those bugs
there are still some issues remaining but this is the best even pushing  years laterthe graphics are  only d and compared to the new games it is lacking but it still is visually appealing and lovely to seei can verify that it works on windows at least up to win  bit
i have not tried it on win this game is a nit picker  or perhaps more correctly a game requiring a lot of micromanagement
this leads to both the charm and addiction of the game
if you want to sit down play a  min hr game and be done this isnt it the game requires the establishment of a city environment involving laying out the city foundations establishing the taxes wages providing military protection food finances health water supply etc in other words all those things which will attract and hold your population at an appropriate level of happinessif you live in a rough and ready town on the military frontier you may be near forced labor
in a religious and cultural center you may have scribes and palaces with a population of elites served by the labor of a large population of workers and farmersat the same time you must hold the respect of your countrymen the fear and conquest of foreign and domestic enemies with their eye on your land and goods
this is done by your military accomplishments your charitable contributions to countrymen tributes to the crown etcto the games credit they do provide both military and cultural paths to completing your ascension to pharoah
this allows you to be a great general military or a renowned city builder mostly peaceful and still achive the games goalsyou must carefully manage trade too it is key to the financial success of every city
you have a number of choices of goods production and trade partners so choose carefully and you must please the gods they can be demanding and vengeful or friendly and beneficent depending on how you manage their attitudeson top of all that you often must construct wonders of various sorts preparing the materials sacrifices and labor to build pyramids monuments temples etc according to the success criteria provided by the scenerio you are doing there are a lot of them to allow for extended play
you can also adjust play difficulty over  levels and you can add the cleopatra expansion to give even more options
i recommend the gold editoin as it costeffectively gives you both pharaoh gold  pharaohcleopatra cdsthe major shortcoming of the game which was carried through the sierra linage is the mechanics of accumulation distribution trading and collection of goods
this can be rather artificial and tedious but if you accept the concept you can be philosophical about it and simply accept it as just another challenge all players must solvethe implementation of the storehouses are the key to this you have to learn this as the key to game enjoyment it isnt well explained in the instructions so i suggest a bit of research before you start serious play
it is the weakest part of the game but its workable enough to allow a ton of funthere are several excellent websites free that can help out in many ways and provides a ton of helpful information on all aspects of the game
this gives you a resouce if you feel youve come up against a deadend this is good as the game hasnt been supported by the publisher for many yearsas another reported one can find that you have achieved the goals of the scenerio but havent got the wonder built
the solution to this is the analysis and early planning for labor and material accumulation to coordinate your objestives a lot of pleasure can be had after you see whats required to get everything done by going back over a scenerio and trying to beat your old performance this is easily done via the replay scenerio menu on the gamethe game also allows you to establish several families each establishing the linage of a player to play through the scenerios
this allows several players to play the same game without stepping on the toes of other players
each player can even have different levels of difficulty etcthis game is old and past its support period but there are some enthusiast support sites located by search free which are of great help
this item should be readily available through clearance or junk trays at retailers or via mail
it should be available in the under  price range shipped free
though its far from perfect i heartily recommend it if you can find it at reasonable prices buy it enjoy itas to not repeat too much of what has already been said by other reviewers this is a great game
the thing about this game that is especially addictive is the monument building
what other game can you build pyramids with
that alone is worth picking up this title
this game would have received  stars from me but the fighting parts of this game are cumbersome
the troops move so slowly and heaven help you if you have to move your troops across rivers with the quottransportsquot  still a good game but very addictive so watch out or you will be spending a lot of time in front of your computer which for some of you is your life anyway  bjoseph dworakwhere oh where to begin
i dug caesar iii to the point where it caused me to lose sleep and affect my health
being a huge fan of egyptian history i was salivating for months while impressions developed  pharaohi was not disappointed
the graphics while not your latest  daccelerated zingboom flavor are slick and very nice to look at
the  gameplay is all we remember from the citybuilding series plus a bunch of  new surprises
there are many differences in the way you build a roman  city vs an egyptian city and its refreshing to see that pharaoh goes for  accuracy in the little details
this is a detailoriented game after all
floodplain farming the lack of groundwater in the desert and monument  building are some of the interesting differences between pharaoh and caesar  iii
management of religion is improved somewhat though i still find  myself constructing quottemple rowquot somewhere out of the way just to  make sure all the gods are equally appeasedthe biggest stumbling block  ironically is also pharaohs greatest triumph the accurate and detailed  process it takes to build monuments
you dont just say quotoh i wanna  build a pyramidquot and plunk it down
no first you must build the  infrastructure guilds must cut and lay stone peasants must prepare the  build site and haul stone
carpenters must build ramps etc etc
the  process of building a pyramid is excellent and most fun to watch when  it goes as plannedunfortunately the damn things take forever to build
you may have met all your victory requirements for a given mission four  hours previous but youre stuck waiting for that pyramid to build
sometimes carpenters just dont come build the ramps and your stone  haulers are left stacked up waiting to deposit their loads that stuff gets  heavy after a few months
game lengths aside pharaoh is as fun and  addicting as any strategy game ive played and the citybuilding style is  always a refreshing change from the quotgathergtbuild unitsgtdestroy  enemyquot formula that most rts games employ
in pharaoh if you dont  make your city work or plan or listen to your people youll be one  unhappy city managerthis game rocksthis is probably one of the best strategycity building games ive played in a long long time
the possibilities and the play are seemingly endliness and the addition of the scenario builder makes the game that much more customizable
the challenge of getting areas to develop while keeping the gods and your residents happy along with the rest of the kingdom will test your multitasking abilities
theres very little to complain about with this game and im lookign forward to trying the expansion packdefinitely a great sequel to popular diablo
its very tricky to update the game enough to improve features and functionality and preserve the original theme at the same time
the folks at blizzard north did an excellent job of itplaying the beta the only problem i noticed was that the graphic  rendering was painfully slow
i am hoping that this is endemic to the beta  version
it takes about  minutes for the game to load on a pentium   with mb ram and a mb tnt nvidia video cardotherwise the visual  and audio effects of the game are breathtaking and the game play is very  interesting and more intuitive than the original versioni played diablo  shortly after playing the first game and was immediately impressed by the improvements
note i played diablo  with the expansion lord of destruction installed along with patch  both of which i highly recommend
not only was the expanded choice of characters refreshing but the ways that you could customize the characters with the skill system was a vast improvement over the first gamegameplay very similar to the first gamea lot of mouse usage along with the keyboard for hotkeys
this game is a bit more linear than the first diablo since none of its  quests are randomly selected they are the same each game
however the story is well told through firstrate cutscenes and dialogue with npcs
this game is much bigger than the first and there are four different areas that you adventure in including a desert plains a jungle and of course hell
most fights are resolved quick and nasty however the bosses at the end of each act there are four acts are all good fights
diablo himself is much nastier than he was in the first game
you can hire a npc to travel and fight with you which is a nice feature that adds more excitement to the battles
gameplay is overall quite good for a hackandslay action adventure with a sprinkling of roleplaying elements
there are really just two big problems
first the game places quantity over quality when it comes to encounters with monsters
after you wade through literally hundreds of creatures you will likely only remember the tough ones which infrequently appear and the end bosses
although there are dozens of monster types in the game they all become rather monotonous after you kill  or more of each type
the other problem with the game is the save system and what happens to you when you die
as others have said blizzard made a big blunder by having a gamesave system that does not allow you to save the game where you are
instead when you save you must exit the game
when you play again you start out in the local town
also when you die you are resurrected in the local town but you must go back to the spot where you died in order to claim your equipment from your corpse
and of course more likely than not youll have to fight your murderers to get your stuff back
this system and the music are the only things that are inferior in diablo  as compared to the first gamegraphics good in x resolution which you can only get with the lord of destruction expansion
monsters scenary spell effects and combat all look convincing
it looks as good as the baldurs gate games
the cutscenes are the best ive ever seensound sound effects are generally well done
voice acting is okay although most npcs dont speak with the kind of urgency youd think they should have when facing the end of the world
the music is decent but not as good as the thunderous drums of the first gamereplayvalue if you liked the first diablo youll probably like this one at least as good or better
and for the current price its worth it
it took me about  hours to finish everything with a paladin character
treasure monsters dungeon walls shrines and other things are randomly generated
also the game can be played over the internet which should appeal to online gamers
i personally have no desire to go through it again since none of the quests are random
however the game is designed to encourage repeat play especially since each character class is very different and the game has online capabilityoverall diablo  is a very good game but not a great game in my opinion
it should offer many hours of gameplay and does have replay appeal
dont look for the kind of depth that you would find in fullfledge computer roleplaying games such as baldurs gate or morrowind
diablo is less about acting out a part in a grand story although there is some of this and more about the instant satisfaction that comes with arcadestyle actiondiablo  will probably win an award for most underappreciated game of the  year
its interestin to see so many people bashing a game that if you  actually think about it is exactly what people were expectingthe  original diablo was a fun game in that it was addictive and people who  liked repetetive hack and slash action enjoyed it
however it only held  appeal for a very narrow branch of gamers
the rest of us wanted strategy  and something else to make fighting endless hordes somewhat more  interestingenter diablo   by adding a horde of various skills and  tweaking a lot of code the original diablo battle system returns with a  punch
imagine being a huge barbarian instead of just hacking everything  to pieces you leap  meters into the fray slash a few monsters block  some attacks with your shield leap out again and just for good measure  give a huge shout to scare off any pursuers
you clamber behind a wall and  equip a bow to shoot monsters from between the bars of a jail cell before  they catch up to you again and you decide that this time youre going to  equip  swords and do a huge double slice attack
sounds a lot better  doesnt itthe graphics of this game are also highly under appreciated
everyone seems to think that it looks basically the samebut in reality  the graphics have improved in many many ways
take the lighting effects  for example walk around any pillar in a dungeon and you will see some of  the most beautiful lighting effects ever created
every animation is  smoother more pronounced and easily distinguishablebut enough about  the graphics
even smaller changes to the game system have made it so much  more enjoyable
the concept of quottomesquot  huge collections of  identical scrolls  have freed up inventory space for everyones  characters
as previously mentioned the skills system is huge and allows  for crazy levels of character customizationbut the biggest most  incredible part of this game is the multiplayer
diablo s major fault  was that you could import a character from your single player game and use  it online
in addition a monstrous number of hacks and other programs of  that nature went into circulation so that everyone online had the best of  everythingwhere was the enjoyment
there wasnt any  i stopped playing  diablo online very quickly because of the lack of enjoyment
this time  around blizzard got smart  online characters are stored online and cannot  be modified short of hacking blizzards character database because none of  the character data is stored on your machine
multiplayer has become that  much more fun because of itand last but not least the storyline is  much improved
no more of this quotwe live in one town and walk into the  same dungeon to fight everythingquot
diablo  actually has something of  a storyline and a new quest system that enables you to more clearly see  the benefits of doing favors for the townspeople you encounter
in  addition the world map is huge  and easily travelable due to the added  concept of waypointsto conclude people who are saying this game is a  diablo  clone are obviously not very attentive or are playing both games  without half as much enjoyment as they can offerwhile this doesnt introduce anything groundbreaking over the first diablo it does continue in the same entertaining path
the one drawback is that you have no in game save feature
truly a bummer
the storyline is entertaining
the cinematic cut scenes are what weve come to expect from blizzard
overall the game is a sequel to the original in storyline
it would have been better if blizzard had been able to incorporate some new technology into the game engine or into the graphics
but those drawbacks aside if you enjoyed diablo youll enjoy this one
if you have never seen or played the first one do not feel bad
you will not be completely lost in the storyline and the game play doesnt rely on any previous experienceyour wait is almost over
the beta test is nearly through and everything seems stablebut is diablo as good as all the hype
well pretty muchthe game is visually stunning
detailed landscapes throughout
but  overhead view gets old
a change in game perspective would be  niceall new music in the background with a few familiar elements
the  music is better than in the original diablo but its still there
it gets  tedious but its easily tuned out
the sounds in the game have improved  and are eerily realisticthe most obvious improvement in my opinion is  the clickandhold attack
no more destroying mouse after mouse
simply  click on your target and hold the button down
you will continue to attack  until your target dies or you dothe interface doesnt take much to  get used to as it still resembles the old diablo
it is fairly  intuitivebut you want to know about the characters and monsters dont  youi wont talk about the new monsters youll just have to find out  on your own
but i will say that some are quite easy to take down while  others will take quite a bit of workthe five new character classes  each have their own strengths and weaknesses
the new skill mapping in  diablo  makes you choose master a few a skills or be jack of all trades  master of noneone thing that has always drawn me back to playing diablo  is the ability to create a private game
luckily this is still in the  game and better
now you can have  friends join you in the quest to  destroy evil
you can be antisocial and social at the same timelook  for new perks such as followers and your own private stashive already  preordered my copy
if youre comping at the bit for this title id  suggest you do the samei originally started playing this game so that i could do something with my sons
now i like it
it is def
a very cool game
i am not a hard core gamer and i find it to be challenging but not so hard that i am totally discouragedoverall diablo ii is a very fun immersing game
what it lacks in terms of a story is made up by the fantastic gameplay great sound effects and above average graphicsi believe that if you are going to get the most out of this game you should play it online
not only because of the other people that you can interact with but also because you can level up much faster assuming you have someone to help you through the game
i guess i should first explain how you go about quotbeatingquot this game
the first time you play through the game is known as quotnormalquot difficulty
after you complete this you also have to beat the game in quotnightmarequot and quothellquot difficulties
naturally these are much harder than normal and thus they require your character to be a higher level to have a chance
nevertheless there is a way around this
you can get a high level character to quotrushquot your low level character through the entire game thus avoiding the tedious and time consuming procedure for leveling up
after you are rushed through the three difficulty levels then the best way to level up is to join quotcows gamesquot
basically the designers created a quotsecret levelquot where you well fight bipedal cows with what look like poleaxes
naturally the advantage to doing this is that you level up very quickly as the cows when killed give out enormous numbers of experience points
thus you can turn your low level character into a fairly high level one much quicker than if you went through all the difficulty levels yourself killing everything and gaining experience points the quotrightquot waynaturally nightmare and hell difficulties also have some quototherquot features that make them harder than normal
first in nightmare your resistances drop to   in hell they drop to resistances are just the defense that your character has against the elements
each one is ranked separately so therefore you could have a resistance of  in fire but only  in lightning
at the beginning of the game you have no resistances at all  you have to find armor or other things that give these resistances to you
also you may not raise your resistances above  unless you have items that let you add points to your quotmaximum resistquotspeaking of items they are the most important thing in determining how powerful your character is
ive had characters that would be awesome meaning they had the right skills and stat points but they turned out awfully  because of my lack of good items
therefore trading with other players to get what you want is very important
this is accomplished by one player going up to the other in a town area where no fighting can happen and clicking on them
then it will give them a message asking if they want to trade and if they do then a screen will come up where you can both place items in
when youre done putting your stuff down then you press the little check mark accept button and when you both press it the trade will go through
this system is great since there is no way someone can cheat you out of something unless of course you dont know what youre trading for or what you have is worth then they can obviously rip you off but it will never be because of the trading systemthe best part about this game though is the character development
literally every time you play the game your character could be a little different depending on the way you allocate skill points of course
basically skill points enable you to pick what spells you want to develop
since you wont get enough skill points to develop every spell you want to you may have to pick which quotcorequot spells you want to develop
this is why it is important to find out what spells are good before actually building up your character
although youd think that all spells should be equally good well theyre not
for example the level  paladin skill meaning you cant get it until your character is at level  fist of the heavens is just horrible
it does barely any damage to the harder enemies in the game and it only attacks one enemy at a time
trust me in hell difficulty you need spells that affect more than one enemy at a time
also in order to get to the level  skills you may need to put points into a  prerequisite skill or skills
this is where the strategy of the game comes in  you need to know not only what skills are worth investing points into but also if theyre worth spending all the prerequisite points just to get themthe one fault with this game is that there is a lot of slowdown lag if you choose to play online
granted this is true with any online game but because you can have up to  people in a game at one time and you usually do especially if youre playing hell cows then the game tends to lag
this wouldnt be too bad except for the fact that if you die in hell difficulty and nightmare too you lose experience
given that it takes more than three hours to level up when you get past level  losing experience can be a major annoyance
i once had all my  minutes worth of experience erased because i got too close to a cow and then the game lagged
frankly here im not blaming the lag im blaming the game designers for putting that stupid feature in the gameother than that though this game is wonderful
it can be very addictive however so watch out
still if you have the time to spend on it this game can be a very rewarding and fun experience
theres just no words to describe the satisfaction that you feel once you get your character up to the highest level that youve ever acheived and thats really what this game is about leveling up
that may not sound that great but after awhile the concept grows on you and you get drawn into the great world of diablo iithe hype for this game last summer was well worth the game
this game was done very well
use a dfx with glide and you can see the trees animate as you walk by
who says that the best graphics have to be firstperson shooters
this game is not for the faint hearted or the babtist
 this game takes up a ton of time
beating diablo is a long hard path its best to have a friend along the way
even more fun than the original diabloyou will not be able to stop playing this game
i swear
i still go back and run through it just to try out a new character or to try another tactic somewhere or test out the skills in new ways
the only thing that took some getting used to was the saving system since it puts you back in townthe worst thing about diablo ii is that it is being called an rpg
in  reality it is a game about killing thingslots of things
dont get me  wrong i love this game it is addictive and satisfying it just isnt an  rpgif you want to play a great game that is all about combat dig in
but if you want to play a thoughtfully put together rpg with a complex  storyline and depth of character try one of the excellent games by black  isle studios baldurs gate torment icewind dale etc
me i like bothdiablo ii lived up to the hype no doubt about that but its fun fails in comparison to the first diablo
why
because blizzard didnt bother to change the gameplay one bityep its exactley the same
of course thats not really a bad thing considering how great the gameplay is but its just sooo sooo repetitive
all blizzard needed to do is add more depth to the gameplay and it would of recieved a perfect score
but still while repetitive  its very replayable and fun especially since diablo ii has battlenet to back it up another thing that remained the same is the graphics
yup no change at all or so i thinksound greatcontrol so easyso is diablo ii worth buying
of course
but dont expect too much out of it or you will be dissapointedin my opinion the first diablo is betterthe series needs to end here periodbut of course it wont cyaif this game allowed for higher monitor resolutions than x with  colors id have given it a five
as it stands right now diablo  is one of the better sequels i have ever played and an incredible game in its own  right
gone are the days of mindlessly choosing a generic character that  more or less plays like any other you now have  distinct classes  and  combined with their abundant skill trees youre almost guarnteed a unique  experience everytime you start the game over
gone are the limited quests  and short playing time diablo  features almost  quests covering a  variety of exotic locales
play control has been refined hotkeys made more  plentiful and the user interface is intuitiveequipment has more variety  and your storage space has been increased
weather effects have been added  for the outdoors location and they help set a gloomy tone with the eerie  music
blizzard retooled everything i disliked about the first one  cramped inventory easily accessible cheats limited quests and kept the  distinct feel of the original game
there is plenty to like about this  game and im not doing it justice
buy itdiablo  can be summarized as like diablo but more so
diablo  has more locales more varied scenery more and more elaborate ais more control over developing your characters skills more types of characters to play better play balance and so onlike the original diablo s settings are mostly randomly generated so that with the exception of some setpiece areas like the skeleton kings lair in the original no two games follow exactly the same map
diablo  has four acts covering  locales including tristram the setting of diablo
each act has very different climategeography and monsters differing accordinglyyoure following the trail of the wanderer the hero of the first game as he locates the other prime evils diablos brothers before leading you into hell and the final confrontation with diablo himself
the settings in general have much greater variety and eye candy and include outdoor segments as well as dungeon crawlsact i is a genericeurope setting with a lesserdemon level boss rather than a prime evil
act i most closely resembles the earlier stages of the original diablo and contains references back to the original as the players task is to help the sisters of the sightless eye
the rogue from diablo was a member of the order your closestequivalent player character in diablo  is the amazon who has a different backstory
act ii is a desert scenario with a sort of egyptian flavor to the tombs and a different more formidable type of undead
act iii by contrast is a rainforest emphasis on poisonous insects water monsters and fastmoving little ais with blowpipe attacks
act ivs revamped version of hell is much more larger and elaborate than that in the original with an assortment of demons and new attacks
the succubae werent retained but as a tradeoff act i has hordes of renegade roguesmany of the ais have been revamped to make them tougher and to give them more distinctive appearances
while the distinct colour schemes were retained the details are more elaborate and theyre tougher opponents
the carvertype ais now include shamans who in addition to their own magical attacks can raise the fallen
animated skeletons on higher difficulty levels may now have mages as well as archers with themthats one of the biggest changes from the original
monsters not only regenerate after youve cleaned out a level even lesser unique monsters though not level bosses that have to be killed to end an act but many monster types can raise the dead or harvest energy from corpses
there are also delayedaction attacks as poisons and antidotes have been addedother changes from original multiplayer and single player now use the same limited set of quests rather than single player having a random selection of a larger set of quests play balance on character abilities now includes active and passive skills differing by character type
not just any character can learn spells in addition to mana and life player has stamina
while you dont have to eat or sleep as in eg
darkstone you either have to pace your character stock up on stamina potions or be content to move slowly in addition to town portal spells each act contains a set of fixed waypoints and the player can return to earlier acts if desired towns are more elaborate
apothecaries selling potions are now separate from magic sellers and at least one npc per act can gamble with you
you can hire and equip npcs who will follow you and fight what you fight
if theyre with you your experience points are divided with them but they level up and become more formidable over timesome lessons learned by the designers local smiths can upgrade weapons eg
installing runes or gems in them
partway through act ii a quest item allows you to combine multiple gems of the same type to get a single gem of a better grade so strategy is a factor in towncamp you have a chest in addition to the inventory on your characters person
items in the chest are safe but if youre killed and resurrected anything you were carrying has to be retrieved from the body
since youre fined a large amount of your total gold when youre resurrected youre motivated to scavenge your own body anyway just to get some of it back partway through act i you revisit tristram and rescue deckard cain who now has enough gratitude to identify items for free instead of gouging you some unique items now come in sets eg
helmet breastplate gauntlets that are stronger together than apart and mostly effective for specific character types eg
bonuses apply only to a paladin
strategy comes into play is it worth saving an item in the hopes of acquiring the rest of the setin summary the thing i miss most from the original is the randomized quest mix on single player
the activepassive skill system is interesting enough to make up for restricting the players ability to create superpowerful spellcasting rogues and the likeas in the original even in singleplayer a game cant be saved in multiple states you can only have multiple characters working through different scenarios
in multiplayer items can be transferred between characters by dropandswitch but thats about itthis is quite a good game and i am addicted
my problem is balancing tribes  and tfc as well  i like this game but i had a problem today
i got the game only a week ago and i am a level  sorceress
i was out in the dark wood slaughtering some hapless hungry dead when two people level  barbarians were talking quotwhere is shequot quothey namehere do u know where she isquot  quotmequot i asked and one of them said quotyeah where r uquot so i said quotwaaay out in the dark woodquot
i had no idea the barb would find me he did and chopped me in half with his sword
he took my  gold
i asked him  times to stop killing me but he said nothing
after being slaughtered  times i finally found away around him and grabbed my stuff
i ran as fast as i could but he found me and managed to hit me once
i ran out of stamina so as quickly as i could i exited the game mere feet away from his sword
i then started my own game and used half my health potions
so if you beware the jerks diablo is a very good gamediablo  is a fantastic game diablo  basically expands upon that
more classes more levels better graphics yet it just isnt as challenging as the original
still a great game and fans of the first should pick this upa true classic of the rpg genregreat gameplay immersive and rich storyline fun multiplayer experience
highly recommendedas a major fan of the original diablo i have to say that i am both thrilled and frustrated by diablo ii
thrilled because it is essentially the same game only with more options more character classes more skills  larger levels etc
frustrated because of one design choice blizzard  made that makes life tedious unlike diablo diablo ii does not save the  state of monsters and items in the dungeonswhen you fire up a saved  game your character is back at the starting town for that act not in the  middle of the dungeon where you left off
this may not seem like much but  it is an incredibly tedious change from the first diablo for somebody who  doesnt have a lot of contiguous time to play computer games
as a father  of two kids i do not have much time to sit in front of a computer so i  grab what time i can spare a halfhour here an hour there
blizzards  design decision means that at least the first  minutes of any diablo ii  session are spent just getting back to where you were
if you only have   minutes to spend playing dont even bother booting up the game
sure  they put in waypoints to teleport you around but with the monsters  regenerated you still have to spend a lot of time battling your way through  territory youve already been through and some of the waypoints are out in  the middle of a level so that when you teleport in youre instantly  surrounded by monsters
if you are playing a sorceress character like me  this is a potentially fatal situation that you would never have let  yourself get into normallyanyway diablo ii is a great game
the  graphics are excellent and more expansive than the first game
the sound  is fantastic awesome eax d positional sound effects believable voice  acting and outstanding music which is very similar to the original  diablos music
if you can spare  hours at a time to play the game  youll love it
otherwise i think youll find that it is still a really  fun game but a more frustrating than it had to beif you were a fan of the original you dont need me telling you to buy it  you probably already have it
if your new to diablo or if this genre of  game is not your thing you may find the graphics a little substandard
dont get me wrong its a good looking game
but if your used to the d  accelerated hires graphics of some of the first person shooters out there  this will look quotdifferentquot in a way that might be interpreted as  quotlowresquotwhile the experience on battlenet has been very  annoying iedowntime difficulty starting and getting into games lag  etc the lan multiplayer side of this game has been a blast
that is where  the true fun in this game will come out for you
two friends and i have  made diablo ii a weekly thing and have enjoyed every minutethe single  player game is also enjoyable if you are into that kind of thing but i  found myself losing interest after a pretty short time as a single playernow check it and take it from the penguin up south single player is horible and boring
then you got bnet online play
thats where the money goes
i mean if u only know the thrill you get when your fighting a boss with  other ppl on ur side  levels more then you
its especially cool with all the magic and seeing the armor and weapons you actually equipt
now im thinking it will be another quake  arena for me ill get tire of it sooner or later
so far thoughits very fun online so u might as well not waste  gb on the full versionboth single and multiplayer and just install the multiplayeronlinethe penguin speaks
u better pick either the sorceress or the barbarian in this game or illfirst let me say that i have never been the biggest fan of rpgsthough final fantasy  is an exception
however in the case of diablo ii  i love ehm
it is a highly fun and entertaining game
it revolves around the lands of sanctuarysanctuary is the name of the world or section of the world
diablo  the lord of terror was once imprisoned in a soulstone along with his brothers the lord of destruction and the lord of hatredbaal and mephisto
however now he has been released and is shedding his terror and darkness over the world and of course you must stop him
the charecters  you have the option of  charecter classes in diablo ii
the amazon  a beautiful but deadly warrior from accross the sea
she is a master at wielding bows and spear weapons
necromancer  raising the dead and cusring his enemies are his specialties
the necromancer is one hell of a charecter
he can after slaying his unfortunate opponents raise them from the dead as skelatons who fight for himhe can raise one skelaton per exp level
barbarian  when it comes to fighting  this guy rocks
a warrior from far away ancient not too mention heavily guarded mountains the barbarian is the ultimate charecter when it comes to meelee weaponry
as he charges through he can shout great battle cries which can send his enemies running in fear or leave them dead
he can slaughter enemies mercilessly before showing signs of weakness but his most impressive skill is the ability to wield to weapons at once one in each hand
with an ax in one hand and a sword in the other he can easily exterminate his opponentspaladin  a holy crusader  the paladin fights with faith and the light of truth as his weaponsas well as his sword and shield
he casts holy magicin the form of auras
dont underestimate himhe can be a strong warrior
sorceress  though skilled with weaponry the sorceress uses elemental spells as her mane weapons
wielding ice fire and lightning  she is a demons worst nightmare
all of the charecters have them own advantages and flaws  but they are all great and real fun to play as
combat and control  control is great in this game
you simply click were you want to go and your charecter will move
you can also make them runthough this uses up stamina which is a big advantage when you need to escape a horde of enemies quickly
you use a two mouse button combat controlunless you use mac
the control of each button is fully customisible
combat is every where and you cant go a minute without fightingwether small skirmishes or huge battles
some say this is a problem and that there isnt enough puzzle involved
well they have there opinions but its there is enough exploring to satisfy my intulectial needs and more than enough fighting to satisfy my destructive needs
i will admit that there is one form of over combat
the problem is that they often stick huge amounts of monsters in one spacelike enough to fill your screen
then they all charge at you and before you know it your deadunless you run
this means i often am simply running trying to avoid combat
i dont mind small bands of  to  or seven but it can be ridicolousitems and weaponry  there are plenty of items to use in diablo ii
crossbows swords potions axes bows spears you name it
and they are every where
you will probly find yourself filling your inventory in a matter of minutes with weapons and potions
and if you have extra items or ones you cant use then just sell them
one very helpful item is the town portal scroll with wich you can open a portal to the nearest townusefull for escaping from large battles when you are cornered or low on health and health potions
all this is not with out a problem
the inventory could be much bigger
however that is only a minor problem
weapons usage  i really like the way they have set up weapons usage
when you find weapons you may not be able to use them right away because they may be unidentified
this can be fixed with identity scrolls
also weapons require you charecter to be atleast at a certain exp lvlexpiriance level
they also require certain degrees of strength or dexterity
this keeps you from simply grabbing the best item you see and they blasting your way through the gamethis being a good thing as it allows for strategy
also weapons degrade in durabilty with usage
this means that you cant just pick your best weapon and use it for ever
you have to compramise and think and balance your weapon usage
durabily can be replenished at a blacksmithplayer advancement plays a big role
unlike in many rpgs where when you advance to a new level the game chooses the hp or ep or sp or dpstriength points energy points etc in diablo ii you choose this your self
also whenever you advance to a new exp lvl you have the options for new skills
you get chose the skills so you customise wether your amazon gets to fling buring arrows or attack with lightning spears or if you barbarian learns a new battle cry or become better at wielding axesone person complained that the caves and maps were not randomly generated
this is not truethey are
i dont know what heshe thinks randomly generated means but he is wrong about it in this game
you ussually have an idea about what sortof oppenents will inhabit an area but you dont know which in particualar or where they are or where items will be or how the cave will be shaped
they are randomly generatedgrpahics arent the best but they do finewell there you have it diabloii
it is a great game and i highly suggest you buy it
not a waste of moneyyou dont have to do a lot of thinking or puzzle solving in this game and sometimes i just like to kill things so this is great
the graphics are pretty cool and if you get upgrades the get better
i love the fact that you can be one of five characters now instead of just one of three  the male characters still outweigh the female
there are some graphic glitches every now and then which make your assistants pace back and forth and not rush to your aid
the graphics can get a bit gross especially in act iv where you go to hellits funny how game developers strike on a theme or concept and consider it a gold mine
and like your average gold mine its used for a while some times for years but before anyone realizes it it starts to run out
and so like many crazy miners the game developers keep mining hoping to strike that gigantic hidden vein
well blizzard hit the gold mine with original diablo
i myself admit that i stayed up for all hours of the night playing diablo by myself on my lan and on blizzardnet
shame to admit it i played the game until i reached hell then replayed with different characters big whoop and played again using the quotevilquot hackers tools gasp
so when diablo ii was announced i eagerly awaited the release of the sequel
i announced my retirement from diablo ordered and got the limited edition of diablo ii and 
was disappointedreally disappointed
my first mistake was accessing battlenet the day of release nay the month of release
blizzard stress tested the new network for diablo ii due to a fundamental change in how network play is handled
well
they stress tested for  people
well  limited edition diablo iis were printed on top of who knows how many of the regular edition and the server was crippled for several months
what did blizzard think
that we would graciously limit ourselves  people at a time
 world wide if i understand the news wheel correctly
granted the change was for the best
i myself was getting annoyed by the vast number of cheating player killers cpk using special software to quotsurvivequot anything
many honest players were forced to use the very same hackers tools just to enjoy the game
the network was changed for diablo ii to prevent this type of cheat in an quothonestquot game
at least blizzard didnt lose all of their brain cells
blizzard did work hard to improve the atampt servers for game play and now thanks to their hard work server down time is somewhat minimized albeit hardly perfected
we game players are an impatient bunch
and now on to the graphics
well
the graphics are nothing new
still problems with the voodoo  series of the cards under certain circumstances it appears that you are looking through a sheet of water
monsters are still ho hum areas are um 
the same random maps
not much difference except the quotbowledquot effect
not sure why blizzard implemented this perhaps to give the player a better quotperspectivequot
things kind of do look more quotdistantquot as the object reach the edge of the screen
whatevercontrols are the same
the game now makes better use of the keyboard however the entire game can still be played without ever touching the keyboard
both points are good
i like the fact that belt items are a variable  for the first belt  for the next belt  for the next belt and so on and so on
however many may not like the newer compact look of the screen
they may not realize that this is by design to allow the player more visible gaming area
item finding is vastly improved how many times did we squint at the screen to find a stupid ring
pressing a chosen key highlights the items for easy findingalso managing and using your character has never changed from the original
its still easy to look at the farious stats and items that you have
however ive never liked how much screen real estate this process has to takei find that the characters are somewhat unbalanced for game play
i cant really decide if this is good or bad
it is clear that one character will certainly stand out as the best for player to player combat not good
as well as another character will become the best for single player games and another will be the best for quotgroupingquot i do like the quotuniquequot spells and abilities of each character
but is all this better than the quotvanillaquot characters of diablo i
it certainly is but by how much im not too certainthere really isnt much to say about this game
giving or not giving a star for each quality i rated the game like thus
one star for the solid but very stock graphics
one star for the extremely refined controls
however i have to force a loss of one star for the quirkiness of the battlenet servers
quotis that fairquot you may ask
well yes you see playing diablo ii by yourself is only  of the game
playing online or on a lan is the other 
online play is such an integral part of the experience of this game that i feel that blizzards service should be included in the rating
sorry guys and gals
i cant decide whether to give or take one star for the characters
i would rather give half a star but amazon doesnt allow that therefor ill be nice and round up
one star for the character selection and development
the final star goes towards overall addiction
this game is indeed addictive however care should be exercised that boredom wont creep in
all in all three and a half stars rounded up to four
this game needs to be viewed as an extension of the original instead of the a whole new version and your enjoyment will increase
the price is a bit high as of this writing but i feel it is worth the hard earned cash or credit in our modern worldon a final note yes im positive no more paragraphs
some of you may wonder why i dont always include music and sound in my reviews
it is because i am a part of the deaf community although i myself am not deaf
i am keenly aware that deaf people often really dont care about music in a game so therfor i tend to leave those out
in case you are wondering the music in diablo ii is far better than that found in diablo i much more moody and awe inspiring it certainly sets the pace of the gamethanks for readingtigerpommei am getting back into my old ps and needed a controller
this was cheap and works great
i got a used one and it works greatthis is a good company to buy from if you have a problem dont do what i did and not answer your email
i made a mistake and gave a bad review without looking first
but they resolved it and now they deserve a good review so buy from them if there is a mistake they will make it right
thank you and to game kong i am sincerely sorryplaystations dual shock is such a comfortable and popular layout that pc gamepad companies like saitek and logitech try to copy it and they usually dont do a very good job
their dpads are always too awkward or their construction is too lightweight
the dual shock is solid and is built to last
im an emulation gamer and thanks to smartjoys usb adapter i can use a real psps gamepad with zsnes and bleemmy only gripes with the pad a the startselect buttons really shouldve been moved up after the addition of analog sticks
im always finding myself fumbling over the sticks trying to get to start and select
b while the dpad is very sturdy it kills my thumbs after a couple hours of play
kinda makes me wish they had taken a turbo touch  approach and used a touchsensitive panel instead of hard plastic arrowsi have had my playstation in almost a year now and i had the dual shock controller ever since i got my consoli use it for all my games but i  think it is funniest to use in nhl  from easports
it is great that  you can feel that you are getting hit in the fights and that the controller  is really shaking when you have lost a fight
furthermore the feeling when  you get a tackle on to the boards is quite funnyi have used the  controller for other games as well
and even though some the games are not  able to use the shockfunction the controller is very good anywaythe  buttons are easy to reach the analog control is well functioning and the  controller is nice to hold in your hands even when you have played for a  long timeall in all a good controller that can be used in all sorts of  games  but of course it is best in games which are enabled to use the  shockfunctionthis was my first system and i had great fun with it
some of the games are amazing like super mario  and the legend of zelda ocarina of time
this system holds some of the most classic and most well made games
the system itself is alright
i have run into minor problems with it like games freezing or not even loading
the controls are alright you rarely use the dpadonly a handful of games make this a must buyconkers bad fur daysuper mario goldeneye super mario kart zelda ocarina of timeperfect darkstar wars rouge sqadronstar wars shadows of the empirethose are the titles that ive played and lovedits worth a purchasei still am mad at my dad for selling my n back in  to a guy in germany but theyre the cheapest game console i can think of today that is still graphically holds upgame selection   games is nowhere near colse as the ps but alot of d games that you loved on the snes come on here
mario zelda fzero metroid doom  are all on herecontroller  idk wat nintendo was thinking with this alot of game controls need alot of getting used to like  dpads  a analog stick
do ya think thats enough
and its not the most conftorable thing to hold and the rumble paks do make it significantly heavier then say saturn or ps controllers but it does make d games more natural to controli really dont get y they went with cartridges i mean i love them but audio  video is almost completely non existant on here music loops kinda short the cutscenes are used with polygons instead of cg but load times are only  secondsnow getting one today is easy since alot of games were made for it and they wont break but it kinda feels olde then it looks always get one with a memory expansion pak
the jumper pak gives the framerate slower then it shouldafter years of coveting my friends super nintendo i finally got my first gaming console
in the christmas of  the nintendo  arrivedthe nintendo  or n as it is sometimes referred followed in the wake of success of the first sony console the playstation and started producing their games with d graphics
instead of limiting the player to only being able to move forward and backward or left and right you could now move in all directions
this opened a portal for nintendo to take some of their classic characters and put them in truly immersive worlds
for example mario was no longer a bit side scrolling red and blue pixel but a small italian man with a healthy knack for adventure
being able to see these characters up close and all around was something like we had never seen before
the result ended up being games like super mario  star fox  the legend of zelda ocarina of time and the countless hours and vivid gameplay that they would offerwith a very simple design and set up like the previous  nintendo consoles snes  nes the  was another cartridge based nintendo console with no load times and generally easy maintenance remember blowing into the cartridges and consoles
the controller however was something that was dramatically different from both previous nintendo consoles
this controller offered an analog stick and more than the standard  or  buttons
the analog stick was great for the d games and made it very easy to navigate however after enough hours of play it stop working in one way or anotherits interesting to see how nintendo has come full circle evolving to something like the nintendo  and in some ways digressing back to its origins with games like new super mario bros u which is much like super mario bros for snes but with updated graphics and a few more tweaksthe n is admitidly a very good system as known by many owners of this fine system the one and only reason i would rate this system down a star is because the low game library and very nice but blocky graphics  i know its a contradiction first ill rate the positives  the system is pretty durable ill give it that and i like the craftsmanship in the systems shape  the systems various colors i happen to own a jungle green  my favorite  and ice blue system  the system is just a bit better constructed then the ps in a few ways for one the on button is a switch which allows the worry of an overused on button popping up during play and turning off it also has its own memory built in plus it allready comes with  controll ports right from the start  the controlls are very comfortable the first and probably last controll that can be held in  ways one of which ways would be more confortable for larger hands the  problems i see in this controll is that the analog eventually gets loose and unresponsive  look up n joystick repair on youtube for a quick but short lasting fix still works second it does not have built in shock feedback like the ps which is how the ps is much better in this way with joysticks that are super durable and very realistic shocking luckily there are rumble pacs that allow shock feedback so thats easily solvedcons sadly the one and only problem i can find with this system  other then the controlls problems which can be solved partally is the graphics of the game is allways blocky looking and the sound quality isnt amazing compared to ps reason being the ps is a cd which holds by far more data allowing for better sound quality as for the blockyness i have no idea what causes that even the best looking graphics from donkey kong still seems slightly less but still blocky and thats that it fully uses the expansion pack not much to gain from a  bit system which is doubled with the expansion pack as opposed a system like ps which is far less graphics bit then the  to me  im not sure anyone else  the  release of crash bandicoot is well comparable to the s most powerfull graphic game donkey kong and the  release of spyro the dragon has smooth graphics amazing lighting effects and graphics that will simply blow your mind as for the  release of spyro  when dk  was released the graphics are even smoother and everythings looks amazingly realistic you have never seen more realistic water then in this game also the game library is les then half the amount the ps does as for the ps allowing more genres of games especially amazing platforms like spyro crash and croc even frogger allthough as people allways say graphics dont make the game which is far too true games like goldeneye  donkey kong  super smash bros super mario  star wars rouge squadron and star fox  the few yes but i love these gamesmy overall rate for the  has to be  i just cant let these problems go unseen but as for fun the  gets  stars i hope people dont hate me for this review its just the way i see itgreat product works fine smells a little different but this might just be the age
company had it protected in a box and it works  percent
not a  star because of smellok the graphics are outdated but who cares when it is home to one of the best games ever madezelda 
thats right and many other hits as well
i have to admit i mainly bought this system because of the zelda games but behold there are other great hits as well
i dont know what they are but who cares
who cares when you have a master peice to keep you entertained for a fairly cheap pricei would have liked the inclusion of an audiovideo cable and a controller but those addons typically run extra so i wasnt surprised they werent includedthe n was nintendos rd console not counting the game boy and virtaul boyit came out shortly after the sega saturn and sony playstation
if you dont have this system anymore or never have
and collect systems and and games then i recommend this system
the controller has always at first glace seemed like a gimmick
and like myself probably made you think how are people supposed to use that controller
but it actually isnt too bad
the system its self is pretty simple yet cool looking
and is for the most part really reliable
and having  controller ports is a plus too
though it would have been nice if nintendo released more mature games for the console there are some classic games
i recommend the games below golden eyemortal kombat trilogymario kart wcw nwo revengeresident evil super mario fzeroready  rumblelegend of zelda ocarina of timestar wars shadows of the empirenba hangtimedoom nfl blitzkiller instinct goldbio freaksand wayne gretzkys d hockey to name a few to start withat the time i bought my nintendo  it was for one reason and one reason only goldeneye 
the game was revolutionary when it came out and took everyones breath with the graphics and gameplay
other n games have evolved into my favorites such as perfect dark madden  and the legend of zelda ocarina of time
the n is a lot more graphically capable than the playstation
the downfall for the nintendo  however which eventually let playstation surpass it was nintendos decision to go with the cartridge format which scared game developers away due to the carts limited memory capacityoverall the n is home to some of the greatest video games ever made and is worth your moneythe nintendo  is a lot of fun and it is wellmade too
mine works like new and is about  or  years old right now
there are a lot of fun games and it has all right graphics and good sound
even though its kind of old i still have a lot of fun with this consoleone thing to keep in mind is you may need to add some things to it
some games require a memory card which plugs into the controller and some need an expansion pack which plugs into the console
you can add a rumble pack if you want but thats not required
it should come with  controllers but you can have up to this is a very fun consolealthough the system is outdated the games are still really funthe really good games are nintendo made like super mario  or paper marioback in the dayand by that i mean the late smy family and i owned our own sony playstation console
it was an amazing console with games such as crash bandicoot and spyro the dragon
without any real competition from sega during the mid s playstation and the nintendo  struggled to show everybody who was the bestreleased in about  years after the debut of the playstation consolethe nintendo  picked up steam fast
games such as super mario  zeldas ocarina of time and mario kart  its no wonder nintendos new system did so wellso now lets see just how the nintendo  compares to the playstation
for starters the picture clearly indicates one thing the playstation didnt have four controller ports
the only way to play with four players on the playstation was to attach a multitap to its front
in terms of the controllers themselves the playstation wins with its sleek ergonomic design and simple button layout its no competition
the nintendo  on the other hand has an awkwardtohandle controller with three handlesalmost as if nintendo expected there to be gamers with three hands looking for a new nintendo console
the only thing better about the nintendo s controller is how it was the first to have a builtin thumbstickwhich sony later took to but into their dualshock controlleranother thing you may notice about the nintendo  is how it has a cartridge slotas opposed to the sega saturn and playstation having disc drives
because of the nintendo s lack of a disc drive its games cannot hold the space or audio quality of discbased games
butbecause the discs are on cartridgesthe long loading times we experience with the playstation are virtually nonexistent hereas nintendos last home console to use cartridges and their first console to use d bit graphics it became a major success
its games set the status quo for many d platformers d racers and adventure games to comethe n has some of the absolute greatest games ever made
i love the look of it and the zero loadtimes of the cartridge games
that being said it has one of the most flawed firstparty controllers ever made
i like the layout but there seems to be a lot of friction in the analog stick
every n controller have ever owned has a significantly degenerated analog stickthese games do not work with windows xp
most people reading this are probably aware of that but in case you thought about purchasing it and hoping youd luck out like my wife it doesntpretty good game
i would probably even play it again
i do usually cheat by getting walkthroughs for any pc games i play but even with the walkthroughs it still had some tough challenging spotspros  beautiful immersive atmospheric worlds
monumental architecture
eerie music
breathtaking cutscenes
ugly creepy archvillain
for the most part you dont have to be a rocket scientist to solve the puzzles
great hightech tools to use  impressive vehicles to drive and fly creative use of everyday objects
when you pick items up they zoom off the screen into your inventory with a  whooshing sound
the inventory feature is exceptionally easy to  usecons  some locations are too dark and murky
i suggest that  for the very dark places you might want to adjust the brightnesscontrast  on your monitor to make it easier to locate the hidden goodies
some  mechanical leverscontrols respond correctly only if you move the mouse  very slowly
the game crashed a couple of times and i never was able  to get autoplay to workbottom line  a superior very entertaining  adventure marred slightly by minor glitchesa colony has suddenly evacuated its cities in order to avoid the wrath of an angry ozgar
the players object is to locate ozgar and stop him before he destroys this planet
the colonists have developed a remarkable technology for hypertravel from one world to another
through the course of the game the player gains control of this technology in order to find and defeat ozgarby virtue of this narrative the player is afforded the opportunity to jump freely after gaining the technology from any of four worlds
the worlds are quite disparate and very beautifully rendered
it does take some time and effort to obtain the technology but the process of doing so is engaging interesting logical and rewardingthere are very few nonplayer character interactions
in fact in most cases an encounter with another character usually means troublesome encounters result in a sudden quotgame overquot
this game consequently is a very solitary experience with very little dialogue and with most clues being found intuitively and through exploration
i enjoyed this aspect of the game very much
some reviewers have felt that the sudden quotgame overquot encounters were unnecessary and distracting
perhaps but if you save often as you should anyway you can easily return to the gameplay and the game makes it fairly clear fairly quickly that you should avoid all beings
once the first serious encounter is made the player is fairly well clued in that nothing about these worlds is particularly friendlythe scenery is just splendid
the worlds are very differentone lush and green one arid and dry one partially submerged underwater and in which the player enters one building and goes several floors down beneath the surface of the water outside
the players progress is extremely linearmost things must be done in a particular order and in some cases the player may be significantly hindered if she has missed some element
however the ease with which the player may jump from world to world more than makes up for the linearity
exploration is multidimensional in this regardtoward the end i did find it necessary to go to a walkthrough online
the puzzles became to some degree inhibitive rather than contributing to the game experience
once solved by cheating a little the storyline and graphics were rewarding enough for me to forgive myself my indiscretion
the final puzzle i must agree with other reviewers is unnecessarily convoluted and the end is rather seriously truncated
in this way i was a little disappointedi give this game four stars for its creative way of mitigating the problem of linearity by giving the player free rein after gaining the technology to explore several beautiful worlds for its inventive artwork in rendering the worlds for its pensive solitary feel and for its science fictional as opposed to fantasy concept
i give this game no more than four stars because i sense that it was cut short because the linearity sometimes interferes with how much exploration the player may engage in each world and because i felt it necessary to turn to walkthroughs in order to complete the game
all in all i come away from the crystal key feeling mainly that i spent my time well in these worldsif you like point and click adventure games this is good buy for the price
nice graphics and smooth gameplayan adventure game like they used to make them  intelligent funny challenging and thoughtprovoking
one warning theres a major bug about a third of the way through the game that crashes the game to the desktop on machines running win or later
the manufacturers solution
download a saved game from their website that picks up after the problem
better than nothing i supposethis game is now quite old
its still pretty fun though
the best attraction is the wisecracking main charactersome of the puzzles are of the tedious quotsearch and search and search until you find that one item that you didnt seequot variety
in fact the puzzles were generally a weak point in the game
i got bored with them and checked uhs for solutionsi didnt get bored with the plot though which was rather funjourney with rayman as he ventures through more than  different levels ranging from mini several minute bursts to hour long conquests filled with marvelous graphical scenery that will leave you breath taken and wanting another serving
with bonus levels great music that put you into the mood of the game and great accomplishments to meet the game could be viewed as one of the best platform games ever createdof course there is a bad side to this of course
the games camera angles can be confusing and uncooperative many times
having a gamepad is almost a musthave for the full enjoyment of the game unless you really get use to the keyboard controlls which is not that hard but tricky or youre up for a lot of wrist pains trying to maneuver rayman successfully
the main downside for most players is the save option which is very strick but isnt as bad if you think about the save points during each level in the level
oh yeah the controls cant be changedbut other than that this is a game in which every player should experience one time or anotherof course it was a good game fun and even addictive
some interesting improvements include the more advanced ai of the enemies than was the case in the first quotdelta forcequot
its also more realistic than the first one ie
hiding inside a canvas tent wont protect you from the cannon fire from a hind
using several parachute sequences made it much more enjoyable and interesting
a big problem however was that when you looked at your gps map you could still move you man but you couldnt turn his direction
this proved to be a major irritation all throughout gameplay
furthermore inclusion of a shotgun was nothing but absurd unrealistic and totally unnecessary
also the manual and help screens are very unclear on how to climb down ladders
as the heading says it was good but by fixing only a few minor details they could have made it a lot betterthe first of these games are the single player campaign missions which while fun ranger from easy to really really easy
the enemy ai is at its best lackluster and at worse totally moronic
to tell you truth i never bothered much with the single player missionsthe nd game which totally kicks butt and gets you your moneys worth is the multplayer part
anyone who is a fan of red faction or halflife will love this gameonline it is a total slaughterfest even though the community has shrank n recent years as people have gone on to either the df sequals or something else simply to combat the rise in cheating
the other versions of the game did a much better of keeping the cheaters outoverallstill all in all i just love this gamei thought this game was a lot of fun  but very unrealistic in some places like when i was sniping at an enemy camp and the moment i fired a shot all people in the camp immediately spotted me and start firing at me
and also the red screen when youre getting shot is totally annoying you cant see anything at allfinally i found a d commando soldier simulation with an interface that can be mastered in  minutes without sacrifizing realismi love it
the graphics the gameplay the missions the controls and different objects  vehicles weapons and so onfour stars seems a little bit cheap for this  great game but the fifth star is missing because i would have liked to see  a greater variety of campaigns for example with different  identitiesthemes
but still it is worth every pennyi have gone backwards in my delta force experience having bought dflandwarrior first and then buying up the first two just to have more missions to play
it is certainly been worth it
all the delta force games take place out doors which makes them different
its realistic action were you have to snipe your way around the perimeter to make your way into a camp to complete your mission objective
of the three delta force games i own i think df has the most original and interesting missionsyou like missions
well in this game you get over  of them
i wish rainbow six would give you that many
these missions are part of two campaigns that form a certain story line or you can play them as quick missions in any order on your own
many of those missions are also available in multiplayer so you can play coop with a buddy
the missions take place in a variety of weather conditions day and night and the challenge is being able to take out all the terrorists because that one guy you missed will take you out and remember one shot kills
sure you can respawn but that just means starting the mission all over again from the beginning
that is the challenge in delta force the sheer number of combatants you need to take out and the large area in which they use
for example in one of my favorite missions there is a downed pilot hiding in this snowy wilderness
to fly him out safely you need to take out a camp containing at least  of the enemy and destroy three sams
getting most of the terrorist scum is easy as you just take a position up top and start picking them off but its hard to get them all and some are out where you cant see them easily
so patience is key because as soon as you leave your cover somebody will get you
it took me a while to complete that mission and twice i was  finished just having blown up the sams only to get snipedyou dont have a huge number of weapons to choose from but what you have is fantastic and youll find yourself using one of the sniper rifles or the m machine gun which has a grenade launcher
you wont use your hand gun much and you have the choice of delayed or frag grenades
satchels are available for blowing up large things like those sam sites and you can use extra ammo or a vest as one of your options
because methodical longer range warfare is the order you have a really nice alternative to games like rainbow and half life were most of your action is confined to a small space
its the pace of the game that i really like and its a blast to pick off some terrorist from  meters awaythe multiplayer is a whole new ball game because youre going to have quite a few people trying to get you
the last time i played at nova world there were  people in there so you never have to wait for some action
you can play deathmatch where every man is for himself or team death match
capture the flag is a blast
you really can never tire of this gamedrawbacks
well the graphics are not an improvement over delta force one though they are pretty cool
you do need to update the game all the way because there are a few problems that needed to be fixed and youll want to maximize your resolution
the game can be just a bit choopy and sluggish at times which brings me to why i only have a  ratingin all the delta force games you are placed in an outdoor enviroment that is enormous
often you will have to run for a minute or two just to engage the enemy or reach their camp
in all these games you feel like you are spending too much time running  around and that is especially a problem in multiplyer were you run for ever only to get killed and have to go back to where you were 
dflandwarrior remedies this problem a little by making the characters run faster but in this game you seem to plod along at a slow pace
thats especially true when running up and down steep mountainsover all delta force is a fantastic realistic shooter with unique characteristics
its a great compliment to some of the other great games out there
i own rainbow  and rouge spear and this makes a nice alternative
certainly the price is rightwell this game is a ton of fun through  stars
but after people start to get incredibly aggravated with your condo rates even when the are so low you are losing money and your cash starts going down the drain
but it is very addicting so even when you lose you start right over again
its like suddenly zooming into one of the buildings that is being built in simcity
you start with nothing except a few thousand dollars and an empty lot
but as you build your tower up i suggest leaving the basment levels for later because you will want them for cooler stuff later like a subway from a  star rating to a  you get many new features that improve your tower
ohbut just to warn you to change the price you charge for certain rooms you have to click on every single one
but besides all the cons it is really fun and should work on any window computer though you might need to change its compatibility
if you do decide to buy good luck to you and may your tower ever grow taller and a terrorist never put a bomb in your buildingthis game is great for a break from writing a report or studying
my aunt owns her own caffe and loves this game
i guess to say if you have any intrest in buisness you will love this
its easy to pick up and the only thing you have to worry about is quotwhat time is it 
quot or quothow long have i been playing this
quotglitchy bugy chock full of errors and lacking in originalty at pointsyet so addictingly goodfly a copter and do missions in the janky world
drop people in the ocean  watch them drown just because you canstrive for the best copter with all of the enhancmentsget extra money  tear gas the sick guy your trying to saverescue people from burning buildings only to drown them in the oceanthe possibilitys are endless
in fact i feel an itch right now to bounce some poor pedestrins off building corners with a long dangly ropehope you have funthis game was released in 
i bought it when it was relatively new and i had  children  boys and a girl from about  i already had the simcity game whatever was current then i think  unlimited its difficult to trace my entering simcopter fandom with this game but enter i didfirst even in  its graphics were hardly aweinspiring but it had a few things really going for it
it computergenerated textures one of the early games to do so and it would use the cities and countrysides generated in simcity and let you fly through them
and it runs on the most primitive pc requiring very little in the way of computer resourcesat first i was tentative whats this
the idea aside of just touring your own cities was to earn money by helping out with fire traffic crime medical passengers etc emergencies by either directly intervening or by calling and directing appropriate response teams fire ambulance police etc
these activities form the structure of the game ie get money buy better stuff etc until you made it to the ultimate choppers even allowing a military unit where you can challenge ufos and of course true to games of that era it also has an easter egg or two tucked awayand what are these citizens at first you thought they forgot to finish the game graphics but then the genius of vague graphics and mumbling speech that you thought might be real but no its just noise
and what are these animals too but then i find myself admiring the contextual beauty of it  and they have expressions as well i dont speak a foriegn language even though ive traveled and know a few words here and there i expect this game translates well to most any language
just as you watch your pets mouthings and actions and you swear you know what they are saying loltrue to all will wright games it is nonviolent ecofriendly problem solving this is no exception  and like most will wright games there just isnt much to it and yet it becomes a classic with diehard followers and im one for this gameit has a charm a wit and a pleasant thoughtful presence that appeals to a wide number of people of all ages and with different styles sure you find those naughty things you can do like run over people smash into building jam up the highways and throw patients out of the helicopter great emotional vents in those moments of frustration or boredom but the basic game somehow holds to a gentler kinder essencemy kids all spent many hours as well it is just fun without your having to invest a lot of painful brainpower  it requires very little learning time and is even fun to learn as you go
in the final analysis as suggested by reviewer ribcage it boils down to a great pleasant way to pass timeedit one warning however you can only use simcity  yes its that oldheheh cities to tour im pretty sure it cannot use simcity  simcity rushhour and deluxe versions
i believe there are conversion programs that can move the maps at least though probably  not the buildings back and forth
it does come with  or so cities prebuilt so this isnt required
of course sc is still available not only alone but in various collection editions with other sc versionsi see this game from various sources such as bargain bins recycled software shops etc id say if you can find it for a few bucks including shipping go for it its great fun and relaxing too just one of those whimsies in lifereally a fun little gamenot the greatest graphics but the fun factor is a love flight sims and while this game is really not a flight sim the game has lots of things going for itas one other review i read before purchasing the game stated the fun makes up for the lack of graphicsi agreesimant is an excellent simulation of ant battle but is easy to beat and the sound and graphic quality is poor
basically youre an ant in a colony trying to destroy the red ants
a spider which somehow shoots lasers occasionally dont ask me and ant lions are among the existing perils
its pretty involved with mating behavior control and foraging
these can be left alone except the first but it can be tougher without them
the fullgame mode the only one that i find worthwile is too easy to beat and involves a simple strategy
i recommend this primarily for people who like strategy gamesnox is a fun little game
what it lacks in originality it more than makes up for with excellent gameplay and performance
considering how low the price is for this game now it is definitely worth buyingthe storyline for this game is linear but each of the levels are large and have a lot of areas to explore
the theme of the game is kind of lighthearted and cartoonish
you walk around the levels hacking or shooting or zapping monsters finding keys and breaking open stuff for goodies
in between levels you can usually visit merchants to buy new stuff and get your equipment repairedtheres nothing really original there
where nox excels is in some other areas in which other games often fail  the graphics animation and sound for this game are excellent
each room has a bunch of small objects to interact with although most of them are things that you dont need
still if you want to you can smash wine barrels for the heck of it and push rocks around
the interface is easy to use and fits the fastpaced gameplay very well
there are hotkeys for three potions five spells and two weapons
the game is short but it is genuinely replayable
at the beginning of the game you choose one of three distinct character classes
the beginning missions for each class are totally different
the later missions are the same but each class has such distinct abilities that you have to play them somewhat differently
the inventory system was refreshingly untedious
maybe its not realistic but its a nice break from the routine of constantly rearranging your inventory
the game actually has good gold balance
what i mean by this is that you dont end up the game with a ton of gold and nothing good to spend it on
you get progressively more useful items at each level but they cost more
each time you spend gold you can usually buy one or two things that you want but you have to spend your money wiselynox is a fun game to play
its short length and shallow linear plot are the reason that it gets four stars instead of fivewhile sitting in his trailer in a florida trailer park jack mower along with his tv
is suddenly sucked through a vortex into the quasimedieval world of nox
there he finds hes the only person who can rid that world of the evil and malevolent sorceress hecubah and he cant go home until he does
he can choose to follow the path of the warrior conjurer or wizard each with its own attributes skills and challenges
your character is always male but if you have something against the name jack you can change it along with other physical attributesi started out as a warrior because thats usually the easiest character to play in these adventurerpg hybrid games since you have plenty of brawn to hack and slash your way through the foes while toting about practically everything you come across
it soon became apparent that enough money to enable purchase of the really cool stuff is hard to come by especially if you want to keep your weapons and armour in good shape
even if you tote about all you can carry it doesnt raise much when you get to a shop
also one of the areas is practically impossible to negotiate without ranged weapons which are prohibitively expensive and you dont find many on corpses or in chests
the warrior has no magic skills at all and is dependent on food and potions for healing and curing
you can only carry a limited amount at once and you always seem to run out at critical momentsi left my warrior in the castle and started out again as a conjurer as id read in some reviews that this is the most diverse and interesting character to play
well i havent played as a wizard and probably wont but playing the conjurer is great fun
you visit the same places but have quite different challenges and meet different people
a conjurer can use bows crossbows and staves can wear leather armour some you find in the latter stages are pretty cool and has heaps of offensive defensive and healing magic at his disposal
the most interesting spell enables you to charm animals to assist you and later you can even summon them to help
your great midgame foe the mimic is a worthy ally when summoned especially against the vampire lichs
in one of noxs great ironies monsters in the conjurer game drop heaps of ranged weapons that a warrior would kill for but which are useless to the conjurer and raise hardly any cash
id advise not to buy arrows as you find more than enough in the latter stages and you can use the cash for better purposes
and carry a few spare sets of armour into the final chapter as youll go through it quickly and any armour is better than nonenox has often been compared with diablo and while i can see why that comparison can be drawn i would liken it more to revenant
like revenant it has a good story line very impressive graphics and a very simple control system
but it leaves both diablo and revenant floundering in its wake since it has a pleasing amount of gameplay acceptable voice acting challenging but not impossible puzzles and a satisfactory ending
i wasnt having much success in the final showdown so i restored and tried a different approach always take note of your latest find  its often a clue to defeating your next foe
that time hecubah could not withstand the concerted attack and after a great little final cut scene jack and the tv were restored to earthid read that nox is very fast and boy was that an understatement
battles in this game particularly in the latter stages needs amazing reflexes something im not overly endowed with
however i am blessed with cunning and persistence and after my character died three or four or even ten times id managed to figure out the puzzle or a good strategy against the monsters
some of the later monsters move with lightning speed often only needing one hit to splatter jack and his gear all over the screen so a wellpositioned charmed or summoned ally makes an excellent distraction allowing jack the nanosecond needed to get off a good shot or spell i didnt have much success with bombsi loved nox but since ive revised my personal scoring system i can only give it  stars
im saving  for that really unforgettable game and although nox was great fun it really was too similar to diablo and revenant to outscore themim a huge fan of rp games and review a ton of them  atfirst glance this game seems like a ripoff of many other games outthere
diablo or baldurs gate anyonewhat original ideas
you can be a warrior conjurer or wizard
you come from earth youre sent into another dimension where you are the only hope
even worse youre a male from a florida trailer park whose idea of fun is crushing beer cans against his forehead while rebuilding truck engines
lets talk about the antigoodgaming idealhowever when you start up the game the graphics amaze you
the whole sparkling mouse the smooth graphics on all the select screens and then the game play graphics
simply amazing
barrels are not just background decoration they are all discreet individual objects
rocks skulls you name it  all individual objects that can be moved aroundthe enemies all have personalities
the three factions all have distinct reasons for existing and are in conflict with each other
the comments are humorous and the individuals have personality
i suppose at times the coders can overcome even the most inane marketers when it comes to game designthe spells are great
the conjurer my favorite character type has a pixie swarm to help defend him and can have various creatures hang out with him as sort of a roving company of friends
i like the wolves and spiders myself but you can acquire just about any enemy out there to hang out with you and help protect youthe training levels are easy to get the hang of
i dislike the coneofvision because even if you were just in a room you suddenly forget where everything is in it  even the walls  and have to visit again to make sure you didnt miss anything
if you swing by a room it draws it as a complete room so its difficult to tell from maps where you have been and where you have just passed byalso save games are limited and you cant describe them at all
they simply list the character name and actual time  making it quite difficult for a multigamer household like mine to keep characters separatedthere are other minor bugs  icons dont consistantly draw in and multiplayer bugs are slightly annoying
the game itself is way too short when played in single player mode
multiplayer gets old really quickly as you run around trying to kill each other over and over again
how about cooperative quests like in bgin general though the graphics and gameplay on this game are quite better than i had expected from a game that touted maleonly characters
if only they had put a bit of effort into thinking about the people playing this game and what they would want to play
i would have rated this game extremely highly instead of only reasonably high
worth renting to play through but not a keeperi randomly thought of this game and when i wanted to buy it i came here
it was wellpriced and i enjoyed playing this gamedefinitely
most people will agree that ultima  had the makings of being the best rgp of all time if it werent for the insane system requirements and the frustrating bugs
so how does the game play now that technology and patches have caught upwell almost exactly the same
the game is still the most beautiful i have ever seen even compared to todays standards
some fps are put to shame and no other rpg comes close
the rendered backgrounds of baldurs gate are nice but the d environments in ultima  give you a sense of size and granduer that bg can never communicate
the story is also fascinating and deeply satisfying one of my top  rpg favorites
the characters and themes are the most human ive ever experienced
to see the already rich world of britania made deeper and more wonderful by a factor of  easily is fascinatingthe system requirements are still steep
i have a p mb ram and a voodoo  agp
i like to run the game on maximum settings with fsaa x stunning btw and it still chokes in a city
changing the resolution turning off fsaa or reducing the detail has no effect in the framerate
only by shortening the fog distance can i play effectively in a town like britan
i also tried playing with mb ram and noticed no improvements when i moved to mb
i would guess that mhz cpu is the minimum required to really enjoy this game
you can still play it on something slower and still see the utter beauty of the game but youll have to fiddle with the settings oftenfinally unfortunately the bugs are still there although greatly reduced
the game rarely crashes no more often than most other games these days
however i did find a showstopping bug where an npc refused to acknowledge a quest i completed
i couldnt continue and none of my saved games helped i had a lot of them
i was forced to start over from the beginning after making it halfway through already
infinitely frustrating
i had the latest patch too and since origin has stated that they will no longer be supporting the game we can expect no more patches everso now what
if you are a big ultima or rpg fan and you have a system similar to mine definitly get this game now
otherwise wait another year and play it a ghz machine with mb ram and a voodoo   it will still be beautiful next fall
but definitely play this gameid highly recommend this game but with one caveat make sure you get the patch and expect some troubleshooting even after you get the quotlastest bugfreequot buggy versionthe game itself is awesome and has a very solid plot line behind it
the avatars voice sounds  well gradeb acting but the script is pretty good and largely to the  point
the graphics which are generally excellent get kind of choppy when  youre in town however so a highend machine is recommended im running  on a piii  ram
there are also plenty of welldone cutscenes a  personal musthave which keep you interested in the game and allow for  additional plot developmentdont expect flawless performance but do  expect a great and enjoyable gamewhile this certainly isnt the best game in the ultima series it is a notable title
long time fans will notice the avatar seems a bit underinformed as a character in this entry
while this seemed odd it wasnt a game breaker and the story while more simplistic was still enjoyable
i believe they did this with the dialogue options to appeal to a wider base of players who arent as familiar with ultima
the wide array of weapons and armor in the game was nice as well as the games special effects
i especially enjoyed the graphic cleansing of the shrines and animated cut scenes
many complain about the voice acting but i actually enjoyed it
a lot goes into voice acting and it dramatically increases the cost of the games development
i think it was a welcome addition and a nice touch in an ultima game
i also felt britannia translated nicely to d
today you can install nice community mods like beautiful britannia that make the game look great even by modern standards
i highly recommend playing with the official strategy guide for an additional old school treat
it really made the game more enjoyable for me and i was able to use the dungeon maps referencing the walkthrough when i was stumped
i havent used one with a game in years and it was a lot of funthis game isnt without its flaws though
it is incredibly buggy and even with the fully patched version you need to do some ini tweaks to get it to run smoothly with minimal crashes
there were a couple confusing things about the story too like lord blackthorn working for the guardian
that didnt make sense seeing that blackthorn was supposedly a good man corrupted by the shadowlords back in ultima v all of a sudden he sides with the evil while no longer under the shadowlords influenceall things considered this is not the perfect conclusion to the avatars story but it is a fun game worth your time
if you like ultima give it a try and go into it with an open mind forming your own opinion
the haters really need to lighten upi once wrote saying this game would not work on newer operating systems and the only pcs capable were the new ones yet xppro still plays it quite well you will need to avoid raid however and icd errors are more frequent
some bugs are very bad even as of now but it is not a showstopper
thier are unaddressed or unspoken except in a hushed wisper bugs not anywhere addressed onlinemuch like microsofts hiding there error message knowledge from the public
the ultima bugs are not a big deal yet somewhat annoying if in the spirit of the game as karma hits in uncalled for places jumping a chasm in despise can knock you for a few points  if your lucky  if your unfortunate
this can happen before getting the wurm armur in pit or after comeing back this way out
defeats the purpose of being anything but a ranger
low karma anyway
also you are not supposed to be able to steal eggs from the gargoyle queen but you can just fly down her backside granny shortsnot a pretty site and get one not incurring a karma hit that lb made such a big deal about implementing in his clue book interveiw
more bugsthough more on laughable comedy but detracting the avatar kan sit in chairs kan
as in on the backs not the seat
i misspelled on purpose herbert
the mines of mynok also disengage your input devicesnamely keyboard and mouse and cause you to cntrl alt to desktop
toolbelt disapearence possiblethough unlikely
if keagan doesnt sell you that third map your seafaring days are over
yep its a bug without his chartshe must sell you map  before hand your captancy is landed and so is your game
lubber
freeromaing abilty is present but not a good idea this game runs on a linear path of evnets if you traverse magincia via swimming or yew without the open pass youll blotch up the plot as it isnt intelligent enough to accept this as an alternative
very disney in game intellect
but most annoying is icd error a showstopper if youve reloaded as much as i have
patch f and f unofficial
makes your tired of playing
it happens more frequently as time goes on and eventually so often you dont have time to even save the gameonce every  seconds at later stages
in windows another conspiracy bug a white desktop cursor ackompanies your game gauntlet cursorugly and the humility movie cuts out to a permanant condition of your pcthe white cursor shows up in all ddglnon voodoo fx games from then on
i told ea of this in  and the punky boarish teen on the phone said as predicted well i aint never saw nuttn like that happen
what are you talkn bout dude
the exact words
very evil
ea is to games as disney is to amimatinon tv
and holiwood to moves and so ontaking place at the same time as the movie this game immerses you in an  amazing cyberpunk world filled with odd characters
the settings are  stunning the music haunting and the gameplay rarely disappointsthough the game boasts a quotreal timequot world most events wait for  you to do something before occurring bombs wont blow up until you get  there etc
but there are times when you have to do something quickly or  youll lose your chance to do it chasing and catching someone so you can  pursue a dialogue treeat times also the puzzles and gameplay were a  little simplisticbut the story always carried it on in my opinion
you  wanted to know what would happen next even if you had to do some silly  tasks to find out what
as for content a little violence youre a cop  after all a little bit of scantily clad female cgi flesh and a bit of  swearingnothing over the top
play it even if you havent seen the  movieyoull probably want to after you finish the game thoughthere are two things to think about when talking about this game
one is the game mechanics themselves and one is the execution of the look and feel of the game
on the former the game lacks but as far as the way the game looks and sounds you will be hard pressed to find a computer game that puts you this deeply into a franchise
blade runner is this kind of gamewestwood studios decided to take a stab at the blade runner franchise and make a game so true to the movie that you would be hard pressed to tell the difference
i think they succeeded in this
they do it in three ways plot or story structure visuals and sound
all of which holds onto an important credo be true to the source materialthe plot itself puts you in the blade runner world as a rep detec a blade runner on the hunt for a group fugitive replicants
apparently this is all happening at the exact same time as the movie events as well kinda like two different cases going on in the department
the mood and manner of the story is well done and they brought in a wealth of talent to do with voice acting including a few from the original movie sean young brion james william sanderson and more
add some really nice cut scenes and you get a pretty theatrical experience
one scene where you walk out of your apartment balcony so see the city streets and skyline is almost worth playing the game alonethe visuals are stunning for when the game was made
actually they still are
the backgrounds are prerendered with some interaction here and there
while that sounds like it makes a rather static game it does mean when you walk into a familar blade runner movie location you really feel it
down to the little details the background visuals really inspirewhile the visuals are great i think what really makes the difference in this game is the sound
i think this game takes full advantage of having  channels of audio and if it doesnt it sure does sound like it
every location you go to is filled with environmental sounds
this more than anything else sucks you into the setting
add to that the occasional cues from the vangelis soundtrack which mixes in perfectly by the way plus the incredible voice acting and the audio experience in breathtaking
even with two speakers its incredible
add some surround sound and you will get lost in the gameokay thats all the good stuff about the game but i did say the actual game play was merely average
i meant that
the game is incredibly static
while you can travel all over the place and see the beautiful sites and sounds which is a good thing if you think about it the game will not progress until you take a specific action or interview a specific person
you play a detective in the game but since the game is so linear you really dont get a chance to stretch your detecting skills muchalso while the backgrounds and static images or animations are incredible westwood made a compromise and decided to reduce the resolution of the items that are more dynamic so more people with average systems at the time could enjoy the game
the end result is you are a very pixelated character and the characters you interact with are just as pixellated
while shading is not too bad on your pixelled self any time you compare with the backgrounds the difference is painfully obviousso the game had pixelled characters and very linear gameplay
thats not the reason to get it
the reason to buy blade runner is to get yourself immersed in the blade runner universe
this more than anything else is what the accomplishes in spadeswell im not going to go in and restate everything from all the other reviews on here im just interjecting my  cents
the multiplayer system is great the base wars battles are wonderful everything is great except one little thing that just bugs the heck out of me
remember if you will or just pretend if you never played the game wing commander   one ship the arrow a light interceptor had an ability called the slide which enhanced its dogfighting abilities
well every ship in this game can do that
theres more though there is a ship addon called lateral thrusters in the game which allow youer ship to strafe side to side
basically with both of these aspects being redilly available to every ship in the multiplayer campaigns you have dogfights turning into odd forays which much resemble circle strafing matches in any number of first person shooter style games
to me it takes alot of fun out of a flight sim to not be able to dogfight but thats just my opinionfirst of all this review is assuming that the game works on your computer
i read some of the other reviews below and heard about how this game isnt compatible with some graphics cards or whatever
if that were the case id haved to give this game one star
but since this game did run perfectly well on my machine heres what i have to say about it
the only space sim that ive played other than tachyon is xwingan old vga gamebut in many ways xwing was the turning point in space sims
the graphics in tachyon are really good if somewhat redundant
what i mean is that sometimes i see the same patterns and textures on space stations
speaking of space stations i was most impressed by their size
the people at novalogic really did an outstanding job at scaling things correctly
but what really got me to buy this game was the fact that you could buy different ships and decide what armament and upgrades you want to put on it
certain ships have a certain amount of slots and the possible combinations are nearly endless
another nice feature is that you can own multiple ships at once or sell individual ships or parts for money
you can hire wingmen to assist you on missions
since there is no inflight camera its hard to tell if your wingmen did anything to help you but at least they dont die easilyeven the poorer pilots
there are several external view but i didnt find them very helpful
they should have put a gunsight on the external view so that you could fly through the mission accomplish it and enjoy the scenery at the same time
the game is sorta nonlinear
you get to choose which level mission you want to undertake but ultimately you will end up doing the others
the missions are fairly simple and varied which is nice
i remember that xwing was downright frustrating at times
by the way there are cheats for this game so if you get stuck look em up
the levels with the fog are interesting although they can be a strain on the eyes and disorientating at times
but thats not until the end
there are some cutscenes but nothing truly original or amazingtheyre still the ingame graphics
this game could have been better but overall id say its worth its price
but id check to make sure it can run on your machine firstgood game however i do have a problem
if you have a vodoo sound card you might get a whole lot of echo in your speakersmade all the better by the fact that it doesnt seem to take itself too seriously
bruce campbell is the voice of the main character
of course it isnt that seriousthe gameplay though is pretty good
the fighters are decently customizable and the combat is fun and engaging
the story takes a turn at one particular mission and you cant go back so i recommend saving before that missionwhen it debuted the game had multiplayer but i dont know if it still doesthe graphics are pretty and colorful and the sound effects are well donenow its dated but if you find this in the bargain bin dont pass it up starsthe listed price as with many hitgamingcom sold games is rather inflatedi got this game some time ago as a gift and even though i was never a fan of this type of game  i loved it
the graphics are great gameplay is challenging but not impossible and there are several tutorials that take you through the basics of the game
another big plus is the game doesnt take itself too seriously
using bruce campbell for voiceovers was a brilliant idea and brought a spark of life and humor to the gamethey also created a backstory for the game  a consistant well thought out one
its nice to be able to choose your missions and who you want to fight for
one of my biggest beef with these types of games is the lack of choices you just jump through the hoops
theres still a little of that in this game but not enough to detract from the positivestake conflict freespace polish up the alreadygorgeous graphics and you have freespace 
essentially a rerun of the original this adds new ships new weapons at least one outstanding graphical effect capital  ships now attack each other with beam weapons  giant shafts of light  that cut through ships like a hot knife through butter and some new  cutscenes all wrapped up in a sturdy cardboard box
at the risk of  souding boring if you liked the original youll like this as its more  of the same  the controls and interface are identical and its just as  derivative of xwing and wing commander as it ever was with an  emphasis on fast action and spectacular effects
it has absolutely no  depth and very little replay value the missions are often  tightlyscripted and replaying them is often quite dull as you know  exactly whats about to happen but its the best combat flight simulator  on the market
one tip  try and play the original first as this game  doesnt usher you into the flow of play gradually it drops you right in  the thick of things from the first missionthis is the best star trek simulation ive played and ive been looking for a good one since the early s
many ship designs and the ability to customize them several races to play good graphics and welldone music and sound effects
nothing like catching an enemy in a tractor beam and slugging it out while transporting marines onto his ship
the tutorials are also very informative
there are some problems with the game though
in one of the federation scenarios i couldnt win without sacrificing a ship though i should have been able to use a tractored enemy ship as the sacrifice
the game is a firstclass flight simulator but not much else
you dont really get a sense that moving about the galaxy changes the game in any meaningful way
also even though you have crew members who have names they are nothing more than statistical probabilities that can help or hinder game play not communicative crew members
after finishing all of the scenarios which i have not i imagine this game does not have much replay value beyond customized skirmishes that you can create
altogether the price of this game makes it a good value and probably one of the better games in the starfleet command serieswell bugs bugs an more bugs 
fun game to playa little bit on the boring side at times
game play is ok interfact is good  read the book
but it a way to easy to quotwinquot i give this a high rating because it is fun to play an i am a big fan but this is a game that people should take a little time with an make sure that they get the updatesim a big fan of baldurs gate and the fallouts so naturally i went and bought the next series planescape torment
what i was confronted with was a game rich in storyline and graphic detail but on the playability end as  compared to the other rpgs released by interplay i knew issues were at  hand
the game runs slow sometimes even if you have a super pc and the  patch is virtually a must if you want fully enjoy the gamefirst and  foremost i am a huge fan of bioware
i think they have done wonders for  both pc rpgs and  also bringing adampd to the computer
but after i  was a few hours into the game i was hit with the cold similarity that  planescape torment was very easily compared to the fallout series
it  seemed to me strongly that the planescape torment setting was awfully close  to the fallout games
im not too much into conspiracies but ill put my  money on it that this game was a result of a dropped project to make  fallout  using the baldurs gate engine
the graphics the screen font  the dark settings they all fit fallout
this was a bummer to me and i  almost felt like i was playing a thrown together project saved by a team of  fans from the planescape settingbut i cant let that ruin the game
it is a very intelligent game and certainly not one for kids in terms of  understanding and content
the dialogue and intrigue are very intense and  do make you part of the game and your character much more than almost any  game ive played before
that is not an easy feat for a pc gamemy  final analysis is that this may not be a game for fans of baldurs gate or  fallout and with the later fans you will absolutely see what im saying  when comparing planescape to the postapocalyse setting
that is where my  fifth star dissapeared to
all in all this is an excellent roleplaying  game but not for all rpg fans
this is a thinking game not a combat  game
a job well done once again at biowareif youve ever played baldurs gate this game should be fairly familiar to  you
it uses the tsr dampd rules although instead of having your stats  rolled out for you it assigned a certain number of points you have to  spend and many of the creatures that inhabit the dampd worldyou play  the nameless one a man who dies and comes back to life over and over  again
you have bo idea who you are or what youre doing and have nothing  to guide you except a note tattooed on your back telling you to go visit a  man named pharod
from there youre plunged into a great long adventure  all about finding out who you are and how you came to be what you  arethe perspective is akin to baldurs gate and diablo although unlike  those games there are no multiplayer capabilities
you still are able to  pick up companions in the game such as morte the floating talking skull  annah the red haired halfdemon woman with a rats tail ignus the fire  elemental and many others
all of them have their own skills and their  own personalities
quite often theyll bicker at each other
i really  loved the myriad of subquests in this game that you can run through or  avoid at your leisure and also the fact that most of the experience points  earned in the game come from talking to people and discovering new things  instead of just bashing lots of monsters  although there are plenty of  monsters to bash as wellas you progress your actions determine what  alignment your characters is and you have the option of being a fighter a  mage or a thief as you progress
its a really great game with plenty to  do and tons of entertainment timeand remember to ask yourself  quotwhat can change the nature of a manquotfor the last couple of years people have been patiently awaiting the release of  i found out that the same makers of those two great games where releasing an rpg in my favorite campaign setting i almost soiled myself with gleetorment uses the baldurs engine but dont be the setting is not the sword and sorcery genre you are used too
in fact to me it seems to have more of the quirkiness of fallout than the straitforward dampd elements of baldurs
there are few weapons choices and ive never even worn any armor but you wont miss any of thatthe main pc is a recently resurrented immortal and his first ally is a floating skull
i have almost finished the game and my weapon of choice through most of it was my own severed arm
how can you not love thatthe only reason im not giving the game  stars is because for my system i found it quite buggy
i suffered lots of lockups and assertion errors as well as the occasional graphics glitch
the third disk had trouble loading at times as welli still highly recommend this game and i commend black isle for putting the rp back into rpg
the setting and story are compelling and unpredictable and the party members are rich and interesting instead of just someone to hold your treasure
so if you are biting your nails in anticipation for diablo  give torment a try and if you havent already try baldurs and fallout you will be glad you diddecent graphics but a little slow in areas especially with multiple spells going off at once
besides that pretty good plot decent leveling ability and very nice fighting
i think youll enjoy
just be sure to  have a d graphics card enabled and some decent ramwell if you havent figured it out yet from the other reviews the player assumes the role of an immortal searching for his identity
so the game exhibits a dark shadow of death and rebirththis fact kind of hits home with me
a little over a year ago i was in a crippling auto accident broke my neckspinal injury where i could have easily been killed
so the games theme is a bit creepy to me at times and gets me thinking that im not afraid of dyingbut on to game playwith the ability to play your character the way you want good or evil and to answer dialogue questions with truths lies or playing dumb torment will play different every time
also in character generation want to be a fighter
gear up on strength dexterity and constitution
want to be a mage gear up on intelligence wisdomi especially love the verbal taunts after a critical hit or misseslike quotdiequot quotdid you see thatquot and quotdamnquot the special effects are cool too
spells healing animations critical hits and suchthe story line is complex and drawingly addictive
its nothing to spend a half a day to play thru a relatively small portion of the game with its numerous questswhich provide you more experience than the hacking coming out shortly
well have to wait and seei have to admit i was a bit concerned at the outset aside from lords of magic ive never been too big on games where you control only one character in your party and the lack of ability to select an original class had me a bit worried
wrong i was
this is definitely a keeperthe premise is a bit like that of the film mirage your character wakes up with no memory and has to figure out where he is and what hes doing there
the quotwherequot part comes along pretty quickly hes in sigil the home of planehopping extraterrestrials and weird beings from other planes
the quotwhyquot is the true meat of the game and its quite nice that while the developers were working so hard at tweaking the games responses to be tailormade to your character they didnt forget to include a plot compelling enough to bring players back to the game day after dayif you havent picked it up yet especially if youve played the other games using the inifinty engine give it a shot
its different enough from them to hold your interest but similar enough that your learning curve should be next to zerothis was not in a big box with a manual as advertised
hence the four stars and not five
the game itself is extremely addictive for those that love playing the dd games
very creative and thoughtful writingive never played a tomb raider game until i bought this a month ago and i was really impressed
the graphics are a bit too blocky and choppy the controls take a bit of getting used to and laura doesnt always seem to do what i want her to but i loved the challenge of it all
the puzzles have found that right balance of being challenging without making you rip your hair out trying to figure it out
ive not looked at a cheat book yet and im pretty far into the game already
granted i dont have all the secrets on each level but ill go back and do that later
the cinemas are done very nicely as well
the game creates a lot of its mood by suprising you with baddies popping out when you least expect it
more than once ive been startled and hit the wrong key just to see laura die
but with a smile on my face i just start from my last save and have at it again
and thats another thing you can save at any time you want
big plusif youre into games at all you have to give this a try
ive been pulled into the game completely but others comments are keeping me away from the sequals
buy this the original and prepare for an adventure youll never forgettip  make sure you know what kind of sound card you have installed on your computer because you have to tell the game which kind to use
it took me a few days to figure out which one i had installedthis is a very smart soldier sim  less anal than rainbow six but much stricter than delta force
you guide a set of ww sas commandos through a set of superblydesigned where eagles darestyle missions whilst being  shot at by extremely accurate nazi guards
after a short while getting used  to the game controls your soldiers move around realistically  unlike  other games they dont glide effortlessly over the ground you can order  your men around fight effectively plant bombs and do all kinds of  commando things
the tension is palpable the presentation is excellent  especially the music performed by a proper orchestra and the chance to  act out childhood fantasies with a captured mp is irresistablethat  said it could have been a lot better
the initial release was bugged to  blue blazes and despite a patch it still feels shaky
the ai makes lots  of odd mistakes your soldiers are unusually flimsy particularly on uneven  ground where they tend to trip and fall and die and the enemy soldiers  are unfeasibly hyperaccurate from a maplength away
furthermore a couple  of the endofepisode missions are ferociously unfairly tough and  youll probably cheat out of frustrationstill when it works its one  of the best games around  combining lots of tense sneaking with moments of  violent action and excellent varied mission designsmy friend and i have been longing for a game like this for years
and finally in the summer of  illusion softworks a czechbased software company has created such a game
one of my favorite missions is an  assault on a bunker base defended by a network of trenches and mg machine  guns
now which movie did that come from
the final mission is awesome
sneak thru an airfield at the end of the war with the russians attacking on  the other sidesound effects are great
makes you feel like youre  there
as with the airfield mission you see antiaircraft fire snake thru  the sky just like baghdad babygranted the initial release had many  many bugs
but with several patches most bugs have been worked out
be  sure and get the v patch which has seemed to fix some problems that v  created
ie
the m rifle now fires again but with a round clip which  is historically accurate anyway
in v it wanted to reload without ever  shooting
soldier ai has been greatly improved on both sides as well
however the dead bodies still just hang in midair if shot on slanted  terrain
mouse sensitivity has been improved alsoim awaiting the new  devils bridge addon coming around the end of the month which will take  the campaigns to locales like greece poland and battle of the buldge
this addon includes  new missions across  huge campaignsthis is the best flight simulator microsoft has ever produced there no doubt about that excellent graphics new features such as gps navigation more airports worldwide better weather system and easier to  use
there is a downside to all this i think the consumer should know
the  speed of the game is noticably slower compared with ms flightsim  and  below very glitchy allaround
i could not seem to speed it up usually  averages around  frames per sec even with setting the detail settings  lower
to put it in perspective i have a pii mhz computer with mb of  ram and a mb dfx voodoo d accelerator card
i even bought the  accelerator card to see if it would speed it up it barely does
i am  recommending anyone who wants to buy this program and likes a fast  nonglitchy game to be aware that if your computer has a processor below  mhz you will not like what you see microsoft says that you must have  a mhz minimum
ha
you wouldnt even be able to fly the graphics would  be so slowto recap if you want the game to run smoothly you should  atleast have a mhz pii system with atleast mb of ram and i would  recommend getting some kind of video accelerator card if you dont already  have one and if your serious about performance
if you just want to  play and dont really care about the slow speed go with microsofts  recommendation about having a mhz processor system or higher
it will be  very slow but will workoverall this is a very good game and would  recommend for anyone
also makes a great giftaoe is one of the best on its genre still is so damn popular on the multizone no matter if you play the solo missions or the standard games you will get a thrill
as always its an excellent companion to many of our quotlonely nightsquot
maybe the only thing is on the multiplayer option which is sometimes a little bit complicated
anyway this game is a must for your collectionoverall this game rocks
the gameplay is superb and the graphics rock thte house
the one thing of the game that i do not like is that you cannot build a lot of buildings
it can be very annoying if you want to build a big city
this game is a little like the game startcraft if anyone of you played thataoes excitement isnt as high as other games but in order to win all the campains you need to have a strategy
wheter getting to a place or other taks all of them need planning
if you want to defeat another town without any cheasts you have to creat a certain amount of villagers to work for you
this game is really good but why dont they have buildings from age of empires  like the goverment center
well here is a overview of what i think of this gamegraphics the games graphics are pretty good
it may not have the best graphics but okgameplayexcellent
this game isnt that exciting if you know what i mean but can last you some timevaluemoderate high
this game wont last forever but will last a very long timeconcept great campains
i would give it a this game is fabulous
get itstart with villagers some resources a town center and build up you little outpost into a great center of trade diplomacy and a place where enemies who want what you have are going to destroy you
this is what age of empires  is all about
you start from scratch with just some mere villagers
you gather up resources to build an army to conqueror and defend
its really like all realtime strategy games
however unlike some of its counterparts ahem cough starcraft  warcraft cough  it has a lot of the same buildings and lots of the same core units
in warcraft and starcraft every race has different resources gatherers whereas in age of empires you always have the same villager
in aoe the only differences between races would be unique units and unittech trees
each race has their own econonic boosts and disadvantages
the unittech tree that i am talking about is that each race can make a certain unit and research a certain technology that another race cannot
for example  the chinese can build bombard towers but the celts cannot
the chinese can build camels while the celts cannot
however celts can research much stronger infantry technology including weapons and armor advancements while the chinese cannot
overall you will have lots of fun playing this game no matter if you have played both starcraft and warcraft previouslyi have to admit the original game didnt really impress me all that much
so i wasnt holding out very high hopes for the sequel
so you can imagine my stunned surprise when i found out that age of empires  aoe was a  surprisingly good gamethe biggest improvement in the game was the user  interface
i think aoe has the most advanced user interface ever  introduced in a realtime strategy game
it makes it extremely easy to  control the formation and behaviour of your troops and queing units is a  snapthe second strength is the ai which along with dark reign is the  most complex in any game todate
the ai will respond to attacks on its own  bases and it will send large strike forces against your armieshowever aoes greatest weakness is its lack of a cohesive  singleplayer campaign
instead of a series of missions linked with a  cohesive storyline you have several separate campaigns each centering  around a different empire
so the missions are more like skirmishes than  really cohesive campaigns
regrettably starcraft is still the king when it  comes to singleplayer campaignsfor the above stated reason i must  remove one star
other than that aoe is a game every discerning computer  strategy gamer should have on their pcthis game is an awesome demonstration of what life was like in the middle ages
the thrill of watching your small village grow into a mighty empire is very cool
the scenerios are historically accurate fun  play and most importantly challenging yet possible
a great overall gamethis is by far one of the best realtime strategy games available
the game style is superbly unique and even shames the classic quotwarcraft iiquot
the many different types of units buildings and technologies makes the game very interesting for a long period of time and the difficulty of the missions makes this a game that will remain on your hard drive for at least several months are you purchase it
even the experienced gamer will find quotage of empires iiquot difficult and the newbie will probably be at it for quite some time
i played most of the missions on the quoteasiestquot setting and they were still quite challenging and addictiveyou have several various options within the game
first you can play tour of duty campaigns in which you play as various civilizations the celts and franks to name a few against different kind of enemies
these missions are generally the most difficult part of the game and most have you at them for hours before you finally come out the victor
the other two sections of the game are multiplayer which you can play over a network or on the internet and custom campaigns which let you play against the computer in a multiplayer style gaming environment
in this type of game you get to pick any one of the  different civilizations to be all of which have unique strengths and weaknesses
its quite fun to go through each civilization researching new weapons and upgrades to see which fits you the besteven though quotage of empires iiquot is beginning to be dated the game is still excellent and worth the money
this will be one to go down as a quotclassicquot very similar to quotwarcraft iiquot
a definite buyage of empires age of kings is definately one of the better realtime stratagy games on the market at this time
the graphics are very good giving the game a fun edge to it that will keep you hooked as you play
there are many modes that you can play either start your own war trading with your allies and battling your enemies
or protecting your king and defeating all of the other fiefdoms before they destroy you
but you can also play as joan of arc or barbarossa playing missions and liberating france
this game is fun but it does have a few drawbacks
alliances with people are hard to keep
the gameplay is a little difficult making you keep an eye on  places at once
also as your town progresses you can make your town better by moving forward in quotagesquot
there arent nearly enough of these more would make the game more inviting and fun to play
also there is not nearly enough different types of weapons ie
soldiers calvaryetc but this game is definately engaging and could easily pass a few hours of boredomthis is one of my favorite computer games around
the graphics are great and the gameplay is terrific
i love all the different empires you can control everything from british to chinese
the strategy is much the same  as the first installment of age of empires but if it aint broke dont fix  it
lots of fun with this onefor any of you history buffs out there this is the game for you
not only is the the gameplay easy to follow and understand the visuals and sounds are great
the campaign modes are actually fun to play
whats up with that
the game is real easy to pick up and the many different difficulty settings alows you to get better slowly not get frustrated and bite you mouse in halfwhen i first played age of empires i knew the nd one would be a hell of alot better than the first
it was so much better
the resolution was better the castle age and imperial age are an excellent add on
the dark age and fudel are just like the ones in age of empires 
the new weapons buildings castles are my favorite
this game has no end to the limits
multiplayer is so much fun except when there is lag
this game deserves to be honored with  stars because of its authentic gameplayi stumbled upon this game about a year or two ago and i strongly recommend it even if you have never experienced a strategy type of gameyou are the unseen ruler of one of  uinque ancient civilizations
your objective is to either strive to conquer with a strong military find and bank three religious relics or build a wonder to increase the prestige of your civilization
each time you play you can pick which civ
you want to be what civ
your enemies and allies are what objective you are to meet the difficulty level the location of your game how many resources you start out with and what age  dark feudal feudal castle umperial your civ will begin in
oh and dont forget about your population limitbut dont think accomplishing this is so easy
everything has a price to pay in this game and without a large team of villagers to boost the economy your civilization will not last for long
even so a strong loyal miltary is also needed to defend and protect you at all times
and dont forget each time you play more suprises await youhold your breath theres more
along with a general quotrandom mapquot mode comes a few very exciting campaigns where you become jonah of arc barbarossa genghis khan william wallace and moreoh boymore
although i never have gotten into creating and editing my own scenarios and custom campaigns that doesnt mean you wont
tahts right along with everything else comes a unique feature which allows you to edit premade scenarios or cr eate your ownandif this is your first time with a strategy game a strongly advise you to play the tutorial which gasp comes along with the game as well
keep in mind though that each civilization has its own pros and cons and each civ
comes with its own unique military unitand if all of this just isnt enough for youthan buy the expansion packthis game is so much better then aoe
first it has super graphics and great gameplay
it is very replayable bc it comes with a random map generator
there are only a couple problems on my mgz ram it gets pretty slow after you get to around  units
also it can get sort of boring if you play it a lot
all in all this game was worth its money
i suggeset that you buy itive had this game for a week
i finally picked it up played it and explored the game a bit
im still learning the game but heres the story how it is so farthe game is excellent
plenty of depth fun and many different units and buildings
each building has specific functions and people it can create making the game all the more intricate and exciting
you can research quotnewquot technologies and go from the dark age through the imperial age
the game is a nonstop blastbut waitit is much more fun to play on the msn gaming zone
you can actually talk to your allyallies and chat and trade resources make strategies etc
you cant entirely do this with the computer
i love playing with other people because it adds that much more excitement
heres how to play with other people via the internetgo to zonemsncom click sign in
if needed get a free msn passport
next in the games list click age of empires ii
it will ask to install the msn gaming zone
click yes
after its done click age of empires ii
select a game room i preffer hunt the royal and youll see big icons for various games
click join on one game room
when the host is ready the game will be launched and youll be ready for some fun
make sure you have age of empires ii in the cdrom drive when you go to the game zone
happy conqueringthere are enough rave reviews here to get the point across so i wont spend too much time
this game is addictive historically fascinating what if william wallace did do battle with genghis khan
 and very easy on the eyesthe graphics are crystal clear
just beware youll start playing and without realizing it the hours have flown by
the game never gets boring and offers dozens of scenarios
personal fave attacking with elephantsyou know youre in trouble when the first scenario after the tutorial pits you against three foes
if youve played a rts before its not that bad but if youre new to the genre its the deep end of the pool
true im more of a explore and build player but i was still disappointed with the difficulty of the campaigns
if a game wants to be difficult id prefer it be with good ai not swamping you with an early rush or overwhelming numbers
there is a simple formula to win most scenarios survive the early rush create a defense and assault the computer opponents one at a time and youll winthere are good things here a lot of them
huge maps and tech tree updated graphics and wellbalanced rockpaperscissors units
i also think the random scenario generator is great for a couple hours of playif youre new to realtime strategy it isnt the place to start
if you want to david vs goliath this game is for yougreat game
simple to manipulate and it makes you feel like you are god
great too if you like this age in historyim revising my original review where i originally gave this game  stars
after reading more about strategy and tactics i discovered that this game is much more fun than i gave it credit for
i realized that my own shortcomings were to blame and not the game
an excellent and fun addictive game that i recommend
this was my original reviewi only gave this  stars because it turns out i dont like realtime games as much as turnbased games
if youre like me and you dont like realtime games where everything moves super fast and you dont really have too much time to plan things out then you wont like this that much because you need to be quick on your feet
but if you like that kind of thing then youll love this
hope this helps
if you prefer turnbased try civilization iii have a fast computer
or my personal favorite call to power ii some people dont like this one as much but i love itmy first impression of the game wasnt all too great
i played it for a few days grew tired of it and went back to everquesti hit level  in everquest and realized there was nothing left to do the game was  pointless and more frustrating than anything
so i quit and decided to give  asherons call another shot
needless to say i had alot better time than  the firstasherons call is a great game if you give it a fair chance
the first few levels suck but after you get past the initial newbie levels  the game opens up and becomes very enjoyable
you get to control just about  every aspect of your characters development from his eye color to his  attributes and skillsi find the landscape and environment graphics to  be excellent but the charcter and enemies look a little rough
but if you  are looking for great graphics in an online game go to everquest
but if  you are looking for a fun productive and extremely large game with  limitless potential asherons call is the way to goasherons call is a massivley multiplayer game that will suck you in and keep you in
it is the bestor worst enemy of resposibility ever invented
but as with everything there are pluses and minusesmy  system recommendations windows  d graphics accelerator i use ati  ragepro run a pentium ii at  mhz or better with at least  mb of ram
connect at k via modem or go with dsl or cable otherwise youll pay  the price
i also recommend a nice sound card
the game comes with direct  x 
visuals the developers at turbine paid attention to the  details at the expense of your system
the d graphics and texturing  are fantastic but you must have a d graphics accelerator to enjoy themambience no annoyingly repetative soundtrack here
unlike other games  there is no background music
a wise decision by msturbine
there is no  muzak running  hours a day where i live and i like it that way
the  sounds that you do hear are birds chirping bees buzzing and monsters  coming at you
with a good sound card and d speakers or headphones you  can tell where a monster is before you even see itplayability  laughably simple interface
your hands do move from the keyboard to the  mouse but only when wandering around towns and talking with other players
in battle you can use the mouse by itself or go strictly with keybaord  commands
thank you turbine
game features includeconstantly  evolving world the game is alive
new quests come and go world altering  events happen new monsters appear to plague the human elementfully  customizable characters well you cant adjust hieght or wieght but you  can choose eye shape and color hair color and length or no hair skin  color clothing armor weaponry skills abilities you can have a  nicely unique characternew monsters no standard orcs and dragons  here
lots of different monsters with different attacks and weaknesses
you have to learn what works well on which beastiesno player  killing there is a specific game quotworldquot for playerkillers
you wont get bumped off by someone who wants your armor
helpful game  staff have a question
ask an advocate
stuck on a hillside
ask a  sentinel
the help line is built into the game interface
a plot yes  there is an everevolving plot on asherons call
in so many other online  games there is no plot
how can you have a rpg with no plotmassively multiplayer  a blessing and a curse
there are lots of people  who are willing to help you and answer any questions you might have
but  there are lots of people who are just waiting to trick you
and there are  lots of people
if you find a nice spot to hunt chances are you wont be  alonei love this game
it rates so much higher than eq or diablo in my  book
so why did i only give it  stars instead of 
too many  other players
to enjoy the true beauty of the game you need a  topofthe line computer
lousy premade character  quotclassesquot
you dont have to use them but they are a good place  to start
just dont use the template asis
youll hate your  characterdont bother with those other online rpgs asherons call is  the oneunfortunately the mega memory card only works when a battery is active in the cartridge which defeated my purpose
but i still use the card every time i savefirst of all im going to talk about the better of the  japans ffvi aka usas ffiii
aside from usas ffii this is the best final fantasy ever
this game was first released in the usa for the snes console
even then the music in this game was comparable to that of games played on the psx the bit sony system
the graphics are also great dimensional
besides that the story is awesome and the game will keep you busy for awhile
its a long one
theres so many twists and turns and things you can do in this game that its almost unbelievable
its a wonder why i didnt choose this one to be  instead of ffii
i guess its because in my mind ffii is the one that started the greatness of the ff series
since ffii the ff series has had a great story and the graphics started looking pretty good
not to bag on ffi but the story was rather weak and besides it was on the bit nintendo system
if you have been let down by any final fantasy youve ever played this is the one to play
theres so many different characters you can get in this game as well but you have to know how to get them
my favorite is the ninja because he has a mind of his own and you never know what hes going to say or domy second topic is japans ffv
the only reason i gave ff anthology  stars is due to the greatness of ffvi
this ffv game though in a word sucks
its the worst ff game i have ever played
the enemies are too difficult
they give you too many character jobs
and finally the game is just boring
the graphics arent any better than usas ffii if not worse
to me this game is like ff tactics crossed with ffii
i dont own this game anymore due to the fact that i already have ffiii for the snes console
if you dont have an snes or cant get your hands on ffiii then this game is a definite must just to play ffviquotthe game might as well stayed unreleasedquot  i dont agree with this at all
i personally appreciate the effort of square to give us this game  a game we otherwise would not have
ffa should be a game in your psx library
 for   cant beat that
i feel as though even quotnewschoolquot gamers who played ff first would find these games entertaining
now as far as the comment in the editorial about ff this game is the hardest in the series next to the ff that japan got for the original nes
the bosses are hard and mastering the job system in this game takes a lot of effort
try going through this game without dying on a few bosses and you can consider yourself an ff expertmy hats off to square for releasing these games to us hardcore gamers in north america
ff vi is arguably the best rpg in the bit genre and ff v technically being a new game to north america make this an unbeatable package
square must know this because theyre doing it again with final fantasy chronicles ff iv and chrono trigger
smart move if you ask me
gamers like me will be first in line to get this compilation when it comes out
meanwhile if you see this somewhere and you dont own it buy it
you wont regret itffv features a lone traveller a princess in search of her father an amnesiac old man and a pirate captain all of whom are called forth to defend the world from the destruction of the crystals of water wind fire and earth
the biggest feature in this game is the job systemyou can customize your characters job through gaining experience in each field
for instance i have a monk trained with the knights cover technique and a mage trained equally high in both white and black magic
while complaints that the story is transparent and childish do not go unfounded the gameplay itself is entertaining enough to make up for thatprosmonster battles while common are not so frequent that playing this becomes a chore in itselfthe job system is fun to play withthe characters are interesting and entertainingboss fights are challenging but not impossibleconsthe story as previously stated is very basic at times
it is deeper than ffx yet not as deep as ffxyou are restricted to  alternate ability this becomes very confining at timesas with most earlier ff games instruction tends to be rare if present at all
i have not played ffvi enough to make a judgement on itthis was an ok game or should i say games but i didnt find it nearly as addictive as the other final fantasies ive played
ffv was an ok addition to the series but the dialogue is awkward they didnt do a fantastic job translating on v or vi and the gameplay is more like a standard rpg than the final fantasy style
buy it if youre really into the ff series but if youre just starting out get ffvii firstthis game contains two classic final fantasy games
easy to play and a lot of fun also
see the games that led up to the current final fantasy seriesseeing as i had ffiiii on handhelds and ffviiffx on playstation  and  i was looking to flesh out the rest of themwell i love final fantasy v and the job system
final fantasy vi was not my cup of tea but still good the game freezes up after you beat the final boss
because of this i cant get the ending or to create a system file
the spell ultima deals k damage instead of  if the caster has a magic power of gamers get two of the deepest greatest rpgs ever created for less than the price of a single new game  its hard to argue with that sort of value
whether youve waited five years for final fantasy v or just finished your first final fantasy the final fantasy anthology is sure to entertain
jody bissoonboth these games are pretty goodreviewers may judge ff for being bad or something but it is because it is harder than other final fantasys
i think this is a great thing as you cant just use attack every round
the job and ability system is awesome
you can learn abilitys on jobs and use them for other jobs
you could have a sorcerer have the power to store one of his attacks
you could have a knight cast demi
you can have a barbarian who guards other members
it is really cool and fun as you stay with basically  characters
these  characters can change jobs and look different for each one
the fun thing is getting to choose who does what
the story is great as it should be
the characters interact and have personalitysnow i stopped playing ff half way through because it is much longer than other final fantasys
it also has a saving issue
sometimes when opening the save menu you will see the pixels go crazy
you have to exit the save menu a couple times or just select save by pressing down once than x  times
this bug is kinda annoying at times but it can be fixed
it does have high points though that should not be overlookedff is good
it has much better sprites
it is different though
you cant just have your  favorite characters as you will probably switch it up alot
i liked the characters but they do tend to become useless
most of them do
i never use cyan or whatever
the challenge is moderately hard
it is not as challenging as ff but more challenging than ff
there are a ton of summons
i read expert gamer sometimes and they have a whole page filled with summons in one issue
the battles are relatively fun but can be won easily with edgar
it is so easy to use tools that it is almost a joke
i stopped playing this one half way through also as i got distractedif you like classic d games these are pretty good
i am gonna finish ff after starting over and plan to do the same with  they are both good and the editor said quotff should of stayed unreleasedquot
when you say something like that you clearly did not play the game
it is innovative and fun
great value for  great gamesanthology is a great buyilike it cause its got one of my favorite games ever ff
truly a sweet game but lacking a little creativity when it came to some of the characters it is a game worth buying
now ff well thats a toughie i think its a decent game but my friends seem to think other wise cause of the pretty sad character design and graphicalization
the music cd is really not worth squares money i mean come on music that sounds like beepbeepbeepbeeep
yeahyou get my pointdo not pay  dollars for this game
it will come out sometime in december for  dollars because square will rerelease it as a greatest hits game
final fantasy s story kinda suks but the job system beats ffs materia system or any other type in any final fantasy game ive played
havent played all of ff  but it was pretty good
graphics not very good except opening and closing cgi at opening and closing of each game
havent seen end of  but others were cool
ff chronicles vagrant story and xenogears will also come out for this collection brings back two of great classic final fantasys
all though we all would have liked to see ff in this collection that will have to wait for the next collectionthe reason why most people would want to buy this is for ff which has only been available with emulation until this
ff in my opinion has the best battle system to date
it introduces the full buffet of jobs for you to choose from and customize
its fairly challenging and very fun
a must have for anyone who enjoyed the oldschool rpgsbefore i fixed my older brothers beleaguered psone library of games this was one of the highlights of the collection of his before i bought a ton of new awesome games for it
world war ii games have never really fit me mostly over the fact when killing enemies on shooters im used to supernatural aliens or criminals
when i decided to play this game i was surprised by how much i liked it
heres the scenario youre a soldier fresh out of training with an outstanding training record so you begin your missions of nazi killing and infiltration
i was surprised the basic controls of this fps actually function most of the time on psone because the many horrendously bad shooters ive played on psone in comparison the far better shooters on n which actually function
the graphics still have a pixel look to them but otherwise look nice
i was actually baffled that the enemies have great ai considering so many shooters have crappy ai
the missions are great and are actually fun
i had a satisfying experience with this classic game but there is one glaring issue that cant be ignored and that is the glitches with controls during certain times in the game along with the confusing controls
because of these glitches it prevents this game from reaching greater heights but that doesnt means its not a lot of fun
this game is highly recommendable for fps fans looking for a retro fix
too bad developers are basically doing nothing new with world war ii games which has unfortunately made them lose a lot of their luster that made them appealing oncethis game was stellar for its release time and is still fun with a solid soundtrack and presentation
graphically it is showing its age however and the control scheme is different from most fps configurations and will take a bit to get used to
there are some interaction issues with objects in the environment getting hung up on invisible objects clipping into walls and trying to find the way out that happened  times throughout the gameits interesting to see things that have become standard fare in fps games done here much earlierall around great game
one of the finest playstation has to offer
everything from the menu interface the fluid st person gameplay to the difficulty of missions simply amazing
it would be perfect if only their were more levels dont get me wrong  missions kept me busy for over a month but once you complete the final objective you feel an emptiness
a fantastic void that alters your perception on how video games should leave you after the final level
oh yeah its that good
one of the best features this title has is fully orchestrated background music
it draws you completly into the main character and his surroundings
i havent had a chance to play much multiplayer but the little ive experienced it definitly gets my vote
so stop wasting your time reading reviews and just get it
besides the medal of honor underground sequal i have yet to find any other action games that match up to medal of honor
good good timesi bought tomorrow never dies brand new still in the wrapping at a thrift store last year for a dollar
i dont own a ps but i have played the game in my ps
the graphics are slightly outofdate but the game is still fun to playthis was a great james bond game
i have always loved the  series
although i used cheat codes for the last  levels i couldnt get past it was a lot of fun
the only downside was it does not have multiplayer
other then that its a great game for anyone who likes james bond gamesthis was an entertaining games which was based on the movie
the graphics were a bit shotty which is why it got  stars but you still felt like you were part of the action as you played the movie
this is definatly a game you want to replaysince i reviewed the movie tomorrow never dies ill throw this in
this game was suppose to come out christmas  it says so on my vhs copy of tmd
but it was delayed until november  the reviewz basically said it was mediocre i myself could never get into this game like i could golden eye on the n or the world is not enough on n or any other of the james bond games
i finally decided to sit down  try to play through this game
it is good but it has a lot of problems
it does follow the movie somewhat  you can beat this in no time it is probably  of the quickest gmaes to beat that i have ever played
there is puzzle solving  codes to crack they are fairly easy to figure out
the fight with stamper wasnt good i did expect more
the fight with elliot carver was better though
level to level do follow the movie
the cut scenes are pretty bad i wish the driving levels they could of done more on ea would improve on them in the future bond games
this was eas st  game  you can tell
gun selection couldve been better your pistol is always silenced poor selection in assault weapons they couldve done better on the controlls
this game is dirt cheap now so its worth playing just to say you played through it  youll have no problem beating it
it only takes about  or  hoursthis game was suppose to come out christmas  it says so on my vhs copy of tmd
but it was delayed until november  the reviewz basically said it was mediocre i myself could never get into this game like i could golden eye on the n or the world is not enough on n or any other of the james bond games

this game is dirt cheap now so its worth playing just to say you played through it  youll have no problem beating it
it only takes about  or  hoursthis game has until now been somewhat of a mystery to me
i never owner a ps so i never bought this game
though recently i have been filling in my gaps and had to pick up this title
being a bond fan an especially loving goldeneye i expected this one to be rather good
the final product though was a disappointing rd person shooter
the problem with this game is the auto aim
the enemies can hit you from a nice distance but you have to get pretty close to use the auto aim
they are constantly hitting you before you can come within range
there is an aiming system but it is so slow that you are better off running towards them to get in range
you have to stop to aim and it leaves open to their fire
whenever bond gets hit he pauses for a second and it can be really annoying when you are low on health because you are unable to attack when stunned
thankfully there are extra lives in the game so you can die in a level and re spawn
that is something that was lacking from goldeneyethere is only one driving mission in the game and that is disappointing
it is not the parking garage scene or the motorcycle chase either
just some random scene that they made up
there are two missions where you are on skis
this is annoying as you cant shoot during these stages
you have to hit the enemies into obstaclesthe graphics in this game are pretty bad
they just look too square with no rounded edges
goldeneye looks alot better
also the game more often then not gets too dark
its probably to hide the poor textures but makes the game a little bland
another thing about the graphics is that things pop up all the time
there is absolutely no draw distance
which is common to the system in generalanother disappointing thing is the lack of multiplayer
was the ps incapable of multiplayer
after the success of goldeneyes multiplayer why wouldnt ea attempt to put it in
well i guess i have my answer on that one
ea made it not rare
the game does have cutscenes from the movie and actual voice in the game which is nice
i hate text boxes
brosnan doesnt do the voice of bond though but the guy is close so ill let it go
there are some boss battles that add variety to the gameplay
it does follow the movie pretty well and does attempt to bring bond into a new type of game
rd person bond games would be forgotten for years but it was always a type of game i enjoyed
i recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the bond franchise
it doesnt take long to beat probably less then  hours
so it wont take up much of your time
it is an interesting look back at the history of bond so give it a try its a really cheap game now a daysi bought this hot wheels turbo racing game for my nephew
i must say it is pretty fun myself
everyone has probably had a hot wheels when they were little
all of the classic hot wheels cars are on here
the objective is to unlock all of them
you start out with a few and you have to race on different tracks overcoming different obstacles to unlock all of the cars and win the game
overall it is a fun family friendly gamethis game is awesome
it defently desnt beat games like mario kart  or double dash best racing game ever but it is preety fun
here are some pros and cons of the gameproseasy controls fun of course cpad helps a lotconsway too easy course is screwed not enough courses to earnok let me talk about the messed up course your playing this course
its like all the other courses easy but fun but then when u complete a lap it doesnt count it
im not sure if there was something wrong with my game or if there was a programming error but it makes that course absolutley horribleif u get stuck on this game if u do its kind of sad go to cheatcccom and they will give u a code to unlock every course and car
yes there are cars to unlock and yes there are a lot of cars to unlock u get cars by  finding them in courses and  youll have to find numeral dos on your own if your wondering why i went on cheatcccom to beat a game that i said was totally easy dont think that i cheated
after i beat the game in  weekend i erased the data off my controller pack to give my brother a shot
unfortantly he only found  car and unlocked none of the  courses to unlock so he got kind of frustrated
overall this game isnt a mustbuy but it is a good game and i didnt regret that i spent  bucks on it
now of course its much cheaper so its a good buy not great but goodquotwho wants to be a millionairequot is equal parts fun and frustrating
its fun because you get to test your knowledge and see just how smart you are
its great for getting your heart beating
but its also frustrating because it makes you feel like such an idiot at times
quotif only i would have used one of my lifelines instead of guessing on the  question
what was i thinking
quoti have expressed my frustrations more than once while playing this game
but thats good
it just makes me want to beat it even morethe game plays just like the tv show
for single players youre thrown into the hotseat immediately
but for multiple players you have to play the fastestfinger game something that i seem to get beat at a lot
for this review well just say i won the fastestfinger round
hey i feel like a millionaire alreadyjust like the tv show you pit your skills against what the computer has to offer
a negative thing about this is that you dont get all the time in the world to guess the answer like people do on tv you only get  seconds which can be irritating sometimeslets say you decide to use one of your lifelines
the trick here is that using a lifeline doesnt always assure you of the right answer
its not a trick by the designers all the questions you are asked by the computer were asked of hundreds of people before the game was brought out
the actual figures youre given for example when you use the quotask the audiencequot lifeline are real figures
so it is possible for  of the audience to go with an answer and still be wrong
only until youve played the game do you realize how frustrating that can beregis philbin commentates throughout this game like he does on the tv show and here he is both funny and a pest
depending on your mood youll find his wisecracks after youve crashed and burned for the th time either acceptable or annoyingabout the only actual negative thing about this game is that once you have played it enough times it gets way to easy
there are only around  questions total and so they just keep getting recycled
after having played for a short while the first five or so questions are a snap
they shouldnt be however
games like this should be a challengebut there is still enough fun in it for a person to enjoy
the questions do get harder as you go along and your heartrate and pulse do start to rise as you inch your way closer and closer to the million
of course its only a game you keep telling yourself
but still  a million dollars real or otherwise is still a million dollarsdespite its few shortcomings this game is a lot of fun to play
personally i think this game should have come with a lot more questions instead of forcing the buyer to buy the nd rd sports kids and whatever other versions of the game that are out on the marketregardless there is still enough challenge and charm in this game to play it multiple times
and finally winning the million does bring a great deal of satisfaction
even if all you get is an imaginary checkthis game matches with the real thing quite well but has too few questions to endure
if youve never seen the show its simply a series of fifteen each increasing in dollar amount until the last milliondollar question
its drawn out
theres a speech clip for each dollar amount answer and other things
the infamous quotfinal answerquot option only appears when you take a while to answer unfortunately
the lifelines are realistic minus the fact that quotphone a friendquot is really quotphone regiss friendquot
the quotfast fingerquot scrambles the choices and the first correct key pressed wins
the graphics are pretty good and there are neat animations
i recommend this for millionare fanatics or trivia people but only those who wont run out of questionsthis game besides its colorfulness and cute characters is a simple game that small children and some old will enjoy
the game requires no strategy just exploring discovering and a certain amount of thought depending on your age
your goal in the game is to rescue baby animals that have spread to different parts of the zoo
of course you also have to complete a very easy task to get them within reach such as throw down a rope lure them and things such as that
i think this game would most likely be a favorite of little ones since most small children are fascinated by animals
puttputt is a cute character and in this game you can paint him different colors
when i was younger i used to have quite a bit of fun changing his color
but my personal favorite feature of the game is that once you buy a camera you can take pictures of the animals
i loved playing photographer and taking pictures in each area i went to then looking at all the pictures id taken in puttputts photo album
you can also print the pictures which ive done a few times
i only wish that you could save because when i was little i got far on the game but had to turn it off erasing all of my workoverall id say this is a cute game that little ones will love
i cant guarentee older ones will but i know puttputt saves the zoo is a very familybased game that i would gladly let my little ones play if i actually had kids and wasnt one myselfmight and magic vi the mandate of heaven was an extreme improvement over its prequils
its the first might and magic game to have an actual d worldsome may critisize the use of d sprites in the game
the  reason for this is to save memory
at some point in the game literally  hundreds of enemys could be in the area at a time and to use d objects  would take up too much memorythe thing i was dissapointed in was the  roster
you can only have human characters the ninja class no longer  exists i love ninjas and you cant change your current pary like in all  the previous mm titles
other than that its very fun to play for hoursthe might and magic games were always the standard rpg gaming experience for me until origin came along and the whole d revolution began
but these games are classic screenbyscreen dungeon and dragon adventuring
and the adventuring is whats fun about them
the quests that last for years in the world of the game and span whole continents and oceans
the multiple towns and dozens of different creatures
the hundreds of different items and weapons and spells and skills
theyre just great fun to play and this one one of the last of the type is probably the best
even after all these years i still like to play it now and againone of the biggest delights in adventure gaming when you can find it is a chararacter andor party of characters that changes over time  the more you play the more you change
and here evolution is what its all about in fact if you dont change you dont succeed
of course theres the gold you can amass but thats just the tip of the iceberg experience points are really where its at and i love a game with true experience points
defeat a creature get experience points then get stronger
so you can fight harder creatures worth more experience points so that you can get even stronger
nothing so satisfying as working your way up from sweating goblins to brushing aside even the strongest of dragons and all it takes is the most valuable skill of all patienceyeah youll spend dozens of hours just trying to get your party strong enough to get to areas that advance the main plot but thats just the fun of it
these games arent about finger dexterity but persistance and in this case mental cleverness as well
there are some pretty difficult puzzles here that need to be solved before you can proceed along your path  and the software usually wont do it for you
you need to stop and think awhileyou wont be told for example how to defeat a particularly nasty foe or that there is a switch hidden somewhere
you have to figure it out on your own and if you dont
well thats just too badsome fights will seem so impossible youll want to give up but then hey wait what if i lurk around this corner and try to draw just one enemy out at a time rather than taking on the whole army at once
and no enemy is so impossible that you cant beat it by just going away for awhile and getting stronger before you face itbut the getting of things is the real pleasure
the finding of things the buying of things the gradual molding of your party into an unstoppable war machine
its all great fun no matter that its old school and the graphics dont comparea few drawbacks of course  the aging system which i hate in an rpg
its like a time limit which is another pet peeve
and as if natural aging wasnt bad enough there are creatures in the might and magic games that can age you artifically in battle
if you cant find a fountain of youth in time
your characters become enfeebled and the quest is essentially over
not fun
 the curse system whereby just fighting a somewhat weak creature can damage you until you can get to a town or unless you have a remove curse spell
such things arent really a challenge they only serve to delay you
because now you have to stop everything and fix your party so that theyll be able to fight again
why should it be easier to fight a werewolf who can kill you with one welltimed blow than a ghost who would otherwise be dispatched with one or two hits
 some of the later puzzles are ridiculously hard to figure out
i didnt like to spend four months on a game only to be held up by some door that wouldnt open because i did not talk to the right person or did not read the right clue in a dungeon half a continent away or whatever
 its really really easy to cheat
sometimes its just a matter of waiting awhile  empty a chest of its precious cargo wait awhile come back and itll be there again
in other cases though such as when youre having trouble with an enemy all it takes is a good bow and a cheating positionbut overall this is a great game one of my favorite rpgs
and it will play on practically anything you wont even need a game emulatori played this on a powermac g and it was incredibly stable
id even leave the game sitting overnight come back in the morning and start right back up without a sputter also shifts to audio and visual cutscenes were very smooththe story is interesting
you begin as a nearly frozen arctic explorer who is looking for his father and you find the herculania a mysterious luxury ship with people suspended in odd pods
as you wander you see ghostly apparitions of past events and as time goes by you piece together the macabre happenings and even find out what happened to your father
in the course of your advetures you enter the dreams of several characters and these settings were as interesting as the beautiful ships theatre cabins and scientific roomsvery well done firstperson adventure gamemorpheus seems to be a sleeper amoung the adventure games
i played this one a few months ago and loved it
if you like games like riven and obsidian youll enjoy morpheus toothe year is   you are an arctic explorer intent on solving the mystery of his fathers disappearance some thirty years before
unfortunately youve become lost and it looks as though youre going to go the same way as dear old dad
you keep having these strange dreams
coming out of one or have you
 you suddenly find the icebound hulk of a cruise ship
when you climb on board to find shelter you discover that the ship is the herculania the very vessel that your father was investigating when he was lostmorpheus is a great example of a breed of adventure that pretty much started with myst and is now unfortunately for people like me beginning to wane a bit in prominence  first person point and click atmospheric
you might call it quotamber on icequot  like amber it involves somewhat supernatural phenomena and getting into the minds and dreams of others
the story that is revealed as you wander about the shippresented in qt moviesis a kind of phantom of the opera with a gruesome twist
unlike the stories in some other games it is quite welldeveloped and realised making for intriguing clues and puzzles integral to the story
the characters are well mental cases but they are believable people and with one exception you end up feeling sympathy for themthe graphics are really quite nice with a degree view
my one complaint here was that though you could look around you to all sides you could not look either up or down
the paths that you could travel were somewhat limited however
in some rooms you could for example only go into the corner by the desk
there were also a lot of things i would have liked to have been able to examine more closely
on the other hand there were a few things that didnt seem to have any purpose
on the whole the look trod the edge between sparse and lush with backgrounds beautifully rendered but not too many objectsas in myst the puzzles are largely mechanical
you need to make the ship work so you can figure out whats going on  you need to gain access to locked staterooms and so on
later on there are some puzzles that involve acquiring inventory but there is essentially no inventory you carry around  you use each item pretty much where you find it
there are no conversations and no interactions
for me this was great  i prefer quottruequot puzzles to task accomplishment and mechanics to inventory
others might find it tedious or difficulti ran this game on a brand new amd  with xp and the only real problem i had was that the mouse cursor was so extraordinarily sensitive that until i learned fine motor control i was all over the place
fortunately this didnt take long
i also had some problems with the movies  green screens and the like
i have heard there is a patch for this but i couldnt find itmorpheus took me about  hours to play
the start was slow and i wasnt sure i liked it at first
when things started to go together i liked it a great deal
i was sorry to see it end and the ending was quite abruptoverall this is the kind of adventure game that i like
if youre a fan of myst an mystlike games youll like this tooeven if the game had limited or no color i still like the game as much since when i got it for my th birthday im  now
though the game gets beaten fast its still okay
plus its packed with secret levels
a vintage gameboy mario game thats still as much fun as the day it was released in storesps
 on the select you name menu press select to make the game easier
and when youre in a course and die quickly press start and then press select to exit without losing a lifea fine sequel to super mario land this game upon its release boasted incredible graphics and superior sound
even today this game is terrific
the controls are innovative and fun and theres one entire level in homage to the balloon trip mode of the old game balloon fight
and lets not forget that this game introduced nintendos latest villainfranchise wario
the replay value is incredible and the graphics look great colorized
i still play this game and even my boyfriend borrowed it for a while for his sp
again this game isnt quite metroid ii or links awakening but its right on up therewhen it comes to video games its amazing how we sometimes overlook staple video game characters
despite the amount of respect ive held towards mario in general the games always seem to be at the bottom of my current backlog of gaming titles
as much as i dont want to insinuate that these games cant satisfy more mature gamers a thought that is just ludicrous does such an idea subconsciously lurk within my mind
its hard to say
still when i saw a copy of super mario land  six golden coins at the local game xchange i knew i had been away for too long
i knew it had to be replayedone purchase and playthough later im pleased to announce that mario land  is still the game i remember a game that is in good company with other gameboy classics like kirbys dream land and metroid ii
despite the fact that each mario game tends to be special in its own way i cant think of another game that parallels the refreshing variety seen in super mario land s levels even the levels within each zone are far from being rehashes of one another and the zones are clever and keep you guessing with their occasional alternate exits
as important as control and graphics are to the package i have to go out on a limb and say the games audio is the icing on the preverbal cakethat said the fact that the game is literally over before it even begins is a bit of a buzz kill
super mario land  may be longer than a title like kirbys dream land but its still short enough to undertake in a single dedicated sit down or two which is a bit a disappointing
younger players will obviously find more challenging than teens and adults but this should hardly deter anyone from playing it especially when one considers its rather easy to procure and doesnt cost an arm and a leg like some these older games do
dont let the games age fool you it can easily go toetotoe with anything released before or after it without batting an eyelashif you have an original gameboy or a gameboy advance sp lying around its practically a crime not to have this game around for a quick runthrough every now and then
again ill admit im usually not the biggest fan of first party games despite the quality theyre known for but super mario land  six golden coins is a good reminder of why we  make that i  should pay more attention to the list usual suspectsthis game is a definite step up from the first super mario land
theres a lot of levels contained within six separate worlds and the nice thing about this game is that it comes with a save feature so you can explore the worlds and levels at your leisure and put downpick up this game any time you liketatanga  the final bossadversary from super mario land  makes his appearance in here as the boss of the space zone but the bad guy of the whole game is wario marios evil doppelganger
weird i know
but believe me this is a good and enjoyable game and a worthy installment in the collection of mario gamesi really like this game a lot
the game has six different zones with at least one secret level in each one
after that thereswarios castle
another thing i like about this game is that you can cash your coins in for things like extra lives in a slotmachine like manner of chance
this game also has very good graphics for a game boy game from  and looks sharp on the game boy color
the controls are easy to figure out but sometimes when mario runs he can slide and he cant jump very high either
what i do like is that if you lose your fire flower of rabbit ears you can still be big
ive beaten this game a lot but its still fun to do
its a great buythis game is very fun
the only thing bad about the game is that it may start out easy but it gets very hard
three people can save this game at one time
 better than most games 
it also has no passwords
good
i hate writing passwords down
there are more than  levels of fun
 i only know some because i didnt complete the game
i am  out of  
the levels are underwater halloween legos and more
some enemies are saws turtles ghosts witches divers and pigs
there is even different music when you go different placesthe original super mario land left gamers scratching the heads but nonetheless enjoying themselves
building off the commercial success of the first game boy title super mario land  returns to a familiar formula and manages to squeeze just about as much as you could into a game boy cartridgethe game has the mario flare that we have come accustomed to as fans of the series
platforming underwater levels koopas and more show their faces throughout mario land
its fun for all ages and offers about  levels of playtime
i will say though that up until the final level the game is easier than community college i had over  lives at the end of the game and then all of a sudden youre thrown into the final level which has a much steeper difficulty curve than anything youve played before
the game introduces marios nemesis wario who more than capably fills the shoes of bowser as the bad guyoverall the game runs like a welloiled machine never once locking up during my experience
theres a lot of entertainment to be had here but it does get repetitious at times
level layout is pretty basic and event the secret goals found in certain levels arent all that difficult to figure out
the music doesnt do too much for me either
as far as original game boy games go though super mario land  should be in your collection as it improves on just about every aspect of the original gamethis is a fun game that you will find yourself coming back to multiple times
its not terribly long in fact a seasoned player will be able to beat it in less than half an hour but whats in it is entertaining and gives you that childlike sense of wonder we all long for when playing our favorite
definitely recommend this game to anybody who loves mario or nintendodont be fooled by this games relatively crude graphics
since this is a firstgeneration gameboy game i can let that slide
the music and sound fx are good for the gb but what makes this game shine is the gameplayclassic super mario gameplay with some new ideas traveling via submarine and airplane
the last fight the one with tatanga is more of a shooter but still this is a very fun game
a word of advicedo not be fooled by the crude graphics
this game is a blastwhen the game boy was released in  fans everywhere went to buy it in droves and along came some very good games for the handheld system
and hot off the success of the nes mario games nintendo released super mario land soon after and it sold very well
while the game itself is short compared to the nes games marios first smb inspired game was still good enough to pick up and playsuper mario land took the same game play mechanics of super mario bros for the nes added a few familiar enemies while bringing in new ones changed some power ups and introduced a new princess to rescue
as mario you stomp on enemies collect power ups and coins through  worlds each with  levels
to switch things up you control an airplane and a submarine on a few stages and this time bowser isnt the main villain youre afterthe pros it was a dream come true for many game boy owners the chance to play a portable mario game and it was good too
for its time the graphics and sounds were what you expected in a mario game while the music was in a class all its own
the fact that it was similar to super mario bros yet it had its own feel was different and that was a good thingthe cons while the game was good you cant help to think that just when you were getting into the game its over
it was because it was super short compared to super mario bros and just like the nes game you had to beat the game in one shot without any password system or battery backed save progress to mark your progressdespite its flaw the game had a charm all its own and featured nintendos famous mascot at the time
it was a good game and you could have taken it everywhere with you
its definitely brought me some fond memories and if you get the chance to play it and you havent played it before you wont regret itafter my success of super mario land   golden coins i decided to play the first super mario land
to me this game is okay but nothing too exciting to write home about
its basically like playing the first super mario game back when it was on nintendo
there are four levels to beat and each end of the level has a boss to beatthe super powers are origonal
all you get is the mushroom and the fire flower
and when you get hit youll turn back small not super mario like most games
also some of the enemies are very difficult to beat and takes a while to kill
and at times some levels are too difficult to beat like the third level easter island so it gets real fustrating
i managed to beat the game and i believe it stats me over from the beginning and it is much harder to playbasically this game is alomst exactly like the first super mario that was on nintendo but just shorter
if you liked that game then give this one a tryi cant believe i got this game for christmas fourteen years ago
for months after i would actually dream this gamenow for original game boy its no masterpiece like metroid ii tetris or links awakening
but super mario land is however a fine jumpingstompingsmashingfireballspitting mario game and one of the first and best games available for that giant grey plastic box of yorewhile the quotsavequot problem is annoying to me as a gamer now id never even heard of quotsavingquot and quotrestoringquot when i got this game as a kid
it just wasnt done back then
it was no different from playing mario bros on nintendo to meonce you get past the charmingly crude graphics thats why we call it a quotdigital antiquequot the sound and gameplay are enough to keep you occupied
quality mario action
  starsas i said in the title this game is very fun but it is short and easy
i had never played this game before so when i got it i popped it into my gba sp and to my surprise i beat it in about  minutes
here are some specifics
this game has  worlds and each world has  stages
as opposed to super mario bros on the nes which has  worlds and each world has  stages
in stage  of worlds  and  mario is in a old style plane and the game becomes a shooter game
the jumping controls are a bit odd if you are not used to them because mario lingers in the air for a bit before he comes down
when you stomp you the koopas you better get out of the way because their shells explode after a couple seconds
at the end of each stage instead of a flagpole there are  doors you can go into
one at the top of the screen and one at the bottom
if you make it into the one at the top of the screen you get a bonus game where you can get up to  extra lives or a fire flower
plus there are still bonus areas when you go into pipes and for some of them there is an insane amount of coins
overall this is a very fun game with a lot of replay valuemuch like the first nes mario game this first mario game for the gameboy is very basic both in graphics and gameplay
it was one of gameboys first games and is a definite classic
the bad guy in here is tatanga and i only wish that there had been more of him  princess daisy has become a regular character in the mario universe but tatanga has all but disappeared from memorygame was in good shape and it made my son very happy when he received it
it was over all a good experience
thank youoriginally reviewed at lastgencomthe nintendo game boy was a huge success thanks to aaa titles like super mario land to boost sales at launch on  the firstever mario platformer on a handheld it is a faithfulyetquirky game thats a trip down memory lanewhile video games at home were getting much more sophisticated by  handhelds were still in its infancy
mario had already been a household name by then thanks to super mario bros on the nes and mario was exactly what the budding game boy needed to succeedfamiliar characters and gameplay welcome the player without much of a learning curve but there are some distinct differences
while the nes counterpart had castles as their main theme mario this time around travels to egypt china and even another planet
goombas and piranha plants make a comeback along with the upgraded koopa troopas who now explode upon getting stepped on
other enemies include aliens sphinxes and chinese ghosts
there are also a couple sidescrolling shooter type levels that keep the game interestingthe music was memorable and catchy very fitting for the levels
the ending theme is also nice but it doesnt feel very mario
i also didnt feel that the game ended on a positive note as the last level was a sidescrolling shooter  not a very mario way to wrap up a game
as with most mario games at this era the story is transparent as usual
the level designs are still creative and fun to play but game is short with only  worlds with  levels each  its to be expected since theres no saving feature run out of aa batteries and youre starting over
also not so surprising is the lack of a player optionsuper mario land definitely shows its age but its still a very fun game to play
it may only take you one sitting to beat but the current cheap prices for the game should merit a purchase for the mario fanive always had fond memories of this game from my childhood so i decided to purchase it to play again on those long flights home
its just as i remember
the game is a lot of fun and the music just sticks in your head
the only problem with the game is you cant saveim being a bit generous giving it four stars
the game is certainly a change of pace from other mario games
however if you can look past that and the slippery controls while im at it its pretty goodi have never played this game when i was kid back in s but now playing this in late  was interesting
i would have gave this  stars but i gave it  because this game is very long for a game boy game
the avergae game boys game then should be average enough and easy to beat
but its great for any tmnt fan
go for it check it outwish i could save game but other than that it awesome of course it is hard some but sweet i say buy cheap just incase you dont likefall of the foot clan is a sidescroller in its most basic and simple form this can be a good thing or a bad thing
unless you have never played a video game before in your life there will be little if any difficulty completing this one
there are five levels four turtles three bonus games and a handful of enemies
let me break it down like thisgraphics  of gameplay  of sound  of innovation  of storyline  of fun  of  familiar characters nice music especially in level  cartoony graphics minigames too easy no female turtle no venus april is not playable turtles walk slowlythis is a great game nice big graphics for gameboy
there are only four or five levels and barely any foot soldiers
you start out each level by picking a turtle to play as if they die then you pick another
its not all that challenging and it can probably be beaten in a day or a week
the graphics are a bit bland because it came out so early in gameboys history
its more like black on white no graywhile the games illustration cover resembles more like the dark mirage comics darker foot soldiers turtles oversized headbands serious looks and lack of pupils the actual game is taken straight out of the kid friendly cartoon series from the late searly s and thats usually the format of almost every ninja turtle game ported into nintendo and this release was no exception
even on hard mode the game is very simple and short
with the turtle of your choice you plow your way through several foot soliders mousers and roadkill rodney robots plus avoid a few obsticles while you make your way to the technodrome and krang and save your friend april oneal
unlke the tmnt games on the larger consoles there are only five levels and five bosses rocksteady bebop baxter stockman shredder and krang so my only gripe was not providing a few more levels thus not adding a little more of a challenge to the game
because of the games success gameboy allowed konami to make a sequel with a bigger challenge and more levelsbosses tmnt ii back from the sewers
other than the limited challenge probally to target younger kids while the games cover art is targeting older kids its a fun adventure fun and slash game that great for all ages and its timeless
grab your gameboy this game and a pizza and rock onteenage mutant ninja turtles fall of the foot clan stays true to the once popular cartoon series and comic books
each of the turtles are playable and all of their major enemies have been included
increasing your life meter can be done by grabbing the turtles favorite food pizza
gameplay is better than average
each turtle has their appropriate weapon
every weapon has the same power so the longer weapons of leonardo and donatello are the most useful
one button is used for attack and the other for jumping
jumping seems a bit tight meaning you cant get too far on a jump
jumps are best used to go straight up to avoid enemies or making a hop on to the next step up
one other attack is done by crouching and pressing the attack button
this will throw a shuriken
levels are broken down into stages
when you lose a turtle on a level and have others left you will be brought back to the beginning of the stage you were last on
no continues are offered so you will have to make it through without losing all  turtles
before each level or when a turtle goes down you have the option of selecting another
it is probably best to begin the game with either raphael or michaelangelo so you can have the guys with longer weapons for the more difficult levelsmany small enemies have been created for the game
your majority of attackers though are from the television series and comic books
those would be the foot soldiers and the mousers
most can be defeated with one hit so the challenge should not be too difficult
the whole game takes place while you progress to the right
graphics look really good
level backgrounds are detailed enough to give you an impression of where you are
characters all look like themselves
the turtles can only be identified form each other by their weapons
sounds are okay but all of your attacks sound the same
you cant hear a difference between a katana blade and a bo staff
if you are a fan of the turtles then teenage mutant ninja turtles fall of the foot clan should not disappoint you
for those who dont care for the turtles then this game doesnt offer anyhting you cant find somewhere else
as far as action games go this one is not too different from the majoritymortal kombat ii was always known as the pinnacle of the longrunning series to think mortal kombat  is coming
while mk dominated arcades and home consoles once again the question is did it do well on game boy
it wasnt probably sold as much as the games console cousins but the game was greatyou choose your character out of  and fight  other fighters each with their own abilities
this goes for all of the mortal kombat games not in these specific s though
the gameplay is pure arcade fighting on the go
the graphics are awesome and the soundsmusic were greatthe downside however is the fact that there are only a few arenas in this port
plus the game could be beaten in about  minutes or so
but is it worth replaying
yes
it truly is
mk is probably the best of the game boy mortal kombatsi thought mk ii for gameboy was pretty goodit was alot better than the godawful gameboy versions of mk and mk
the special moves in this game were pretty simple to pull offcompared to the other two gamesplus this version had some decent fatalities and there were also babalities toothe character roster is limitedbut its got the mk ii ninjas subzeroscorpion and reptileplus some other fighters as wellthe gameplay is fine and the soundmusic is pretty good toooverallif there was only one mk gameboy game to owni would say this one would be itpick this one upand leave mk and mk alonepeople say this game is bad but its the best mk game on the gameboy
while it only has  levels and  fatality per character the gameplay is great
the people move fast and the controls are responsive which is alot more than i can say for most fighters on the gameboy
while it lacks blood color and may not be as nice as the gamegear version its still not badthis gb is the very first one made
even though it is not in color it was amusing at one time
at the time when it came out it had the same games on it as the nes but in black and white unstead
everyone thought it was handy because they thought it was the first nintindo on the go but they soon realized that it was not in color
the sound is great for such a old thing and the graphics since its in black and white r ok but a little blocky
the only reason i gave it such a high rating is becaus i loved all of the zeldamariometroidand other games on itthis is one of these games that doesnt quite fit into the zelda universe much like the second legend of zelda game for the nes but its still a fun game
link is lost in a shipwreck and washes up on an island
there is no ganon and there doesnt seem to be a real main antagonist
yes there are bosses eight in all for the eight dungeons and a final boss but it is definitely not ganonesque
youre supposed to wake up the wind fish and gather eight magical instruments to accomplish that goal so you wonder if the whole game is a dream to linkthe characters are all new no familiar ones like zelda or impa
the fighting is realtime like in most of the other zelda games and there are familiar elements in here gaining new items opens up more areas to explore you start out with three hearts and gain more hearts along the way etc and there are also the rupees
if youre a zelda fan this game is definitely worth playing at least oncethis is a fun game for me because i grew up playing the original three zelda games
although it pales in comparison to link to the past for super nintendo it gives you the same feel of that game and it is very entertaining
a child would dislike this with all the new technology out therethis is for die hard zelda fans or someone who likes retro gaming
i like this gamewhen i first played this game in  i knew i was in for not only fun but for a challenge
i had to get use to switching all of links items on the inventory screen  including the power bracelet sword and shield  for example of which are some of the items that link is usually automatically equipped with from the other games while the b button was used for other weapons that link can switch to
that was kind of annoying
the navigations and secrets for progression were a bit more like a guessing game unlike the nes titles and a link to the past
i do commend the game for the consistency of the original gameplay and use of many items like the past zelda games
the  storys plot mentions links boat being crashed due to a thunderstorm and being washed up on shore of koholint island so the kingdom of hyrule is non existent in this game and neither is princess zelda
with help from new friends like the beautiful marin her strange uncle tarin and a annoying yet wise owl link must defeat  different nightmare guardians so he can aquire  different instruments to unlock the egg to awaken the wind fish his only means of returning home but not before defeating the last nightmare creature that takes the form of ganon and other enemies from links past
after winning the game it turns out that the town of koholint and all of its inhabitants were all non existent and link was dreaming the whole time kind of like super mario  from nes
at the time links awakening was the most challenging zelda game i played besides the adventures of link on the nes
unlike any other zelda title there are some great secret features in the game that the player can use such as stealing items from the store yes you can take items from the store while make the store clerk look the other way while you quickly go on your way but dont come back to the store and be prepared to have the people you come accross call you thief instead of the name you registeredlol
i still have my original copy so i can try to beat it again
its a fun game and im glad that the first portable zelda game was done rightwhile it may not be the most classic game ever to come out on the sega genisis aladdin is definitly a good gamethe game has you taking the role of aladdin duh as he races through agrabah seeking to save the princess jasmine
throughout his at times frustrating quest he must jump through the cave of wonders run through the streets of agrabah outrun lava boulders in a frustratingly difficult and exciting level and take on jaffar in a epic confrentation at the end of the gamethe graphics are bright and lively with lots of colorsthe sound is quite good with lively and catchy music fairly good voice acting and lots of boops bumps and squeaksthe level design is at times enlighitining and maddining
some levels like genies lamp jafars palace and escape from the cave of wonders are just maddingly frustrating to get throughoverall aladdin is a good game but its frustration level takes it down a bitthe goodbright graphicsinteresting levelscatchy musicthe badnothingand the uglyreally frustrating at timessummaryif you can stand the frustration this is a good game to buy if you find it at a low pricegreat gamethis game is really fun but i dont believe it deserves  stars
the graphics are crisp as you sidescroll through many worlds many of which are in the movies
you can through apples at the enemy guards or fight them with your sword
one thing that i find wrong with the game is that when you kill a person all that they do is poof into some dust
there are bosses in some levels that are quite challenging
the beginning levels are easy but as you progress they get much harder with the final level of jafars palace
this game is a lot of fun and i suggest that you get it if you like older games
if you have one of the new systems i suggest that you buy a game from that system thoughalthough this game isnt the best of the best sega games it is still a classic game
a fun and entertaining way for you to spent a time espically if it is with your friendsi got this game today and i started playing with my brother and it gets really crazywe havent even passed the first level yet because of the vast amount of thugs and the boss at the end
yes it is a hard game but it takes practice and with all the mayhem going on it basically makes you want more and more
the gadgets are pretty coolstill have to figure out what most of them are since the game i got doesnt come with a manual
the only real downside to this game is that when youre against the boss after a stage and you lose  of your lives you cant continue to fight and help your partner till after the boss is killed
you basically have to wait till the next level to come back into the game
and if both of you lose  lives its basically game over and you have to start overim not sure if you have to start at the first level again or just at the beginning of whatever level youre at cause i havent gotten that far yetanyway this is getting confusing
good game great challenge
wordthis is one of batmans best games out there and for fans cant be missed
graphics are nice the music is decent and the story does the cartoon justice
its too bad the gameplay is only average it gets old kind of fast and could have used improvementthis isnt the best batman licensed game ever made but its a very unique one
its based on the awardwinning animated series from the mid s and pits batman and robin against foes like joker and the mad hatterthe art style will be very familiar to fans of the series though the pounding techno beats are something new
the game doesnt really play like batman its more like contra with superpowered batarangs instead of guns
its also very challenging and gamers will have to practice practice practice to get through all the levelsas a game that tries to make you feel like batman this one comes up short
but as a fastpaced action title with solid gameplay that has batman slapped onto it this ones a fun timeright off the bat i must tell you now
i am not really a huge fan of batman
never watched any movies or the shows
however i played a couple of the nes gamesbatman forever was based off of a movie but the game is actually fairly good
unfortunately there are flawsas soon as you start playing the game youll realize that it is kind of a rebuilt mortal kombat
it has the same control scheme and the game is even made by acclaim
it you like mortal kombat games then this might be good news for you
although it shares the controls with mortal kombat there are of course new additions such as the grappling hook and the batarang
the grappling hook might take some getting used towhat has me dock a star off this review is that the challenge feels cheap at times
there is a way or two how more than half your health will drain from an enemy using their attack not the standard fighting moves
everything else is greatif you are playing with a button controller you must press b and c at the same time  up to shoot up
if you press all buttons at the same time you just jump
and as for jumping down a hole you must press c  down
if youre using a button controller then you just need to use the y button for the grappling hook instead of b and c at least it isnt as terrible how the super nintendo version had it select  updown  rthe graphics are really amazing for a genesis game
digitizing the actorsjust like mortal kombat
the backgrounds are also dark and stylish
to think that batman forever wouldve actually made itself at home on the sega xthe sound effects are also pretty cool although youd hear smacks and punches most of the time
and sometimes you might not understand what the voice is saying when you collect a riddle we could blame genesis hardware for that maybethe most frustrating aspect of this game is the fact that there isnt a save feature
now there are video games in which you dont even need to save your game
but here its pretty lengthy
plus the game gets kinda hard at timeswhats really awesome about this game is how you can play with another player in a coop mode coop mortal kombat eh
however that might make the game kinda hardertheres also a training mode
this mode has you beat up enemies until you die
just keep progressing through difficulty levels beating up punks
you can play as any character you want here
even all the enemies pick the guy with the flamethrower and twoface
this could just be a genesis game itself considering how some popular genesis games dont have this mode
you can also play with a friend here which is where things get really funalso in training mode you can battle your friend
this is where its just mortal kombat batman edition all the wayoverall this is one kind of batman game you should try outi suppose its the videogame equivelent of jet li thencomix zone is a supermetafictional beatemup adventure starring sketch turner and his rodent sidekick roadkill a grungy artist who is zapped into his own comicbook and must fight the powerful mutant mortus a boss who sort of resembles colonel sanders crossed with one of his own chickens
the most innovative thing about the game is that it is set within the panels of the comicbook with sketch hopping from one scene to the next
secrets and powerups can be revealed by shredding the pages tooill bet my bottom dollar that the concept and execution of this game partially inspired the matrix
when you think about it they do have a lot in common
but cz is undeniably s in its production design and style
the game doesnt last for very long but its very challenging
the most annoying thing about it is the fact that you only get one life for the entire game and when you hit enemies it diminishes your energy bar
not very faircz was released right at the tailend of the genesis reign but it has still become a classic since that time
personally i feel that one playthough is enoughgraphics asound agameplay blasting appeal bcomix zone is a game i played in my childhood and always had a fairly difficult time with
it is a beat em up side scroller that rewards moves based on tactics and not just brute force
the challenge can be unfair when it comes to obstacles more often then not as opposed to enemies which you generally have a tough time with if you are not strong enough to face them
if you like genesis games this is one to ownfor starters i bought this game because i am a huge lion king fan and i love old video games
i was going to buy it on amazon but i thought it was too much for an old video game
i am glad i found it at a used game store for 
this game is good but not  worth of your money
for one the graphics are pretty good and the sound is amazing for the sega genesis
but i found the game difficult to play
the controls are a little hard to handle
they dont respond quick enough sometimes
it took me a while to get past the first  levels
now i find it pretty easy
but now i am stuck on the th level i cant figure out what i have to do
but overall this game is great
buy this game if you are a lion king fan
but dont pay more than  for itafter revenge the shinobi games went downhill quite bit with the rather tepid shadow dancer
i know im not the only person in the world who was disappointed with the genesis port because the arcade version and even the commodore  version was so much better and almost completely differentshinobi iii goes back to the gameplay of revenge and gives us more of the same only with improved graphics great stuff for a simple bit genesis and different locations
a rather cool horseback and surfboard level is included too
we also get a new climbing ability which is quite cool
and the bad guys still explode when you kill them for some reasonit starts out quite easy but gets rather hard towards the end
youll be screaming with anger in the rockfall and aircraft levels
however the bad guys still do nothing but wait for you to kill them and the worst thing for you is simply falling down bottomless pitsanyone who enjoyed revenge will no doubt get a kick out of shinobi iiigraphics asound bgameplay blasting appeal bthis is more of a kiddy game because of its graphics from sega
i played it so much that my eyes get dizzy following sonic throughout the scene
although i think everyone should take dizzy pills because of how fast he is running
i know if you look down at his shoes you will get dizzysonic  is not as good as sonic  but that doesnt its bad
on the conterary its still awsomeit had more speed multiplayer better graphics and super sonicthe special stages are cool but can be frustrating without a game genie
there are sonic  or  places where you get stuck in the enviorment
when you get all the emeralds and  rings in a level becomming super sonic isnt a choice
but that doesnt slow this game downif you want a game to have fun with by yourself or with freinds sonic  is the one for yousonic  remains strangely the most famous sonic game played by more people than any of other sonic genesis games
this game presented a lot of changes over its predecessor sonic sonic  introduces the character tails or miles if you want to get techincal
tails is a young twotailed fox whom becomes good friends with and idolizes sonic
in the game the default character is sonic and tails in which p is sonic and the computer controls tails in which tails mimics sonics moves and follows him around
however unlike sonic  sonic  is a p and p game offering tails as p in the newly added verses mode
with the p mode you can play as sonic and tails sonic alone or tails aloneanother addition to sonic  is that there are seven chaos emeralds not six
and when sonic gets all the emeralds he can become super sonic stronger faster and invincible to enemies
unfortunatley tails cannot become super even if he gets all the emeraldslevels there are  levels with  zones each
this is a new setup from sonic  which had zone levels
i personally like the sonic  setup better for there are more levels and less zones per level  zones i think tend to make the levels a little boring after a while
the levels are moderatley challenging and are much more original than the levels in sonic  which sometimes appear to be similar to one another in my opiniongrade best level chemical plant zone level  aquatic ruin zone level  i have other favorites but really with sonic  its to each his own when it comes to levelsgraphics not bad a big improvement from sonic  but still very outdated by sonic  and sonic and knuckles standards
the features for the game are much more decorated such as the protective shield and the star postsgrade emerald rounds the emerald rounds in sonic  introduce a d version of sonic andor tails running through a long stretch in order to catch rings
these rounds seem easy at first but get very difficult very quickly
in fact these rounds are quite possibly the most difficult emerald rounds in the sonic genesis lineup possibly disputable with the sonic  emerald rounds
despite the fact that these rounds are a challenge often i find that the higher levels are too much of a challenge and i often get frustrated with them
i think that for this reason the rounds in sonic  are a little easiergrade characters its good to be able to play with tails but he doesnt seem to have much advantage or even equal play when compared to playing sonic
however playing sonic and tails does have its own advantagesgrade music the music in sonic  is much better compared to sonic  i believe
its catchy and quite fun
i think that music from sonic  is even superior than to that of its predecessor sonic  because there are so many different levels in sonic  there are a lot more original themes
the thing i like about sonic  is that like i said before all the levels are very different in setting and in theme unlike sonic  some themes arent that great but the themes of levels such as chemical plant zone and metropolis zone are quite fun to listen to
take some time to listen to the themes of the verses mode as well because even though the levels are the same the themes are differentgrade bosses the bosses start out easy but get challenging pretty quickly
however i find that a lot of the bosses are easier than in sonic  however when it comes to the death egg zone the final boss round the sonic  final boss is much more of a challenge than the sonic  final boss
again like sonic  you are not able to have any rings in the final roundgrade sonic  is a classic sonic genesis game
despite all the amazing hightech games today sonic  is still a very enjoyable game to play
its too bad the genesis wasnt as popular as it could have been
if you have sonic and knuckles you can attach sonic  to it and play sonic  and knuckles which is basically playing knuckles through all the sonic  levels
knuckles with his gliding and climbing abilities can explore places in the levels that sonic never couldoh and if you want the cheat for sonic go to options go down to sound test
put in and play the following sounds in the following order    and  once you play  you should here a small ring
press start and itll take you back to the start screen
press a and then start and itll take you to the level screenremember the days when sonic had the finest graphics in the world well d or not even today id take sonic over quit a few xbox or ps games because sonic had so much class i mean hes a blue hedgechog who has a super saign i dont know which one was made first sonic or dragonball z
even though it had a lack of plot or how sega recycle a lot of the levels it was sheer brilliance i mean i used to love sonic and was sad when sega stopped making game consoles i mean think of the classics alex kidd eco the dolphinsoul calibur and lets never and i mean never forget kid chameleonwell no matter how old i get ill never forget when that little blue hedchog was revolutionary in terms of graphicssound and lengthsonic the hedgehog  is absolutely a worthwhile gaming experience
this game has it all killer gameplayreplay valuegreat controlsgraphicssoundawesome and crazy levels with high speed
in  its hard to find a game this good these days with a few exceptions halohalo doom iii but besides a few titles the new games just dont impress meso they have better graphics but where is the gameplay and such
anyways back to the review sonic the hedgehog  can appeal to almost anyone young to old
also checkout sonic cd for sega cd it is by far the best sonic game and sonic the hedgehog  is second in my opinionwell i used to
its a fun game especially if youre a real fan of the terminator
this is technically the first game you actually get to play as the terminator not that one for ps
only thing was i think i was the only person around these parts that had even heard of the game
i rented this repeatedly
its a sidescrolling missionbased game where you have objectives like retrieving future objects a box with a terminator part in it and keeping john and sarah connor alive
personally when i was younger i just enjoyed acquiring the pistol and the shotgun from the bikers and just blasting them all over the place and blowing up the telephone booths and bikes and tables and pool tables
eventually i got around to playing the game the driving parts of the game are a real pain and itd be nice if you could just cruise around because the map is rather huge and its very colorful
the problem is you constantly have cops and bikers chasing after you and its very easy for you to lose your energy
t is also impossible to kill and ends up being a nuisance
many different things in this game can cause your terminator harm and it does get to be a painid only recommend this to people who have a real sweet tooth for a genuine genesis game and a good t game for it
the music is annoying the sounds are pretty bad the graphics arent spectacular the gameplay is rather straightforward and simple but hey im still playing it
theres something about shooting up the mall and psych ward that is very funxmen iiclone wars is a fantastic actionadventure game for the genesis console
it boasts large character sprites clean colorful graphics a huge number of intersting levels and who doesnt like being able to pick wolverine psylocke beast gambit cyclops nightcrawler or even magneto to play as before each level
the plot is fairly thin so thin you wont even notice it but thats not where the fun factor is clean fast powerful action big varied levels siberian taiga to asteroid x to the amazon rainforests and big fast bosses make this game into a genesis masterpiecei like xmen  clone wars video game
it is a lot of fun and better than the first xmen game on genesisthis game is a greater improvement compared to the previous title
your characters move much quicker your mutant powers are unlimited the graphics are a little better and the difficulty is fair with the gameplay
this game definitley stood the test of time and is also better than mutant apocalypse for super nes
you go through several levels fighting your way through armed ninjas acolyte soldiers prehistoric reptiles savage land mutants phalanx robots and clones and the difficulty rises as you move on so if you made it that far youve been  dared to face pure torture so plan wisely
whatever you do do not use a  player coop unless your partner is as skilled and as fast paced as you because not only the overall gameplay slows down but getting ahead will be difficult if heshe sucks
like the previous game the many obsticles you must face is not designed for a two player coop
this isnt ninja turtles or contra so you cant mess up if you dare to use the  player coopyou have the original lineup cyclops wolverine nightcrawler and gambit
gambit and cyclops mutant powers are weak and so are their jumping but their speed is up to par
wolverine and nightcrawler stand out from all the characters because they can climb and crawl on walls and ceilings can jump high and are the quickest characters not to mention wolverines strong mutant attack and healing factor if you wait a few minutes when your health is running low
there are three new mutants in the roster
psylocke has the highest jump best ranged attack and strongest mutant power attackunfortunatley robots are immune to her psychic knife
beasts regular attacks and mutant attacks are the strongest but his speed is not up to par
both psylocke and beast can stick onto walls but cant crawl like wolverine and nightcrawler
as for magneto if you think it is easy street to finally control one of the most powerful mutants in the world think again
to balance out the rest of the characters magneto was designed to be the slowest character in the game of which he has only two weak attacks projectles only but he can float on command
as i recall hes only useful for one level which is the apocalypse level for obvious reasonsthis game is worth adding to your genesis collection and so far one of the best marvel comics licensed games for a bit system
just becareful and take this game seriously cause its hhhhaaaaaarrrrrrrrrdddddddddd but funof all the genesis games i played back in the old days this was my favorite
not just because i was familar with the source material of the same name shadowrun is a table top role playing game but the way they incorperated the material into a pretty impressive console gamethe shadowrun setting is essentially a mix between blade runner and lord of the rings
you have major corporations controlling a dystopic metropolis seattle while at the same time elves ghouls trolls dragons and other fantasy creatures are seen in everyday life
with you get magic spells along with guns and cybernetic implants
in this game you are an operative for hire
a shadowrunner
this entails you getting assignments ranging from being a bodyguard courier corporate thief and more
along the way you also have a personal mission to take care of
the way this all is put together makes for some great gameplayfirst off shadowrun is completely open ended
you pick what kind of runner you want to be cybered up mercenary called a street samurai mage for fire or futuristic computer hacker and you decide what jobs you will do
youre not even that limited by the character you pick
you can give your mage some cybernetic implants or build up your samurais computer skills
i think you can even get both to start casting spells
the trick is as you gain experience in the game you only have so much resources to use in increasing your skills so technically its best to pick one and roll with it
personally i recommend being a decker futuristic hacker as it gives you more levels of gameplaynot only is character generation open ended but the game world is as well
you can travel all over seattle and the outskirts without being stuck in some linear path
its funny how people go nuts about grand theft auto and how you can go anywhere and do anything
well this was doing that long before
as you explore the world around you meet various different characters
some will just talk to you or sell you stuff
others will hire you for shadowruns
there are also other shadowrunners out there for you to meet and even hire to help you with your missionsthe gameplay is pretty straight forward
when not in combat you walk around and talk to people collect items
pretty standard fare
when in combat things are a bit different
it essentially becomes a move around and shoot as much as you can sort of deal
its all done with auto aiming so this part really isnt like scrolling shooter
also be warned you can miss your target a lot
but as long as you continue to increase your shooting skills in the rpg aspects it works out
a high enough skill level and you wont ever missanother form of gameplay you get to do as a decker is jacking into the matrix
what that basically means is a virtual reality type internet
the world looks like something from tron and you go around with a silver persona of yourself zapping or sneaking past intrusion countermeasures as you steal data from computer systems
gameplay is about the same as other combat modes in that you press a lot of buttons with the exception of a little more tactical planning in picking your programs to fight withokay enough about game mechanics
essentially the gameplay can get repetitive what with the combat mode and walking about but thats whats to expect from an rpg
what makes the game jibe so well is the story behind it
all that nonlinear gameplay sets up the feeling of being in a living breathing environment
at least as good as you can get from the sega genesis keep in mind boys and girls this is the  bit era
the personal mission you have is more linear but since you can get on and off track of that anytime you feel it still feels more fluid
the climax of the game feels big and gets you pumped
definitely worth the effort for  bit console fansthe sega genesis is known for being better at music and sound than the super nintendo
however the snes version of shadowrun totally different kind of game by the way i feel actually had better music
sounds effects on the other hand are better on this one
if you want an overal game comparison ultimately the story and gameplay on the genesis version beat out the snes however the songs are cooler on the snes versioni loved playing this game and its the only reason i still have my genesis
if you are a fan of rpg games from this era or a shadowrun or a fan of cyberpunk styled games i highly this one to youthis game is more of a oneonone fighter a la mortal kombat than a wrestler but both styles are incorporated into a good fighting game
get this game instead of the snes version the genesis version has  characters but the snes has only sixi had wwf wrestlemania the arcde game years ago when it first came out easy to play and hours of fun
i had to buy it again because some douchebags stole my games at my house
i bought it again after i bought the playstation game because it loads too much at the challenge match at the last match
the sega genesis one is better because it has a short load timebut the wrestlers are a little smaller hardly noticeable it looks  close to the arcade version
i use to play this game a lot after schoolit has eight wrestlersrazor ramonbret hartyokozunathe undertaker bam bam bigelowdoink the clownshawn michaels and lex luger
my favorite wrestler is razor ramonscott hallbecause he has effective moves plus he is my favorite in real life
i wish midway would make another one it with  wrestlers and still keep it d but have it really detailed it would be so much fun online and two player coop mode
i would recommend this game if you like d fighters and like midway style of over the top fightingpros great choice of wrestlers mortal kombatstyle fighting hours of fun looked better than other wrestling games at the time a lot of moves for each wrestler not as cheap as mk find out different combos digitized graphics make wrestlers look real  player coop modecons digitized graphics dont look as good by todays standard too short only has  wrestlersi have to admit i hadnt started watching wrestling too early so i never really watched wwfi only watch wwe
i dont even watch tna so im just a wwe person
for people whove played games like street fighter seriesmortal kombat seriesstreets of rage seriestekken series like me and have enjoyed them i would recommend this game to you
its not too entertaining and it gets really boring after a few hours youll just want to leave it lying on your unused video game pile for a while before breaking it out again after a few months
other then that its a good game although not fit for me that much more for the hardcore wrestling fan that doesnt really care about the qualitystill a classic worth paying for although it vaguely reminds me of a wwe plug and play game i have and i bought it for around ten dollars i got this for a cheaper price
genesis owners and wrestling fans rejoiceim more of a new generation wrestling video game fan and a beat em up fan so dont take my opinion too much into consideration try looking at the other reviews first and look at them as a whole
sort of biasedltthis right here is a  bit arcade wrestling game of all your favorite wwe s wrestlers like shawn michaels and thr undertaker and so on so if i was you i would buy the genesis version because the snes took out some wrestlersyouve got space age megadestructive demolition vehgiclesyou are on timed boards where you go in and in destroy everything in sighttheres bombsgiant dump trucks that can take out buildings and much much morethe only pain in the butt is this stupid timed thingif it werent for the timer putting pressure on yoiu the whole timethis would be far less stressfulif you are going back to collect intendo games or even play them for a little nostalgia pick this up if you have a few extra bucksits a good game
its not that hard until the levels late in the game ie
diamond sands and it is fairly addictive
it is very fun but gets tedious if you get stuck in a harder level
also backlash is rather hard to control even with practicehowever it is worth your time even with the issues with backlash and the harder levels
most of the game is very creative and decently difficultoriginally reviewed at lastgencomreleased in  for the nintendo  rares blast corps is a blast gasp to playexplosions have an important role in hollywood because it sells like hotcakes
terminator  die hard speed etc
and the list goes on it just wouldnt be the same
the exact rule applies for video games and sometimes a cool explosion can make you feel super cool saying holy crap i did that
blast corps is one of those games that keeps you in explosion heaventhe premise of blast corps is pretty simple clear a pathway for the missile carrier
for some strange reason the carrier is carrying two unstable nuclear warheads that will go off at the slightest touch and some genius decided that itd be a good idea to have the thing on autopilot
you basically exercise the classic horror film clicheacute run as fast as you can from the slowmoving antagonist to stay alive breaking everything in your path to reach safety
thankfully you have powerful vehicles and giant robots in your arsenal of demolition machinesthere are eight vehicles for you to control and each offer a different type of gameplay
ramdozer bulldozer is the simplest where you just ram things to destroy them jbomb giant robot can fly with its jetpack and fall onto buildings to destroy them think marios butt stomp in super mario  and six more gameplay styles
the graphics are pretty nice with clean models and colorful explosions
i personally liked the music surprisingly good considering its genre what is the genre
the sound effects are of course good though the explosions sound kind of cheesy
it is nice that the game has talking characters i catch myself saying time to get moving
after playing this game for a while its very contagiousblast corps is very fun to play alone and with friends taking turns since it doesnt support player
i can also recommend this to younger kids since its full of tonka and giant robot goodness without any violence thats of course if you dont consider explosions violence
overall a musthave for any nintendo  gamernostalgia can be a wonderful thingwe get a warm fuzzy feeling when we reflect on our happiest memories
we get inspired to create something
and we can share our experiences with othersnostalgia can be a painful thingdid we really understand what we experienced
was it really as awesome as we remembered it
would we believe the same things if we were at a different ageblast corps from rare on the nintendo  is a mixture of these two reactionsat times you will be giddy at its arcadey destruction its simple premise its cheesy music and its inventive puzzles
and at other times you will be frustrated with the controls be surprised at how short the game is and wonder how the n graphics were supposedly the best youd ever seenthe concept behind blast corps is that for reasons i never found out you will commandeer vehicles and destroy buildings so that a missile wont collide with anything thus causing a massive explosion
the missile operates on a single path and its your job make sure nothing gets in its way to your recovery truck
forgive me if i dont have the story correct because quite frankly it doesnt matter
if you cant enjoy the simple pleasure of using a yellow vehicle to demolish buildings so that a red missile doesnt explode i cant help youyou will start by using a simple bulldozer to run into the buildings but youll soon get an assortment of vehicles
theres a sidewinder which uses its metallic hind to drift into buildings
you get this tiny little gokart which uses a turbo booster and tall heights to crash into things
you get a giant silver robot with a rocketpack which hovers it into the sky only to let you aerial stomp onto the roofsyou see how simple this is
well wait until you have to commandeer a train just to get the vehicles
or try to figure out how to use a bombshooting motorcycle in order to free the cartwheeling robot to help you clear the level faster
yes you read that rightin addition to the regular carnage of destroying buildings there are a few time attack stages thrown in for your speedrunning pleasure
there are also a few hidden goals that you can acheive in order to turn your goldmedal completion into a double goldmedal completion
ahh the simple pleasure of trying to get a medal and high score in videogamesn games from rare tend to be silly even the revered goldeneye and perfect dark and they tend to be great
however blast corps is a shortlived bucket of fun
there arent as many stages as there couldve been even for an n title
the experience is singleplayer only which is sad because there were a lot of possibilities for multiplayer in blast corps
also why cant you choose your vehicle for the stages
instead each stage has its own vehicles which is good the puzzles but not so good in the long run
for example using the drifting sidewinder was a pain the butt and i dreaded each of its stagesthe biggest problem with this game though is its camera
rather than a traditional d perspective from this generations racing games blast corps uses a topdown view like metal gear solid
thankfully the camera is rotatable but it doesnt really help much
the default controls are also more like resident evil than like a driving game which is a  successi dont mean to trash on blast corps because the game is a lot of fun
it is worth checking out and it will satisfy most gamers with a simplistic arcade hunger
but it isnt as good as you want it to be
youre thinking rare  n  classic
im sorry but this isnt truein blast corps was a good game but only worth renting or buying at a very low priceits almost blast corps is a good game but only worth buying at a very low priceblast corps was one of the first games rare made for the n and one of its most controversial
while this is a game people either love or hate theres not denying that its a unique experience that hasnt been attempted sincea runaway carrier loaded with two nuclear missiles forces the blast corps team to clear away all obstacles in its path or face nuclear winter
players will be given an assortment of destructive vehicles to use including a bulldozer a dump truck a missileloaded motorcycle a rocketpowered car and three robo suits
run over buildings blow them up or stomp them flat to get the job done
the only thing more satisfying than all this mass destruction is knowing that the world will be thanking you for itthe main complaint of blast corps has always been that the final few missions are too hard to complete
either theres too much stuff to destroy too little time or the vehicles are too hard to maneuver especially the dump truck
while all this is true its all part of the fun that makes up blast corps
theres nothing more nervewracking than taking down a building with the missile carrier three seconds behind you
in fact a few levels are purposely designed to give you as little breathing room as possible so players should never give up
i dont consider myself a strong videogamer i never completed  agent on goldeneye gotten all the medals in rogue squadron or finished banjomariodonkey kong without looking at a cheat guide
yet i still got through blast corps
my point
anyone with a little patience and determination can complete this game
consider it a test that seperates the true gamers from the pretendersmy only true complaint with this game is that its a little short
still while there arent that many main levels the number of bonus levels and sheer tension during the completion of the main levels guarantees that you wont feel cheated
with regards to the games technical aspects the graphics are top notch with nicely animated vehicles buildings and lots of explodsions
i also like the music theres a certain deliberate cheesiness to it that helps alleviate some of the tensionblast corps is definitely one of the ns sleeper hits
those who dislike it because its too hard need to spend just a little more time with it
since theres no current equivalent on gamecube ps or xbox i highly recommend buying this game if you see itdonkey kong  is a great game
its also a really long pull your hair out frustrating adventure
its big
its long
its got a pretty poor framerate
but what have we come to expect from rare now
the best video game maker in the states rare has given us such classics as diddy kong racing goldeneye perfect dark and the banjokazooie series
late  also brought us the return of dk
and lots of other ape friends
the game itself is fantastic to look at
rare takes ordinary level settings factory jungle water and makes them into worlds
really really big worlds
all the characters are animated down to a t using the best graphics possible
the controls are pretty standard most everything uses a zc arrangement although i would like the trigger to be z instead of b which after playing perfect dark for hours confuses the heck out of me
past that the game itself is uh big
there are countless items to collect and places to visit
many of the minigames are confusing and repetative
it takes a long time to get from place to place in the worlds
some of the bosses are worthy of a screaming fit
its hard
and it gets harder
veteran gamers can finish it in  hours
thats a full day of donkey kong
ive already rounded that base and am going towards a second day
things dont move quickly but when you defeat a boss or solve a challenge you really do feel good
the game probably earns a star for the winning and just so gosh darn cute characters who are more fun to look at than that boring link
if youre up to the challenge go for it
it is rewarding and fun to play but i reccomend taking a break from it when times get tough
they will get better
note donkey kong is a good game but it cant match the standards of banjotooie a fantastic rare piece that takes the best elements of banjokazooie and dk and meshes them into an exuberant gaming experience
its worth it at the pricewhat can i say
this game is huge but its fun
i was initially adamant at trying it out because i had been disappointed with banjokazooie the year before but as soon as i got into it i was hooked
this game is not for the weak of heart
it is about twice the size of banjokazooie
there are twice as many golden bananas as bk had jiggies
there are more than  times the amount of bananas for banana medals than bk had musical notes
when you play a level in donkey kong  and then go back and try a level in banjokazooie it feels terribly restricted
yet the gameplay is still essentially the same
you move around the levels you control five characters this time and perform a variety of tasks after which you are awarded a golden banana for your efforts
and then you lather rinse and repeat
boss battles play an even larger part of a role than in bk where the only boss battle seemed to have been at the end of the game
everybody have the same general moves but they all must earn them independently from cranky candy or funky with their specific coinsand then there are the tedious aspects that everybody remembers in donkey kong  with five playable characters rare seemed to want them to work as a team but sometimes that may be a bit of a bother
no it is actually more of a big bother
lets suppose there is a switch that donkey must open
we can assume that the things behind that door are for donkey kong but nope
rare just made a donkey out of us
its for diddy and tiny
and then there are times when you are walking along collecting green bananas for chunky but all of a sudden the bananas change to blue
so then your only choice is to find a switch barrel and change to lanky
it gets a bit tedious
and then there are the backtracking
you have to unlock certain characters in the beginning and they are not all in the first level
so you must then go back and get their respective golden bananas in previous levels
meh
all of this constant switching really takes away the fun out of the game especially if youre playing it through for the fourth time
its still worth it to play through the entire game at least once although certain frustrating moments would make it acceptable to avoid the but donkey kong  is still an amazing game
even if you hate the repetition you cant overlook the technological wonders rare has instilled
the game had been one of the most stunning five years ago as rare was already setting themselves up as one of the experts in graphical achievements
although each kong look rather bland now the games visuals are certainly pleasing on the eyes
however the same cant be said about the games camera
the camera can often go crazy at times especially during swimming moments or on diddys jet barrels
those are times when i go on a cursing frenzy
there are other equally frustrating times
i suppose the camera had always been the death of d platformadventure games
the games music is terrific
although people have a lovehate relationship with the infamous dk
rap the rest of the games soundtrack are lovely
songs like the main menu music and frantic factory are catchy while fungi forest can actually send a chill down your spine
and then theres the humor
actually some of the games humor seems to be kind of forced but then again the same can be said about the humor in banjokazooie
other parts are genuinely funny
however as spectacular as the game is the games tedium and spotty camera keeps it from becoming a classic
its too bad
nintendo had such high hopes for this gamethe problem with this game is that it gets boring
much like jet force gemini there is too much collecting to be done
plus later levels suffer from camera problemsfor fans of the original bit snes games you couldnt ask for a better game
the once d platform scrolling of donkey kong country is now juiced up into a d freeroaming adventure
the levels are new and exciting and offer a wicked challenge
but sometimes the challenge is too muchthe story is familiar enough
donkey kong with the help of his friends goes after the evil reptiles that stole his banana hoard
cranky kong who is the original arcade dk offers greater help this time around giving you new abilities and objectives as you complete old ones
his sarcastic in my day remarks add some nice comic relief
the graphics with the aid of the requisite expansion pak are amazing rich and colorful
the movements of the characters are smooth and the worlds are gigantic allowing for lots of exploration and hidden levelsthe flaws in this game are relative to the player
i find that the sheer volume of items you need to obtain and all the side levels can be unbelieveable
you spend more time looking for items than you do looking for reptiles
much of your time is also dedicated to finding hidden levels which adds a lot of replay value but causes you to get stuck at certain points
for some this is a definite plus and i am not saying that it is a big downer but sometimes you feel bogged down with things to doanother problem that needs addressing is the camera
they should have focused as much on responsive camera movements as they did with the graphics
it often shifts when you dont want it to and it is a bugger to get a strait focus
this also brings up the issue of the controls which are harder to master than a new language
getting donkey kong to dive properly underwater is enough to send your remote flying across the roombut all these are minor flaws in an otherwise great game
when you play it you will see how they took full advantage of the nintendo s abilities
it is not for everybody and will definitely frustrate some but it is worth every bit of effortill be honest i rather dislike the whole nintendostyle gameas a genre of which this most certainly is a part and as a pc user accustomed  to buying games in a lower range it kills me to pay for just about  any video game
but then i didnt get it for me i got it for my  fouryearold son
unfortunately its too hard for him so i end up playing  through the hard sequences
hes just about to turn five and hell  probably have it mastered by the time hes six
but clearly its not for  the easily frustrated child or adultapart from that
well the score  reflects it
its expansive has goofy characters with funny moves and  apart from some points early on which will be unclear to the nintendo  novice theres always plenty to do
one surprising bit is a buxom  character named quotcandyquot whose dialogue is all sexual innuendo
it  didnt offend me and my son didnt even notice but i cant see an american  designer putting something like that in a kids game
anyway the point  is as far as these games go this seems to be a pretty entertaining one  and my son likes it quite a bitbottom line is you will get a lot of game for your dollar
even after the  hours to complete every single last objective the game theres still a simple but worthy multiplayer mode to keep you occupied
the real problem is that right to the end its just more of the same
there isnt the sharp contrast that dkcountry brought to the snes as most hoped and expected
while no major ground is broken from banjo kazooie donkey kong is still all there as a d platform gamethis was my most anticipated that was going to come out on the n
i had very high expectations for this game and not only did it meet them it amazed me the first time i played it
dks graphics are by far the best on the n the gameplay is kind of repetitive and the sound isnt that bad
anyone who liked banjokazooietooie or mario  will enjoy this game
the short version graphics  sound  control  fun factor  total dont get me wrong i am a big fan of donkey kong
i loved the one on the snes to me it was the best one but the one on the n wasnt as much fun as i expected
i favor the jungle levels and this one only had one on it
i wont get into the fact about the ending for all of you who know what i am talking about because it was neither here nor there
it was totally untraditionalfor graphics the game ruled
for sound it was awesome
for plot eeehhhhh but oh well
over all it was pretty goodoverall dk is a great game
its a blast and will have you playing for hours on end
with different levels including aztecs caverns castles forests and of course a jungle and five different playable characters each with their own abilities and golden bananas similar to stars in super mario  to collect you would think donkey kong  would never get old
and it wont
for a whilethe plot goes something like this  king k rool has another scheme
hes taken all of donkey kongs precious golden bananas and kidnapped all his friends
youll have to navigate through a series of levels rescuing different characters in each of them unlocking golden bananas as you go to eventually reach the final stage
each level has its own boss which are usually the best part of the level
to reach the boss youll have to collect a certain number of regular bananas scattered throughout the level different from golden bananas
a certain number of golden bananas unlocks a new level
if you ever want to complete the game youll have to rescue all of donkeys companions
diddy tiny lanky and chunky kong all await you in the first three levels
meanwhile you buy instruments from candy potions from cranky and weapons from funky
all these can be upgraded
the things you buy especially crankys potions will give you abilities that are essential to collecting all the golden bananas
there are also various barrel mini games that you must complete in order to finally get the bananadonkey kong has graphics and gameplay very similar to banjo kazooietooie
so those who liked those two games will love dk
also fans of the donkey kong franchise will not be let down
donkey kong  is addictive and youll always love exploring the new environments the game places you in
theres always aspects to the level that are unique and also crucial to getting golden bananas for example in the forest level there is a giant clock that switches the game between day and night
some bananas can only be reached at certain times of the day
the degrees of difficulty for getting the bananas range from stupidly easy to impossible
many however are just pure fun
overall dk is a very enjoyable game and good for all agesa certain degree of frustration does come with the game however
some golden bananas are impossible to get you do absolutely everything right
youll do lots of falling and retrying especially in the factory level to reach some
another irk is that you must get two coins in order to advance to the final boss stages
you must beat the original donkey kong and jetpak
the problem is no matter what i could not beat the original donkey kong which prevented me from beating the game
i spent so many wasted hours trying to beat that stupid game
last this game requires an expansion pack
nowadays expansion packs are hard to come by and cost about  which is probably five times more than the actual game will cost youother than that donkey kong  is great fun
even if you dont manage to get through the whole game it is a very worthwhile title and surely a great value especially now
you wont be disappointed with donkey kong  unless of course youre currently enrolled in an anger management classthe massive almost completely open world gaming experience this game gives you is unbelievable
graphics in it are amazing and even though the game can be frustrating at times the storyline and the characters keep you hooked throughout the game
its gets boring at times spending hours on hours trying to find that last banana to unlock that last character but if you love games like banjo kazooie your going to love this one
donkey kong  makes use of all the graphics the nintendo  has to offer which is a key reason why this game is considered to be a classic
the game also includes shooting adventure puzzles and exploration as well
lastly this game has one of the best intro scenes to a game ive ever seen
its creative and hilarious
if the intro and the theme song to the game isnt enough to reel you in playing as the big and bad donkey kong and all of his friends will sure do the trickin donkey kong  you get an expansion pack which already makes the game a good buy but the game is huge
it takes hours to complete so i wouldnt recommend it for younger kids but the gameplay is great
there  are five kongs in this game donkey diddy tiny lanky and chunky
all  of which have different powers which are needed to earn golden banannas to  unlock levels
besides the games challenge you also need to complete two  classic rare games jetpac and the original donkey kong
this game  supports an ok multiplayer but it is not as addictive as the game and the  controls would be to confusing for someone who is not familiar with the  game
all in all this game is a good buythis is a excellent gameis so addicted ive been playing for four hoursis so fun to play itnice graphic but you need a expension pak to play with itive try it without the expension pak and i cant start ityou need a expension pak to work itdonkey kong  is the best game manthere alot of puzzle to solve and to save another kong buddythen you can choose different kong toogo monkeyi know im not supposed to make references to other reviews but i cant help noticing that at least two yearold gamers think this game is horrible
perhaps preteens are so in touch with d games that d games seem brittle or maybe its about tastein any case i personally recommend mischief makers to any gamer who can tolerate mostlytwodimensional sidescrollers
not only does it have a female hero okay so shes really a robot its also lots of fun with few complications
there is so much mindless humor you might go boom
okay whatever
you ask
right
did i mention no struggling with camera angles
thats right no clipping no awkward views and no blocky charactersthe main character one ms sarina lightyears calls herself an intergalactic cybot g
her creator one professor oh whats his name
anyway marinas fathercreator has been kidnapped and now she must rescue him from his evil brother and a gang of socalled dogooders
i dont see any reason not to play this game unless you hate girls or sidescrollers
give it a girl i mean whirl
youll be glad you didokay so i promised an updated review and i intend to deliver
i never promised the update would be any good but here goeswhen playing as marina which is usually the case except for the twoorso levels you play as clancer you attack your enemies by grabbing and then throwing them
you can throw them in one of eight different directions but its usually a good idea to act like a school bully and shake them first to relieve them of any gems they may be carrying
you can shake and throw friendly characters too if you feel like being a jerk they dont seem to care anyway
in fact marina likes to throw her creator every time she rescues him but thats probably because he looks like hes about to cop a feel when he tells her how glad he is to see herthe music is also catchy
i dont think youll like it but i certainly do
its sort of  actually im not really sure what the hell it is
its good thoughyou also get plenty of stages on a map screen you can play again as many times as you want
in fact you probably should play them more than once just to get the illusive yellow gems if you didnt get them the first timei wanna say more but the dogs are yapping at me
im still not finished herethe fact is goemon had never really gotten that much publicity
half of the games in the goemon franchise never reached american shores
mystical ninja is essentially the first goemon game for the n out of not bad when most people expect  and it has become pretty much the cult classic for the n
most cult classics are things that do poorly in its initial release but later develop legions of backers extolling its greatness
some cult classics really are that great and the people have valid points
others really arent that good at all and the people behind are just pulling argument out of the air
so is mystical ninja an example of the former or the latterthis game is structured like zelda and plays like zelda except you can switch characters with the push of a cbutton
i mean you go around an overworld fighting enemies and getting ryo
then you play castles which are like dungeons and fight a boss at the end after which you get a keepsake
wt
ahem
its like zelda but its not zelda
its goemon
and goemon just doesnt have the polish zelda has
yeah
the graphics are decidedly like the runofthemill platform games that appeared on the n in the last  years of the th century
but saying mystical ninja is not worthy because its graphics are bad is judging a book by its cover
to pass mystical ninja as bad game because of its graphics is unfair
wed have to look at its gameplaywell the gameplay isnt zelda either
the camera and controls just lack the precision of not only ocarina of time but also super mario 
in one dungeon i found myself having to repeat a section several agonizing times because the camera angle was so off
ah well
outside of dungeons the controls work pretty well
meh
what else can i say
the humor found in the game is pretty nice
theres a laugh track
theres an elephant narrator that rarely appears
there are dogs smarter than humans
theres yae who is pretty goodlooking despite being stgeneration pixels
add that to the japanese feel of the game and you get something that is pretty surreal
the songs get stuck in your head too
so what is my final judgment
umits a good game but it lacks polishvery silly game and fun enough to run through
it can be confusing but there is a fortune teller that tells you your next step for a small in game fee
also this game apparently was from a tv showanime and i never knew about it all this timewell that explains its animelike intro for the game lolim not really into shootemup games so maybe this is so fun for me because i dont get killed off right away
i like this game because it is simple its fun to advance through the levels and i actually like the techno music soundtrack
the graphics are simple but colorful and playful
and the titles at the start of each level are funny
this isnt sophisticated or anything but its always something i like to play when im bored and it can keep me busy for hoursshadows of the empire was my first game when i bought the n
at the time it was the software that definately showed off what the n hardware could do the most
it was also the very first star wars game to have a realistic level devoted to the famous hoth scene from empire strikes back
allowing you to participate in the backstory of this great film the game is filled with a variety of different gamestyles from rd person adventure to racing through the streets of mos eisley to blasting enemy ships in space as part of the shadows of the empire multimedia blitz the story continued in both novel comic and cd soundtrack form the game also stands as star wars continuity and is an integral part to the expanded universe
a classic game definately pick it up if you see itthis game was alright but to get down to the main point the thing that has disappointed me the most are the frustrating choppy controls but i can forgive that since this was one of the launch titles that came out near the end of  with that said it is your typical d platformer with a star wars signature to it
however if you are not a competitive gamer expect to have an outstanding amount of trouble with many parts of this game including a boss that i could not beat that comes right after the stage where you dodge obstacles while riding on various trains
as if the stage wasnt long and punishing enough they had to throw a boss that involved hiding from hisblasts which was very difficult and jumping up through platforms that are extremely difficult to jump on tomaybe have a better aim at the boss
i have given up after losing several sets of lives
i grew up with the n andi have never came across a game that was this outstanding difficult in the  years i played various n gamesthe story on the other hand wasnt too bad
it filled some plot holes between v and vi just fine and the overall sound quality was not bad for n considering that the sound had to be compressed before it could be released because of the format limitations of cartridges at the time
overall this game is passable but if you areexpecting a game that has a fair difficulty and easy to control i would suggest playing something else insteadupdate apparently i was quite harsh on the game considering that the controls are actually not as bad as i made them out to be
i managed to defeatthe second boss with some hassle but i was too close to the boss itself
the controls do take some time to get used to but they are not actuallyhorrible as i have seen much worse and rather unforgiving controls than thisthis game was the very first n game ive ever played
youre dash render a han solo like character
this game is a lot of fun accurate to the book and has the best debugger cheat ive ever seen
there is a three ship levels where youre in the outriderdashs ship or a snow speeder
there  is four camera modes so you can play it either james bond first person style or laura croft second person style either way its fun
your choices of weapons are aewsome from laser to seekera heat seeking gun to disrupterhalf grenade half atom bomb this bay will fry everything including dash
a great game that doesnt waste your moneyits shadows of the empire
the game play is highly varied and the graphics arent terrible even by todays standards
where else are you going to get to trip up an atat with a cable fired from a snowspeeder and blow up ig in the same game
on easy i got halfway through the game in one sitting and i enjoyed it
ill finish it soon and go through it again with the difficulty turned upmodern gamers should be wary of the bottomless pits
this game doesnt hold your hand and put glass walls between you and falling to your death like they do these days
some of the stages play like proper old school platformers but this game was in the first wave of proper d and its a strong examplethis game is one of the best nintendo  games ever sold
it truly is worth your moneyive owned every other star wars game on the  and without a doubt nothing surpasses rogue squadron
but shadows of the empire is not to be over lookedi had my doubts about this game
i started off playing rogue squadron then naboo and racer both racer and naboo lost their reply value after a week for me but rs is one i will always go back to now and then so i thought i might give shadows of the empire a go
i had low expectations for it but actually comparing it to rs is useless because this version is completely different to rs and bfn
it surprised me when i got to the nd stage and it had gone golden eye style
you run around as a guy named dash you start with a laser but you can find missiles proton thingies stun guns and my favorite that just blows half the room away i dunno what it was called but its greatoh and a flame thrower
would have been nice if the enemies caught fire or something instead of act like the where shot but its still coolhalf the game is on foot in a goldeneyeduke nukem kind of way
you open doors collect things can fly around with a jet pack and have to do things to get to certain area first before moving on the level and things like that
the rest of the game is flying and shooting in your shipslevel one is the battle of hoth and where this games story begins
it is almost like the battle of hoth in rs on one of the bonus missions
the graphics arent rs but that didnt matter
you gun down the probe droids go after the chicken walkers and then trip the walkers
then the story begins whats happening is this game starts from empire strikes back the movie and after the battle of hoth its following the story of another rebellion dash
and what it leads to is the events that have happened in between empire strikes back  return of the jedifrom the movies you only see the end of empire as they go looking for han then the next movies starts with his rescue
well this game is what happened in between thenthe graphics are decent there not rs but its still fun
i know its the original but it felt good to actually get out of the crafts and vehicles and do some running around for a changeonly  negative things i have to say you kill boba fett in this so that makes no continuity sense no multiplayer  wouldve made a great  or more player game i reckon it would have been nice to be able to do a custom edit to the controls and be able to choose what button you want to do what with
because of the s of other shoot em up games every time i went to shoot i was pressing the z button by mistake
theres no programmed control setting to use the z button to fire
which makes no sense because the z button is known as the trigger button but all it does in this game is either view or run left depending on what control setting you have setso basically the graphics arent superb it was one of the st games for the  and you can see the many advancements they made for rs
but this game is still good
sofe  rs are  completely different games
if you love rs or bfn and you havent played this one cause you think it is inferior then think again
it holds its own and stands up still
there is even a level on speeder bikes
reminded me a bit of racer but not quite the same its hard to go fast and stay in control in this
there arent any ships to choose in mission like rs basically you start with the snow speeder go onto dashs ship that is much like the falcon
and apparently theres a code to fly an x wing in the last level and cheats to play as the atst but i didnt try themi found it tougher then youd think to stay alive so i recommend you enter the debug codewhat you do is start a new game in a fresh slot erase if you none free then enter your name as wampastompa and note the case sensitive and the 
before and in the middle of the words
there is a space at the start and  between stompa
it is case sensitive so make sure you press the l button to change from upper case to lower case
then ok it all and start the game
press pause as soon as the level starts and on the pause menu hold down all the c buttons the l r  z buttons and left on the arrow pad hold them all at once together
then while holding them down move the control stick to the left for about  seconds you will hear a noise
then hold it right for  seconds
then left then right then left for the same time
and you should get pink writing come up
tip the way i did it was used my finger to hold the button then used my lips to hold the stick left and rightthat pink writing you can toggle through by press l or r and then start to enable it
you basically just need the invincibility and all weapons
maybe the level skip or teleport to another location of the level your on
have fun with it
each time you want to use it again hold all the buttons down again all cs l r z left and then tap the analog to the left and the menu will display again whenever you want itmay the schwartz be with youi recently went crazy and bought an n system an expansion pak a memory card and  games
thing was it all happened in less than  days and it happened cause the sweet memories i had when i was a child
i bought the n mainly for the game zelda ocarina of time by the way if youve never played it by all cost and means do so
however this game was also part of that sweet memory which im trying to relive againthis game from my experience a long time ago was fun
the only minor problem is sometimes the lack of directions camera angle can be changed but sometimes even with the change you dont exactly get just what you want still and controlling is a little hard sometimes so jumping from one spot to another usually ends up in falling to your doom but again not if you get use to it
same for walking on ledgesyou start out with a small spaceship dont know the names that well not much of a star wars fan and you use your laser guns to kill the small two legged robots atst
and these ropes to entangle and destroy the big ones
than for the next two levels or so are first person shootersthe thing about this game is that soon it gets boring so what you do is be creative in killing your enemies
for example level  or something where you meet these hairy beasts haha wow anyways what i do is they are locked in this room with some guys
so what i do is run in save up my guns and run around and open the cages and let them handle those guys
afterwards you let the two beasts fight each other to save ammo
trick is to not let them see you and dont disturb them while they are fighting each other
and in the first level i love killing the smaller robots with my own ship
suicidal stylethis game is nice still
i think its quite replayable
it was hard for me to play it then cause i didnt have a memory card and each time i turned the game off i got to start in the beginning of that level again
i never beated the train levelyou really cant go wrong with this game
just dont buy it for more than 
i bought one that worked great for 
shop around
nice day to everyoneshadows of the empire was one of those star wars games that had a few strikes against it before it was ever released
first it was a game based off a book and not a movie so right away the casual fan was a little lost
second although you come in contact with characters from the movies you play as an original one from the book
so it didnt suprise me when the game was released that people treated it a little too harshleyso is the game as bad as they say
no
true the game isnt perfect but it is still a pretty fun game
i found the control scheme easy to use and the graphics were some of the best on the n at the time
also it featured both on foot missions and flight simstyled combat missions
both gave you the option of playing in a first or third person perspective
now while a majority of the missions were on foot the game really shined during the flight levels
the final level was a fast paced space battle that included dozens of ships on screen at once all well rendered with a minimum amount of slowdownif i had to gripe about anything in this game id say that the on foot missions get a little boring
youll spend alot of time going back and forth solving puzzles that only slow the game down
on the plus side you do get to fight one of the most popular villians from the films boba fett in an all out shoot out includind dueling jet pack actionso if youre a star wars fan and own an n but never played this game you might be suprised how fun it isshadows of the empire was one of the debut games for the nintendo  system and it was a quite a debut
capitalizing on the huge popularity of the star wars series of novels lucasarts took one of the more popular books shadows of the empire and created a video game based on it
shadows starts off with the hoth snow battle where you use one of the speeders to take out probe droids atsts and atats
from there you play as mercenary dash rendar whose job it is to assist luke and leia in the capturing of a super computer that contains details of the next death star and to battle the black sun crime syndicate
the varying locales of each and methods of gameplay for each board allow for a diverse entertaining experience
there are space battles battles aboard moving trains and numerous battles on foot help increase the intensity of the gameplay
one of the best boards comes late in the game and involves a mission to infiltrate and destroy prince xizors the head of black sun palace
the music effects are the best this side of the original trilogy soundtrack and graphics create a haunting environment of a castle that is very dark almost fogladen and very forbidding to proceed throughof course there are a few flaws in this game as well
its very clear that nintendo was still trying to realize the full graphic potential of the n
several of the background images and even some of the foreground gameplay resemble that of super nes games
the background is flat and the pixelization is frequently choppy
nintendo would get it right not too much later though with the release of the spectacular star wars rogue squadronall that being said shadows is a fun game to play
even despite lacking gold medal goals like rogue squadron has to help increase replayability it still remains fun to go back and play even after beating it numerous timeswho is gamer and followed their evolution this is a game that can not miss the collectionrespecting the limits of its technological platform and its time the game was one of the greatest of his erai recommendgood seller too
the product arrived ahead of schedule in great condition as describedthese yoshis are so cute
you pick what color yoshi you want and then go through different levels eating fruits and avoiding dangers
i thought at first all there was to it was to eat  fruits and the level is over not much of a challenge then i realized you get more points according to what you eat and the game saves your points automatically with your name so my son and i competed to get the best score both on the entire story mode and on the trial page
every level you complete ends up as a quotstickerquot on the trial page so you can go straight to your favorite level if you like and try to beat the best scorei am going to agree with every poster who said this game is really easyi also want to say however that this game looks great and is a lot of fun i just think the downloadable version on the nintendo wii looks the bestthe games graphics look absolutely refurbished and redone on the wii making it look more like a  bit game then a  bit one
the gameplay is really simplistic once you realize all you have to do in about every level is just eat enough fruit to pass the stage
like yoshis island before it the challenge isnt in passing each level its getting a perfect high score
that said this game may not appeal to mario purists simply because mario isnt a playable charachter and the gameplay is  a lot easier than pretty much every mario gameonce you beat the game there really isnt much to keep you playing it over and over again other than the beautiful graphics
so i rate the graphics a  out of  being the best the fun  out of  and the challenge a measly  out of yoshis island was a huge hit in the mids
the nintendo  followup however isnt living up to it
it uses d graphics all around without any d models to be seen other than the popup book which is where the game takes place in by the way and what its lying onthe main game is a d sidescroller in which you must go and eat as much fruit as possible
if you eat enough fruit you move on to the next level
there are only  levels though so that said you can beat the game in under an hour
that doesnt necessarily mean the whole game is bad though
after all the gameplay is very intriguinghowever the game is leaning over to the childish side given the fact that the intermission and title screen music are grininducing for older people since yoshis were heard singing
the difficulty isnt steep either
you can whop through the game pretty easily
although i would still recommend this game to you
that is if you can look past the kiddy parts of the gameon the outside is a childish kind of package
on the inside is a unique platformerkiller instinct gold is the near perfect arcade port of killer instinct  and was released on the nintendo  in the fall of  from the same guys that brought us perfect dark jet force gemini and goldeneye  it is the first game to come from rare and proved to be quite a fighting gameki gold has all of the characters and stages from the arcade and alongside the story vs mode for  players tournament mode and options it now has a training mode where you can practice moves combos combo breakers and string them altogether
completing the different practice levels with a grade a unlocks bonus content and once youre comfortable enough you can take on the game itselfthe pros outside of a few missing animations and voice overs from the over the top announcer this is a near perfect arcade port of the hit arcade game
if you werent able to play this in the arcades now is your chance to see why lots of people lined up for this one
this was very impressive for a game that was part of the first batch of games available for the n and gave street fighter and mortal kombat a run for its money
learning all of the moves combos and combo breakers for each character will keep you quite busy
and when youre bored playing by yourself grab a friend for the vs mode or set up a tournament so you can get more friends to play against
the controls are pretty easy to get into despite how the controller looks
and no matter what difficulty level you set the game will still challenge you the same goes for the boss character gargos who will cheese you to victory every time so be warnedthe bad except for the training mode and the bonus content rare didnt add anything else so what you see is what you get
while gargos himself can be unlocked this game has only  fighters to choose so its a bit light compared to fighting games today
also some of the characters from the first game had the controls for their moves and combos totally changed so you will have to relearn them all if you intend to use themits an impressive game to begin and it comes so close to being exactly like the arcade version
while it didnt add a bunch of exclusive content its still fun and even better when you get more people to play against you
we may never know if rare was to make part  of this fighting game series but it would be cool to see how they would stack up against street fighter  and the new revamped mortal kombat game
pick this up used because finding it new means youll pay a hefty price
i recommend this to all fighting fans especially the ones who grew up in the slets get it out there first killer instinct gold is an advanced fighting game
beginning gamers wont be able to do the combo system
dont get me wrong its fun to play even if youre not very good but i still think that by not being able to pull off the combo system and new fatality system than you really miss out on the core principals of this game and that is the combosnow if you are an advanced gamer than this is easily for you
ki gold does not disappoint in any way shape or form
from its near flawless animation and graphics to its gameplay and replay value its very hard to put this one downalong with some new characters maya kim wu tusk and end boss gargos and returning characters jago orchid tj combo fulgore saberwolf glacius and spinal youre sure to find some completely hardcore fights and of course new combos new moves and newly added supermoves
also no longer are fatalities done while your opponent is dying now they are done during combos ultimate combos
its a great new and challenging systemthe down points for me at least was that my main guy cinder is gone
but vast improvements to the returning cast highly makes up for that
check out ki goldeste juego contiene todos los personajes y se pueden hace brutalitis lo cual este de miedoes el mejor juego de peleas que hay lastima que en estos tiempos no hagan joyas coma estacapaz me compro un n para tener esta reliquia y jugar con mis amigosbloody and brutalwhat else would you expect from an mk gameits always fun to play this classic and compare it to current mk gamesobviously the graphics are much worse but i find the gameplay to be just as funi love this game
mortal kombat has always been one of my favorite games and the chance to play it on this system was greatgot this gift for a friend and he said he really enjoys it
never played it myself but looks funperfect dark the practical sequel to the  smash hit goldeneye is a very good title but not without some flaws that prevent it from being quotperfectquotfirst the single player mode
while it has some interesting missions and some cool objectives its not really the heart of this game at all
about the only cool thing in the entire single player experience is the alien elvis who makes some funny and weird noises when you talk to himthe whole purpose of perfect dark is obviously its amazing multiplayer mode
you can add up to eight simulants to the game with varying degrees of difficulty darksim dont even try and play him youll lose  of the time
there are quite a few well designed levels and tons of killer weaponshowever a few problems drag this game down to the status of only good instead of perfect
first when more than two players join in the multiplayer mode things get ugly very ugly
the framerate is simply atrocious and is a major disappointment
and another thing experienced player or not youre guaranteed to die pretty quickly which might turn away players who just want to get into the gamein all perfect dark is a good game for the nintendo  but had rareware spent a little while longer taking out framerate issues and making it a bit harder to get killed perhaps this could have been a stronger title
buy only if you can deal with these problems otherwise get goldeneye this game is superior to goldeneye in every way
that says a lot because goldeneye is one of the greatest n games ever
having said that in this game you control joanna dark a secret agent who has been sent to infiltrate datadyne corporation because they have been suspected of conspiracy
it turns out that they are collaboration with a hostile alien race
the skeddars are giving them technology and in return datadyne is cloning a skeddar in the form of the american president
you use great guns all hail the slayer cool gadgets i love the spy series and play in cool missions one of which takes place in my home of chicago and one onboard air force one
if you like first person shooters you owe it to yourself to play this gamethe single player part of this game is a bit short and the multiplayer is where this game excelsever one day out of the blue feel like playing a game or watching a movie you havent had in years
fond memories of experiencing it and how it made you felt at that time seem familiar enough to maybe warrant a revisit
its used time and time again with ports and remakes but what about playing the original
does it still hold up or does it seemodd now
recently i had a strange inkling to revisit perfect dark so taking out my old n with thankfully my expansion pak from donkey kongs packaging i thought id check it out and while i can nitpick it to death about dated this and that it still wouldnt mask that it was a great game through and throughstory special agent joanna dark is an operative for the carrington institute who gets involved in a conspiracy involving the institute another corporation known as datadyne and  warring alien races
at the time the plot was rather ambitious moreso than goldeneye which followed the film nearly to a t now of course its quite silly and the single player isnt as developed or as memorable but it still works to a certain extent nowgraphics back then these graphics were through the roof
more realistic lighting and textures a bit more emphasis on art design and decor as opposed to the bland levels of goldeneye and character animations are smoother
the framerate did take a hit occasionally but not enough to make you curse that its so jittery
now it certainly has aged though you can appreciate it for what it is now and what the game did at the time but if youre going to play an old game be prepared for old looking stuffsoundmusic the soundtrack to perfect dark largely consists of a more futuristic bondstyle music where its a bit more ambient and mysterious with moments where it gets really exciting and cinematic
the voice acting however can be a bit sketchy since its not really overracted but rather it sounds rather flat at times while other times it works or its comicalgameplay its strange to revisit an old gameplay system since its familiar enough to know what to do but its been so long and youve played several different types that it feelsalien no pun intended
essentially controlling joanna darks movement and vision is the analog stick and the cup and cdown while the other  are for strafing or more correct turning
it took some getting used to since ive had to use dual analog for a long time and eventually i got around to it but it still felt odd
missions are broken up like goldeneye with several objectives before you can finish the level and in a neat feature the objective can be different on different difficulty settings
one mission might require you just to do one or  things while on hard youll have to do some extra stuff to passone of goldeneyes memorable features was the different guns from handguns automatics shotguns and even miniguns and rocket launchers
pds weapons go a bit beyond that and youll have stuff like camspy which is like a tiny motorized cameraspy vehicle to alien weaponry and things like night vision
its easy to get into and its fun to experiment though the more accurate precision of games like halo or bioshock kind of make it initially problematic to get used tothe n became a bit of a party machine around the house here with the mario party games the wwfwcw wrestling games racers and of course goldeneye
pd adds even more customizable features and just generally a lot more stuff but to access it all you need the expansion pak and of course the more people the bigger the knock against the framerate
most of my family and friends would just pop in goldeneye for multiplayer so its hard to say how it would stack upwith games like the  zeldas and perfect dark the n was a very capable machine at delivering solid play though techwise it wasnt the most advanced but if you can track it down or even still have it its worth giving the game another goif youve ever played golden eye  youll find many similarities between the two games
theyre both made by the same people
its kinda like they took one good idea made a few changes in names characters levels gave it a different name and said heres something new
if you were a fan of golden eye youll like that the controls in perfect dark are the same
there are a lot of the same guns but plenty of different ones
my favorite would be the orb gun that can see through walls and with good aiming skills can kill your enemy while theyre all the way on the opposite side of the level from you trying to hide
i used this one a lot during multiplayer
basically what it comes down to is if youve played golden eye youll probably like this
almost everyone with a nintendo  has played golden eye at some point
most of the time get addicted to it
you might not get as addicted to this one but itll keep you busy when you should be off doing something other than staring at a tvthis game as stated above is probably going to be the last great firstpersonshooter on the n
this game combines the graphics of halflife the weapons of turok  and the gameplay of goldeneye to make a perfect yet a little dark mix of all the great fpss into one
each level in this game as in halflife is completlty different from the last and is archeiteched in a way that is totally conveincible each one of the alien weapons has a feroicious pointed look to it and covered in a brown and red color as in turok  and the gameplay is almost the exact thing used for goldeneye with a good lockon system that slows you down for accuracy instead of being perfectly accurate while runnng franticaly for your life
level design here is great and each level has a high point of action to it that youve sworn you saw in a movie but just cant remember which one for example in the area level you walk into a whitewalled autopsy room disquied in your doctors uniform
above you on a raised platform you see a bright tilted surgery light and below that a short grey alien
all of a sudden a guard yells thats not harry its a spy everyone starts shooting at you running franticaly behind cover you return fire staining the white walls with the red blood of the guards
you run into the autopsy room take the floating cart the unconsious if not dead alien is on and push it out of the room with one hand while carefully holding your trusty pistol in the other
as you open the door two guards let loose with their aks as the cart below you bobbles up and down in the fight you gladly return fire from cover of the cart the alein is on
continually bobing up and down the short grey thing remains unconsious as you push it from room to room surviving each gunfight in the white and now red walled rooms
with such movielike action going on constinly throughout the game and with such coollooking guns and great graphics for the n this game stands almost perfect above the other n i still thing ocarina of time stands higher so dont but this over that just to let you knowbefore even halo dared to hit gamers with the xbox perfect dark from the old n first came to our senses in i admit i havent played throughly with the game
i havent beat it but i can tell by playing several multiplayer levels that perfect dark is one cool game
basically its part halored faction shooter game where you play a female agent who try to wipe out featureless beings from the farfuture
is that righti dont know the story but i was impressed with the innovative graphics gory violence and tight futuristic weapons this game has
man the weapons are weird
but thats the cool partperfect dark hasnt been talked about that much because it was minor success
but it sure beats the hell out of some other shooter games today
so dust off your n from your closet and check this game outperfectdark is a good game with a ton of stuff to do
theres even a  shootingrange where you can test all the weapons youve got
but still  i cant say its better than goldeneye which is one of my alltimefavorite  games
still though if you like goldeneye you should like thiswhen perfect dark came out it was by far the best shooter not one matched it
it was the awakening of shooters to show everyone how good they could really be
its crazy plot about a secret agent trying to stop aliens keeps you in it but all the objectives that you must complete and the crazy gear you get make it by far the best
the multiplayer in this so far can only be matched maybe by halo
this was the first game that let you pretty much get to customize every option of the gamei have played nintendo games since the realease of the original system in   so it takes a lot to impress me
being one of if not the premier  gamer in the state of north carolina i found the story of perfect dark  just a bit cheesy
it almost seemed that nintendo wanted to put a  childlike storyline to a game in which the characters curse and die  screaming
in fact the sounds of characters who have just been shot are  the best parts of this game
the whole alien storyline was just a bit much  dont you think
then you went on to call him elvis
elvis of all things
oh well if you like a good shootem up buy this game if you dont this  game will not change your mind
good attempt but you still cant surpass  the excellency and precision of goldeneyewell its just the background thats bad thats all
the color is runny not realy but if you play the game you know what i mean okgolden eye and this game is almost the same because you get to use guns so on
in this game you meet other people well cant tell you you got to play it yourdselfthis time its a woman not a man its always a man now its a woman doing a mans job
every game i play was good but this is better thats my word how about yourstomb raider and golden eye and die hard are just alike you see go play it for yourself go go on do itthere is more stuff to do if you get in the higher levels and they are very hard
i think they are ten levels in the game
after you done with the game they are four more levels that you can have fun with
story is almost over
this is the other half of the storythe guns are so cool and easy the use and its fun to blow people away and see lots and lots of blood
only    and up can play this game i just want you to be safe okwell thats all i going to say about this game buythis is an awsome game and there nothing more to sayif you liked goldeneye  then youll love this one its better in every way
great single player game but best when played with one or more friends
more weapons more levels more characters to select from the list of improvements is too long to list
the only down side is that things do start to slow down if you have a lot of computer opponents and a couple friends all playing at the same timei am personally not a fan of rpgs like final fantasy but this game provides the elements of rpgs lightly rather than full blown
its a good game for those zelda fans
one thing that does become tedious is the surprise battles and hidden enemies which pop up out of nowherethis game is pretty challenging
if youre not careful youll get a lot of game overs early on
it gets a bit better though as long as you take the time to level up
id recommend back tracking through any area that gives you trouble at least once just to get a few extra levelsthe combat system is very unique and keeps you on your toes a lot more than your classic rpg
you also have a wide range of different powers at your disposal that give you a large choice of actions in each battleone thing that felt a bit lacking in this game was a lack of storyline
it can be summed up in a few sentences
youre father went missing
go find him
while youre at it save the world
but you come to expect this from older video games so it didnt detract too much from the gamesince this is the only rpg i just have to give it more stars
the n doesnt seem like a system that even should have a rpg and so they gave it a shot and i couldnt believe it
so the story isnt that great but its okay shot
the graphic isnt that great but its okay shot
the battle system isnt that great but they gave it a shot
the gameplay has no reply value but they gave it a shot again
all in all this would be a  star game on any other system but the n
and maybe thats why its only for ngreat doom game a new look at the classic shooter with lots of new suprizes
the new set of levels are cool the monsters are great as always with cool new looks there are great new effects that add to the creepiness of the greatest shooting series ever such as fog
the new weapons like the double chainsaw are great the music is very good which always shines in doom games and over all very well donedoom  seems like another  new levelsfinal doompeople
but it is very goodnew lighting effectsmonsters from doom and doom graphics improvedand dont let the movie at the beggening fool youthis isnt doom or doom this is doom  which is not only keeping doom alivebut challenging quake for the ndoom returns in this bit entry of the doom saga
the gameplay is basically doom but with  new levels one new weapon the laser and one new enemy type the final boss the mother of all demons
the graphics with their high resolution textures are head and shoulders over all the other doom games before this
the ambient soundtrack and solid sound effects also get high marksthis game is a bit dark as far as how bright the screen is during gameplay theres no multiplayer option and without a controller pak the passwords are a bit hard to remember
but at the end of the day this game is still a lot of fun and is highly recommendeddoom  was my first fps game while at the time i really loved the dark horrid atmosphere i must admit that always hated the d graphic characters  the sound can some times be disturbing but all in all a fun game i never played it on computer but
who cares i like it anywayfirst id software gave us doom then quake came aboutthe graphicallyenhanced true d successor to doomi bought quake immediately when it first came out for the n because it was the first version of the awesome pc game available to me
it does not disappoint in any way
the graphics are dark gloomy and gorgeous
the levels are intricate with plenty of secret areas
the enemies are fast and difficult to killthats one of the things this games really got goin for itits very challengingitll take you numerous tries to complete some levelsthe demons and monsters can and will make mincemeat out of your assquake  for the n is a tad better but if you love fps doomtype games like me by all means get this game nowoverall  out of this was the first game i picked up for the n when i initially got onei must say disregard any and all crap people say about this game or the turok series for that matterthis is absolutely the best firstperson shooter series on the nthe jungle environments are lush and colorfulthe graphics in turok are undeniably the best next to turok  my alltime favorite n game people btch and moan about the fog but i see no problems at all with it
its a jungle
its supposed to be muggyhence the fog
sure in reality the dense fog is used to cover up jaggies and lack of system power but i feel its a nice touchthe levels are huge and welldesignedits fun exploring every possible nook and cranny in each of the levelsthe control of the game is excellent
it took a while to get used to the odd control but now if i had a preference i would love to use the n controller to navigate any and all firstperson shootersi love the control schemethere are multitudes of enemies in the game
sure you wont have to fight more than  or  enemies at a time at intervals but thats not a problem whatsoeverthe weapons in the game are what really sell
before i got this game for myself i had played it over at a friend house and when he busted out a damn minigun to mow down a raptor i was like holy crap
not only are the weapons awesome but the animations of the weapons firing are the best ive seen in any fps and the first of its kind back then
shells pop out of the shotgun and go flying
bullet casings spit out of the minigun at a rapid rate
the kickback of some of the weapons is so real you almost feel like youre actually firing the guns
hell if you run out of ammo you still have your bow and arrow or tek bow with exploding arrowsthere is hardly anything wrong with this gameand nothing i can think of right nowoverall  out of this was the first fps game i ever played
deciding to try it out again i decided to order it and played through itfirst question i thought to myself was does it still hold up pretty well
well yes it does actually
the game is obviously dated visual wise since its more than a decade old now
it doesnt bother me though given that its from the generation that i started gaming from
though i was pretty surprised at how good it looks for an old school fps
the dinosaurs look and move around beautifully
the humanoid enemies you fight actually have faces which was a pretty big deal back then and you can see them shoulder their weapons and fire back at you
while the levels are pretty linear they look good and you arent given illusions of freedom like in other games
everything you see you can pretty much get to nothing is slapped on to make it look prettythe gameplay is pretty straightforward
go from point a to point b while collecting some keys to unlock the next level
you collect a  tokens to earn lives and pick up med kits to restore health lost from battling enemies
every now and then you come across platform challenges for extra tokens or to get a new weapon to get a better edge
surprisingly these platform bits werent as difficult as id thought
i was pretty intimidated by the three limb n controller when i looked at it for the first time in years wondering how i even managed
it actually controls alright though it does feel somewhat awkward at timesif there is something that turok has that newer fps games dont have is novelty
it reeks old school fps given that you fight dinosaurs and use large bulky scifi weapons that turn enemies to mulch
you battle bosses like a large insect that spits acid and trex
i kind of miss this
fps games that didnt take themselves too seriously
when you fought dinosaurs and super soldiers instead of endlessly respawning russians
when you carried an armory on your back and not just two guns
health bars and the like
while the story if it even has one may be stupid is it any dumber than a scenario when the us is invaded by all of south america for no apparent reasonits worth a play through and id recommend it
if you have a cartridge you should hold onto it because the chances of it being rereleased for any consoles seem pretty lowi remember renting this game from blockbuster and i always had fun with it
today it still is a fun game for n
but the controls are really werid
not bad but they are something that people have to get used to
seeing dinosaurs in a game like this is awesome
overall its not one of the best n games
but it does hold its own as a fun gamealmost a year after the nintendo  made its debut to the world nintendo started to gain steam in rolling out new games
starfox  was released in  and was the sequel to the popular snes game starfox
one of the first games to tote the much liked rumble pack support it was an instant hit and sold millions of copies
it was and still is a great game to play to this dayyou control fox mccloud leader of his flight squad which includes  other characters many of you know already who they are
all of you are out to stop andross the main villain from the first game from taking over the world again so you travel across different planets each with its own theme and challenges
shoot everything in sight to get points fly through colored hoops to refill your energy extend your energy meter  restock weapons collect bombs that destroy everything on the screen and defeat the boss in each planet to move on until you face off against andross himself
grab up to  friends and play the multi player modes to shoot it out against each other with its own options to tweak before each match startsthe pros nintendo did a great job when it came to making starfox  from the intro to the digitized voices of the main characters to the story and overall presentation you feel like you are fox sitting in the cockpit and shooting at all the enemies
the graphics are sharp for a game in  while the music is catchy and moody so its great to hear it during your gaming experience
the sound effects are on point and the digitized voices are exactly how you expect all the characters to sound like
starfox s controls are perfect every button is used and it wont take long to get used to how it works
as an added treat plug in your rumble pack and you get force feedback for just about anything you do and when you take enemy fire or run into objects
playing through it wont take you long but if you meet certain conditions you can take alternate paths and visit other planets and face against alternatedifferent bosses altogether thereby extending the gamethe cons a few issues pop up that prevented me from giving it a  star rating but they are rather small and doesnt ruin the overall experience
the game wont save your progress until you beat andross on his home planet and even at that it only saves your overall score and how many lives you have
so if you have to quit the game youll have to start from the beginning all over again the next time you play
the games difficulty spikes up on certain planets while it plummets on others so you may have to replay certain planets until you memorize it completely
the multi player modes arent really anything special so you wont play this with your friends for long periods of time unlike other games like goldeneye  or perfect darkstarfox  remains as one of the best games in the series and players come back to it and play through it again
it looks and plays great lots of planets to play through and decent multi player modes make this game an excellent choice to pick up and play on the nintendo  if you cant seem to find it or dont want to pay what people are asking for you can download this title for the wii on the virtual console service for   points
i highly recommend it so if you havent played it yet there is no reason for you to not try it outstar fox  is a very fun game
im not even a big fan of star fox either
the graphics r great for the  and sound is just as good as the ds
the controls r even easy and fun to use
the story is fun but after a while it gets very hard and boring
but the multiplayer is great
the more people the better
it is like most star foxes on multiplayer u go around on any planet and battle each other or be on the same team and battle the cpu
it is a great game with excelent sound and graphics and i not even a big fan of star foxthis game is both fun and hard
this one dog guy tells you what to do
a guy that killed your dad is real evil for a monkey
you get to travel through a galaxy filled with planets to save
at some levels you get to battle your rival star wolf
hes a wolf and youre a fox
they are trying to stop you from getting to andros the monkey guy that i was talking about up there because they work for him
whenever you see peppy your ally shoot him and kill him because he is really annoying
every level has a boss and they get harder each time you battle one
your friends are falco slippy and peppy
then theres you the one who does somthing
kill slippy and peppy but not falco
falco saves you on the second level while slippy and peppy are being dorks
if you really try hard you can beat it real easywhile cruisn usa was fun it was without its shortcomings
but the sequel is so much better in every waycruisn world is based on the fun arcade game that was released on the nintendo  in  the premise is the same as it was in the first game pick a car select a track and then race against the crowd to get st place
just like the first game you can unlock a few extra cars and tracks to extend re playability
and then midway added more stuff to the n game  player support new music a time trial mode a practice mode and a championship mode where you can unlock additional carsthe pros better graphics and music more variety in the stages more cars to choose from and more game modes
the controls are easy to get into and it doesnt take itself too seriously for an arcade racerthe cons you still see pop up scenery in the game and once again its very easy for your competition to catch up to you aka rubber band ai
 unlocking some of the cars can be quite challenging and this game works if you play in small chunksif you love arcade racers with more stuff to do on the side you should pick this one
its a blast to play through and you can have your friends play along as well
recommendedunfortunately for nintendo and a lot of video games in the industry they fail to really reach the next chapter of gamers in the industry when it comes to racing games
i often find it to be a mental block of shame
however there are some racing games that do fit the bill with a lot of extras
with the crusn series for nintendo  it failed the first time crossing the usa thankfully the sequel was able to make the engines roar just a tad bit harder and a little more excitingwith crusn world released in late  it contains a start of  cars battaling through  outrageous courses from england all the way to hawaii
that is not all there is even more at stake when it comes to these rolls
there is also championship mode where you can try to earn points for faster speed in the automobiles a very special speed demon and custom packaging with color designs
but it doesnt stop there
there is as usual crusn mode where you can access some of the greatest courses ever including a special course that sets you on the moon
there is also the unbelieveable practice mode where you can try maxing out the time of the certain time and gain access to hidden automobiles  of themunfortunately a lot of people arent interested in crusn world anytime right now largely because of the gamecube and xbox and playstation  games out there
nevertheless if you really want the rubber to burn give this game a trycrusin world is absolutely a great game
the courses are so fun and have neat scenery like on hawaii there is the underground aquarium and on china the great wall of china
there are neat cars also
on this game there is no such thing as a slow car
they all have high speeds and are stylish
you can also get bonus cars which are all really neat
the graphics are really neat they have great details
i like how you can get bonus points for doing tricks
the easiest ones are the mega roll and jump flip
the best course for tricks is without a doubt germany
crusin world is one of the best racing games nintendo has produced
if you enjoyed this youll probably like crusin usa
i recommend this to absolutely everybodydiddy kong racing provides an enjoyable experience but it ultimately screams lackluster in the gameplay department
theres a ton of goodies to unlock but the challenges feel to easy and somewhat stupid sometimeswhat the game is the most blatant mario kart ripoff in history
this is one of the only ones that comes close to capturing the mario kart spirit
but the weapons arent as fun and arent accurate the levels are less interesting and only two characters would later go to achieve stardom in a later game
yep conker and banjo kazooie are in the game but its so weird to see conker not smoking a cigar getting wasted and peeing on enemies
plus they are the only cool charactersgraphics looked good for back then but the textures are a little these days and it has a static look to itmusic a bit annoying its not the enjoyable music from mario kart but its finesound the annoying announcer annoying character voices firing weapons and racinggameplay the controls sometimes feel a little sticky and the weapons arent even close to accurate when hitting a target
racing works fine overall but the game as a whole is average and lacklusteroverall just get mario kart its a lot more fun
it wouldnt hurt to check this game out but there are better options than thisthe good good mario kartripoff racing and some cool environmentsthe bad weapon accuracy is terrible music is annoying controls feel a little stickydiddy kong racing is the other major kart racer for the nintendo  when it came out most people were accusing rare of copying the mario kart  formula
that may be true but at least they made modification
for example there is a major decrease in emphasis on items in diddy kong racing
in mario kart  you need a good hold on the items to win
in diddy kong racing items are merely an afterthought
what are really important are the boosters strewn all around the levels
this creates a different racing feel that some people may like more than others
i personally feel that the karts are not as agile as they are in mario kart  and that decreases my enjoyment of the game
ah well
the inclusion of two extra vehicle types adds a different feel to the gameplay
i didnt really like the plane but hovercrafts rule
in a racing game level design is just as important as the controls
the courses are nice but a bit lacking in variety
oh well
it was obviously a way to fit in with the five different sections in the single player mode
gawdthe single player modethe silver coin challenges are no fair i tell youas the game is less focused on the items the battle modes are a bit drawnout and boring
however fire mountain and smokey castle are brilliant
in fire mountain your goal is to take eggs to your nest and make sure they hatch
the game becomes frantic with the addition of the ability to steal your opponents eggs
in smokey castle you must take  bananas  at a time to your respectable treasure chest
its not as awesome as fire mountain but its fun just the same
graphics are actually decent for  it may not be as visually stunning as what rare would achieve in half a year with banjokazooie but the game looks nice nonetheless
most early rare games have lousy backgrounds but dkrs backgrounds are impressive
the music is terribly catchy and the voice samples are cute
the silver coin challenge is still unfairive spent years playing this game as a child and there is tons of races and a variety of bright optomistic characters
the best part of this title is multiplayer
multiplayer has  diffrent games battle you shoot eachother race and capture the flag
there are  vehicles you can use in this game too
plane kart and hover craft
if your playing solo there is also an adventure mode where you go through a nice adventurewhile n fans were happily busy playing goldeneye  rare surprised everyone by releasing their own kart racing game in  called diddy kong racing
blending adventure elements with the racing elements mario kart  was known for rares mario kart clone was a good effort but it has since sparked a furious debate as to whether it was better than nintendos gamein diddy kong racing  characters including diddy kong band together to stop wizpig the main villain from taking over their world by beating him at his own game racing
you start out driving a kart and get to explore the huge over world with  different sections representing different areas
your goal is to win balloons to unlock all of the areas
each area has  stages to race through and when you come in first place you earn a balloon
after you beat all  stages in an area you unlock a race with the boss of the area
beat the boss and you move on to the other areas to repeat the same process
earn a certain amount of balloons to unlock wizpigs area where you ultimately race against him to beat him and win the game
as you complete each stage it becomes available for time trail and multiplayer modesthe pros for starters there is a lot to do here
not only do you race around in carts but after you accept challenges from the genie the character you interact with the most beat them and you unlock the ability to race around in a hovercraft and a plane
there are a lot of stages to complete and not only can you unlock two additional racers meet a certain condition and you unlock a secret area with its own stages to race on
the game looks great considering it came out in  the overall presentation graphics music and sound effects fit the overall happy mood of the game
three of your friends can take you in the multi player mode and you can use kart hovercraft or plane here as well
so yeah it will keep you busy and its fun but it depends on who plays it becausethe cons of two issues that do hamper the overall gaming experience
first this game is tough
the other racers will put up a fight and since you can use weapons to blast them or help yourself so can the other racers
its a different experience whenever you switch your type of ride so keep that in mind and because of it you have to memorize the stages well to get an advantage
the tough difficulty this game brings may turn off some gamers
also this game requires a huge amount of backtracking which brings about a feeling of severe repetition
in order to get all the balloons you must beat each stage  times and beat each boss of each area two times
yes you read that correct
the first time around you must place first in each race
the second time around you have to collect  silver coins scattered throughout each stage and place first
the third time around you must race through each stage back to back in a grand prix style and place first for the gold trophy
since the computer racers were tough to begin with expect to race the same stages over and over and overrare has a history of making tough games and diddy kong racing follows this tradition
theres so much to do and look at and for the dedicated gamer this game delivers
but for those who dont have a lot of time to invest or are easily frustrated by an intense learning curve this game brings you may not want to play it
with its great graphics main story mode with lots to do and a decent multiplayer mode for you and  other players diddy kong racing is a good effort from rare
whether or not this is a better game compared to mario kart  depends on who you ask
give it a try if you can get this for a low price
as an alternative you can pick this up for the nintendo ds but it went through some changes as a result of rare porting it overi love this game but i cannot get to tt to finish the race at the end of the game
if you love a good and hard game this is for you
the end pig boss is very difficult and can pretty much only be beaten by ttthe rooster is cool but has very hard handlingall in all very fun and very annoying all in one pretty packagewith the successful franchise of super mario brothers blooming in  with mario  nintendo  seemed to be very strong as a contender in the video game wars
although the system has lasted about  years the impact it has made with cartridge video games will never be duplicated ever
when mario kart  came out in  the field was just explosive unlike anything else
then nearly a year later another mark in the racing form came about with diddy kong racing
the game was just as surprising as the race that mario kart had left in the dust
surprisingly with diddy kong racing there was a little more at stake than meets the eyewith the release of diddy kong racing it took the racing game to another level
unlike mario kart  there are three different kinds of vehicles to really choose from instead of one kartstyle like mario kart  airplane and hovercraft
it makes it a little different to rangle with when in some courses you can race with only one of those vehicles and on others you can choose to race two or three vehicles
the game features the story of diddy kong and his friends trying to save timbers island from the clutches of wizpig a vile hog that holds control of the island
there are so many courses that are in the way that you must unlock in the story adventure mode
still there are also some other feels and challenges along the way including unlocking challenges and two hidden charcters drumstick and tt
and some very special codes that you can access in the tracks modehowever there are some flaws that diddy kong racing has that were just surprising
first there is a slower frame rate than mario kart  but the gameplay itself definitely makes up for that flaw
another flaw is the control among some of the characters like crunch the alligator and banjo the bear from the nintendo  game banjokazooie is a little more difficult than evenly averaged in mario kart  the lighter charcters like pipsy the mouse and tiptup the turtle provide a much better use for control in getting those challenges unlocked for a tasteful race with wizpig in the final showdownalthough many people stopped making games for the nintendo  there are some good agmes that still continue to push that pedal to the metal
diddy kong is one of them if you really love the challenge
considering that mostly all racing games are exactly the same as you could possible imagine there are some games that still stand that gameplay
if youve loved mario kart  youll definitely love diddy kong racingokay so this game is more kiddie than mario kart  but if you remember playing this as a kid back in the s then youll enjoy replaying this again just for nostalgias sake
the game arrived at my house clean and in working condition
the game is very similar to mk but with a few twists theres an adventure mode where you race in different levels in hopes of collecting enough trophy balloons and keys so you can confront the main boss wizpig who plots on taking over the island where your adventures take place
another unique twist in diddy kong racing in comparison to mk is the option to choose between three different vehicles the gocart the hovercraft for races on water or snow and my personal favorite the airplane
there are unlockable characters such as drumstick the rooster and teetee the stopwatch
the game can be challenging at times especially when trying to obtain certain keys and trophies in singleplayer mode but overall its pretty easy when racing against friends or mini bosses
again this probably isnt the game you older gamers will enjoy as much but for kids this makes a perfect familyfriendly title for your n librarydiddy kong has a better graphics system then mario kart and gameplay is faster and less sluggish
alltogether a good game to own and worth the money if under fifteen bucksthis game came out years ago and since its creation there have been many copycats
but no game has ever surpassed it in its genre multiplayer racing games
wanna know whyfirst there is the singleplayer mode
i must say that for a childrens game the adventure mode is remarkably challenging
but if you want to play all of the levels and certainly if you want to unlock all the hidden characters youll have to play through it
the challenges are interesting if a bit repetitive and possibly even annoying
but once you get passed the main single player mode the real game startsyou can describe the multiplayer in this game in one word perfection
every character handles differently and has a unique personality
every levels has shortcuts and a unique look and feel
the fourplayer graphics are remarkably fast detailed and smooth for being on a bit system
and the controls really are perfect
and since you have to get bananas to go faster find and hit every speed boost pad you can and collect balloons for offense and defensive powerups you can never let your guard down
each and every level can be experienced a variety of different ways
you can play every level reversed and you can try every level with cars hovercrafts and planes and players can even use diffent vehicles on the same course at the same time
when this game came out it won awards for technical achievement
they were well deserved
i do not think there has ever been a splitscreen racing game to match it
not in gameplay not in graphical prowess and certainly not in fun factor
a great game for kids and adults
no n owner who loves multiplayer games should be without itremember how cool the original nintendo exite bike wasits all here in its original formbut thats not the cool partthe cool part is theres a whole new way better version tooyou can learn all your skills in a tutorial modeyou can build your own tracks from like hundredsmaybe of different hillsrampsdips and spinsyou can even go to modes where you can play games with your bike like soccerits easy to get lost for days in these games but the real idea i guess is to beat it on championship modeits pretty straight forward theretheres a side game where you must scale a very steep and rocky mountainsideoneyes i mean onemistake and youll see some of the most hideous wrecks in exite bike historyits great funi think this is a great remake of a once well known classic super nintendo game made in  however despite that this game has a few minor flaws which i may discuss later in my reviewthe graphics are great one of ns best graphics yet especially for a motocross game but annoying little graphics glitches sometimes appear which is a shame otherwise the graphics are smooth and nice on the eyes
just the little graphic glitches which decrease its score to the sound is pretty good the music through out the game is easy enough to cope with
as for the sound effects they are what you would expect from an extreme game
you hear yells when you ride off a cliff you can hear the irrating motorbike noise as you race you can hear thumps when you hit the ground hard
the only complaint about the sound is that the comentators speech is a little repetitive but otherwise you can get rid of the comentator
the controls are not very good at times your bike just goes any random direction
the reason why the game is hard is due to the control
otherwise its pretty easy to pull of tricks however there could have been a better job on the control
the fun factor is pretty good you can race your friends on which ever tracks you have completed and you can verse them on most of the special tracks which you can get by winning certain stages
the special features include the quotdesertquot where you just race to a fire and then race to the next fire no multiplayer for this
quotstunt coursequot is a course where you can challenge your friends or yourself in performing as many stunts to get as many points
quotoriginal excitebikequot is a feature you get by completing the tutorial
its just the super nintendo version of excitebike
quotsoccerquot is a feature were you verse your friends in soccer on a bike
quothill climbquot is were you verse your friends or yourself up a steep hill
quotexcite dquot is a really good fun race course
the main fun factor in this game is the create a track mode
while there may be many features this game doesnt have many great features
the replay value is great and probably the most effective thing about the game
you will want to keep racing on those very nice outdoorindoor tracks
the main things which bother me about this game is that it could improve  contain more stunts i mean  stunts isnt much for a motocross game
 make it that you can control the time limit for the stunt course i mean  minutes cmon
 make the controls easierthe main highlights of the game is the create a trak mode which allows you to create a track the high replay value and the very interesting outdoor tracksthe nintendo  played host to quite a batch of goodgreat racing games
with titles like diddy kong racing beetle adventure racing mario kart  vigilante  and ridge racer  they were diverse and fun at the same time
in  acclaim entertainment introduced their own title into the racing genre extreme g while it was reminiscent of the playstation exclusive racing series the wipeout games extreme g holds its own and makes itself stand out as a game worth playingextreme g features single player and muliplayer modes
it is set in the future and you choose one of several bikes to race on  tracks in  separate classes
as you pass each track you unlock them in the multiplayer modes
you can choose to just race against your opponentsfriends or turn on weapons and blast anyone who gets in your way to st place
while the single player modes only allow  player the multiplayer modes allow up to  players so when you are done with the story mode grab some friends to go at it in normal races battle races and capture the flag style races
beat the story mode in certain difficulty levels and you unlock a bonus track and  powerful bikesthe pros for its time extreme gs graphics and sound effects were top notch and showed what the n can do
the audio tracks are a real treat as its a mix of housetechno music that get you pumped as you battle it out
the controls are pretty easy to pick up and are customizable so if you dont like the default setup you can change it to your liking
playing on own is fun but bring in  friends and you can look forward to good times
if you have a memory pack  the game will prompt you to save your progress and race times
if not you will have to write down passwords so you dont have to redo your progress
as a added treat you can use your rumble pak and feel the force feedback from the rumblings of your bike to firing and getting hit by weaponsthe cons when the action gets crazy the graphics get choppy and the frame rate as a result drops to a point where its noticeable
some tracks look better than others while the game itself is short
it wont take too long to complete all the tracks so for those looking for a challenge should crank up the difficulty and it shows so be warned
racing games were one of the many reasons why the n had such a following and extreme g while not the best of the bunch proved that it was fun to play by yourself and with other people
the series continued on with acclaim releasing extreme g  on the n and extreme g  on the nintendo gamecube and playstation  this game will cost you a pretty penny unless you get it used so if you havent played it give it a chance and pick this one upgood game to play multiplayer
i remember renting this game when it first came out it is not the best game but it is fun and definately worth being in the collectionwhen nintendo first sent out its n development kits to thirdparty developers there must have been a sticker on the box that said quotplease make a racing gamequot there is no way around it you all have at one point played an n racer be it from midway human boss game studios imagineer or nintendo itself
luckily extremeg the latest one out for the n is quite unique at least until nintendos own fzero  arrives next yearlovingly called xg by its developers the game pits up to four players against each other in insanely fast cyber bike races down tracks that make six flags look like a golf course
there are more than a dozen magnetic tracks bikes weapons boosts loops drops corkscrews and jumps  but if you had to choose only one trait that sets xg apart from the slew of other n racers its speed
the game is very very very fast
and most of time thats what makes it fun
its evident from the start that the developer probe tried to make extremeg live up to the high quality marks set by other n racers no were not talking about cruisn usa
and while it cant quite compete with the graphics physics and control of wave race and top gear rally it is a solid and welldesigned game that is sure to appeal to action and racing fans alikefirst off the graphics are quite nice with four different worlds filled with tracks that up the ante on every other racing game out there
imagine double loops steep drops sudden turns lava driving on the ceiling and corkscrews that make the whole screen spin
speedwise extremeg is second to none
unfortunately there is that dreaded layer of fog a different color for each world to hide popup and keep things moving at high speeds
while it doesnt disturb the gameplay the fog is not as close as in turok it comes at the expense of any sky texture or backdrop that could have lent the tracks more personality and made the loops and twists more dizzying
another problem is the frame rate
xg often moves so quickly the n is having a hard time to keep up a consistent frame rate
but in the end xgs incredible sense of speed the excellent track layouts and some very cool roadside graphics and lighting effects quickly make you forget these cosmetic shortcomingsthe stereo sound effects are right on with booming explosions convincing rocket launcher quotfumpsquot and futuristic engine sounds that add just as much to the gameplay as the good rumble pak implementation
extremeg also features a cool techno soundtrack that does exactly what its supposed to do provide a pulsepounding background beat to the races
the drum beats are a bit weak but cranking your subwoofer up to maximum levels should give you and your neighbors enough enjoyment for days to comethe bike designs look like theyve been inspired by the movie tron featuring aerodynamically rounded bodies with no trace of a rider
each machine has unique handling shields and acceleration and is equipped with a builtin laser weapon
controls are pretty tight but they definitely take some getting used to
in the beginning you will probably drive all over the place and have a hard time aiming at your opponents but after a while you will be amazed how youre able to keep track of things at speeds exceeding  miles per hour
but the real thrill lies in taking out your opponents with some of the awesome powerups found on the tracks
there are more than  weapons types including all kinds of missiles flash bombs mines laser tripwires and even a flame thrower
if you thought using mario karts quotlightning itemquot was a dirty trick wait until you see xgs portal holes sling shots or the quotstatic pulse rayquot that reverses your opponents controls
an awesome arsenal to be sure  but what good would it be if you couldnt try it out on your favorite buddy
good thing probe took the extra time to include some solid multiplayer modes
two to four players can race at the same time either head to head compete in a capture the flags mode or hunt each other down in the mario kartstyle battle mode
unlike most polygonal racers out there extremeg also features a twoplayer grand prix mode extreme contest that lets you and a friend compete against six other computer drones and an awesome tournament where up to  
human drivers are pitted against one other
as most other racers the twoplayer mode splits the screen horizontally and things can get tiny in the fourplayer splitscreen battles
but theres an added surprise for all you triplets out there when playing with three the first player gets  of the screen while the other two get quarters
ncom predicts bruises and bloody noses in the battles for the first controller comparable only to the good old quotwho gets to sit in the front seatquot fights
despite some slowdown and lower framerates xgs multiplayer modes will keep you coming back for more while your other games are already collecting dust on the shelf
kudos also for the good data management screen that lets you refresh without having to press reset every time you flip data banks in your switchable mem paktheres a bunch of super fast space planes racing through unbelivable courses at speeds as high as like  mphits hard to hang onthere are lots and lots of ships to choose fromthere are some really cool side games toowhats that you saysounds like suicidewellyesthats quite trueyou will wreck and die a lotbut youve got to learn to make split second deciionsso learn to anticipateits great funlet me just say this
out of all racing games ive played for the nintendo  only diddy kong racing and mario kart  are more fun
okay
with that said lets explore the various components of gameplay in a random unorganized order
what i found really compelling is the aweinspiring cast of characters
 racers each with their own personality and life story is quite a hefty amount
another thing this game excelled in was the sense of speed
while star wars episode i racer went just as fast if not faster that game didnt present you with the sense of speed fzero x does
sometimes it can get overwhelming and that sends you flying off the track where if youre playing multiplayer allows you play a rather fun slots game in which you can still affect the action on screen
the ability to completely wipe out opposing racers with a slight double press of r or z really adds great strategy in the singleplayer mode
and death race
ooohthat is a classic
tracks are welldesigned
boosts
you wont win without them
they can get quite annoying since if you miss one youre pretty much screwed at least in multiplayer
single player ai is pretty dumbi dont really remember much of the music
recently i was able to use vgmusic great site to listen to fzero x midis and based on what i heard it didnt seem very impressive
perhaps its because these rocklike guitar riffs dont appeal to me
give me soft jazz western or classic any day
sound effects stick better in my mind and they are pretty good
the thing that sticks out the most is probably the wail as you falloffthetrackkaboom
visually fzero x had been kind of lacking
the textures were bleh and the backgrounds were just fog or clouds
even though its not visually or aurally appealing fzero x is still an extremely fun game to playthis game sounds awesome on paperrace through courses at  or more miles per hour against  or so different racers
its even better than it sounds once you play it
it is so addicting because of the high speed and challenging race tracks and it really makes me feel good to hear the announcer say quotalrightfirst placequot
all of the cars are about the same except for  or  that are just absolutely fastalthough the game gets a point taken off for not making the cities very detailed it is a lot more fun to play than it looksif youre looking for a solid racer to fill out your n game collection with fzero x is a great choice
the graphics are low on detail but nintendo compensated with a huge emphasis on speed
tracks twist and turn every which way including deathdefying jumps corkscrews half pipes and cylinders
the familar fzero soundtrack has been updated too and keeps the excitment highhowever the gamecube version basically topped this game in every aspect possible
fzero was a franchise where the sequels consistently made their predecessors look hopelessly outdated and the same applies here
fzero x sacrifices graphic detail for speed
fzero gx sacrificed neither
so if youve been playing the newer versions theres no point going back to this onea solid title for its era and good if you enjoy retro gaming
otherwise this probably wont hold your interest as muchits lamborghini and as far as i can remember the first lamborghini based game that i know of for a console
this game was one of the few titles nintendo had in their starting line up so it was pretty much play what we offer you
i thought the graphics were pretty good and the carswell they were lamborghinis
how can you go wrong
whens the last time youve seen a countach in a game
exactly
automobili lamborghini had the exclusive line up
that is why you brought this game that is why you played it
all i can say is that this game was hard
and i mean extremely hard
i played with the controller and a steering wheel and this game still destroyed all whom chose to play it
for a racing game this one was insanely difficult and ill admit it got boring with no one being on the road hardly because the ai was insanely that much better than you get used to th place
i played this game mainly  to drive lambos
so i did just that and when i needed a better experience i played gran turismo
which when it came out made every other racing game obsolette especially difficult games like this onehang time was the newest incarnation of the very popular and ongoing nba jam series except now it went a little more high scale because it takes the nba on nbc jingles videos and of course the stills and visuals of the nba on nbc tv programminglike all nba jams totally outrageous basketball from start to finish
you can expect anything and everything in this one from more out of this world dunks to being quoton firequot shooting and of course the newly added alley oops and free throws
yes thats right no more shoving your opponents all over the place because now they get  foul shots each worth  points a piece and even shaq can hit these free throws
you can even create your own character and build that character to be the best as you take on the entire nba in  on  mayhem
you also get to answer nba trivia just like on tv during games
pretty coolid get this one because i personally think that this is nba jam at its best
very fun and also very cool to play with friends
especially if you and a friend are good enough to pull off the triple alley oop pass for team fire
again check it outnot many games in the video game industry can actually be a triumph as a spinoff or a remake
for midway following up the success of nba jam was a difficult challenge
it became the highestgrossing video game in the industry with more than  billion to the name
as nba hang time was set to commence many people had no idea of how good this game was going to benba hang time was the very first fulllength basketball video game for the nintendo  giving newcomers who had just bought the smash console a chance to really get some air
hang time had also created something new to the mix that makes it all seem interesting
the game is a bit similar to nba jam but there was something a little different
the game also included a create a player mode a mode where instead of speding a few quarters at the arcade you can createyour very own basketball player by controlling how tall you want him how good he can block you and even how good his aim is for the hoopalthough many people arent interested in nba hang time as much as theyre interested in newer games that came out for playstation  and xbox but there are some new gamers out there who have the nintendo  that might want to enjoy the  on  basketball fever
if you own the nintendo  but you dont have nba hang time you need to make that shot for  and get this video gameas a package sfr is one of the best arcade conversions ever  plus a lot more for the home player
the programmer ed logg is a prince of the arcades
his previous games include asteroids centipede gauntlet steel talons hard drivin and the original san francisco rush
id love to see more of this kind of work on the more recent consoleswith four characters to choose from you can get your race on
ive felt very strongly for a couple of the nintendo  racing games and they are as followssnowboard kids mario kart diddy kong racingwave race theyre all really fun and even though you dont get items to use against your foes in this game just plain racing can get quite competitive
most of the people that i knew werent into this game but it was ok because racing against the computers had never been more funif you still have a nintendo  or just got one i highly recommend this game as well as the ones above
and if you have a nintendo gamecube id recommend wave race blue storm
its almost as fun as this gameciaonot the greatest game ever made but still enjoyable and for the time it was so unique and fun being able to race on jet skies graphics were good for when it was made alsoi got a little excited for the new alien game coming out next fall alien isolation so i purchased this
despite its age its still worth a scare
people say the controls are confusing but if youve played a first person shooter in the past thirteen years then its the same
movement is based on the same dual analog system that halo and call of duty and so many others use
though movement and aiming is hindered by aged sensitivity and not crisp with pinpoint accuracy like the new games its still easy for todays gamers to get their heads around
the graphics are good for back then i suppose but very blocky
all in all i would say its the best installment in the alien video game franchise though i havent played all of them so dont quote mebefore i review this game i would like to give my thoughts on the film alien resuerrection my favorite was aliens ridley scotts original film alien was a masterpiece and alien  is my nd favorite alien is rd alien resuerrection is bottom of the list its alright but just aint as good as the previous  alien vs predator films are crap for god sakes make an alien   a predator  the game is just slightly better than the movie but in levels     its got some glitches
doors wont open when i clearly turned the switch on
controlls are fine if you use analog controllers its like any other on ps ps or ps fps
it does follow alien resuerrection story pretty good
destorying alien eggs and destroying the ripley clones and ultimately fighting the the newborn
but the way you kill the newborn is more like the st movie which i liked
i hope to review all  movies soon ill also review strider  and this game is cool and scary
fox interactive doesnt fully suck but yeah they have made bad gamesthis is a fun game
this game keeps close to the alien movies and especially to the fourth one
while some gamers complain that the game has a lot of dead space with no killing i didnt find that to be the case
i did cheat and use the cheats codes to help me get through the game especially with those little facehuggers lying around the floor waiting to get you
the facehuggers can be frustrating but with the cheat on you dont die
i like the alien genre and if you enjoy the genre as well you too will enjoy this game
it is great when it is best played in the darkits a classic and still scary to play all these years later
this is one of those games you should always play in the darkthis is the first game i can think of that was a st person platformer
in fact i cant think of any games since that are
i bought this game purely out of nostalgia because i had it around the time it came out and i have good memories of it
i havent tried it again yet so this review isnt really complete
if i ever get a chance to play it again ill be sure to do a follow up review to update itmdk for the sony playstation is a pretty good actionshooter game released in   in fact you will be shooting quite often as thats the main purpose of the game
kill all or most of the enemies you encounter to advance to the next stagei mention in another review how its pretty sad in my opinion that so many people feel the need to upgrade their video game consoles when theres so many unpopular though entirely enjoyable games such as mdk that go by without hardly anyone noticing them
once the playstation  hit the market the odds of people discovering a hidden game like mdk are really slim
its really a shame that once a new console hits the shelves everyone runs to it like theres a dinner bell attached to it or somethingyou should never ignore old games just because theyre no longer brand new
am i right
if the reviews for a game are mostly positive then its probably worth owning no matter how many copies sold or how many people know about the game
it makes you wonder how many other fantastic games are available for the original playstation that hardly nobody knows about
thanks to the playstation  the ps will experience the same problem one daywith that out of the way sorry i like to ramble but you have to admit i make a good point lets talk about the actual gamemdk is a very pretty game to look at
colorful and whacky graphics dominate
mdk was clearly a notch above other games at the time of its release
the graphics look a lot like the original version of star fox that appeared on the super nes
if you recall star fox had an fx chip which allowed the graphics to stand out and look distinct
i dont know if its possible for an fx chip to be included in a playstation game but it sure looks like mdk has one
the graphical similarity to star fox was immediately noticeable to mei guess the best way to explain mdks gameplay is that your main character has a gun apparently with unlimited ammo though not entirely sure about that and a bunch of other things like grenades and whatnot which are mainly used to help open doors once youve eliminated the necessary amount of enemies in that particular level
once the door is open another stage begins
its cool how you just walk into another stage with a different atmosphere and background
its like walking into a carnival
of course the items you collect are not simply called grenades because apparently a word that short and simple would be boring to the people who created this game
everything in mdk has to have a funny side to it
well not the shooting itself but besides that everything elseyou see mdk is a really goofy game that shares a few things with earthworm jim the same company made both games by the way
i was taken by surprise when i first played mdk because reading the reviews i was expecting an alienshooting action game to lean on the  serious side
instead its just a really goofy gameim happy to report that none of the goofiness turns annoying after a while which means i give the people responsible for this games creation a lot of credit because many times game companies like to try to be funny with all sorts of experimental ideas and most of the time they end up with a superannoying unplayable game
something usually goes wrong when too much humor is thrown into the mix but im happy to report mdk is able to still proudly stand tall as a really good action game
its just not a serious onethe only difficulty you will discover in the game is trying to learn how to jump properly at all the right moments
for some reason your character has an awkward way of landing after he jumps which can make it tricky to land on certain platforms
other than that the game is pretty simple
shooting aliens over and over is actually not very challenging at all because all you have to do when a bunch of them appear on screen is simply hold down the shoot button square and continue walking back and forth with the l and r buttons
if you continue doing this the laser beam attacks and other gunfire from the enemies will miss you but you wont miss them
also worth noting is that every enemy you encounter has a life bar
some are short some longit took me a couple hours to get used to the controls and figure out what everything important on the screen means
thankfully my copy came with an instruction booklet but if your copy didnt come with one well theres a lot to learn
its well worth putting time into mdk though and eventually you will probably figure out what all the buttons do
it just takes some time to learn
though honestly theres a couple things i still have no clue what they mean but they havent interferred with the gameplay in any way as far as i can tell
and they havent held me back from completing some levels eithersaving your progress can be hard to understand at first
you have to pause the game and then hit the select button
this will bring up the save option
if you die luckily you can start over at the last savepoint
however as far as i can tell the game never asks you to save on its own
you have to do it yourself
so if you die  levels into the game and then realize you forgot to save you will have to start all the way back at the beginning of the game
just remember every time you enter a new stage save the game
the loading times are really short
in fact while walking into the next stage they are barely even one or two seconds long
its funny because i remember back in  everyone would complain about the loading times on the playstation
one year later and the waiting time apparently went down considerablythe music is really good overall
many times it builds tension
i especially like the theme that plays when the game startoptions screen appears at the beginning
it starts off with an innocent flute melody which turns into a much bigger castlelike theme
it reminds me of the genesis song watcher of the skiescall me extremely observant but the way your main character fires his weapon is exactly the same as earthworm jim
in fact the only difference between earthworm jim and this game is that mdk is a d thirdperson shooter game
earthworm jim was just a d sidescroller
well i havent come across any cows yet which is a trademark for earthworm jim
but you can clearly tell the same company created both gamesi really think if you like nonstop shooting action in a colorful unique environment you will enjoy what mdk has to offer
its not a bestseller but that shouldnt matter
it shouldnt stop you from going ahead and buying mdk
the graphics are really coollooking the animations from enemies exploding is quite a spectacle and the challenge is just right for anyone to play but make sure you have it on easy mode the first time
dont give up on the game if the first couple levels are confusing to you
give the game a chance
a really good forgotten playstation game that can be purchased for a very good pricei want to say this was probably the game that created the run n shoot genre thats become so popular in recent years with battlefield call of duty halo  uncharted among others
the graphics are a bit blurry  the character seems to move bizarrely fast making it difficult to judge how much room you have and if youve lines yourself up correctly for a jump but very progressive revolutionary  fun for its time
has a sequel for the psif you copy my writing style it is because i am ultimate
mega man blasts onto the psx with his th adventure
wilys back and this time hes after two robots who battled endlessly before crashing on earth
one of them is duo mega mans new ally and he battles an evil energy that wily wants to get his hands on
so far this is the latest installment unless you count megaman amp bass aka
rockman amp forte as the th although i personally call it mega man   read on to see why this is a decent gamethe goodsome people were put off by the cartoony graphics but i thought they were fine even if mega man looked a little funky
the backgrounds were very nice and the level designs were quite good they havent been this good since mm in my opinion
the storyline is among the best in the series and its almost played like a comic book which i found intriguing
proto man also has to do with the story and the poor guy needs to get his own game
the music is thankfully better than the past two entries and this is an overall challenging game something that most games lack nowadays
on a final note you can also have a weapon selected simultaneously with your mega buster which is very convenientthe badprobably mega mans girlie voice hes a guy capcom
in fact all of the voice acting in this game is quite horrid
i also didnt like it that they dismissed the japanese intro music and while im not a fan of japanese music because i cant understand what theyre saying its an upbeat tune that shouldnt have been ignored and far better than xs heavy metal themeoverallconsidering what we have in the game its not a bad game and i consider it a masterpiece in comparison to mega mans  and   however fans of the older mega man games may be turned off by it
i recommend it to diehard mega man fans who are willing to get over some cartoony animationfor starters the blue guy hasent changed munch you get new stuff as time goes by you big bad guys you stop dr wily once and for all you find a big metoer whats not to likeperhaps megaman  should have been called megaman playstation instead
it feels more like a new version of megaman than a true sequel to the other  bit megamans
the graphics seem a little bland in spots but for the most part it is a solid game
a few of the bosses seem corny but after so many megaman games theres only so much to work with
the gameplay is right on even though the game can be hard in spots with all of megamans moves every gamer has come to know
i think its safe to say that even though it could have been better megaman fans will not be sorely disappointed with megaman mega man  truly deserves a play from not only mega man fans but fans of sidescrolling games in general
the game takes what was good about the previous games and creates genuinely striking experience
with well used  bit graphics an enjoyable soundtrack and that same fluent mega man gameplay its a worthy inclusion to the series that seems to be sorely overlooked nowmega man  is a rare breed of game
not particularly because of its gameplay or style but more so the use of  bit side scrollers on the play station or n
to the best of my knowledge there havent been many high quality side scrollers that keep you visually interested the level but this is a fine example
the levels are vibrant and colorful and character animation is nicely flowing
the gameplay is largely unchanged from previous mega man games
its a platforming shooter with tight controls
this installment did include new little gameplay segments based around flying on your robot dog and sledding down a slope
although these are few in number they do change up the gameplay enough to keep it interestingdespite the quality there is one elephant in the room mainly the inclusion of animated cutscenes
these cut scenes arent badly animated and they serve their purpose of moving the story however they do bear the mark of a lot of early english anime dubs namely terrible acting
this can be pretty distracting however these scenes are short and can be skippedmega man  is a truly entertaining installment to the series i highly recommend it to anyone collecting classic gamesi wish capcom would have put much effort in mega man  as they did mega man  but this is still a fun game with all the aime cut scenesmany people are tired of mega man and his dozens of games but those people are also missing out on a great gaming experience
this is one of his best and it would be a shame to pass up
sure the gameplay is  basically the same as before but whats wrong with that
the graphics and sound are still great and the story is more serious than other games in the series
dont miss out on thisfirst x game to hit a  bit console and yes they did a damn good jobi didnt give it  stars because quite franky they could have done better
i mean x and x were much better so it shows that they have to be able to do bettergood game good price if you havent played it play it nowi felt like they made zero very heavy
i didnt find him as useful for the most part
i dont understand why in the first x they show zero shooting his blaster and then nobody uses his blaster in later games he just uses his saber
youd think he could use bothan excpetionally well thought out game that is hindered by some slight problems which prevent this game from getting a  star rating in my book
the jumping certaintly is one of the worst parts of this game and certainly does help to make this game less enjoyable
however the atmosphere and the mood created are second to none as you roam the streets and catacombs of england searching for the dark genius alex crowley
while most of the gameplay relies heavily upon hack and slash elements and arcade style gameplay it is in the overall execution that this game succeeds
the creators have done a fine job of recreating the dark times which plaque the game world and have created some of the best monsters in a horror videogame standing stride for stride with games like resident evil and silent hill althogh silent hill does have this game topped in terms of sheer terror and horror that is created from the link between the player and the monsters as truly silent hills monsters are a perversion of reality and some of the most intriquing monsters ever created
the sequel to this game does fall a little bit short of what i would have expected although i do enjoy the finishing moves that you are able to execute in nc
definitely worth picking up especially because of the cheap price that you can pick it up for the game seems to be so inexpensive on this sight that you probably will be paying more for the shipping than for the game itself
by the way the best time to play this game is right before halloween as that was when it was originally released and im sure the creators intended that the season be around you when playing this game just an idea though
thanks for ya time ya all
yeah yeahthe graphics are corny but i love this game but it does glitch and it took a while to get here but worth iti decided to buy nightmare creatures on a whim there were no other things to get and i was bored
this game besides being frustrating at times was pretty in depth dark gloomy and pretty entertaining
i would say its worth a purchase if you can look over the minor technicalitiesin nc you can choose from  of  characters and its pretty much a third person slasher that goes level by level of hacking and slashing your way through some pretty cool enemies and genuinely creative levels in what seems to be th century englandits a lot like final fight in third person except that you can perform different combos gaining each one each level
otherwise you can just tap on the attack buttons and use the basic moves
i loved using the combos and if you can button mash different combos youll discover them on your own and not need the game to give them to you every level
each character has his and her own selection of cool martial art moves and its awesome to see them go into effect
the enemies are hacked into various body parts like arms legs and heads being amputated
another great feature is the level design theyre so detailed and gloomed up with fog rain and dirt that it makes it so much fun to simply run around and explore everything
it does look somewhat grainy and pixels to become apparent the closer you become to objects but this gives the game an even darker look you can really appreciate
the levels are also very unique from one another giving the player some great varietywhat i didnt like about the game for one was the controls and i think everyone can back me up on this when i say theyre too choppy
well its hard to say the controls themselves arent choppy each one executes smoothly the problem lies in the characters position in the level
its like your characters body feels too big for the level and this causes strange perception problems when it comes to pulling off jumps over certain obstacles and defending yourself against your enemy
you will die a few times in frustration before you really get the hang of the control scheme of the game
this will also cause you to die a lot during the final level of the game and especially against the final bossoverall i liked this game a lot
i had a lot of fun playing it through and i would go through it again because i beat it a long time ago and i dont remember too much of it
if you can look over these few technicalities  you will definitely enjoy this one for a long time
also since you can get it used at most places now id say pick it up right away you wont regret itif you love the original tomba from whoopee camp youll love this more
and if you think that this is a d game youre incorrect because this is only a d platform game but it offers a lot of colorful graphics and delightful humorous charactersthere are more puzzles to conquer and more quottreasuresquot to findto beat the game you have to finish the events find some crystals whichll add to tombas ap totalit may make you dizzy but the act of playing is worth iti havent yet had a chance to play the original tomba but after picking up a copy of tomba  recently i have to say im pretty impressed  i wasnt expecting it to look so good and to have such solid enjoyable gameplayyou play as a young boy raised in the jungle and you must navigate often difficult terrain think running jumping climbing swinging and gliding to reach your objectivesolve puzzles while the whole time avoiding evil pigs and other enemys along the wayi found the initial learning curve to be pretty quick however more then a few of the objectives are fairly difficult so i wouldnt recommend the game for young children or the easily frusterated
youre going to need to save often to be successfuldo yourself a favor and check it out if you are looking for a good solid and challenging platformertomba  is a great followup to the original
it is more challenging and it gives that little rpg touch that this game needed to be successful
one  con that this game has is its poor sound quality and if you want a   hour adventure rpg this is not the game to get
however this is a fairly  short game that youll want to play over and over again
this game is a  game that requires a lot of thinking and should be a game that a parent  would love to buy for their kidsthe good classic platforming gameplay decent story lots of places to go lots of different things to killthe bad no sense of direction whatsoever can make you lost easily cheap deathsi remember tomba
back when i was a kid
that was a really great game then
it even is for today but of course shows its flaws more now
the story of tomba
is about pigsevil pigs
you are a caveman looking dude with pink hair who naps under a tree one day and an evil pig comes and swipes your bracelet your grandfather gave youyou try to recover it but you wind up doing more than just thatwhile the game has great platforming abilities its plagued with cheap deaths and not being able to find your way most of the time
with no map or any hints whatsoever it can make things frustrating
while the game sports many different enemies and environments it makes you feel like some things missing anyway
the main draw to this game was the unique idea of d and d mixed platformingthere are two parts of each level but one is behind each other
you can jump down from d platforms and come out of it like you would in a d game
this was both trippy and unique at the time
make sure you play this game is you havent and youll love itpros great for any aspiring xfiles fan to play several cast members make appearances throughout the game makes references to xfiles episodes and mythologycons no closecaptioningsubtitles available compatibility issues with the playstation  and playstation i played this game on my pc years ago and i recently got a copy for my playstation
its a pointandclick adventure game with video clips which takes place around the tail end of the rd season of the xfilesin this game you play as agent craig willmore an fbi agent based in seattle
youre called in by ad walter skinner to investigate the disappearance of his favorite pair of fbi agents from washington dc fox mulder and dana scullythe story is quite linear with slight changes that occur depending on choices you make during dialogues with nonplayable characters
during the game youll be searching for clues going to different locations on your pda interviewing people checking items on your computer with occasional shootouts thrown in for good measure
some of the rooms are very dark and its hard to know exactly what to click on to move the game forward
thankfully theres an artificial intuition option to help find difficult items throughout the gamethe playstation version is a disc game distilled down from the disc pc version ofthe xfiles gamebecause of this some gameplay elements were removed for the playstation version like figuring out willmores computer password but the plot doesnt suffer as a resultsome ingame jokes might be overlooked by casual xfiles fans but if you were a regular watcher or youve discovered the show on netflix youll notice references to episodes like syzygy blood money and piper maru among several others
one of the series writers frank spotnitz helped to write the games screenplay and i feel it could have worked as a twopart season  episodethe story is very goodthe game has appearances by david duchovny gillian anderson mitch pileggi steven williams and william b davisconsi was disappointed to find this game had no option for close captioning or subtitles on the playstation but these options were available for the pc versionheres the biggest knock to the game the xfiles is one of the games which backward compatibility forgotwhen i tried playing this game on my slim ps everything workedexcept the video it was completely blacked out
when i tried it on my playstation  it worked but all of the navigation and interaction icons were glitched
ive uploaded some pictures to the customer images section so you can see what i meanfinal verdictthis game isnt too difficult but some of the puzzles might require a peek at an online walkthrough or use of the artificial intuition optionits a great trip down memory lane for xfiles fans such as myself and if youre lucky enough to have a playstation  lying around its the best machine to get the clearest pictureif you only have a playstation  itll take some time and patience to get used to the visual glitchesxmen mutant academy is a pretty cool d fighter with with d rendered characters
it plays a little bit like the street fighter series but its  gameplay is excellent
each character has their own strengths and each are  pretty fun to play with
each character has a variety of super moves some  of which i am still trying to figure out
the characters are storm  wolverine cyclops gambit phoenix beast sabretooth mystique toad and  magneto
although the number of characters you can use is small its still  a very fun game to playthe graphics are excellent
there are different  scenes behind every battle such as the danger room the bayouaka gambit  etc
each character has very cool voice overs which are played at the end  of each battlebottomline where this title is not as stong as the  tekken series it is still a very fun fighter for the playstation
its  excellent graphics sound and gameplay will have you coming back for more  and more
this one is well worth a purchasethis game created a whole new level and a whole new idea of gaming
with outstanding graphics and ontheedgeofyourseat gaming and missions this game was an instant classic
althought they could add a d gun to this  first person shooter it lacks no other flaws
this game is a great great  game
your a swat team leader and its your mission to rescue the hostages  and its tailed with amazing cinemas and great gameplay
buy thisrainbow six is oddly unbalanced though fascinating
a realistic simulation of smallscale antiterrorist tactics its excellent in theory if often bizarre in execution
for a start you dont just dive into a  mission and fight you have to plan it first
this is the first problem   without knowing how the environment will be its very hard to work out an  effective plan
although the map you use to plot the path of your team can  be toggled into a semid view its slow and cumbersome and working out  which lines are walls which are fatal glass windows and which areas are  overlooked by balconies is impossible
therefore you have to treat the  first couple of attempts on a mission as if they are a practice run
worst  of all is the fact that once you have set the plan its set in stone   apart from a generic halt command you have no way of altering it whilst  in the action phase
therefore you play the mission until you complete it  and then go back and work out the most effective plan
the fundamental  flaw though is that you can create the perfect plan and still lose to  random chance and  or ai stupidity
the action phase is fascinating
unlike quake and its ilk bullets here are immediately lethal
the bad  guys tend to be extremely infeasibly accurate even when firing on full  auto so the game is enormously tense as you peek around corners trying to  spot a villain lurking in the shadows
the visuals are stark and angular  but seem to fit the precise analytical mood of the game quite well and  the sounds are fab
on the other hand its extremely hard often unfairly
neither your soldiers or the enemy appear to be particularly smart
order  your men to use grenades for example and they will inevitably blow  themselves up after which the enemy will mill around for a while before  getting bored and standing still as if random grenade explosions were just  one of those things
its best to be the point man and use your  associates to cover you than to send them against the enemy
the wide  choice of weaponry boils down to a single silenced machinegun and a  portable radar device and once you have played the missions once youll  probably want to do them solo the next time
the emphasis on hostage rescue  is often frustrating too  after playing the mission a single slipup at  the end results in the hostages being shot and you have to do it all over  againthe game works best during the excellent stealth missions in  which mission impossiblestyle you have to infiltrate an enemy  stronghold without being seen
it becomes a completely different game in  fact  a bit like thief but with technologyits interesting to  compare it with the two other highprofile soldier sims delta force  and hidden and dangerous too  the former is more cartoony with most  missions being solo sniperfests whilst the latter gets the planning  right whilst being full of bugsthis game is good
good things
the fun facter is wonderful
it has a ton of complex features and planning
the story line is wonderful
you get to nearly completely custimize your entire team
they have special classes and skills
your missions are very different and unique
there are unlimited ways to complete your mission adding a strong point to the replay value
the story is well told and interesting
they are in real world locationsyouve a arsenal of weapons and gadgets and body armer to custimize your men and women with
the game game is very realistic
if one of the men dies in a mission you cant use him in another mission he is dead
if a person is incapicated in battle you cannot use this operative in another mission for a certain amount of missions till he or she heals
also you can be wounded this happends eather if you are wounded in battle or you were incapicitated and know you are nearly healed
when you are wounded you can go into battle but have loss to your skills
types of soilders are assault recon demolitions electronics sniper they have skills fitting their type
types of missions include preventing a nuclear meltdown recon planting explosives capturing an enemy leader rescuing hostages nuetrilizing a group of terrorists and busting a arms deal prevent terrorists from escaping from a bust
you and your teamates have a realistic amount of health excluding bodyarmer you have as much health as the badguys
you can custimize down to the bullet you use in planning
nuetrel things
the enemy ai isnt that good
enemies arent very smart they dont really pay attention to their surronding killing them is easy
they will run from a grenade and set off a alarm but they could just be standin around not awear of anything until he sees you
so if you are behind him or near him in a position where if he just looked around hell see you but he dosentlook around
this dosent count for patroling enemies
when an enemy sees you he just walk towards you firing not ducking or hiding behind a wall
if you capture a enemy captain which you have to do in a mission hell sound just like a hostage you are rescuing
acting like they were rescued as prisoners not being captured as a prisoner
bad things
your team ai sucks they will will just stand there cluelessly unless you tell them to do something or you make them have a plan which they will follow like rbots only shooting enemy and doing what they are told
they basicly dont think for themselfs
you can shoot at one hell stand there doing nothing and your other teammates wont even notice that their coleege is getting killedalso it is loadeed with bugs and graphicel gliches enemys go through walls
you get cought in graphics allot
voices and music slur crackel
enemies sometime float around or the bodys are lieing firmly in mid air
im giving it  stars because even though it has some problems it is a really good game any realistic anterrorism shooting game fan would like itif youve ever played rainbow six and dreamed about how good the sequel to it could be this is your answer to it
this one will not let you down
it is packed with realistic intense gameplay along with jawdropping graphics
this game is everything that you could have anticipated or thought about
rogue spear even packs a level with a airplaine hijacking
talk about fun
i never thought that a game could get so real and addicting
this series  really introduced a whole new gameplay
i love both of these games
i can  say by pretty much that i like this one better
i love it
if u liked the  last one buy this oneessentially a series of extra missions for rainbow six this adds some extra weapons and an extremely useful crawl function the omission of which stuck out like a sore thumb in the original game
the extra weapons  some sniper rifles a new shotgun many more assault rifles and some  desert eagle pistols are nice to have but as with the original game you  will almost exclusively use your trusty silent mpsd
it has all the  strengths of the original  palpable tension some great mission designs   with some effective new locations
the wrecked rainlashed kosovan city is  extremely atmospheric and theres an obligatory passenger jetliner  hostage crisis tooon the downside the terrorists even when they are  jumpedup students are still unbelievably accurate regularly downing your  teammembers from a couple of hundred feet away even when armed with  machinepistols
this may well be how real special forces people train but  its offputting when you have to play the game
the lessserious delta  force seemed to get the skilllevel of the bad guys right in this respect
as i have said the extra weapons are cosmetically nice but only one  mission absolutely requires a sniper rifle and otherwise anything more  than a silenced machinepistol is slower and less useful
grenades for  example are amazingly pointless
as with the original the improved  graphics are functional although the detail of having wounded team members  limp is nicely done and some of the team ai is suspect
furthermore the  thought that you could create the best plan possible and yet still fail a  mission is unsettling
indeed the planning section still seems flawed  it  would be better if hidden and dangerousstyle you could alter or  generate the plan whilst in the action phase to take account of changing  circumstanceoddly the stealthy missions the thiefesque moments  where you must avoid being detected at all costs are the best of the lot   with the emphasis on solitary skill and sneakery theyre ultratense  affairs
another good thing is the lone wolf mode in which die  hardstyle you tackle thirty terrorists in a location soloif you have  the original is this worth a further  pounds
not really  youll  probably get it nonetheless but its not a major leap forwards
on its  own merits its excellent though a complex strategy  action game with  added realismthere is a lot of empty ground to cover a lot of w but okgood graphics and sound
you need to plan aheadi cant believe more people arent familiar with this zeldastyle game
i love zelda link to the past and it turns out blood omen is almost as awesome as that game
the fact that the orchestra music is really nice and the graphics are all dark and gothic gives the game a perfect touch of adventure and fear
i love iti really enjoy rpg games and this game is one of lthe older bestit looks and plays like a darker zelda alttp
you are a vampire you kill people you suck their blood you have gory magic etclooks and plays great for an early d ps game
the cutscenes are the worst i have seen
but the regular gameplay  of the game is very very solidrecommended for d fans or action rpg fansi will start off by saying this game is definitely not for everyonethe game starts off by allowing you to choose from one of seven characters
each one has their own story some better than others
i will say that square did advertise the game to be something it isnt seven different games which it is not
graphicssome nice locales and some plain looking locales
while the lighting outside of battle special effects in battle and monsters in battle appear quite nice however the characters have few frames of animation and dont have much detail
gameplaythe openended gameplay isnt for everyone
the game is nonlinear and at times it becomes difficult to find your next destinationin battle you select commands to attack however your characters learn a series of new attacks when they use the attacks they begin with
characters also learn team attacks when they use their attacks often
this is a pretty cool feature as battles dont become stale fast
musicbeautifully orchestrated music
this is one of the highlights of this gameprosmusic is a pleasure to listen tocharacters learn many moves by use of the ones listed in their command windowseven different characters to choose fromconswhile there are seven different characters to choose from some of the stories are weakopenended gameplay isnt for everyonegraphics may be a turn off to somedifficult navigationsquaresoft advertised the game as something it is notthis is a game i would have to recommend others to rent first if you want to try it out
i personally love the game however i can see why many wouldnt like it
you either fall into the half the like the game or hate itsuikodens chief appeal comes from its behemoth cast of  playable characters some of whom join you for no reason whatsoever some of whom you need to mollify with special items or impress by other means and most of whom have no semblance of any personality
there i said it
by combining different character in special formations you can also stumble upon combination attacks but there are so many possible formations that this task is well beyond dauntingcombat is a standard sixcharacter frontandback row affair completely turnbased
most magic spells and abilities are runebased while most runes can be bought en masse and assigned to virtually any character
this simple functional arrangment makes for interesting strategies and fun boss battles but during the frequent random encounters the routine of selecting quotattackquot six times in a row can drive the player up a wallthe graphics music and plot bridge the gap between the elegant simplicity of the bit era rpgs and the complicated flashy rpgs for the currentgeneration consoles
the music is very memorable
although the graphics can become pixelated in combat they allow the game to move at a fairly quick pace
the plot is nicely done with your army of  characters staging a revolution to depose the tyrannical government
luckily the alltoocliche supervillain doesnt become overly obvious until the last few parts of the plotsuikoden is a fine example of early playstation rpgs perhaps even one of the best
if you dont care too much for constant change and innovation suikoden just might fit your billsuikoden is an rpg similar in style to older rpgs like final fantasy vi chrono trigger and wild arms
there are no fancy cinematics no complex subplots and rarely as challenging as the newer fullscale rpgs
but this does not deplete the value of  the game considering it was made in  before ffvii and chrono cross ever crossed the psx radaryou are the son of a famous general who on a quest for the empire stumbles onto a renegade army of outlaws called the liberation army a group of people who seek to overthrow the empire
you inevitably get caught up in their cause
where suikoden differs from other rpgs is the diverse selection of fighters you can choose from  intotal
each character has various abilities and attributes and can help in different ways
finding all  characters helps give suikoden some decent replay value
unlike final fantasy vii which spans  cds suikoden only spans one so dont expect the  hours of game timegraphically this is nothin to get too excited about
the typical topscrolling view you expect from oldschool rpgs is here
as said before there are no cinematics so anyone expecting ffx material are lout of luck
being someone who loves oldschool rpgs this is a pro rather than a con
the music is nice and atmospheric and blends in nicely with the gameoverall this is a fine albeit short little rpg
all the elements that make rpgs great are here
the only complain i have is that there are times when the game seems too easy
otherwise i am happy with suikoden and would recommend it to any rpg loveroverall this rpg was very well done
there were some things that could have been improved upon such as graphics and more character development but lessons were learned and the improvements were made in suikoden its very hard to find this game nowadays but it is worth playing
in the late s konamis suikoden  and suikoden  were overshadowed by squares releases of final fantasy  and  but these really were great games that never received the attention they deservedafter hearing tons of good reviews for this game i decided to give it a try
anyway i picked up suikoden not really knowing what to expect and i was surprised
for an rpg that came out before final fantasy  it was quite goodthe story is simple
you are the son of a great general in the emperors army when he soon leaves to go to battle you get a job working for the emperor
soon later you stumble onto a secret your father has been serving the wrong side and now you must lead an army to defeat the evil emperoreven though the story is a little unoriginal it still unfolds very nicely
the character delevopment is good but nowhere near as good as chrono trigger or xenogears
the battle system is turn  based i hit you you hit me and the rune system is good but it could have been carried out a little betterthe main problem with suikoden is that it is too short
with monster games out right now that take   hours to beat such as grandia and xenogears suikoden only has about  hours
however the replay is high with trying to find all  playable characters
the game is also very easy which may annoy experienced rpg gamersanyway suikoden is a fun and enjoyable rpg that can be bought for a very good price
it should take you at least a few months to find all the  characters without using a walkthrough
pick it up and see for yourself you wont be disappointedthe tales franchise is one that is sadly overlooked
everyones played symphonia sure but what about the others
its a shame too because all of the games ive played have been pretty good
but as you can imagine some games are better than the others and this is one of the weaker gamesgraphics minus the anime cutscenes this looks like a game that could fit snugly in an snes cartridge
while its easier on the eyes than a polygonal mess it doesnt look much different than tale of phantasia
you know that the ps is capable of d graphics that are much prettier so theres no excusemusicsound there are quite a few good tracks in this game
from the bassheavy battle theme to the town music there isnt a bad track in this game
the battle voices sound good as well and theyre thankfully in japanese
we all know how bad english dubs for video games were in the sstorycharacters not a bad story here
the talking swords concept was neat and the main protagonist stahn is likable
the other characters who join you are solid as well
leon and rutee are welldeveloped and while the amnesia character is a bit cliche marys well done
the other characters are hit or miss
philias good garrs alright chelseas your typical annoying yearoldgirl and bruiser while a good character to have on your party isnt developed at all
the story itself is pretty easy to follow but its nothing memorable
also one thing i didnt like was that the main antagonist kept changing
while it keeps you guessing doing so doesnt give you a solid antagonist and the final ones a bit underwhelmingalso wheres the spa scenegameplay for an early tales battle system its decent
its d of course so it doesnt have that flow that later tales games will have
one thing i hate about the battles is that theyre too easy compared to other tales games
i felt overpowered throughout the game and i didnt feel threatened once during the final boss
another thing i dont like are the random battles
while tales games today have the enemies on screen early ones were random
the game makes you think at the beginning that the enemies will be on the screen but then it changes to random
my problem is that there are too many
its annoying to go through a maze of a dungeon or do a puzzle while getting pulled into a battle every five secondsone interesting thing about the systems are the swordians
theyre the talking swords that four of the characters obtain and are part of the story
the swords are customizable through discs and they can level up making it more interesting than just buying a new weapon in every village
you can also learn new moves that are on tablets around the world depending on you and your swordians levelthe rest is your standard jrpg formula
it all works well but theres nothing too interesting
one thing that could have had potential was the lens system
enemies drop lens along with gald and you can exchange your lens for gald
but i always find myself not needing to use it because i usually have all the money i needanother pet peeve of mine is your way of travel
you only get a flying ship at the very end so most of the game you are traveling by ship
the docks will only take you to port towns so theres no exploring
its also very annoying to accidentally choose the wrong town and it happens because you have to watch the ship go to the destonation on the world map
its a bit tediousmost of the sidequests and minigames arent too interesting
many sidequests involve the food system which is something i kind of ignore in the tales series
one sidequest that is good is a hidden dungeon that is based on the s namco game the tower of druaga and its the hardest part of the game
the minigames consist of things such as racing or tag so theyre nothing special but one of the better minigames is a quiz asked by phantasia characters cless and arche which is pretty neat
a few other sidequests help develop the characters more but theyre nothing really spectacularoverall despite my nitpicking this is another good ps jrpg to pick up especially if you are a tales fan
it doesnt have the mechanics of later tales games or the charm of phantasia but its a solid entry nonetheless
the price of the games a bit steep and its not yet available on the psn but if you can find this game for a reasonable price add it to your collectionfunny to think that before i even got to play this ive already played ffvii wild arms breath of fire  and other rpgs circa  and yet this game i have to say is my favorite among them all
a friend of mine had a copy and said it sucks but when i tried it i was completely mesmerized over how awesome this game is especially the battles
ive tried all sorts of rpgs in the past but even up to now i still consider the battles in namcos tales series to be the most actionpacked and fun the best for me to sum it up fully
tod may have a slightly high encounter rate which can be lessened by using a certain item but what about it if the battles are excitinggraphics
if you like snesesque d graphics at its best tod is simply a keeper
if not you might be initially turned off by this game
then again if graphics matter most to you then you might be more interested in a prettier but shallow and uninspired games that only take a few or so hours to finish
its no question that the developers who worked on this game emphasized more on what is skin deep
bad strategy to lure the dphiles at the time who were astonished by abything d but for rpg oldschoolers of the snes era most of them would see how good this game can be
and the anime intro of this game is really coolthe bgm music is aok not as memorable as that offered by lets say final fantasy or wild arms but its still pretty nice since it matches the game well enough
there are a few fast tunes that would stay in your head well for me anyway
as for the voices they retained the japanese voices instead of handing it to amateurish dubbers of that era good move
the japanese voices are awesome although it may annoy some who doesnt have trained ears for words that dont sound english with some famous seiyuu voicing out the characters battle voices
a definite treat for anime fansthe story may turn on some turn off others but overall the characters are the driving plot of this game and once you get a liking of any of the characters here you would enjoy the story immensely
i have to say the dialogue is pretty wellscripted as well as translated impeccably thats a positive word folks with a few funny and witty dialogue and injokes
this converts a seemingly triedandtrue rpg elements into something very light and enjoyable feel on a slightly cliched but wellwritten storythis is the game that started me on the tales series and what a series it is
and i find it ironic that certain game sites rated this game low whereas the people who actually played this game thouroughly see the game in high regardsby the way ive played all sorts of great games before in my friends place before and when i finally bought my own playstation ths is the first game i bought after trying it out in a friends place
even though i have the money to do so i havent bought another game for months
i just plain love this gamei made a big mistake when i first reviewed duke nukem time to kill and gave the game  stars
it turns out that as the game goes along youre required to climb swim and basically luck out avoiding gunshots from enemies
enemies will always hit you at least once before you can hit them
not fair
the game is too hard and the play control makes me absolutely sick
for some reason you have to hit the up button if you want to swim down
makes no sense at allthe framerate is so slow and choppy i just decided that after walking into a wall for the millionth time it was time to put this game in the trash
when you walk into a wall duke stops moving completely and just stands there like an idiot
you will walk into a wall all the time because its so hard controlling duke
some people might put this game is the garbage because of the bad example it sets for kids but others like me threw it away because a challenge should never lie in just trying to move your character from point a to point b  please avoid this horrible waste of plastichundreds of better games for the playstation are available if youre looking to start up a collection
avoid games like this one where just walking around becomes the biggest challenge you will face
god what was i thinking giving this game  stars
i should have collected my thoughts firsttravel through time in an allnew duke nukem fragfest that gives you more of what you crave
more duke attitude
more hardcore action
more exploration
more shooter mayhem
 massive single and player levels
play duke in third person perspective for the first time ever
 allnew annihilating weapons
hardcore nukem action shooting and exploration
annihialte ancient rome
tame the wild west
light up la
conquer the dark agesgraphics   neat character creations and fantastic hard guns make up for the occasional sense of effortlessness in the graphicssound   great guns fire away with heartpounding brilliance in sound and editingvalue   with fun games like duke nukem time to kill you cant get enough
its worth the money you pay for it because its fabulously entertaining and will keep you glued to the screen for agesoverall   dirty sexy hilarious neat actionpacked thrilling funit would take another few reviews to put all the adjectives that describe this game
just play it and see for yourself
not recommended for people under  years of ageeinhander has got to be the best looking shooter available on the playstation
its full of colorful and detailed backrounds the enemies are imaginatively constructed and theres a nice variety of weapons
the gameplay is similar to side scrolling shooters of the past with a couple of new featureslike the ability to choose your ship and being able to change your weapon configuration on the fly
einhander will keep even the most experienced of gamers on their toes with long and difficult levels
the only feature that keeps einhander from perfection is the lack of a  player mode
shooters have alot more replay value when they have a multiplayer option
still einhander is a great gameand since its now available at a low price theres no reason not to get itthis game and its twin panzer general are probably the best strat games for the playstation
ive loved them and their pc successors for years
these have crappy graphics and clunky movement and firing rules compared to pz  pz but i still love themthe only reason im reviewing this after  years is because im interested in what another review wrote about the pskov scenario in the russian campaign
it has to be buggedi remember trying for months to beat it to the point where i reloaded extensively until one time i beat it with a major victory
anything other than a major appears to end the campaign with a lossi saved that win on a memory card and any any time i wanted to play the russian campaign i just started with that save
so my old memory card got trashed in a flood and now i have to try to replicate what took about  month of on and off again playing to beat pskov the first time
can anyone if anyone reads this in the next three years tell me if there is any quick and easy way to pull a major on pskovthis game doesnt rank tops for graphics and the music can be pretty annoying after a couple hours but its easy to turn it off
the gameplay is completly unique its very complex and dynamic with some of the subtlty of a good chess game with the advantage of it being faster paced and more variable with terrain effects and pieces being able to offer support on attack and defense
all in all a good game and well worth the moneyi used to write for game informer and this goofy little game has had a lasting impression on me
if the words best game ever cause your brain to lean more towards a halo or a final fantasy than a katamari damacy this ones not really for you
its weird
its kind of bad
yet its delightful
youre a cave man
you run around and hit various animals with a stick to get food
you fall asleep for a good  seconds at a time often sliding down mountains in the process
the only real goal of the game involves running back and forth and repeating a task
its inexplicably awesome to some of us
if you have or want pepsi man in your gaming library this ones definitely worth grabbingso you wanna be a caveman
or cavewoman
then this is for you
now you might think it sounds silly but this game can devour your life whole
as of this writing i have recieved a copy again and its as fun now as it was way back then and its soundtrack is still excellent and the night sky and stormy skies make this game a true winner
did i mension the sound
its stunning
never in a game have i heard music and effects this good
i absolutely recommend this to any harvest moon nuts like me or anyone whom likes simulations
you start off as your sole tribe member but as you explore the earth all of it you will find other animal life cavemen and even aliens
its a weird game but its loads of fun
i had been playing what seemed like an hour when i looked at the time and saw  hours had passed
i am telling you this is great
the objective of the game besides getting your tribe to grow and advance yep weapon improvements so you can finally hunt the wooly mammoths for their tusks to build a tower to grab the tale of the sun right down to how the game shows your tribes history as a cave painting
i truly wish this would come out for a next gen system like ps or pc
buy it before it vanishes and you miss one of the great art style games think ico but st gen graphicsgraphics kinda ugly now
still  stars for the evening skiessound superb  star every sound rocks
from eating to waterfallsfun this rating scale isnt big enough for  star fun
so  starsoverall one of the forgotten gems of the ps grab a copy or you will end up buying one all scratched up off ebay
or worsebuy it here 
tail of the suntail of the sun has a simple premise and simple gameplay youre a caveman trying to survive evolve and build a tower of mammoth tusks that reaches so high into the sky it catches the tail of the sun
the game involves taking your caveman or woman if you so choose  you get to pick which tribe member you play next each time one dies out into the wilderness and exploring every nook and cranny trying to make sense of the world around you
along the way youll eat many many fruits to both help you survive it is possible to starve to death and to shape the attributes at which you want to excel  you can become an excellent jumper hold your breath underwater for longer periods evolve quickly run quickly to name a few
each food makes a slight unique impact on these attributes and you must balance these attributes deciding what is most important to your tribes survival
as you explore you will encounter animals from nearly harmless monkeys to deadly sabretooth tigers from which you can gather meat to bring back to your tribe and help it grow
youll also encounter caves solve little mysteries of the world and of course battle mammoths to build your tower  the ultimate goal of the gameill say it now the graphics and sound are nothing particularly standout or beautiful
if you must have your eyecandy or an epic musical score to set the mood for your game look elsewhere
on the up side however the graphics arent so bad you cant tell what youre looking at and the sounds and music are decent enough that while you probably wont be humming them for hours after shutting off the game they wont make you want to mute the game eithertail of the sun is a fairly easy game with simple controls that could be mastered by just about anyone including children
its repetitive nature is what prompted me to give it just four stars  after i had satisfied my curiosity as to exploring the rest of the world and decided that sabretooth tigers just werent worth my time to bother trying to kill it quickly devolved into an exercise of running to the nearest spot i knew had mammoths killing one bringing it back to my tribe and repeating over and over until the tower was complete
im sure this wasnt the way the game was exactly intended to be played by the developers but there it is
eventually thats all there is to do and it does become repetitive
there probably isnt much for replay value unless by some strange chance you manage to finish your tower while exploring and still havent satisfied your urge to explore the prehistoric world or you have some burning desire to see whether youre able to finish it with a different attribute setupoverall the game is just a fun light little diversion that will keep you busy for a few hours just dying to see whats around the corner or what happens when that tower is finished
i had a lot of fun playing it and other fans of quirky games will probably get a big kick out of this gamethe gameplay in astal is interesting
there is a cavepart where you will be warned of incoming monters
the screen will grow dark and all youll see is the glowing eyes of beasts your companion and astal
if you like odins breathtaking graphics youll like astal
its almost in the same fashion as odins background
the boss fights somewhat remind me of castlevania rhondo of blood remake for the psp
there are animated cutscenes and voiceacting
the game also reminds me of crystal maze for the atari
remember you had to finish the level before the grimreaper came
well astal has its version of the reaper
finish quickly or there will be something unpleasant stalking you
youll also want to smack the goddess for punishing astal then suddenly falling asleep for no reason thus leaving the universe vulnerable to be destroyed by her enemy
she then stupidly leaves afterwards for good so she has no purpose other than just being a goddess
the invoicing is somewhat cheesyastal yells
he yells like a banshee every time it comes time to toss some rock or an enemy
sure it can be ignored after a person gets use to the game but its annoying the first couple of times
astal is short game but it makes up for it with its sidescrolling graphics
gem for any collector of the sega saturn franchisesega fans used to eat this game up and claim it to be the ultimate adventure
it sure is adventurous
it didnt become the alltime classic that gaming magazines thought it would but nights has some really spectacular graphics and leaves you with a pleasant taste in your mouth
its unlike any other game ive ever played and when youre done playing it you think about it
you think about how theres really nothing else like nights out there
that alone should be enough for you to look into the gamethe graphics make you think wow
maybe the graphics are similar to sonic the hedgehog but only slightly
nights shows you how beautiful the nighttime can be if you give it a chancethis game is really fun and was under galactic attack is well worth buyingsaturn has some great shmups that went unnoticed like this gamega has great special effectscool atmosphereand a nice set of weaponsgunsthe explosives and backgrounds are beautifulone thing great about the saturn is that it handles d really greatit was made for itga doesnt have any slowdown whatsoevereven with all the bombs and shots going everywherethis game is a must have if you own a saturn or just love shmupsi just recently discovered themthis game is kind of hard to play if your not use to playing them like mei recommend galactic attack to anyone who owns a saturn and actually likes to play great video games like this oneget all  in the series but this one is the least impressive
though thats not a bad thing
the whole series is fantastic and funaladdin was the mega popular disney movie released in  and stars a teen named aladdin who unexpectedly falls in love with a princess and then rescues her from an evil sorcerer who gets a hold of a lamp containing great power
he wants to use this great power in order to rule the world
the movie won over moviegoers worldwide and received critical acclaim while grossing millions of dollars while it was played in theaters
it wasnt long before the game was released to the super nes and sega genesis in  the genesis version was made by virgin interactive and the snes version was made by capcom and fortunately they turned the hit movie into a good game worth playingaladdin follows the story and events in the movie exactly and focuses on aladdins agile ability to jump off poles ledges and enemies to reach platforms to other areas before continuing on
he can use apples to stun his enemies while collecting food for health diamonds for points and golden scarabs which trigger a mini game at the end of the stage where he finds one
the game has  stages in total including bonus stages where you can earn more pointsthe pros capcom had held the license to make games based on disney properties
aladdin looks and sounds great thanks to its bright graphics excellent music sound effects and even includes songs featured in the movie
the controls are spot on so controlling aladdin is never an issue
once you finish a stage you are given a password so its easy to stop where you are and continue your progress laterthe cons aladdin is not the hardest game out there so even the youngest of players can breeze through the game with ease
its also a short game so its over before you realize itinteresting enough the reason capcom did not make this game for the genesis was because the license to make games based on disney movies had just expired and virgin interactive stepped in to make it for sega
that game turned out to be totally different and received positive reviews and feedback from players
you cant go wrong with either version
but for those who want to check out the snes version its worth buying it for young players but it may not hold the interest of older gamers long enoughi had this game growing up and man it was fun
i spent many a nights and days playing it
the only complaint is that it was a little short
i got used to it and could burn through it so fast
it was awesome though and what i wouldnt give to have back my super nintendo and all my games from thenincluding this classicmaybe since the game uses the name battletoads i hold this game to very high standard
battletoads the original was one of the best nes games and one of the best of all times
it combined difficulty with innovation i  mean the game took the toads to many different and well themed levels with great controls
this game falls short in each category however its still pretty decent and fun
below are a the pros in cons to double dragon andor battletoads games for nesprosbetter ai
with computer opponents as well as dragons and toads move faster
bosses are less predictable at least in regards to battletoads for nes
has a rather cool point system different methods of defeating an enemy lead to a different amounts of pointsconsplatforming difficulty is way down  and so are the general controls my biggest complaint with the game
level  in general not because its hard because no space ship should fly like that naturally a stage like battletoads for gameboy stage two would have been great
computers can really cheaply juggle with is totally unfair doesnt allow you to get out of a combo at all to attack
however they would maybe bring down your life  points sometimes so its ok its not constantly doing thisin summary if you want a true battletoads game this isnt it however if you like slightly more challenging beatem up and battletoads is too hard play thisrare finally closed the dkc series with this title donkey kong country  dixie kongs double trouble
released in  it was one of the last games to appear on the snes as the nintendo  made its debut and everyone was moving onto it and the playstation
dont let the naysayers cast a shadow over dkc  its a good game that while it isnt better than diddys kong quest it is worthy to being part of the fantastic snes seriesin donkey kong country  dixie kongs double trouble both donkey kong and diddy kong have been kidnapped by a mysterious villain named kaos so dixie kong enlists the help of her baby cousin kiddy kong to help her in the rescue effort
dkc has all of the previous features from the first two games and adds more friendly animals an all bear clan that populates the brand new world and stages new items to collectnew enemies and a mini fetch quest for items that help you get to other parts of the world
there are plenty of secrets here so be sure to beat all the stages and find all the items to access the hidden world and hidden boss as well
the game has up to three slots to save your progress and its done exactly like in the previous entries of the seriesthe pros rare still manages to pump out a fun game and everything works
while its still more of the same experience its still worth doing it again
the new world is viewed from an overhead perspective and gives a preview to the gorgeous graphics and subtle effects
the music is all new and sets the mood while the controls are exactly same as they have been with dkc and dkc
the game is pretty hard so it will take you awhile to find all the secretsthe cons by now some people may feel the been there done that feeling as youll be doing the same thing beating enemies collecting items finding secrets
this game doesnt bring anything new so you better be okay with that
otherwise youll get bored pretty fastand so the dkc trilogy ended with this underrated gem as it was the least liked of the three
rare would go on to make bigger and better games on the nintendo  and they will always be remembered for the contributions they made during the snes era
if youve played through donkey kong country  and  then you already played this game
if you havent done so track down a used copy or get yourself a wii and download it from the virtual console service for  points 
long live dkc trilogyi enjoyed the first two games before this onethis game has a few more secrets to find than the old ones
though it does suck you cant play as donkey kong as you cant in the second onewhile the graphics are beautiful and some of the gameplay new there isnt much here that you havent already seen
some of the levels were quite innovative and fun yet others were just more of what was in the second game in the series
while this game is great the second is vastly superior in quality and originality and i would recomend you play that firstthis is a cool game
there is a topdown perspective when youre exploring the outside area
when you go in buildings it switches to a d firstperson perspective
graphics in this game are quite good
the dinosaurs look extremely good
but the sweetest thing about this game is the soundin full dolby surround sound
not many games on the snes had surround sound the only other game i can think of that does is super turricanoverall i think this is a pretty fun game for something on the system
though at some point it is impossible to go on because of the card key
but at this time there might be some guide for that hidden item
but it is still quite funi own this game for my super nintendo and its pretty cool
although its not cool enough to get a  star rating from me
ive beat it a few times
it has a cool story structure but it could have better items
when you beat a dungeon you get a pendant instead of an essance mask or medallian
there are three dungeons in all
you can go between the real world and the dark realm to advance in your journey
thats pretty cool
its up to you whether you want to buy it or not
see yamy sister order it but when she play it
it just would not save
but the owner was cool about it and did take it back and gave our refund
so we are happy about thatgreat i love it
the game is cool they sould make the game harder and have more bosss than before
if you have not play the game you sould because the game is any other game that i play before in years
i have two games of zelda there are the legend of zelda ocarina of time and the legend of zelda  majoras mask there are a great game you sould go and buy it and play it yourself
the game is fun you get to go places like under water on top of a mountains and in cold caves inside a big fish and forests oceans rocky mountains and graveyards
nd saveing the world in the nick of time from evil king ganondorf and stop evil monsters in each dungeon in the game
and saveing the world again now go play the gameps
play the legend of zelda a link to the past thats a good one tooeven without being part of the zelda series this game is a lot of fun
if youve played links awakening on the gameboy you will see that this game is very reminiscent of that one
you gain one special item in each successive palace  something that has not changed as far as i know fight bosses and navigate your way through progressively more difficult dungeonslairs
the nice thing is that this game provides a lot of backdrop compared to older installments of zelda and the graphics were really nice for that time and still are todaythere are a couple of parts of this game that are frustrating but overall this game is really solid and ive enjoyed it
if youre a zelda fan definitely check it outas most of all the other reviews state this game is a musthave
you can get all sorts of weapons and items and such and battle interesting people and bosseseverybody says this game has fantastic graphics but really it looks like a pokemon game boy game which is why i took off a starin the game there are soooo many places to explore and things to findbuy this game nowbecause at the time no other game dazzled players like this one did
it was innovative with the flying cape tricks you could pull off and the music was sensational
going to each castle was fun too and beating the pants off of the koopa kids was fun as heckim not sure that this game would get much play time from me now though because i played it out when it was out and after that
but for those who have played it too im sure you agree that this game was wonderful and still is
p starswith a save feature this game is just awesome
since theres a hundred ways to exit with some levels having two exits interesting powers new abilities and great graphics this is a game that just cant be beat
with the save you can play for as long as you like
riding yoshi really is a lot of fun at times though its disconcerting and frustrating if youre riding along smoothly and an enemy strikes you causing yoshi to run off
the levels are rich and complex and theres some cool shortcuts and features you can activate
i found the shortcuts but still went through each level to get  percent because if you do you get to play in an allnew secret bonus world
how nice is that
if youre ever going to play a mario game try this
heck i like this better than mario this is super nintendos best work yet
mario is back and ready for action look out bowserits super mario world
brings back memories but i dont remember it being so easy
man how you remember things from your childhood so differentas the original packin game for the super nintendo this is a worthy successor to the super mario series
it expands the super mario universe without sacrificing the fun or addicting gameplay
in addition to improved graphics mario has new moves including the ability to throw turtles fly and ride around on a little green dinosaur named yoshi his first appearance in the video game
the world itself is huge compared to previous mario games with a nice variety of settings including haunted houses
a battery backup lets you save up to four games
this game should be standard issue for all super nintendo ownersmegaman x was capcoms megaman spinoff and the first mm game on the snessome would say the first game for snes was mm but that was released in the same year mmx
anyways for one of the earlier snes games mmx has great graphics great gameplay and great music
the stages are designed with great skill as there are pits and spikes everywhere with plenty of walls to climb
the music in the game is really good too not necessarily being top notch but being good enough that you can remember most of it
with the start of a new series there are new features
in this game you start with the ability to climb walls
then you have to hunt down the heartsto expand your health bar the capsulesto upgrade your armor and the subtankslike the energy cans from the originals except these are permanent and you fill them up yourself with excess healthan interesting feature in this game that was unfortunately not featured in any others is that you can affect other bosses stages by defeating a certain boss
for example you kill chill penguin and the lava in flame mammoths stage freezes
stuff like thatits really neatothe only thing that this game is lacking is plot
sure if you sit through the annoying sequence in the beginning with the type writer and the alarm noise you see that x is a new kind of robot that can think and act for himself and that if he was to make a wrong decision the effects could be disastrous
you would also see that a man named dr cain discovered x in a capsule  years after he was made
but after that there wasnt much to the plot except quotlets go find sigmaquot and quotill take him xquot and then quotcrap im deadquot and finally quotyouve killed me x but well meet againquot the plot is the only minus in this game
had this game had a better developed storyline it wouldve gotten the full five stars
however its still a great game and i would recommend it to anyone who was new to the series and interested in which game they should play first and its not expensive so anyone can easily buy it without getting a hole in their walletthis is one of the more expensive snes but i dont play it that much its kinda boringits really good for  yrs ago tho foshomega man x 
the first part of a seven episode spinoff series and the first one to appear on the super nintendoby the time  came around the nes was almost dead and everyones favorite series of games had to be ported over to the thennextgeneration system the snes
many companies pulled it off quite nicely with newport sequels of games like mario castlevania metroid and others
obviously capcom heeded the calls of their devoted fans and decided to give their most successful series an innovative upgrade and a new darker look
thus the mega man x series was created
although a bit cartoony looking compared to say x and x it took the mm series to a whole new level in terms of story gameplay and features
well heres my synopsisproscompletely original ideas
most every x game hereafter would reuse this games general formula of find the armor beat the bosses
the biggest difference gameplaywise from the original series is the armor feature
by collecting parts of it x becomes more able to take on the levels and the bosses the levels themselves were designed with the dash feature in mindthe idea for the poweranimal bosses is alot more clever and original than the repetitive powerman type bosses used in the older games
for instance storm eagle sounds quite a bit more threatening than say  bright mangood music improvement
well the old games had good tunes but these sound more like upbeat hard rock in terms of quality than the buzzing nes midi
the loud sound effects are especially fitting for an action game like thisstorywise a nice connection to the original series
it starts out with x being built by dr light
he is very unsure about his new prototype model so in order to make sure all of xs systems will function properly he x must be locked in a capsule for about thirty years
light realized that he wont be alive when x awakens so he buries x for another scientist to find
 years later dr cain finds x and starts to build numerous creations based off of xs design
one of them sigma goes haywire and threatens to destroy all of mankind so x is sent to stop him
i wont spoil the restgreat balance of gameplay
the action is tough but not too hard to the point of impossibility
there is plenty to shoot at and enough great weapons to do so with
i like the new idea of charging up boss weapons
at the cost of more wenergy a little flame attack can turn into a giant wave of flame pillars
simply a phenominal ideai love the idea of beating a stage in order to alter another one
for instance if chill penguin is destroyed then all the lava in flame mammoths stage will freeze enabling x to make it through the stage easier and to obtain more powerups
sadly this idea was completely ignored for the next  sequels until x where it returned in the form of a crudely put together nightmare systemconsthis is the first mmx game and it shows
many ideas havent  been brought to their full potential yet which would happen later in the next few games
a perfect example of this is the ramhelmet upgrade
there is one place where you can use it but otherwise its only function is to make x look more fancy
like i said this will improve in the upcoming sequelsthe levels are decently designed and reasonably long but like x there are hardly any extras to find however this is the first game
powerups are easy to find for the most part the dashboots upgrade is directly in your path
still there are more secrets to find here than in any other mm game up to that pointzero and vile are introduced but they dont really explain each of them here zero would be in x and vile sort of would be in x
the reason i complain about this is because originally this was going to be the only game and it would have been pointless to introduce close characters that wouldnt get a chance to evolveall things said i cant really find anything bad about this game
its a great step up from the old series and has some of the best d action gameplay you will ever find on the snes
its only slight drawback comes from the fact that the x series is at its concept stage at this point giving off ideas that will only continue to improve in the next several x games
this game gets  stars for good gameplaysoundstoryinnovation all put together into an overall great package
i heartily recommend this game to beginners of the series
many longtime fans find this to be their alltime favorite x game
while its certainly not my favorite it does everything that an oldschool d action game should do deliver pure nostalgic gaming bliss
besides isnt that all that mm games need in order to be good
if you havent played this game yet either youre too young to care or youve been living in a hole for the past decade
in which case go get yourself equipped with time stopper and track down a copy of this game before they all disappear
you wont regret ithaving enjoyed the original rockman series at least  i decided to try the mega man x game recently though i had been aware of mmx for years
this game is different than the original but it has enough features in common with its predecessor that it is familiar and fun enough for longtime fansrather than  man as the usual stage boss the robot masters in the mmx series are generally modeled after animals but with many of the same abilities as the original bosses such as lightning fire ice shield etc
here you have such bosses referred to as mavericks as chill penguin flame mammoth sting chameleon launch octopus and so on and so forth the formula of which would last through the rest of the mmx series
you acquire weapons and by exploring stages carefully you can increase your power gauge and find other nifty little things that boost your statsi have to admit that i miss dr wily he was such a fun game character but this series is still a lot of funthis was capcoms first mega man x game
for the most part they pulled it off nicely
though you began the game normal you had to find four capsules each one with an upgrade for your body
the leg part would let you dash short distances and jump further
the helmet part allowed you to break certain surfaces with your head
the body part allowed you to withstand twice as much damage
and the arm part let you charge your blaster to a fourth level of damage
also you begin this game with a very small life meter
you must find the heart tanks one is in each of the eight stages to make it larger
instead of energy tanks you now have sub tanks which you must fill yourself with surplus energy
also completing certain stages will alter others
if you beat chill penguins stage flame mammoths fire factory will have frozen over
if you beat storm eagles stage the wreckage of his flying machine will destroy the electricity generation in spark mandrills stage
if you beat launch octopus the underground of sting chameleons stage will flood
being a totally new series this takes place approximately  years after the most recent game in the classic mega man seriesthe story goes something like this x a new breed of robot who can think and make decisions on his own was unearthed from the remains of an ancient laboratory by dr cain
fascinated by x cain produced his own series of these robots ignoring the risks
several of them became mavericks and began disobeying human orders
to counter this cain built maverick hunter robots led by the ultrapowerful sigma
unfortunately after sigma battled a mysterious red robot called zero he too became a maverick bringing cains worst fears to life
oddly enough zero went back to normal and joined x together they set out to destroy all of the maverick bots
unfortunately zero was destroyed in action forcing x to continue alone
once he ultimately stopped sigma he realized the battle was only beginning
it would be continued in future mega man x gamesaside from having to start a level over if you die the game is cool and it plays wellgo see video samples of the game from level  to the end at love itmany movies that get turned into video games do not fair well
more often than not they dont follow the movies very well at all or they simply fail at having decent gameplay
sometimes even both
the super star wars trilogy on the super nintendo has decent gameplay
they dont follow the movies to a tee especially the first game but theyre good games nonetheless that many gamers are destined to likethe game begins on the dune sea where youll play as luke skywalker
you begin the game with a simple blaster and can power it up through the level
the first power up gives you flame
afterwards you can power the blaster up to heat seekers rapid ion and plasma
you cant carry all five blasters at the same time however
they stack on one another
there are fifteen levels in super star wars and as the game progresses so will the gameplay
eventually luke will be able to use a lightsaber and eventually youll get to use han and chewbaccasuper star wars is not an easy game however
while no where near as difficult as the empire strikes back the game provides a good challenge nonetheless
many times youll find yourself suffering from cheap deaths
some levels are also populated with dangers that will kill you in one hit
to compensate the game has difficulty levels
easy brave and jedi
all of which are fairly challengingin terms of graphics super star wars looks very good for a video game released in   there are a few moments of slowdown while playing and a few moments where certain aspects of the environment will be clipped but nonetheless the levels are very detailed
even better is the music in the game which sounds very close to the movie only sixteen bit
if anything the only big problem with the music is that there isnt much of a soundtrack to it
many levels especially in the later half of the game make the same music over and over againsuper star wars is still a brilliant game for its time
gamers looking for a challenge and nostalgia will be happy to play thisthis is not a bad game
its not a great game but its really not bad
its not for kids its for the kind of people who like tetris or bejeweled or dr mario or minesweeper
just dont expect it to be like tetris its more like bejewled
its meditational but gets challenging
it has good music for a game of this sort
im not sure what style the music is but its old timey
swing mayberare proved to be a worthy asset to nintendo during the s and surprised everyone by bringing out the hit arcade game killer instinct in  it was an excellent alternative to the street fighter and mortal kombat games that dominated the arcade scene
while it did not have as many characters or stages as other fighting games it made up for it with stunning graphics excellent music a roster of good characters and deep gameplay that made you want to master each character
then in  rare released killer instinct for the snes shocking and surprising gamers at the same time
and it was so close to the source material that it was such a marvelous achievement from rare and nintendokiller instinct has a story in there that no one cared for so you just jump into the action
pick a character and youll see the line of characters you must fight one after the other
each character has hisherits own moves waiting to be discovered
the game gets you acquainted to a combo system where you can string together certain moves to start a combo chain
the longer the chain the more you get to beat up the opponent and take off more energy
to make it interesting and to stop players from over dominating matches each character has a combo breaker move a certain combo then when you execute after someone tries to chain a combo that character breaks out of it and hits your opponent at the same time
when your opponent loses all of hisher energy you get the chance to end the match by either knocking himher off the stage or by doing an end special a special move that you execute to unleash a barrage of combo hits earning you an ultra combo  or more hits in a row
if you take too long to finish your opponent heshe comes back to life with a little bit of energy and is extra powerful
alongside the main mode you can get used to the controls in the practice mode tweak the game setting in the options screen take on another player in the  player vs mode and tournament mode where up to  players can duke it by passing the controller aroundthe pros for rare to bring this game to the snes and have it turn out as good as what capcom did to the home port of street fighter ii a few years before it was quite impressive
the core game complete with all the characters stages and moves is intact and inside the massive black  megabit cartridge
the graphics music sound effects and game play are worth seeing in person
the controls are very responsive and its just a matter of memorizing the moves before you learn how to play and get better
the game will become more difficult once you raise it so prepare to fight hard
adding the extra modes means you can get all your friends in on the action making it a fun game to play
as an special treat rare included a bonus music cd of the games soundtrack and remixed tracks exclusively for the snes versionthe cons due to cartridge limitations rare had to make cuts here and there
you will see missing frames of animations flat d settings instead of the original d look the stages had in the arcade version graphics running on a lower resolution setting and the music tracks playing in the background of matches are instrumental compared to the arcade versions where you heard it with the lyrics spoken hence the reason why the music cd was included
these are just minor quips as it doesnt deter from the overall gaming experiencekiller instinct was worth picking up back in  and is still worth playing to this very day
those of you who want to take a chance on this better find a used copy as this game is expensive to buy as a new product
so if you still got your snes and it works definitely check this out
and if you can buy the soundtrack as well its pretty goodfor a  bit game this rocks
interesting set of characters phenominal graphics and outstanding music once again proves why the snes is one of the all time greatest systems
as in controls this title utilizes every button available  total to unleash incredible combos that makes this the fighting game to ownthat is not to say that this game doesnt have its flaws
for example the difficulty is set even on easy to where a casual gamer just cant pick this up and play
the training mode is lackluster and combos are difficult to pull off
also despite how cool the music is it doesnt always fit the area your fighing in
however overall it works just finelooking at characters there is a nice variety
you have cyborgs ninjas assassins mutants aliens lycanthropies and even a skeleton who has the funniest ending
no move is duplicated each has their own set of specials and combos
however the finishing taunt wont spoil it is a little dumb and the finishers are ok at bestin the end killer instinct is a nice game to purchase it will take a lot of practice to beat the final boss but it is so worth it if you winfatalitywhile this game was simple compared to future mortal kombat games it served as a good precursor much like the first installment of final fantasy mario bros legend of zelda etc etc
so give it a try if youre a mortal kombat fan and get a taste of the old schoolany video game fan has played this game at least once in their lifetime
and even though this game really resembles the original arcade version for this game the fatalities and the gore which was controversial at the time and caused all video games to have rating labels on them are missing
so that means after the fights are over no fatalities all you can do is finish your opponent off with a regular move
but even with the fact that is a tamed version of the arcade favorite i still enjoyed this game
theres  characters to choose from which are liu kang kato johnny cage raiden scorpion sub zero and sonya
the game is filled with great graphics and easy to learn gameplay
the best characters to play with are sub zero scorpion and raiden
this was still a fun game and if you wanna add one of the greatest fighting games ever made to your video game collection get this game wherever you can find a copy of it
versions to avoid sega genesis game boy and game geari used to play the crap out of this in the arcades spending crazy quarters on it
once it was coming to home systems i was like its on
i had both a genesis  snes
i chose to get it on genesis first
shortly after i got it for the super too
mk has  characters scorpionliu kangraidensubzerokanojohnny cage  sonya
each have signituretradmark moves much like street fighter  and the characters also have their own fatalities which you do after winning  rounds
both versions sega  nintendo have pros and consheres snespros the graphics are much more accurate to the arcade than the genesis versionthe sound is better  more clearsharp than the genesis versionit has all characters as does segascons no bloodno fatalities exact as the arcade versionthe controls arent horrible however they feel a bit delayed or stiffoverall its still a fun game for the snes  for the nostalgia of it
the game has obviously aged since its release yrs ago
still cool thoughbest played with a friend or family member
id say this is worth picking up for farely cheap
mk is where snes incorporated the blood and fatalities like the arcadethe censoring is no big deal however there are some negatives to this portthe game is a bit slow not that much though
the game is rather dark too so enemies can be hard to spot
the games window is smaller then usual toohowever this game is still awesome and classicby the way this game comes with a red cartridgei think the jaguar version is betteri guess its the graphics that makes me like the jag version better
the one area the snes version does better than the jag version is musicwell actually the jag version has no ingame music whatsoever but it makes it creepier
but for a bit game snes doom is greatdoomjust the name alone makes you drool over your bfg  and shotgun
direct from the pc to your snes system doom is a fun fps on the snes
with the used of the fx chip the graphics are not bad for its time and the music is quite good
however there are some cons to the game you cant save your game once you start you have to play all the way through but you can gain access to the other chapters but selecting harder difficulty setting controls are very rough on your dpad hand
you move a bit sluggish and the controls fell a bit heavy graphics are good for a snes system but long play and your eyes are going to fell like youve been staring at the sun all dayalthough it has its short comings its still the doom we all know and lovedoom is by far one of my favorite video games of all time it broke grounds for todays action and shooters
but the control is horrible for snes version maybe because my first play was on a spsbut all in all you gotta appreciate nintendos effortsunless you are a collector i highly recommend playstations versions and or x boxdespite the fact the super nintendo had big amounts of classic games like chrono trigger final fantasy iii vi to everyone else and super metroid the system had a great amount of party games that you can play with friends and just have fun
super punchout
was one of those games since you could take turns playing each fighter or see who could best the others time when playing time attack mode
however the game like a lot of the older games was hard and at times unbelievably frustrating at partsstory youre basically a boxer going through the different circuits which range from wimpy average fighters to championshipcaliber players who hit hard and fast
its a boxing game so theres not really much of a story to begin with and fighters get their own little prefight quotetauntgraphics the graphics while outdated work extremely well in the game as your fighter transparent except for his gloves faces off against the different fighters who face you
some of the taunts and moves they do is actually quite funny and unlike some games the graphics support the game rather than stylize it without the gameplay theresoundmusic the different fighters have different themes to go along with them and have small voice clips sometimes
gabby jay for example will open the match with a yay
and when hes about to get his big punch in he goes come on
its nothing to impressive but at least it gets the job done although personally i like listening to music while playinggameplay one of my least favorite things in a game is a huge sense of difficulty in that the game almost seems to be better than you and upon beating a levelbossfighter rather than feel elated and proud you get frustrated that it took so long
the first  circuits are simple and nothing too difficult but then you hit those last  and oh my god talk about frustration
punches pack a wallop they defend more and usually seem to know what youre about to do
if you could beat the special circuit without dying on any of them hats offas for the gameplay itself you have your body blows which hits their stomach and jabs for the face with a special punch should you fill up a meter after you get successful punches enough without getting hit
enemies have a uniquebutlimited move list so its just simply a case of figuring out the patterns and know what to duck what to counter and how to exploit them
but ultimately the games not challenging because of time restraints although you do have  minutes or because of enemy strengthspeed but because your guy doesnt dodgeduck quick enough and there was times where id dodge the first and second attacks only to get hit anyway by the second that i was supposed to be dodging
its minor but in the heat of battleheh it gets on your nervesif you can even track it down id highly recommend it as its quite fun but those with low blood pressure and get easily frustrated might wanna stay clear or at least prepare yourselfsuper punch out is the sequelfollowup to mike tysons punch out or punch out depending on which version you have and like the original punch out its a beat em up and knock em down type of boxing game that makes fun of itselfnow super punch out isnt as comedic as ready  rumble but it does have some funny moments in it like when you slug your opponent so hard that they look like their going bean up their lunch and whenever you knock down the narcist prince thats just funnyonly  characters from the original have returned bald bull mr sandman and super macho man
with a cast of all new boxers with all new styles and definitely new challenges super punch out will keep you entertainedi will admit that this might not be for all gamers
there is no mobility like punch out
basically you dodge duck and throw punches
and eventually you do get a little tired of this one
id either look to buy this one cheap or rent it first if you can
its still a good game but it is really to each their ownfun but hard gamewhile not as fun as the original maybe due to nostalgia this is an entertaining game
the boxers definitely toughen up the further you progressthe final wrestling game to grace the snes took a whole different path than the previous three available
this offers arcade fighting action in and out of the ring
arcade meaning that you press forward forward punch to perform a move
there are only six true to life superstars bret hart the undertaker hbk razor ramon doink the clown and lex luger so you may get bored with frequent matches
there are some incredible animations though but it does get goofy though with hit combinations lex lugers arm turning into a mace and other such odd things
there is a road to wrestlemania mode for single players which pits you in singles two on one and three on one handicap matches
it can get frustrating and tedious to go through those matches
the two player mode only has a huge battle royal mode in which a tag team together tries to defeat  wrestlers which come in one after anotherisnt it just like acclaim to incorporate real life humans to portray characters in their games
this trend started in mortal kombat and theyve outdone themselves with this game by using the actual wrestlers themselves
mind the term quotwrestlersquot though because this game is almost fiftyfifty in wrestling and street brawling
you get to choose from six wwf wrestlers bret quotthe hitmanquot hart shawn michaels the undertaker doink quotthe clownquot lex luger and razor ramon aka scott hall
this is a bit unfortunate because the genesis version had them plus yokozuna and bam bam bigelow
this may cause the game to be a tad repetitive
but once the match starts its an allout brawl and the victor will most often be the fastestthinking shrewd and buttonmashing wrestler rather than people taking a strategic approach
they may find themselves knocked out and pinned in ten secondsthe graphics and animation are realistic
the music is fair
i cant say quotgoodquot because it doesnt have the wrestlers theme songs can i
the sound effects are nice and the commentators vince mcmahon and quotthe kingquot jerry lawler are great
memorable comments include mcmahon shouting quotboomshakalakaquot quotshockingquot  and occasionally quotsomebody call securityquot
the game also has quotspecial movesquot like doinks quotelectric handquot and bret harts rolling uppercut
the gameplay is fast and furious
controls are deadon
and get this it has mortal kombatstyle blocking tooso this game might not be the best wrestling game out there
it could use more wrestlers and a few more options
but compared to its predecessors royal rumble and wwf raw it is quite a bit more addictive
besides its good to have some spontaneous wrestling for a change without memorising the moves
most any wrestling especially wwf fan will derive some serious amusement out of this onei love this game it certainly is not like any other wrestling game
this one is not about pinning anyone or making them submit like wrestling
this was more a new version of mortal kombat
the same company acclaim made this game a beat em up
however there is no blood and no finishers
you can preform combos special moves and things like that its much the same as mortal kombats style of game play
the commentary is not annoying provided by vince mcmahon and jerry lawlerthe downfalls are that it did not have yokozuna or bam bam bigalo like the arcadepc sega versions for some reason
but it honestly had a lasting quality over the rest for me untill i found the pc versionits still a great game but you might want the pc version for better graphics and extra wrestlersthere has been complaints about glitches in this game but i loved the glitches
i thought they where cool to hear odd sounds weird effects doing monovours without your oponent actualy being in it
dont let the fact that  wrestlers wernt included this game was super fun if you gave it a golet me start by saying that dark reign  isnt the only drts game out there
there are at least two others  ground control and earth  both games are getting good reviews and it looks increasingly as though dark  reign  is the going to be the only drts to get some very bad reviews
why
part of that is due to bad timing since ground control and earth   were released first
the other reason is because there are deficencies in  gameplay that shouldve been corrected before they were releasedthis  game was made by pandemic the same people that created battlezone  bz
this was a game that was prone to crashes especially on nvidia videocards  and was infested with all manner of gamecrashing bugs
basically bz was  a game that couldve been a classic if it hadnt been for those horrible  bugsfortunately pandemic have obviously learned from their mistakes
dark reign  isnt the crashprone mess that bz was
in fact its the  only daccelerated game that can be played straight out of the box  no  patches required
so the extra months of quality testing were definitely  worthwhilehowever dark reign  does fall down in one important area   gameplay
the developers have obviously put a lot of effort into the  appearance of the game but failed to pay attention to gameplay
for  instance many of the missions require your units to navigate narrow  valleys and the pathfinding ai isnt up to the challenge
its ridiculous  seeing a squad of scorpion tanks jostle for position in a narrow valley
the poor pathfinding ai really shows in the last two missions which take  place in a large and very beautiful looking city
i had to bring a scaver  which is a repair bot to a particular location
instead of making a  beeline for that location the unit careered over the entire mapand then  got blown up by enemy unitsthe other deficiency is in the very short  single player campaign
the sprawler campaign only has ten missions  whereas most strategy games give each side at least  missions
i suspect  that either pandemic is relying on players to create their own missions or  theyre going to release an expansion pack
nevertheless thats no excuse  for creating such a short single player gameand finally my least  favourite aspect of dark reign  is oddly enoughthe graphics
this is  purely a matter of personal taste
ive noticed that pandemic give their  objects a rounded softfocus look that im not too comfortable with
ive  never really liked the polygonal look of most objects in daccelerated  gameseven quake  has the same appearance curved surfaces  notwithstandinglets not forget that dr is still a realtime strategy  rts game
and there are plenty of classic rtss that it will be compared  to
the original dark reign is an obvious choice
so is the nowclassic  starcraft which is the true benchmark that any sciencefiction rts must  aspire to
starcraft had an excellent storyline but the unit control was  too primitive
dark reign  has the opposite problem  a poorly thought out  singleplayer storyline but excellent unit controlsin conclusion dark  reign  couldve been a classic
its the only game ive bought in the past  two years that can be played straightoutofthebox which even diablo   cant lay claim to
and it has an excellent graphics engine
but its the  pathfinding ai and the toobrief single player game that really lets it  down
dark reign  is unfortunately no starcraft
but that shouldnt stop  pc gamers from giving this one a fair goso this game is really welldone
ill say that first unequivocally
the d rendering rocks
the characters are welldefined and wellbalanced
the scale and atmosphere is a broodingfilm noirpost modern epoch that would make huxley jealousbut its just not that fun to play
i had a blast with dark reign but i cant really describe whats missing here
i think its a lot slower the base takes forever to build and for all the balance of units combat tends to feel lopsided
or maybe im just lousy at this version with all the d since the new terrain shifts the tactics around from the originalworth getting even if youre disappointed with what seems like lousy graphics now remember this game predates nvidia  chipstheres probably a strategy game for every type of gamer and as gaming guide for bellaonline ive seen quite a few
dark reign  is gorgeous and is for the thinking strategistthe game sets the forces of the jda  against the sprawlers
each side has similar units  guardians and  rumblers as ground units trikes tanks medics you name it
the  uniqueness for this game isnt in its basic makeup or the thought behind it   strategy games by their nature share a basic manner of working
what  really makes the game stand out is its design and its graphicsinstead  of the old pixelbased systems where graphics were drawn dot by dot and  therefore looked very fuzzy on high quality monitors newer games are done  with actual objects being drawn
dungeon keeper  is an example of this
with an object having sides and textures and angles it will look crisp no  matter how high you resolve the screen
also objects of this type can  easily be modified to react to game eventsmeaning  you can blow  craters in the ground
you can climb up gorgeously rendered mountains with  slight crevices for you to fit through
your units range themselves along  hilltops to fire down at fortifications
the snow falls as your troops  sneak along a treeline concealing themselves within its brancheswhat  a treat to watch and playthe general layout for the interface is well  done  you probably cant go too wrong with this after all of these years  of strategy games
people have pretty much figured out what works and what  doesnt work
however how many strategy games let you zoom in and out and  around as much as you wish with the observer camera
your map shows the  general location of troops and bases and within that map you have complete  control of your camera  zoom in close to the action from floor level
look high overhead a full assault
follow along behind your troops as if  you were really therewhat general could ask for more  a way to  coordinate large groups of troops easily plus the ability to see the  action from a soldiers point of view
its greatthe sound and  daynight cycles are equally as good
the personality of the troops is well  done  the go go trikes call out quotyeah babyquot when you give  them orders and youre alerted when quotthe sun emerges from its  sleeping placequot the cut scenes help build the atmosphere and get you  involved in the various plots going on
this isnt just about killing off  the enemy
its about preserving your way of life and discovering what has  been hiddeni agree that for the command amp conquerstyle action  lover the excitement simply isnt there
units chug along
units get stuck  on each other
the pace is much slower more like chess than a battle scene  from quotranquoti definitely enjoy this game not only as a great  game in its own right but also a good indicator of what strategy games to  come will look like as machine speeds catch up to the ingenuity and  creativity of modern day game designers
with the bar raised on display  perhaps all styles of strategy game will shortly look this gorgeousif you love vampires this is a great game
i never played the paper version but the gaming system in this game is very good
the advancement system is nice in that you dont have to wait to advance levels to gain  stats and abilities
just get enough experience and you can upgrade  yourself  at any haventhe graphics are pretty good but there is  something about the characters human and nonhuman that doesnt look  quite right
the scenery is excellent thoughi run this game on a p   with m ram and only have slight glitches
dialogue is occasionaly  choppy but gameplay is never interrupted
i love the main character
the  irony of a crusader now being one of the damned is great
character  interaction is intersting but a bit limitedoverall this game is a  nice addition to the rpg market
its not the same thing is pretty  decently put togetherwhen i heard that this game was in devolpment many moons ago i was  apprehensive because i had played vampire the masquerade for a couple years  and loved the detailed and rich world created by white wolf
after buying  the game though the pros really outweigh the cons
first off activision  decided that they would fraction the normal dot system to extend overall  game play by slowing the rate at which a character can grow
through  truthfully they could have applied the experience rules as is but i see  the logic here
veteran players will also notice a lack of disciplines  and some addational costs to usually free ones ie
potence and fortitude
in an effort to prevent abuse of them
i wont bring up the lack of  skills talents and knowledgeive heard too many people whine about  the save feature but i think that we as a roleplaying community have  gotten too dependant on save features
save less not morehopefully  the worst thing about the game will be fixed with some kind of patch that  horrible artifical intelligence
your companions will constantly amaze you  with the way they burn blood like its going out of style
the comp  plays npcs equally bad to the point where sometimes they wont even defend  themselvesthe best feature here is the limitless storyteller mode  potential
in the hands of a capable person this could make for a whole  new world on online gamingsummary lots of hope for this game with  some much needed polishalthough this game can get slow at times with some long winded diologue i found this game to be right up my alley
if you love vampires in general and appreciate some kickin graphics this game is for youi would not consider myself a gamer afficianado however i found the game easy to learn and found the fightingstory line combination to be a wonderful balanceall in all the story line is really great and the cliffhanger ending has left me waiting for the next release
enjoywhen i first started playing this game i realized several things
first the single player is pretty weak
this game was obviously designed as primarily a multiplayer game
single player can be fun but for a rpg the game is pretty linear
i mean you can pick from several predesigned phrases when talking to certain npcs
according to what responses you pick your humanity rating will either be raised or lowered
humanity is basically defined as how human your character still is
in other words if your character has low humanity then you are closer to becoming a monster and if it drops completly to  then you dont have any more control over your character and you have to start from you last save point
naturally only the most sadistic and demented players will actually reach a score of  as you literally have to go and kill civilians over and over to get a score that low
however ive found a way around this
if you use the spell theft of vitae you can get all the blood from humans you want and your humanity score will not be lowered
yet if you feed from a human meaning you bite the person and drain their blood in the traditional vampiric way and actually kill them through doing this your humanity score will go down
the manual is also not very clear on what raising your humanity actually involves
i literally had to play through the game several times before i realized what things i had to say in order to have a higher humanity rating
however at the end of the game if your humanity is very low lets say  out of  the last boss will say something to you and you will have three choices to pick
thus you can get all three endings by having a low humanity score
yet if your humanity score is high i think above  then you only get the good ending and you cant even see the other ones
obviously then theres almost no incentive to keep your humanity high which is one of the most critical and tragic elements of any vampirethe masquerade gamethe multiplayer is where this game really shines
if you are playing with people who are actually serious about playing the game the way it was meant to be played ie
role playing this game is a blast
the storyteller or person that hosts the game has the option to create enemies objects props etc
and so the levels can be customized pretty much any way you want them to be
however unless youre good with programming you will have to use the premade levels although you can fill these levels with whatever you want to
there is an option for more experienced players to create their own levels though you have to have a special programming tool for this which was not released with the game you have to go and download it for yourself
i believe the name for it is the nod sdk but i could be mistaken
in either case its readily available on almost any website related to vampirethe masqueraderedemption although the official web site  is where id go for most of this stuffoverall vampire is a decent single player game and it has the potential to be an excellent multiplayer one
like any game that you play online the amount of fun you have is largely influenced by the people that you play with so its important to make sure you find people that are serious about roleplaying
that is unless you want to join a game where all you do is hackandslash because the majority of games that are created seem to be more like that
still like with any good game it supports people who want eitheror youre not forced to roleplay if you dont want to nor do you have to hackandslashin this game we find a new storyline among the vampire world that is brought to life in this tale
however the saving of the games in progress are horrible and sometimes it doesnt save and a whole section needs to be redone because of it
although that part is a con for the game the pro for the game is that you get to see a character move through history and his way of trying to gain some sort of redemption for himself because of what he isim not terribly sure what drives people gaga over the gameplay in vampire the maquerade redemption
i assume the games popularity has more to do with atmosphere and subject matter than anything
i didnt enjoy the actual play very muchthe box art and cutscenes might mislead unsuspecting players into thinking vampire is an epic rpg or even a firstperson adventure
its neither
while the story conversations and character development are engaging the game itself is an oldstyle isometric hack and slash
which is fine when that particular system is implemented competently
here it only occasionally works
too much of vampires environments consist of narrow hallways and blind corridors where enemies and allies alike jam themselves into environmental wedges run headlong into adversaries and generally act in manners directly against common sense
level design is pretty well detailed and enhances the mood of the game but it is amateurish in terms of interactivity
this would be a minor flaw if again the meat of the game werent the combat itself
yes there are many rpg elements like character leveling and the often fun experiments with trinkets and baubles picked up at the local shops but the fun bits devolve into frustration whenever a member of your crew runs headfirst into a gaggle of bloodsuckers despite your commandsthe story nearly makes the gameplay endurable
i didnt know much about vampires universe and was intrigued by the vampire mafioso storyline
rather than preying on innocent damsels in distress vampires protagonists are a humansympathetic clan at war with other more sinister vampire families
the story unfolds through fairly taut and convincing for a video game dialogue and the occasional cutscene
i was never bored with the story progression and my curiosity about the next winding turn kept me playing for a good while
eventually the infuriatingly clumsy and often poorly balanced gameplay soured the experience for me thoughif youre a huge fan of this games particular universe and simply must know how the story goes then vampire the masquerade redemption may be worth the effort
just be prepared for the headachesstar trek elite force is an excellent star trek adventure
it puts you in the role of a member of the crew whos job is a leader of a sort of swat
team
the game starts out with a simulation aboard a borg ship
the graphics are very nicely done in this sequence and continue to be so throughout the entire game
you then get a chance to walk around voyager on your way to a job duty
it looks and sounds just like the television show
it is awesome
the individual missions are well written and are very exciting
you will get to protect voyager from intruders as well as protecting other team members on away missions
elite force also features multiplayer options like unreal tournament and quake iii
the levels are nicely drawn and they seem to run even faster than the actual game
i am running the game on a celeron  with  megs of ram and a voodoo  with  megs
it is quite choppy at times especially if there are a lot of enemies in the room at the same time
i am not sure if it is my machine to blame or if a patch is needed
despite those flaws this is one of the best star trek games ever
it has been a long time coming
play long and prosperwell this is my second review of this game and its still impressive although a bit too easy
i just got into playing it a week ago after upgrading my computer with the d voodoo card
it only took me that long to beat it
the only thing left to do now is enjoy the holodeck adventures either alone or with someone online
thats always the sad part about a game  when youve beaten it
i know it has to happen sooner or later but this seemed like a very short time compared to other games
oh well
the holodeck adventures are still there thank goodnessstill a must have for all fans alikethis is without question the best star trek game ever made  period  and the firstperson shooter aspect makes it even better
the graphics are very nice to look at it utilizes the quake  engine as are the weapons and dialogue between the characters
this game will probably be a little on the easy side for experienced gamers since it offers few challenging puzzles
at the same time however the pace is quick enough to keep veterans interested and keep inexperienced players on the edge of their seat
very well balanced for everyone concernedthe only downside to this game is the system requirements
you have to have a very sweet computer to run this game
i have a p iii  mhz with  megs of ram and a voodoo  and there were still a few instances when the game action got very sluggish
anyone with an older computer should probably stay away from the game unless you want to set the graphics detail to the lowest setting but even then youll probably run into problems
its too bad really that the game is so demanding since it could have been almost perfect if it werent for the system requirementsall in all if you have a good computer it is definitely a great game to purchase regardless of if youre a star trek fan or nota good qiii based game you are able to use phaser weapons and have the star trek actors talk to you you also are able to save voyager may times over
its a great game and deserves more acclaim than it gotthe seller was amazon
it works fine on my pc running windows xp home spelite force is a first person shooter game
i replayed elite force recently and it was still fun
i also have the expansion pack and elite force things i like about elite force star trek gameplay graphics are good for its time think year  graphics not modern day voice acting is great star trek actors were used story is decent plays like an episode of the tv seriesthings i dont like about elite force sound is too loud during cut scenes doesnt respond to ingame sound options teammates get in the way waiting for teammates to catchup cant skip cut scenes or dialogue too many elevatorsthere are a few overused phrases like they know were here now and how many are there
the final boss fight is really tough
i just wasnt interested in bashing the boss overandover again so i used god mode to finish the game so i could watch the final cut scenesim glad to have elite force in my collection and i look forward to replaying it again the futurevisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsmay trekkkers waited for an action game with startrek characters now thei  prays have been answered the good points are you get to fight borg in  st person you get to fight with seven you get to see voyager and lots  of alien shipps and planets you get to use cool startrek weapons from  activision which also brought us quake  and  soldier of fortune and  battlezone when i first started playing on this game along time ago i thought the missions were a little boring and thats the first and one of very few draw backs i found
heck the graphics are great the sound is good level designs impressive and large but the fun factor i think is just a little boring and tedious and you end up fighting your way through the surprisingly short game to end up with a quite frankly awful and short end sequence
the game is great for trekies but if youre just after a good fps look elsewhere unlessthe multiplayer makes up the lack of single player enjoyment i think
not just for playing online but for playing against the computer or even with the computer in team games
the customisation option is great you can even change the amount your man gets pushed back when shot and the speed you can run and the speed at which ammo is re created
there are in the region of  multiplayer maps and are all worth playingthis fine example of making a game totally repayable is something all fps games should employ it allows infinite gaming joy as you can find your sweet spot skill level and try to beat it in free for all team or capture the flag modesgood multiplayer game not bad single player gamei am exited for this game because it has the quake iii arena ingine under the hood
let me remind you the quake iii engine is a work of art
soo smooth and pretty
the network code isnt like counterstrikes but that is because it is a all out fastpaced and graphic filled wonder
ok soo what about that
the game play will be great in this trek of all treks
the framrates will be smooth and action will be intense
the sound will emerse you with full sourround sound
it will be interesting seeing how they pull off the enviroments
the qa engine hasent been tested like the unreal engine has for large expansive areasi recamend this because i truly believe any star treker with a good system will enjoy playing as a character in their showhaving loved the series voyager i was expecting something different from this game
now that the series is over i can still enjoy it in this simulation gamethe graphics are great and the special sound effects and visuals are stunning
still the people look a little mechanical unreal but the pixar technology is still a few years away to be put in out homes as of yetthe action is believable the training is semi real and the charcaters are interactive
seeing the ship is very cool as well
the younger people seem to like the color and interactivity of itthis is a good game to havei downloaded the demo of this tried it thought eh and went my merry way
however a couple of months later a coworker came in raving to me about it so i said ok ok ill try itgood decision
for  you just cant beat this
ive seen a good deal of trek in my time and im enough of a fan to see the latest movie in the theater but i have spent less time actually watching voyager than i have playing this gameive got the following praise for this game this is better than the few episodes of the show that ive actually seen
this game while not consistently as good as does have moments where it is at the level of halflife and jedi knight in terms of being a stellar example of just what a firstperson shooter can be
if only more fpss had this level of voice acting ai story depth and animation wed all be happier gamers even if were not trekkies
theres some great moments of atmosphere here along with some really choice rounds of topquality blasting to be had and isnt that what its all about
somebody obviously understood this and the game seems to have a great balance between assets and problems youre usually not so flush with firepower that you can lay waste to the landscape at will nor are you so dry that youre constantly hurting for health or  and the enemies coming at you are proportionalfurthermore and heres where youll really hate me i think this game is the game that quake  should have been at a minimum
i mean youve got an actual honesttogod single player game here thats actually good
plus youve got all the multiplay or single vs bots action that q had and more besidesmore game types and weapons with two fire modes
clearly these guys took a look at unreal tournament and said guess what we need to incorporate some of these features
obviously if youre such a fraghead that this is what you play games for you wouldnt buy this instead of q but the point being that q would have been a much better game if theyd gone the route that this game hasno doubt this game looks better than q does
the artwork and level design are topnotch
this is what bit color was born to do rather than just depict tones of grey orange and brown
the weapons fire and hit effects along with the sounds are excellent
you cant help but giggle when you unload your personal photon torpedo launcher and it fires a torpedo that looks and sounds exactly like the ones you see on tv and the movies and this goes for all the weapons in your arsenalwhats not to like
well its short
you can probably nail the game from beginning to end in less than  hours but its a testament to how good it is that you wish it was longer in some senses
i still dont feel like i was cheaped out of my  by any meansas noted by other reviewers the weapons are weak in how theyre balancednot in how they look or sound which is stunning with what actual results they have
there are only two types of  in the singleplayer game and there seems to be a direct relationship between  used and damage done
only the borg require a special to deal with so if any other enemy is coming at you you could choose and use just about any  to blast himit doesnt matter if those  rounds come out of your phaser rifle or out of your torpedo launcher you just have to spend those  somehow and he goes down
you could conceivably get through all of the nonborg areas of the game about  of it by using only your first two weapons
it would have been more fun to have enemies that were more or less resistant to certain weaponsso that you had to choose the right tool for the job making the game a bit more sophisticated
as it is now basically any tool will dononetheless a solid effort and worth the  whether youre a trekkie or not
if youre starving for good fps action this will definitely tide you over until the next real piece of gaming genius comes along whenever that may be
the expansion pack due in early may ill be buying on the day it comes outi have played this game back when it first came out never got to finish it and how with better and faster computer iplain to finish iti may be older now but the fun is still in methis stpersonshooter game has you taking on the role of alexander munro or the lovely alexandra an ensign aboard star treks uss voyager
when voyager was catapulted into a distant corner of the galaxy  far beyond any hope of reinforcements  tuvok the ships executive officer formed the hazard team an elite corps of starfleet commandos capable of facing any threat
armed with a variety of weapons and trained to operate equipment on any alien starship the team stands ready against whatever the delta quadrant can throw at it
unfortunately munro is a bit too impulsive as she proves at the end of the first level and stands to be kicked off the team
instead fate intervenes and the team is forced to take munro along when the ship is snared by an alien ship and brought through an isodimensional rift into a vast graveyard of other alien ships
with voyager too severely damaged and drained of power to escape the hazard team is pressed into duty  boarding other ships in a desperate attempt to learn the secret of the aliens that hijacked their ship and to find the means to escape
the game relies on both alien races both familiar klingon malon hirogen and borg and new
the levels arent too long or complicated and a tight storyline beautifully keeps the game running
between the missions is a mix of cutscenes using the game engine ala jk and interactive scenes in which you prowl the halls and lounges of the voyager and mingle with its crewtheres a lot to love and to be disappointed with in this game which is nevertheless the king of trek games at least until ef debuts later this year
level design is a mixed bag of great and bad  with my clear favorite being the scavenger ship a huge space station composed of salvaged starships like a klingon warbird and an early rd century constitution class starship that level excels because its such a mishmash that you never know what youre going to see next
the game wisely starts its action aboard an etherian starship whose wondrous insides resemble less that of a spacegoing vessel than an acid trip
unfortunately those are the early levels
the game maintains its edge with an infiltration mission on a borg cube only to lose it afterwards when you find you must infiltrate other alien ships manned by either sentry robots or the harvesters and reavers  vicious and robotlike aliens
the game also has a wonderful design engine that gives some of its nonplayer characters a wonderful individuality whether its your team mates or the aliens
however that tool embedded within the icarus engine is barely relied on for the aliens  and most of the aliens youll meet are faceless and uninteresting hordes
the exception being that set aboard the scavenger ship  where we hear klingons complaining about their food hirogen discussing their latest hunts and humans playing an unending game of d chess
gameplay is hampered at all levels by the games simplicity  though lightyears past wolfenstein much of ef has you prowling the hostile corridors of enemy territory pretty much blasting whoever you meet and finding the exit
again the scavenger level is best because its a stealth mission requiring extra precision even so you spend so much time hiding that you cant afford more than quick glimpses of the scenery
the designers probably felt like they could only make a game that was either a fragfest or a thinking mans rpg and that wed be grateful whenever it was both for even a secondthis is actually my second review of this game though i had to do a followup after having played jedi knight  which is also based on the qiii arena engine
though older than jk elite force ef holds up pretty well
its not as long as jk you can easily finish the game in a week after playing a level a night nor as difficult the enemies arent quite as overwhelming as in jk and the game relies on far less counterintuitive puzzles than that game
on the minus side its not as challenging and the simplistic game play gets annoying really quick instead of puzzles you have to locate control panels which your pda will id on any alien ship and throw their switches
there are two genuine bosslevels in the whole game and maybe twice as many true fragfests
echoing the differences between the trek and sw universes ef probably sees itself more as a thinkingmans shooter but wont make you think too hard
though you wont need to be any kind of trekkie to get through or even enjoy the game fans will appreciate how the qiii engine renders their shipi played this on my p ghz xp machine without any hickups
i havent tried multiplayer yet but managed to get by without downloading the mb patch which i eventually installed for the heck of it  the only difference ive noticed is that seven is actually voiced by jeri ryan
ef isnt as finicky about your choice of accelerator cards accepting my s savage card
in short a great trek game and one not to be missed before elite force i cant take star trek
i used to love it but i try to watch it now andno
cant do it
i liked the original series and next generation was pretty good for a while but after roddenberry died everything fell apart
deep space nine is just a badly disguised clone of babylon   voyager was boring uninspired repetitive and flatter than a piece of paper
it shouldve been cancelled years ago
enterprise
please
even the upn executives couldnt keep that thing goingso why am i here giving a star trek game a good review
simple because its everything the shows and movies stopped being a long time agoits exciting
its thrilling
its challenging
it makes you think
the people in it are actual people not a bunch of cardboard cutouts in black pajamas and weird makeup trying to advance the useless plot
and above all you never once hear anyone say anything remotely like modify the subspace harmonic phase variance yada yada yada  if i never hear that weak plot device crap again itll be too soon
not only that it has things and concepts in it that not only make you think yeah they should have something like that itll also make you say why didnt they ever have that
the idea behind the game is this
since voyager grris on the far side of the galaxy far away from any backup janeway and tuvok develop a new kind of away team
this new unit called the hazard team is made up of special forces crewmen assembled to take on challenging missions that regulars cant handle like a swat team compared to regular police
the teams just been created when voyager rr gets sucked into a mysterious region of space and immobilized
you play as ensign alex or alexandriahow pc munro the hazard teams secondincommand
and during the game youll have runins with mysterious aliens hostile scavengers the borg and a new race created only for this gameraven software did a great job on this game
the environments are bigger than what youd expect from the tv shows the aliens are more imaginative the weapons are much more impressive and realistic and the combat is gripping in some parts especially when youre facing a stampede of borg
your teammates all have their own personalities and functions and the patter between them is actually worth listening to
theyre even funny when they tell jokes
who knewunfortunately the game does fizzle in a few places
it uses the same sound as wallpaper approach to background music so there isnt a single nanosecond that isnt drenched in bland new age elevator muzak
some of the weapons dont have convincing sounds like the tetryon gatling gun youd think it was shooting soap bubbles
not only that but youre limited to only two types of ammunition for eight different weapons so if you run out of one of those two half your arsenals kaput
and worst of all at some points you have to listen to the boring regular voyager cast members while they spout off about unimportant crap
that ones easy enough to fix though if you do what i do turn the sound off and wait it outi know i should end this review with something inspiring like how in the right hands even a lump of coal can shine like a diamond but ive got nothingbut it is a lot more fun and entertaining than star treks been for at least fifteen years and that aint bad eitherstar trek armada is   a very good gamewhat do you get when you have  millions of trekkies or trekkers wanting to play star trek on a broad level but dont want to be restricted to one race
you get the latest game to hit the compters star trek armada
now you can control multiple starships ranging from federation klingon romulan and our favorite the borgfollowing some of the same guidlines found in blizzards starcraft you must play  chapters in the struggle with a fight to fend off the borg
you mine dilitium moons and build starbases in space to amass huge armadas of ships to do battle with
each chapter focuses on a specific race that you must control and successfully complete each mission
it does make for some fun game play and insight into a story created for this gamethe graphics are very nice and you do get a sense of what it is to control ships and manage space stations in space
although alot of the screen is taken up by menu boxes that can be removed the ability to zoom out my have you scrolling like crazy to manage your space battles
as for the cutscences they are not anything to write home about but they are nicethe gameplay is a little awakward to get used to
you are limited on what you can build depending on your mission and even then it is time consuming to build up a sizeable force
this would have been taken care of if you were able to manipulate your ships more instead of moving near another ship and firing
i really wish they would have allowed you to allow your ships to make evasive manuevers rather than just sit next to enemy and exchange fire until one is dead
the ability to have more control over a few ships would not make it necessary to amass huge armies of ships to attack the enemy terriortory
being able to target specific systems on ships with firepower would be nice too
are you listening activision
i hope so
at least enemy ships do the the brains to retreat when they become heavily damaged
but even so the ai is not too smartoverall this game is very nice and enjoyable to play
i especially loved playing the borg who wouldnt
as for bugs others encounted in the game i found none and you can download patches to add additional ships to build if you desire
the replay value is very minimal unless you focus on the multiplayer side
activision has taken a good step in making this game
they have many of the basic conceptions right on the money
all they need to do now is add more functions and polish the game up a bit
i will definetly purchase any sequels to this game that might come out in the future
so activision plot us a course and quotengagequotin the past year star trek games have gone from worst to almost first
armada is a warcraft type game in which you have to build up your resorces to mount an attack on the enemy
while games like age of empire do this better armada isnt bad
it has good graphics and the game play is easy to understand
it seems a little buggy but it hasnt crashed on me once
activision has good support so a new patch is never hard to get
again this is one of the better trek efforts and it should please all trek fans and non fans alikemy cousin loves playing this game and cant stop
like really he cant
its addicting
so he saysbeing a star trek fan i had high hopes for the game
the preview trailer was exciting and the demo was fun to play
once i got the game i played it for four hours straight
i just couldnt stopi was hooked
untilthe game suddenly juststopped
quotwhat the
quotoverall this could have been the best star trek game ive ever played
you get to be the good guys and the bad guys
building ships starbases taking over ships and unique weapons made it exciting
the bugs were the only problem
the game needs a patch to make it stop crashing or else people would have to play the game saving it every  minutesgraphics were great but could have been better in my opinion
i wished they had used the same graphics as they did in the trailer in between the campaigns
one small detail i was disappointed in was the ending though
it kind of left me with the thought quotthats itquot after all that hard work
i was hoping for an ending movie like the beginningi hope i didnt spoil anything for people who havent bought the game
would i recommend it
definitely
im not going to sit here and say that this is the best game in existence or compare it to games like starcraft and command amp conquer but i will state that this game is a whole lot of fun
star trek fans will love it just as i did
my advice is to save your games every  minutesjust in casethe first thing id like to say about armada is that it is definitely not just for trekkies
i wouldnt remotely qualify as one and i still loved it
anyone who appreciates a good rts should already have thismore than being good strategy armada is also an excellent graphical experience
the ships fight with cinematic intensity with realistic damage and attractive projectile action
you can even go to a movie mode where you can view a melee from a floating d perspective although at the expense of controlon the strategy side there is only one resource dilithium
you harvest it from dilithium moons that can be finite or infinite
its a pretty straightforward resource model and things are automated enough that you wont have to micromanage it
a welcome balance tweak is the starbase armament which makes a rush basically impossible
bad news for all the battlenet fools that like to send zerglings or zealots you know who you are
each race has an superweapon of immense power but in every case they are prohibitively expensive and slow to build
if you see one anywhere in the first  minutes of the game someone is probably hacking
however once someone gets one they have a pretty major advantage against anyone thats technologically deficient
you can also make good of the potentially powerful though also very physically weak science vessels each race offers
theyre expensive and slow but can be the deciding factor in a major battle
all of this serves to make advancing your tech a very feasible strategy over a simple build more warships wear them down methodthe single play campaign is excellent
it has a neat plot and youll see a lot of unique starships that you wont see elsewhere such as the two cardassian types dominion vessels and a breen battleship
none of the levels are especially hard but they can take some thinking
i especially liked one where you have to pilot uss avenger to safety with a klingon fleet hot on your tailmultiplay is probably the weakest aspect of the game
its choppy even on a direct connection and hunting down every last one of your enemies can be utterly tedious
playing online also makes the game notoriously crash prone and if you have eight people in one game it is both extremely slow and crashy
the computer plays a lot like the dark reign ai building up until it has a huge force and then trying to swamp you
if you survive that one big assault the computer is plenty ready to die
rather than improving the ai to be a bit smarter the difficulty settings give it a handicap a very huge one on hardest
they build things faster and everything costs less so they can send a bigger attack at you earlier in the gamenow i know enough about trek to realize that some of the ships arent accurately specified
the defiant especially is incredibly weak for something that could take and dish out so much damage in deep space nine
nevertheless the actual sides are very well balanced and the models are so well done that the specifications are a minor point
each side has its strengths and weaknesses
for example all romulan ships can cloak but the romulans are at a severe penalty when being boarded or trying to board ships of other races
there were a few balance problems with special weapons such as the chain reaction pulsar but they have been fixed in updates
the patch also in my case at least makes the game far more stable
be sure you download itall right so the game has a few weaknesses but other than that it is a huge load of fun
for strategy fans or trekkies this is a mustbuyclock tower is an interesting horror strategy game that requires you to complete many tasks in order to figure out the bad guy who is after you
its a really good game because you have to really use your head to avoid being caught
while the graphics and music arent anything incredibly memorable the gameplay makes up for it
i wouldnt say its anywhere as good as the resident evil series but what you have here is an above average game that you will be coming back to for surethis is a very awesome game
lol i am fifteen but i got this game when i was about eight when i first started playing these horror games and boy was i scared
being a re freak and a horror game freak this game is the mother of allwell basically you run from a killer with a giant pair of scissors which is scary thinking about it
eek
gives me the creeps lol anyway the game is really scary especially since scissorman can jump out at any time and attack you
you either run away or hide somewhere to stop yourself from a horrible death
you try to figure out who this guy or what this thing is but now i know what it is basically i thought at first it was professor barton and boy was i rightyet like every good game all games have their pros and cons but the good news this game only has two conspros  the game is very freaky do what i did wait until ngith close all windows in your room your door turn off the lights and crank up the tv stereo
the music itself that plays when scissorman is near will make you jump out of your ksin literallylol the game plot is very nicely done it has very cool and unique characters and the scissorman is a very freaky character the environments are great i love this freaking game
cons  sometimes when scissorman jumps out you sometimes dont really have any hiding places and have to run through ten million doors to find one having to use a cursor instead of walking with the d pad my cursor on the game sometimes screwed up and the character wouldnt run and she kept goign all over the place i foudn out you have to click it a certain way but dont worry its easy i was being stupid and not noticing it lolwell there ya go only two cons and a handful fo pros
this a very great game and it started the horror game franchise
if you find this game somewhere definitely buy it
trust me it will scare anyone and i mean anyone no matter how brave you areheeheh di love survival horror games and welli wouldnt say that clock tower is like resident evil or whatever elsebecause its just original in its own waythis game is something questaction horror gameclose to reality the character doesnt run around the house with a big bunch of shotgunsrocket launchers but just acts as any of you would act hide from the follower or use what comes to your mind to stop himthe follower in this game is a bad guycreaturenot gonna spoil that for you with a giant pair of scissorsa must try for a horror fanthe only bad thing in it id say the long conversations between parts of the game which you cant skip and they really bore me when i play it again and againthere are  main characters sometimes being replaced by another char multiple endingsall  of that depends on your actions and your walkthroughso it makes more fun scare to play it over and over againthe saving system is also good for that you can save anytime and anywheretrying out different things and watching the resultsdespite the graphics come on this game didnt come out yesterday clock tower is pretty challenging and innovative in the horror games departmentim  and still have my nes and snes sega x n ps ps etc etcto the pointi used to rent this game as a kid and play with my little brother alot i have emulators but that is fakethis arrived very fast i was suprised works perfect
i got one of the cheaper used ones in acceptable condition but the label is basically perfect except near the top a tiny spot of scotch tape had to be used to make it just right but they had it on there already and tested and cleaned it popped it in and worked first tryfor  and a few bucks shipping wow so worth it the memories
cant wait for my lil bro to come down and play with me
this game is kinda like zelda the look of it it has puzzes you slide and throw shxtgreatness
great deal thank you sellerok this game is really fun but confusing
you choose between max or goofy or  players
its an rpg and is not that fun if you think its action an all its just and rpg and all
you find items and use them againts people
thats it
this game is about pirate peter has come to an island and you have to defeat him
its kinda fun if you like adventurehavent played the game to beat it yet
everything works though and came in on time
i have no complaintsthis legendary title belongs in any sega fighting game collectors library i own it as well as super street fighter ii and wouldnt part with either of them
must have the  button pad to enjoy this game but thats common knowledge to any genesis fighting game fan
i remember back when this version first came out how excited i was that the boss characters were playable and this title was when i made the switch from playing as ken nearly always to playing as sagat the tiger uppercut really nails the oponet for a ton of health
i thought this version really stood out from the snes sfs prior to super just for the fact of the added playable characters
i always beleived that genesis held the upper had in the fighting game genre just as the same as snes always held the rpg genre in hand
i reccomend this game to any genesis fighting fan even if you already own ssf i thought the sounds were a lot more crisp in this version than super for genesis even tho i do love them both
a must have for the collector no genesis fighting game library is complete without this version want to make it even awesomer
pick up the genesis  button arcade joystick its sure to pleasedamn good but with just a little too much thickness to go down rightresident evil  is a console game
its move to pc isquestionable
but while it may not be the next generation of gaming goodness it allows all the pc owners of the world a chance to immerse themselves in one of the greatest console games of all timere  is the second and perhaps most epic of the re games
leon kennedy and claire redfield are likeable and active charactors who with time andwellmore time will grow on you
the cast of secondary charactors and monsters are both creepy and delightful
best of all the weapons are good enough to make duke nukem drool a little
pack this into a survival horror package where one must carefully husband ammo and always be prepared and you have a game with a perfect mix of tension and actionbut it is not a computer game
to make that tension thick the designers chose to create save points and sometimes painful camera angles
it is too easy to run through the game if you can save just before every door
instead youll fling the controller across the room because you got jumped by a zombie dog and hashed to shreds leaving you farther back in the game
it just makes keeping alive a little more important as a note though the print cartriges required to save seem scarce they are really almost too commonothers may come to hate the limited space one has to carry items
any good first person shooter allows a much larger range of munitions and keys to hold at once
in re  you get about  slots
that means if you carry the beloved pistol for zombie shooting its ammo and the life saving shotgun for anything else with its ammo you have  slots to carry any health keys or backup weaponry you want or find
trust me its really scary to bring a knife to a gun fight or a pistol to a rocket fight
much of the puzzle system runs along these lines
some require you to place  or more pieces into a key hole
but you cant just find them and take them there you have to carry other things
this means you will have to find them place them in the item box  a magical multilocational box that will hold everything you own and be reached in many places then go find the others before finally gathering them all and opening the puzzle
sound tedious
strangley the game manages to keep you plenty busy in between so it never really becomes too much of a problemas for the bad camera angles they had to stay in the game
to build in a moving camera would have destroyed the game
i tell you now there is something creepy about hearing the patter of zombie feet know they are out there and just not know where they are
if not for the useable venerable autoaim function i too would have screamed every time i ran headlong into the arms of a zombie
as it isthe unseen giant spider is my personal baneso in conclusion at  dollars you are buying a game beloved by play station and dreamcat owners the world across
but it will drive the hardcore pc player insane
but even if this hypothetical pc owner can somehow make his way past the glareing downfalls of this game he will enter the world of resident evil a land where the dead walk and bullets are scarcethis is a great game
the puzzles are really cool though a few are a little but unlikely and obscure but still
this may sound a little strange but i think what really helps make the game is the soundtrack
the music for this game is perfect
its so haunting and mysterious
you just know that there are great mysteries to be unveiled alright that sounded really cheesy
seriously though this is awesome
its also cool how the game can have a lot of different outcomes depending on what you accomplish and how you do ita great adventure game especially for those interested in the titanic disastera couple of years back i remember playing a demo for this game
i told myself one day i will get the game and i didpros the graphic are nice it funny you get to run a hospital serveral level to play easy to play and you get to deal with all types of patient with weird health problemcons the game freezes when playing the last scenario might just be my game a problem with patient sometimes getting stuck can get boring after awhile but i go back to play it on and off
overall i really enjoyed this game and wish that they made a theme hospital  or an expansionmax payne was billed as being one of quotthose games that will change gamingquot with this type of hype i was eagar to buy this game
however after playing it through and trying a mod or two i must say that this will not change gaming
its an ok game
id still take halflife over this gameill list the games pros and consprosits graphics are undeniably niceits new features bullet time and the diving shooting are very coolnice mods bound to show upconsno multiplayer
this was one of the games major problemsonly a few save slotsbad plotmost of the maps are just averageno replay value
i uninstalled it its a space consuming game almost immediatly after beating itoverall nothing industry bending but a few  hours worth of moderate fun
waiting until this games price comes down is my recommendationthere are points about this game that i both liked and dislikedliked really nice graphics duel weapons useage bullet time the creepyaction music scoredisliked long load times having to turn left and right with the mouse 
 some of the hoakeysounding narations with the fmv sequencesi ran the demo on a piii  with  ram and a gf
for the most part the graphics and audio were stable with only one momentary skipi own another pc with piii   ram and an ati rage mobility  i have yet to play the demo on this system but all of my other graphicsintesnive games have played better on this machine than the otherif you are going to buy this game i would hope you have a system with a semidecent video card and lots of ram
mb at leasthaving heard about payne since my early navy days i went out to fred meyers electronic department last tuesday and bought it
over two long nights and part of thursday afternoon i beat it
sucked in from the moment i saw the box art i refused to escape this game
with few exceptions four years of development show in max payneproduced by d realms max payne is a thirdperson shoot through a noirchoked new york city
finnish developer remedy follows the standard set by valve to immerse the game in an actual plot bloody and surreal
we begin with our hero at the end of a vengeful rampage and his reflections are the game
one fine american day detective payne comes home in time to hear drugcrazed loonies shoot his wife and child
he hunts each intruder down but too late
payne joins his buddy alex in the dea
the killers had flown high on valkyr a new designer drug and after three hard years the pair finally discovers the prime dealersa debased and savage crime syndicate
but the break bursts bigger than anyone could imagine hitmen ambush max and alex during a subway meeting
max survives but somebody out there is determined powerful and sadistic max is quickly framed for killing his own friend
as a terrible blizzard sets over new york cold rage sets on max
his enemies think he is trapped and helplessthey only free his trigger fingeras the player i turn paynes predicament into an opportunity for revenge
but not all is grit and gloom
payne parodies itself along the way relieving its own pain through the medicine of laughter
much of the story unfolds in a wonderfully dark and sour graphic novel
frozen in pictures made to resemble watercolor panels actors pose comically goofy expressions across their faces
voice acting accompanies the novel scenes with such delicious ham i wanted to eat it
as the voice of pain himself james mccaffrey deadpans morbid metaphor after sanguine simile after killer comeback
after criticizing the insanity of a mob boss payne broods but who was i to talkan underdog avenger alone against an empire of evil out to right a grave injustice in the action itself the player will stumble across nods to pulp fiction die hard lethal weapon batman the punisher and the killer
foes scream hysterically as they die
and wisely borrowing from no one lives forever remedy peppers the game with the conversations of its guards like why are vampire movies always set in la
they cant get a suntanall of this humor works against the very unfunny circumstance of posttraumatic stress syndrome
one must actually play through paynes nightmares and hallucinations the experience is as frightening as any horror movie
but filling the hole of a dead wife and child is a revengesodden plot with the contrast between humor and horror keeping the atmosphere balancedplay is balanced as much as plot
every time the game is booted up the player has the option of customizing performance textures decals sounds and frames
the software is also apparently able to recognize when the player cuts through the opposition like deaths scythe and when the opposition crumples the playerscythe like tinfoil
the stamina and aim of everybody is accordingly adjusted
payne provides no armor but introduces a sam peckinpahstyle slow motion to give the player a stunt edge
named after a special effect in the matrix this bullet time allows max to shoot and dodge in slow motion but aim in real time
speaking of bullets payne bristles with contemporary crime movie weapons including ingram ms beretta s and sawedoff shotguns straight out of the untouchables
no bazookas bfgs or similar and unnecessary antitank weapons exist
each level is exotic moody and yet realistic a multilevel parking garage has fluorescent lights and whitewashed walls straight out of navy boot campugh
paynes puzzles and mazes are simple subtle and justified with snowstorms and mob wars keeping things in perspectivea proper perspective recognizes quirks as well as qualities
despite four years to perfect it a few noticeable flaws prevent max payne from receiving my fivestar approval
max can crouch but he cannot creepinstead he automatically stands up and jogs
this makes things easier on the level designer but harder on max when he steps around a doorframe and gets shot in the face
max also doesnt climb anything other than stairs which again benefits the designer more than max
while payne is obviously meant to be a lonewolf it would have added to the suspensionofbelief if the levels were populated with friendly new york bums bartenders and bus drivers hiding from the snow
finally some of the levels felt a lot like those in ravens soldier of fortune but given the location i think the similarities are unavoidablestrangest of all to me is the contentline remedy seems to have drawn for itself
no child should play max payne as it is but the game is not nearly as explicit as many classics
the bloody chum found in quake halflife and soldier of fortune puts payne to shame
swearing limits mostly to blasphemies as payne avoids words even network television slips in
while max investigates houses we see just one prostitute and one gambler
duke nukem d has more pornography foul language and gore in the first two levels of the shareware version than all of payne
the only illegal drug mentioned or seen is the fictional valkyrbut i can easily understand if content is traded for style or performance or both
remedys max payne provides active and balanced story and gameplay
its faithful filmnoir atmosphere makes the player imagine more grit than is actually shown
only its neglect of a few basics prevent a full rating
now if youll excuse me i do believe its bullettime
groanmax payne is an addictive game that has action bordering on insanity
i must admit when i busted out the bullettime and took down  guys in a matter of seconds it was the most fun i had had in quite a long time in terms of computer games that is
this ultrastylish game begins with a gruesome murder and then snowballs into a one man versus all killing rampage
slowmotion deaths bullettime multitudes of weapons gigantic explosions and just about everything else is thrown into the mix
i have a few problems with this game first of all the stupid just plain embarassing dialogue
quoti dont know about angels but its fear that gives men wingsquot is typical of the tripe that max spews
this all might be a huge joke or just the game designers trying to stay within the conventions of filmnoir with the constant voiceover but i didnt find it funny
the other problem is the wasted characters and simplistic plot
a revenge plot is a simplistic plot to be sure and i was embroiled throughout most of the gameplay its just when its all done the plot should have been a little more fleshed out
the other thing that made me mad spoiler ahead was the complete waste of a female character
she shows up about midway through and i thought she could be a nice counterpoint to max
instead you never see her again until she is murdered near the end
i was more than a little peeved
anyway it is definitely better than the crop of mediocrity currently occupying the online landscape
it is short but it is a game that has quite a lot of replay value due its numerous cool setpieces
all in all a worthwhile buy and one that will satisfy despite its flawsoh yes i remember this game very well
this is one of the most superb computer games that i have ever played
along with its dark and gritty look the game also has bullet time which is very useful at times
the story is surprisingly good even though i dont care much about stories while playing video games i was really hooked with this one
most of the characters are pretty much cliched but i dont care
i just love the gameplay it feels like im in a cinematic crime thriller whenever i fight against the enemies or use the bullet time
granted some of the music  the writing in the game is corny but max payne is still an overall good game
a very unique game indeedgrade disclaimer if you saw the movie and you havent played the game you have been wrongfully informed of the max payne world
the movie was absolutely terrible and did not do the game one bit of justice
yeah there was slow motion drugs shotguns and guys in swat gear but thats pretty much it  and as much as i love mila kunis she and the rest of the cast sorry markymark were terrible representations of what is maxs world
the game series especially  is one of the greatest i have ever played filled with extremely dark comedy that make you laugh out loud amazing action suspenseful storylines and all out badasseryi bought this game because the second installment of the series is and will always be my favorite video game of all time
i wanted to take a look at the games roots and see how the previous one matched up
the biggest changes between the two are an improved scriptdarker and more comedic storyline in  and some better voice acting
other than that the gameplay is the same most of the same weapons are used and the same amazing styles of combat are used
seriously the max payne bullet time feature is one of the coolest features i have had the pleasure of using in video games
there is nothing like the rush of the perfectly executed awesome movielike shootwhilediving type encounter and max payne has the patent on iti would definitely recommend this game to people who enjoy the noire genre and an action game with a good storyline
i would however recommend the sequel more highly just because it is one of the greatest things to ever be created by a video game company
the max payne series is amazing you should definitely give it a trymax payne is the best thirdperson game ever
the pc version is the best version that is for sure quite frankly id take a keyboard over a controller anyday
max payne is a really really long game why people said the game was short is beyond me
graphically it is pretty average the character models are terribly ugly and the faces just look cut  pasted on the characters
also the one thing i always find amusing about rockstar games is that no matter who develops the games for rockstars you can pull any weapon out of your pockets no matter what size that makes me laughthis game is almost like watching a full blown movie
i loved the way they told the story almost like a comic book which is really cool
bullettime is also a nice feature for a video game that was really original and almost every game has tried to copy it sincei really liked the character mona sax was my favorite even though she wasnt used as much as she would be in max payne  her character really did stand out in max payneoverall max payne is a true hitthis game is definetely todays leader in graphics and system requirements and the developers finally put a decent story in an intense action game but its gameplay is same old third person variant of the fps only it is with one powerful addition bullet time or slow motion which adds more to it
gamers may trigger it whenever they feel like it and it has its one sense of style and adds eye candy to already jawdropping graphics as well as it gives you advantage over your foes which are just plain nasty to deal with because extremely beefy might shoot through their allies to kill max very alert
max can also shootdodge that is leap sideways in slomo and shoot while keeping himself less likely to get hit by enemy bullets in addition that he can just dodge bullets by jumping sideways
yes it took very long to finish this game and it is quite short but in fact most people me too get so addicted to games like max payne that theyll beat it in record time and start whining about its length right after they beat the last level
when it comes to multiplayer to enlighten people who are guessing why remedy did not include it consider the quotslomoquot because this is what this game is all about
if there was multiplayer then imagine how youd play with other human opponents if one goes into slow motion then all of them would resulting horrible experience when some would go into slow motion without triggering it
that means that it could only be limited to  human players at once
when it comes to performance the only necessary requirements for this game to run at optimum are  mb ram and a  mb video card i would recommend nvidias geforce cards
the games textures take up lots of memory especially when running at bit texture color depth and at high level of texture quality and sharpness
 ghz cpu will be more than enough for this gamemax payne is a third person game with a fantastic single player gameplay but no multiplayer gameplay
it has an average plot ground breaking graphics and lots of comic book type animated cutsences
it supports two video modes directd hardware tl and directd software tl
set in new york city max payne is a cop who goes undercover to seek revenge against the gangsters who killed his wife and daughter his cover is blown and is framed for murder with cops and gangsters after him
the game ends with a great climax action which will do any hollywood movie proud
whats unrealistic is max is a cop fighting against drugs but he uses pain killers to cure his injuries
i played on the directd hardware tl and the game runs very smooth
the graphics are fantastic the charecters and world look real though not many different colours
the world detail is superb you could turn on the tv shoot it and watch it explode
the sound recording is very good and loud
the music which plays during the action sences is superb
load times are very good the quick saving and quick loading are very quickmax paynes level design is superb they are very well done in one level you need to chase a gangster jumping from the cities roof top to roof top and finally jumping on a moving train
mp is a short game but the length is just right
the selection of weapons are very good but some of them are very dissapointing grenades and molktov cocktail for example it is quite hard to through grendes
colt commando is my favorite
max paynes gameplay is pre halflife but still the action gameplay is superb and very thrilling
the problems in the game are it is shipped without a multiplayer and initially it has only one difficulty other three difficulties can be unlocked only if you finish the first they are both very bad decisions
it has got loads of annoying cutsences cutsence of the sniper bullet charging to the target is cool but others are very annoying and take the controls from the player
it is also quite hard as max cant take much damage
third person perspective is always a bad choice for action games like this but its third person view is quite good but it does not support the turn left and turn right key for the keyboard you could turn only with the mouse
max payne is not a ground breaking title in gameplay but it is a very good pre halflife kind of game with better graphics and bullet time
if you like pre halflife games not many puzzles shoot everything that moves bad ai then you will really love max paynethis was good way back whensometimes a guy just wants to kick back and shoot the holy heck out of everyone
max payne lets you do that and lets you do it with a modicum of style
there is something almost ballerina like that i found very immerssivesic as i got deeper into the gameyou can find max lounging laconically in the bargain bin of most computergaming stores thusly the purchase price will be around  or  bucks
a good deal if you want to kill  to  hours depending on your rdps expertise
if you are one of those players that was born with a keyboard in your mouth and a mouse stuck where the sun doesnt shine you will whiz through your mpe max payne experience in less than  hours tops
and that is one of the games shortcomings its on the short side
get it
shortcomings  short
heh heh heh i kill myself sometimesone last thing that bothered me a tad and it is the expression on maxs face
he is quite obviously terribly constipated
poor guy
you would think that with all that running around new york city he could pop into a drug store to find some otc reliefthis game is great everything about it is refined to perfection making it the best game about picking up guns and shooting people
i cant believe some people are saying that the ps controls are better that these controls
you aim with the mouse not the arrow keys sheesh
some may say the gameplay is not varied enough but for some reason it keeps pushing you to get to the end
the only problem i have with the game is the ai the baddies are sometimes horribly stupid
they will shoot each other throw grenades into walls and shoot at walls
maybe it is to make the game more like a action movie but i wanted to see the mercenaries you fight later in the game have some real attack strategiesmy advice to you go get the pc version rather than the ps version it has better graphics more responsive controls you can save anywhere you want and you can take advantage of the vibrant mod communityi really liked this game
it had great graphics the best i have ever seen
the bullettime feature is without a doubt the coolest thing ever in this game
slowing down to slow motion seeing the bullets a scene right out of the matrix but youre controlling it very very cool
the storyline was interesting but was cheesy and too indepth at times
in order to get the full effect you have to really be paying attention and have a great memory
i didnt buy the game to get into a deep story line the game needs one true but they could have simplified it a little bit i thought the comic style way of telling was interesting but i didnt care for and lost patience
like many other reviewers have said the first  hours of this game were totally awesome a brand new game great effects matrix time
but then you start to get the feeling of deja vu
the game becomes way to repetitive
enter room clear room collect guns ammo health repeat repeat repeat repeat
get what i mean
i also thought this game was way too short
it only took me a weekend to beat
i feel like this game is a really great start and was worth the money that i paid for it but it leaves much room for improvement
if you havent purchased and played deus ex i recommend you do that instead of buying this gamepayne is a magnicent game to start with  everyone else here has described the realism the graphics portray and the attention to detail like bullets splintering the walls smashed cash registers spewing notes etc
these are very nicely done although most games of maxs ilk feature such eye candymy main point here is that max payne is a great experience for the first say ten stages and then monotony sets in
big time
by the time id reached the industrial estate level with the cranes and forklifts i was thoroughly sick of the kick open door shoot guys in room then repeat gameplaysure max looks better than gordon freeman but at least halflife introduced different scenarios and situations from time to timetwo more quibbles
the matrix style bullet time effect is nighon useless
fair enough your enemies slow down
but so do you so you cant exactly do anything that you couldnt have done in normal time
lastly the dream sequences are awful
annoyingly awful
drab mazes straight out of lara crofts garden
about as stimulating as snake on your nokiaalthough it sounds like im slamming max im not
the finer points have been listed already so i thought that the weaker qualities should be addressedthere is a kind of deserved irony in mimicking a genre as silly and shallow as the graphic novel
the more authentic the caricatured pulp fiction hero is to the original formulas the narrower the constraints of the story
and while no one denies that max payne is an outsider who plays by his own rules and isnt tied down by the man he still walks a pretty narrow pathwhich is not to say max payne is a bad game
it does introduce a certain charm with a number of new innovations such as bullettime and the nightmare sequences
trouble is about halfway through the adventure a serious feeling of dejawoo sets in with the beenthere killedthat repetitionit would have helped the emotional impact of the storyboards had not the manakin from those bizarre pseudos maleenhancement commercials been chosen to play the hero
not bob dole that other guy
his constipated facial expressions rarely match the deadly serious dialogue and turn parts of the story from tragedy to farce
but the schticky dialogue is largely intentional and although often overcooked usually works well to advance the storygraphically the game is a stunner
it looks like a million bucks even on my average pc
the levels of object detail are or were unprecedented for shooters
architectural design is often stunning locations are both realistic and fantastically creative mafia hideouts are appropriately sleazy and opulent a bizarre gothpagan nightclub thumps techno beats that become as chilling as any resident evil backgound noises
object interactivity is high with lots of openable cabinets hiding powerup goodies flushable toilets and vending machines that drop snacks and popwhich runs into my next major criticism of max payne control
oh sure its easy and trouble free but when you build a control scheme as simple as maxs how can you make mistakes
not only is there no analog stick support there is also no walk function
max moves through his environment like rain man on an explosive easter egg hunt
and this highlights what i believe to be a major problem within the game devlopment hierarchies the stratification and exclusionary attitude between different departments of game design
its obvious that those who fleshed out the environments to the degree of a zelda game were not on the same page with the slouches who built max paynes movement engine
and clearly there was little coordination concerning pacing and difficulty
max payne requires playing the easy level on the first goround its far too easy for any experienced gamer
the result is a game best played carelessly and quickly
with liberal use of the quicksave feature max payne is a breeze that can literally be run through in a few hours
much like a filling chinese meal it may leave you hungry again in a few hoursits doom
doom
its hard to believe but its possible that a lot of  people are too young to have played this when it came out all of seven  years ago
basically you run around a series of techno  medieval levels  shooting things
its very simple and good fun  indeed its a lot more  fun than the technologicallysuperior followup quake
if youve ever  wanted to mow down a room full of zombies with a burst of chaingun fire  this is the game for you
its a modern classic and just as much fun as it  ever was  as with wolfenstein you can only really play it in  fifteenminute bursts before getting bored but the small size and speed of  the game on modern machines means that you can use it as a desktop toy a  diversion whilst doing something else
and as a piece of history its  unsurpassed network game and allthis package contains the original  doom and two extra sections both of which are very hard indeed
the game  has been updated for windows  and can run at a slightly higher  resolution to the original
note that theres a superior doom collection  out there which compiles final doom doom  and a thousandodd extra  levelsin addition its worth finding the gldoom patch which enables  dacceleration and higher resolutions
this transforms the game  you can  see all the way into the distanceas for demon d monster maze  for the zx beats it by three yearsalthough the levels are nicely done and its nice to have a title called final doom being added to your doom collection the game is really just a level expansion pack with nothing new going on
tnt evilution has some new music but the bosses in both plutonia experiment and evilution are nothing to get excited about
these are addons that i imagine doom fans will salivate over but final doom doesnt bring anything new to the tablestill its cool  the idea on the game is very cool  command a planetary empire and not as though it were a bunch of spreadsheets with a lousy gui ahemmaster of orion the game has three major screens planetside  in which you build structures manage power allocation and fight in tank combat
 interstellar  in which you manage your vast fleets
 space combat  which can take place between ships or in orbit around one of your or your opponents planetsas much as it can be called realistic the space combat is just that
attackers must overcome space fleets and planetarybased defenses before landing their attack ships onplanetthe difficult part of this game is the economy  resources are gathered slowly buildings are built slowly and there is a maddening amount of time spent awaiting for these vital generators to do what you need them to do
resource allocation is different than in the cc series  it is quite frequent to run out of money energy or both and you can do very little when either of these tickers hits zeroin short a fully entertaining and immersive game just very very difficultimperium galactica ii alliances is definitely a very good strategy game yet it has several silly flaws for no apparent reason thus taking away from what it could overall offerthere is a good though not great variety of civilizations to choose from from the peace loving cheblon to the mighty warlike krahen and many others in between
humans of course could not be absent as they exist in the form of the solariansthe feeling of building up your empire and expanding into the far reaches of the galaxy is very real and you do get a strong sense of accomplishment for all your effort
the battles the inventions the upgrades and the plot are very gooda lot of work seems to have been put into the gameon the negative side there are several points which could have been dealt with before the game was released and many of them have already been coveredpointed out by other reviewersthere is an easy normal and difficult level of play but normal is next to impossible and that is a pretty big problemmoreover when you do decide to play single as opposed to multiplayer you only get a choice of three racesin addition the actual alliances are very difficult to come by when you actually need them while at the same time extremely easy whenever youre winningfurthermore the videos and the graphics are average not poor but not great eitherfinally there are such things as the futuristic electronic music for example that is constantly playing in the background which is rather terrible and highly annoying to say the least
a more star warslike sounding music would have been much appropriate and inspirationaldont get me wrong there are plenty of hours of gaming enjoyment ahead when playing imperium galactica ii alliances
despite its flaws and though it may not be a masterpiece it will provide for a decent amount of amusement as well as excitementthis game is a lot of fun but quite challenging
the graphics are ok  theres plenty of tension and so excitement during the game
there are three difficulty levels
easy is too easy
hard is too hard
but normal is just right after at least  games if you play the krahen klingons until you are pretty good
then you can try the solarians humans
the krahen are much easier
the shinari dont seem to work right
initially keep your taxes low for rapid population growth
in fact when your planet has less than  people use no tax
from  to  use low tax
 and above use moderate tax
the reason is your population growth depends strongly on tax but not at all on population size
therefore  you wouldnt get much tax from small population planets anyway so make them grow fast
use high tax and no autobuild on all planets when you have half the galaxy or so conquered
also use high tax if needed to satisfy a short term demand of the god emperor
keep the god emperor happy at all costs
do these things and you will have a lot of fun on moderate difficulty and even win sometimesthe goodinterplays really made a beautiful game here
giants is based on a completely new engine and takes advantage of newer graphics cards tampl engines to great effect
the course of the singleplayer game is played on a seried of islands some tropical some ice etc
in the single player game you play first as meccs humanlike characters with machine weapons then as delphi a magicswordbow amp arrow using nymph and finally as kabuto a brutish monstereach character you play has a completely different method of gameplay for you to use
its fantastic because it makes the game highly variable
once id just about gotten the meccs weapons amp strategies down the storyline progressed to delphi and i had to learn to use spells and such
not only that but there are resourcecollecting strategy elements involved
one has to collect little guys named smarties and foodsouls to feed them with so they can build a base for you to provide you with more powerful spells or weaponsyour enemies ai while simple isnt so easy as to make it boring
theyll sometimes hide behind trees and structures to fire at you
all in all a great gamethe not as goodthere needs to be an ingame save instead of a perscenario save
some of the missions are just too long to have to repeat
in basebuilding missions it will restart you with the buildings youve already built but even so its a chore to repeat things over amp over again
having an ingame save should be rule  in the game developers handbookin addition the ai can be pretty dumb at times either standing there while i shoot at it or running straight away as i slug its back with roundslastly the game as released in the box needs to be patched badly
the patch is available online from interplay but the game should have at least worked out of the boxclearly this game was released before it was properly tested so that it could make it for the holiday
the game is loaded with bugs
thats not bad though because this game is funthe system requirements are unusually high and even on a powerful system it is very difficult to run it smoothly
still a great gameits hard to believe giants is a decade on now
for those of you who missed it giants was part of the boom in hitech pc games that came about with the introduction of the geforce video card series and the departure of dfx from the graphics market a boom that would also give us black and white boo and max payne yay
for about  years after this game directx would make quantum leaps forward and pc gaming ruled the roost until the affordability and power of seventhgeneration consoles became the new standardas befits the frontrunner of a new generation giants is a tremendously flashy colorful game
it features big open levels with tons of longrange combat and exploration and in the midgame base building
in essence it is a cartoony singleplayer tribes lathered over with tons of shinies and british wit
it even featured some pretty daring use of early lighting shaders that other games wouldnt use so extensively for a few years more in particular kabutos skin boasts a gnarled d lookin the modern age of crysis and skyrim and battlefield  giants isnt so spectacular as it once was but it still boasts clever writing fun combat and endearing characters
well worth your time as a trip to when the current era of pc gaming beganproscute story fun characters
and yes there is an ini tweak to take the blue sorceress ladys top off like in the uk version
dont let your mum catch youdated but still charming graphicsinoffensive soundfun gunplay while it lastsconswhen you actually get to play as the giant its sort of boringonce phenomenal graphics now look rather dated think about like an xbox  gameterrible balance in multiplayer which is probably long dead anywaypretty shortok i hated this game hate hate hated it  brieflywhen i first started it up i loved it it was fun funny had tongue in cheek jokes all over the placebut then it became really really hard tedious you cannot save in the middle of a level so you have to play the damned level again and again and againwhats more it is buggy and crashes  even with the patch it is still a bit buggy jan   so you start the level againwhat i did not realise is that this is not a shoot em like unreal tournament or quake  for example when you are a mech you send your team in to do the fighting for youwhen i learnt that from the strategy guide i realised how much more fun it washowever it does tend to get tediousoverall a fresh new concept with lots of promise but the developers are not experienced enough to have made something stable with ongoing excitementtry it out it is fun
but dont complain if you get boredwhat captures right away the eye are the wonderful landscapes colors grass sea the sun that moves through the horizon with all its spectacular effectsnow what happens in the game you begin out as a mecc a tecnologic warrior that has to help out some strange alien little wierdos called smarties in their combat for existence against the evil sea reaper raceas the game goes on you will control from one to five meccs then control a beautiful reaper woman who allies with the meccs and in the end you will become the allmighty kabutobut i wont tell you who that guy is even if its easy to figure it outthe game is divided in chapters  for each kind of character you are going to control mecc reaper kabuto and the missions are interesting and fortunately not too easybest part of it the fly sensation
the meccs have a jetpack and the reaper has an incredible quotturboquot power that actually make them fly or jump granting you an exceptional almost real quotspeed and flyquot sensationbad part of it no in mission saves if you die you start the whole mission over again bugs sometimes the whole game blinks out of existence and you end up staring at the desktop after losing an hour and a half on a missionand as i said you couldnt save
so ok lets do it all over againoverall great ideas wonderful grafics very original plot and characters original game structurebut it could have been realized betterthis game kicks butt
albeit with all graphics options at their lowest i can get decent framerates with my nvidia vanta lt mb the game still rocks
its a great game with a whole lotta humor mixed into the cutscenes
also you can explore virtually any part of the island as long as you can reach it with your jetpack flying ability or kabutos ability to climb charge up most surfaces and jump from them to other nearby islands
and man does it rule to play as delphi goodbye lara croft this is one hot video game character and she can do magic
of course i dont play this game for that really i dontfirst  my review system was a p  megs of sdram and a riva tnt card
well well well
this game certainly is a conundrum
i wanted to love it and indeed contained inside this ambitious design are some jawdropping moments sidesplitting humor and genuine fun the likes of which ive not experienced since classics like halflife
unfortunately along for the ride are some game destroying crash bugs and glitches
well thats life but it leaves you wondering what this game could have beenid read many glittering reviews of this games graphics
quotthe bump mapping is spectacularquot theyd say and when i saw the drendered menu i was indeed impressed
however when the first mission loaded up i was disappointed to see that the character models were somewhat primitive the view range was limited and there was no bump mapping to be seen
of course my system is to blame for this my old tnt being based on five generation old technology just isnt cutting it anymore
the bump mapping effects in particular seem to be reserved for geforce cards
however i still consider my system to be a decent gaming platform and im sure not everybody out there has a p with geforce ultra and  mb rdram so i felt i needed to mention it
interestingly other older games run faster and look better on my computer than giants does
could be driver optimizations for the geforce who knows
suffice to say youre looking at  mhz and a geforce to really enjoy this gamewellll onto the gameplay
this is where giants really shines
when playing as either the meccs reapers or kabuto the game offers three very different play styles all of which are equally fun
the games narrative is tied together by genuinely hilarious inengine cutscenes featuring some of the best writing and voice acting ive ever seen in a game
the funniest cutscenes feature the meccs and the native smarties that populate the island
both the meccs and the smarties are for some reason british lending a monty pythonish feel to the gameexample not verbatim the meccs after blowing up a prison go to look for their friend timmy a smartie
they find a injured smartie there who says timmy was his singing partner
smartie  yes we sung many a song before they took himthose were the days
borjoyzeetimmys grandfather  now listen you tell me where theyve taken him or youll be feeling the end of my stick
smartie oh yes was that another song
there were so many borjoyzee hits him viciously with his stick on his exposed brain while the meccs winceanyways i suppose you had to be there but rest assured the entire first third of the game is hilarious
however when you get to delphi the sea reapers missions the humor takes a turn for the worse as if the writers had run out of ideas
and by the time kabuto rolls around the cutscenes stop almost entirely except for the intro to his missions and the final cutsceneand even getting to kabuto or the reapers is near impossible with the game in its current state
with no inmission save and some missions lasting more than an hour the game would be hard to begin withbut not only that there are vicious crash bugs that kick you out of the game entirely
this happened to me five times on one particularly hard mecc mission and i was almost ready to uninstall it in disgust when i finally beat the missionthere are also some other aspects that suggest the game was sent out unfinished such as a delphi mission where you are supposed to steal a reaperski but can build one at your base
and the varying quality of graphics and objectives between missions
its really a shame this could have been one of the best games ever with a little more time
shame interplay shame
let the developers do their jobsthis game is a great experience and with a little spit and polish could be one of the all time greats
if youve got the patience and horsepower to see it through youre in for a wild ridelets get one thing straight this game is hard
but it is also a great deal of fun
there are three playable characters each of whom has their own special abilities and characteristics
the play control is very solid and the graphics are absolutely astounding
add in a killer sound track and you have one heck of a game
the only thing that keeps ths game from a star rating is its devilishly hard difficulty level
there are several moments when you have to make precision jumps land nearimpossible shots and survive without any powerups or health items
luckily there are check points spread liberally throughout each level that allow you to save your progress
with a good price this game is a steal that should find its place in every adventurelovers libraryi remember playing this game with my younger brother at the arcades during the s and having a blast
this is one of those games where there isnt much strategy and you just basically shoot away and try to obliterate anything moving on screenthe playstation version is reasonably close to the arcade graphicswise and offers the same twitch gameplay
the only downside to this game is that it is pretty short
the fun doesnt last very long
and of course you must use a lightgun to mimic the arcade experiencethis playstation classic uses the basics of strategic combat from such masterpieces as the shining force series and adds new levels of realism such as elevation concealment and facingprobably the worst thing about vandal hearts is that it is absolutely and perfectly linear
unlike shining force in vandal hearts you cannot replay any of the battles
you cannot egress at critical moments
there are no secret items or characters save for the unimpressive hidden herbs and mushrooms you might accidentally find behind trees and under rocks
vandal hearts is an exercise in pure unadulterated tactics unspoiled by almost any semblance of roleplaying
there are few types of weapons and approximately two dozen of different sorts of items
where this game succeeds is the selection of character classes and the number of possible strategiesjust like in shining force here you can promote your characters to better classes although in vandal hearts you can do it twice once at level  and a second time at level  just like in shining force some of your characters can have a choice of classes to which they can be promotedso where does this all come together
just like in the mass battles in suikoden the classes follow a cyclical hierarchy sword beats arrow beats air beats sword
this rockpaperscissors element hadnt entered the strategy scene prior to vandal hearts
naturally there are also other more popular conventions of precedence opposing elements and the precedence of spells over physical defense will play a major role in the players thinkinglastly the graphics must be spoken of
unfortunately there isnt much to say on the various zoom levels the battlefield ranges from quothard to seequot to quotpixilatedquot
the characters are hard to tell apart especially when they stand in a group
the spell effects are functional at best
in other words nothing a persistent gamer cant handlevandal hearts is a natural transition point from the early consoles to the playstation and beyond
it is a good beginners game as well as an entertaining if temporary diversion for a master gameraround christmas  i was told about this game from a dude in a japanese animation store in new york
he said quotif you really liked tactics youll like vandal hearts
however if you really loved tactics you might not like it as muchquot  well i got it and beat it and i think what he said was on the moneythis game actually has superior gameplay to final fantasy tactics in terms of realism size difficulty and strategy requirements
true you did lack the freedom and the job system in final fantasy tactics was far superior but here strategy is required for more than survival and victory sometimes you need to do something to the terrain itself
i loved thathowever the graphics department was far less than impressive
the graphics were both ugly and used horribly
the first game to get the fully d strategy deal right was myth the fallen lords for the pc where it just like this game has d terrain with sprites
however on that game when you moved around the sprites they kept the swords on the same hand
thats right
while the camera spins around on this game the character will go from being righthanded to lefthanded
i wouldnt complain this much if its graphics worked like final fantasy tactics but this game plays like it has wonderful graphics while the graphics are really just mediocrethe sound department is okay however
the music while far from great wasnt too bad
the compositions were several notches behind that of final fantasy tactics which quite possibly has the most powerful soundtrack ever and so is the sound quality
however the music still gets you into the mood right and it wont put you to sleep
the sound effects are also pretty good and sound rather realthe story and character development are obviously prefftactics
the characters are well developed and likable but not as meaningful or emotional
also the plot is really good but its much shorter and wont play around with your emotions like final fantasy tactics that game was brutal with your emotions
it has some original concepts and some things i still havent seen elsewhere since
while i would give this game a star rating since i didnt like the story as much i do have to consider that this game predates tactics by like  years and as such my opinion of this game is risen drasticallyall in all vandal hearts is a very solid game thats clever and fun
it may be very weak in showing off technology the makers clearly had a lot in mind and that makes this game worth the money any daypublished before final fantasy tactics i didnt even know this tactics game existed until last month
an epic story interesting combat and enough content for one replay hidden items on the maps
the story doesnt suffer from random encounters the boards are challenging often with twists unique to any tactics game and the characters are diversewhile short it is high quality
i dropped a star for length it could easily have had a few bonus boards but otherwise this is one of the better tactics games ive played
the blood gusher from a defeated enemy earns the mature rating and is sometimes very satisfying
while i wouldnt pay more than  for it length is  hours tops i do recommend itas the title says this game is basically an arcade game
you shoot terminators defend comrades and engage in various missions
this game is great on multiplayer but a little stale on singleplayer
its still fun but it feels slightly boring
the shooting mechanics work nicely and are never any trouble
but your gun must recharge if you want it to shoot properly
the graphics look pretty good for a game thats about  years old
everything works fine nothing is broken
the flaws with the game are the annoying gun recharging sequence and the missions can be frustrating due to the fact your gun runs out of energy after shooting many enemies
but if you like the terminator this game is definitely a lot of funyou are the t cyborg and your mission is to first defend humans in a futuristic war then go back in time face off against the t liquid metal unit and save john conner
this is not your average shooter game you must use the super scope  the gun for snes
the graphics are phenominal for the game and they come straight out of the arcade and the challenge is intense too having to save humans as well as in some levels you must shoot cyborgs off of john conners truck without destroying the truck and fun levels where you just plane blow holes in the head of the t
great game normal players will not get too far thoughthis is one of the older games that are still around but unlike the other oldies this one now has directx d acceleration
it also has lucas arts premium sound effects  so if youve never played a star wars game this is as good a place to start as anyyou get a manual a quick reference guide and  cdroms containing a total of  titles xwing tie fighter and xwing vs tie fighter flight school a demo of an improved titlethis was the first games i ever bought and was hoping for a  good space flyingshooting sim thats fun and not too difficult
i got half of what i wantedit looks good and the tutorials are fun and simple but like most of these type games most of us can only finish the first  levels before being inundated with unenjoyably heavy fleets and relentless laser firei dont think there have been any other games that come close to the depth and richness of these games for simulating the star wars flight experience that we saw in the movies
action games like rogue squadron and starfighter are fun but theyre watereddown set pieces that run on rails when compared to this series
xwing was great and tie fighter blew away everyones expectations for what a space dogfighting game could bethis collection isnt perfect  the resolution maxes out at x the d support is rudimentary its a pain to get it working with windows xp or newer systems and the cd music isnt as charming as the original dynamic midi soundtrack
also missing from xwing is the option to assign wingmen to fly with you  a minor omission but a shame it wasnt includeddoes it hold up today
not so well  but these have been rereleased so many times that were probably not going to get an update of this old design ever again so this is the best way to play the old dogfighting games if you have any interest
the price is certainly rightthe interface takes some getting used to but once you get the camera controls down and really its no different than learning what all the buttons do on an fps game it really is quite enjoyable
it makes you  think tactically and strategically which i like
theres no rushing for  the end to gain a quick victory you have to plan your way and learn to use  your units strengthslike i said in my title a good game but still not as good as i hoped
first of all to make the game perfectly smooth you have to have a brand spankin new computer
i have a  mhz pentium   mb of ram and an excellent video card
if your comp is anything less i recommend upgrading your computer befor purchasing this game
the game play is good though
the mission and skermishis are fun but the game is very limmiting
its imposible to have as many units on the front intro all at the same time
and the fighters can act stupid sometimes
and something weird is on  the back of the box it shows awings yet there are no awings in this game
the camera buttons are also very hard to learn so playing the tutorial is a must if you dont know them by heart
the graphics and sounds on this game are remarkable
i mean even the smallest stormtrooper or the largest atat is detailed to the bone
i think this game is supposed to be a recovery for the not so great game star wars rebellion
i also have a review about star wars rebellion next time i hope they make a game more like rebellion but much better
with rebellion a good idea back fired
this game also doesnt hold your intrest very long at least it didnt for me
final verdict risk  is a very good game
it is just like the board game with some very good addons
first there is same time risk
here you dont wait turn but you all get reinforcements at the same time and attack at the same time
you use diffrent type of dice here to
the more men you have the better  dice so it eliminates the problem of have  guys to out   as there are  tourdoments wicth in compairson to a command and conquer is like a compain
also in difference to the board game you can now chose your teritories  diffren
first you can have the computer do it randomly
second you can  choose in a turn based way
and third you can have an election which is  like an auction
this game is well worth you money and is fun for  everyone
higly recommendthis is a marvelous game
the part of the game that shines is definitely the sametime mode
it is much harder but more fun and strategic that the orginial
the computer ai are excellent there are  ai opponents each with different traits and their own skill level of playalso the game is very customizable and includes special mission based objectives
furthermore you dont have to win by taking every piece of territory if you dont want to
you can win by taking over  of the world or if you want a quickie  of the worldin short get this game
its worth itrisk  is definitely worth the bargain price
the many different gameplay options allow for different challenges for one or more players
some old high school buddies and i decided we would try getting together once a month to keep in touch play a game and chat
this game allows for intense gameplay while quality time with family or friends
the tournament is extremely challenging because it forces you to play the game in the different modes which does not allow you to develop a consistent strategy
this is a plus because games that allow you to form and follow a set strategy get boring and monotanous after a short time
the quotsame timequot strategy takes a little while to get used to but definitely is an addition that benefits the game
it allows for multiple attacks both from two or more of your countries but also from several of your countries and countries of other players
if you and a fellow player attack the computer at the same location for instance once the computer has been defeated you and your buddy quotgo at itquot
you also have to watch out for quotsurge attacksquot where an opponent can attack you one place and then immediately go into the next country while youre not even aware of it
if youre into a challenge or want a game which allows for some competition and quality time with family and friends get risk whoever thought putting pacman through pure hell could be fun
this game is very wierd and yet still fun despite its odd design choices
you dont control pacman but with couple of the buttons you can direct him where to go which shows a hand pointing in a certain direction
you also control a slingshot for some reason as well
the main plot is that ms pacman wants pacman to go and search for certain items like a milk bottle or a flower
so you go out and do that
but you will be amazed at how much fun you will get out of shooting pacman in the face and enraging him because of it
some particular sequences in the game like driving a mining cart and flying in a hang glider are a lot of fun
you dont actually control these things other than making pacman go higher in the hang glider by shooting it or shooting pacman to avoid hitting something in the mining car
you can get pacman to do other things as well
hell ride a skateboard and you can choose whether you want to avoid rocks on the sidewalk or not
if not you can watch him get crushed into a tree
shoot a cat and the cat will attack pacman
shoot a guy at a hotdog stand and piss him off then when pacman goes over to get a hotdog he gets squirted with ketchup shoot a cow and the cow will slap him with its tail shoot a farmer and the farmer will be knocked out shoot the bail of hay over the farmer and it will land on the farmer help move a couch and do so many other things that are very entertaining
the biggest flaw is that you cant control pacman and it can get a bit boring with the missions but overall its a fun game
if you like randomly making characters lives hell in games then this is your gamethis was one of my favorite games as a kid
i thought it was fun but i know it cant compare to the original pacman
however if you miss the original pacman theres a level where you can play it
theres an arcade and you can play as much as youd like
i used to spend hours doing that lol
any who some missions are a bit difficult but not impossible
i was able to pass this game several times as a kid
its just not for everyonepacman is a really awesome arcade game
its so addicting
you just eat dots while roaming around in a maze while avoiding ghosts
and then you could use a special dot in which the ghosts become edible
this my friends was timeless action the namco loves going back to over and over again
not in  though in which they release pacman  look at that cover arti dont think this is maze game
i have a theory as to why this interactive cartoon has the pacman  name
there was a pacman cartoon show in the s
i can only assume this is a sequel to that
since a new pacman show is being made and set for next year why not review namcos attempt at doing something like that in a video gamepacman  the new adventures has you help pacman on his journey
thats right
youre a part of his ventures
anyway the game is composed of various objectives pacman has to accomplish
he roams around all kinds of places such as a farm a warehouse a mountain and much more
the trick here is that the player has to be pretty observant and aware of whats going on around the scenerythe player uses a slingshot to shoot at stuff to get pacman to notice them you can also convince pacman to look in a certain direction
its like a shooting gallery crossed with an adventure game
however since this is classified as an interactive cartoon there were definitely some bizarre reactions to what you shoot
for example if you shoot a guy at a hot dog stand he squirts ketchup onto pacman in anger
sometimes the slingshot could be used to help pacman find ways to progress ex a rope for him to climb or shooting away a rock on a hill so pacman doesnt trip over it
or you can even shoot pacman himself when hes about to meet his fate so he could jump away or you could just shoot him to anger himthe slingshot could also be used for slinging power pellets in case of any ghosts lurking around
however heres one major flaw with that  the only place i recall where you get power pellets is pacmans house
and you only get to use  before running out
if pacman needs a power pellet and ghosts are scaring him this will go on for a long time before the ghosts finally fly awaywhat really influences the game other than the slingshot is pacmans mood
this is interestingly an important part of the game because how he acts toward some things rely on his behavior
some instances require him to be angry or happy and some cause him to change his mood to such thingsthe formula overall is very very unique and makes the game really interesting
namco did a great job with the making of this game
unfortunately there are two problems the lack of places to get power pellets and the lack of an actual save feature
yeahyou have to use passwords so you better write em downbut other than those problems the game is greatas for the game being an interactive cartoon it really nails that
the game has a great sense of humor ex in the park pacman trips on rock and slips on a skateboard causing that skateboard to fly up in the air and land straight onto his head  theres also a billboard in the city that shows an anime person holding a hamburger
pacman smiles as a laughable reaction to the billboard
many things you shoot with the slingshot can cause a gutbusteractually it seems like if you dont want to play through the main game you could just have pacman wander off and create your own little cartoon venture
go ahead
have pacman brawl with a cat that stole his hot dog
have a farmers haystack fall flat onto him
do whateverif youre not interested in the actual game pacman  still has some value for you
if you go to the citys arcade youll find a fully playable pacman arcade cabinet  ms pacman
or if you want to avoid the game altogether and go straight into the original pacman or ms pacman you can enter these passwordspacman pcmndpwms
pacman mspcmndpacman is that timeless classic we all know and love
eat the dots avoid ghosts you knowall good stuff
considering pacman s price right now for a used copy you could just buy this game right now just for the classic pacman alonefortunately for you arcade pac lovers out there theres also ms pacman in the mix
however considering ms pacman was eventually rereleased for the snes with bunches of new features that made the game a bigger blast than the arcade original it takes some of the fun out of this port which doesnt have any of those features
you just simply play as is
ms pacman is still a fun game on here but id rather recommend getting the standalone snes version which makes one of the greatest games of all time that much betterall in all pacman  is a shouldhave
if youre a cartoon fanatic you should pick this up right away
if you are looking for an unexpected challenge the game certainly has that
if you are a pacman fan and wish for arcadestyle action pacman  still offers the arcade classic and ms pacman to satisfy your needs
theres something for everyone hereafter playing metroid super metroid metroid prime fusion and zero i realized that the only one i had not playedbeaten yet was the gameboy version of metroid metroid   so i went on one of my legendary hunts for this and low and behold i found it
a few hours later i had beaten it and left me with some interesting thoughtsthe story here is that samus arron has defeated mother brain and her space pirates on planet zebes her next assignment is the exterminate the metroids
so it is from here that the game begins
you must eliminate  or so metroids scattered throughout the caverns of the planet but the metroids are not like the ones from before as these particular breed have mutated to a more evolved statethis game is interesting in that it is still classic metroid fun but with a few complaints
the first one is that the game is real short
the nesxt is when it comes to gathering powerups those too happen fast
within a fifteen minute time span all in one to two areas i went from the ice beam to the wave to spazer to plasma beam
that was in a fifteen minute slot
the final is that outside of the final boss there are no other major bosses
unlike the first in which you had to face ridley and kraid first in order to proceed this one just throws at you one of the four evolved forms of the metroids to deal withi am not saying that this is a bad game but if you have become hooked to say fusion or zero than this game is a step down for you and if you only played prime well avoid all together
however if you are a die hard collector or are interested in the full story than this game is a must have in the legacy
just be warned its short and sweet but with a hard edge difficultythe game is a classic must play
it was the first gameboy game i think
i know it was the one packed with the gameboythe seller was good as well
it got here on time
and the quality of the product was much better than what i was expectingi give donkey kong land a rating of  out of ive decided to update my review four years later because my original review was not only extremely negative and not only wrong but also a bit disrespectful as well
i apologize for thatyes i was hating on donkey kong land pretty hard and heavy during my original review and i even reached a boiling point where i said id never touch the game againmy reason for that immature episode of anger was simply because i preferred the donkey kong country series and donkey kong land felt like a cheap imitation in comparison
however playing through dkl again i realize the error of my ways
i was completely wrong to dismiss this game originallyfirst of all the levels in donkey kong land are not a direct ripoff of the ones in dkcsure the temple water and factory themes make an appearance but its not fair for me to say they are direct ripoffs of the levels in donkey kong country when the levels were actually designed completely differentlyby different i mean the levels are not trying to be like the ones in the dkc series at all instead the game makers took advantage of the popular themes in donkey kong country and used those same themes to create something else entirely with completely different objectives and whatnotin other words the gameplay involving collecting bananas stomping on enemies heads and everything else is exactly the same as in the donkey kong country series the levels themselves are not the same as the ones in the dkc seriesim actually really surprised that the water stages for example are significantly more fun here than they are in the dkc series
theyre also much harder too
actually the water stages feel twice as long in comparison to the ones in dkc which is rather odd considering the dkc series appeared on the super nes the console where ideas were normally utilized to their full potential
it seems like the water stages were more thought out in this gamethe stage where a squid is chasing you through a deep underwater maze is definitely really creepy because he never stops chasing you but more importantly these water stages are really exciting and challenging
im really surprised how significantly more fun and challenging the water and temple stages are in comparison to the ones in the dkc serieson the flipside however the jungle stages are definitely worse than the ones in dkc
this is because theyre usually quite short and not much attention to stage design was given compared to other stages in the gamethe boss fights are really simple because the strategy required to defeat them is usually something extremely basic and easy to figure out but thats a minor flaw
that doesnt mean the final boss fight is a cakewalk though he really tests your ability to move quickly during his final phasemany of the enemies from the dkc series return in addition to plenty of new ones
bees rats snakes and crocodiles are back
other types of enemies such as floating crabs spiky fish flying pigs tornadoes hey they mine as well be enemies and snakes on ropes yes thats right
are new and exciting additions
rambi and expresso are back but winky and enguarde are not
perhaps that explains why the water stages are longerone big flaw however is probably due to a game boy limitation
remember in donkey kong country whenever you run and jump you actually go pretty farwell in donkey kong land whenever you run and jump for some reason donkey kong and diddys animation slows down drastically so you almost hang in mid air which means you never actually leap in the air very far which means you basically have to stand right next to the edge of a cliff in order to make it across to the next platform
it seems while youre holding a barrel you jump a bit further though
weird
either way after a while youll learn to adjust to it just fine so it wont present much of a problemoh and donkey kong doesnt slap the ground anymore
thats slightly disappointing because i used to like slapping bananas out of the dirtthe reason the game is challenging is because enemies are placed in spots that sneak up on you pretty quickly
in other words enemies will probably be walking where you least expect
also the game is stingy with up balloons for some reason
theres a distinct lack of bananas compared to dkc which means getting  of them for extra lives definitely doesnt happen as frequently compared to dkcsome of the levels are really strange
the mine cart levels are gone and in their place are levels involving these platforms that you ride
these are quite possibly the hardest stages in the game especially this one you will encounter later on where you have to jump in the air in order to make the platforms move in the direction you desire
youll see what i mean here when you play the gamethe graphics are really good
seriously
considering this is a game boy game the only flaw is actually one that makes me feel like im nagging when i mention it the graphics are in black and white
thats basically the only difference compared to the donkey kong country version
oh and the music is actually a lot more melodic and creative too
i love just about every single theme song
most game boy games have boring music not this onein the end the number one reason this game is so good is because each and every level is positively loaded with fun things to do
one moment youre collecting bananas and coins the next youre either jumping through barrels riding up and down ropes swinging around jumping up and down on tires riding platforms to faraway places tossing barrels or defeating all kinds of beautifully animated enemies
the fun seriously never ends
this game rulesoverall a pretty solid game that i definitely didnt appreciate when it was first released
nowadays i can play donkey kong land and say its just really fun and not a ripoff of donkey kong countrymany people confuse this for being a port of donkey kong country whereas it is a different game altogether
it has its own unique levels designs etcthe music is one of the greatest achievements of this game with some dkc tunes making an bit appearance and plenty of new ones that youll find yourself humming when youre not playing the game
the level designs are certainly challenging and will take skill to make it throughmy two problems with this game lie in its controls and its presentation
the controls while decent overall require a good deal of precision and will be frustrating at times
second the ending is nonexistent which i found disappointing
however the game was still a worthwhile buy and i recommend it to anybody looking for some good ol rare studios quality gamingthis game wasnt all that bad
the graphics were poor to the point that i couldnt see any secret areas
the controls were very good
the concept was great and the game minus the graphics itself was great but the graphics messed it up
i hope rare remakes this game for the advance for it could be a major hiti remember the first time playing this game ever
i was at my friend alberts house and he had gb games like mortal kombat mega man and kirbys dream land  i didnt really care for mortal kombat but mega man and kirby were cool kirby probably being the coolest of them allyou go through levels floating and copying abilities
but you generally arent alone
i believe you get a companion in every board to accompany you
theres the bird the hamster and the fish you ride on the first two and the fish holds you in his mouth
lol
how epic is that
anyway the game is pretty fun but like someone else said its extremely short and can be beaten in one sitting if you have  hours or so to kill
it has some replayability because its fun but i dont think there are any secrets to uncover once you beat the game
or maybe i didnt know about them
hehegood game though starsall three dkc games had their own game boy counterparts in the donkey kong land series and while they were being on the game boy inferior to the snes version they are still worthy additions to the donkey kong seriesgraphics the transaction to game boy works well actually
while the lack of color is not that great the sprites even though watered down still have that vibe to them that works well on the game boy
although ig youre playing on an emulator dont use full scream it looks awfulmusic pretty much its bit versions of dkcs tracksgameplay the plot is the same and so is the gameplay as the snes version but with a few differences
like dkc its a platformer where you collect bonus tokens to enter the lost world as well as dk tokens to beat mario and yoshi as a video game hero
this time though the lost world is not divided into sections so you have to get all of the tokens before entering the lost worldthe worlds and the levels are the same as dkcs although krem quay and crocodile cauldren are fused into one world and castle crush is renamed to dungeon danger and haunted hall is renamed to krazy karts
but the levels themselves while having the same premise are differently mapped making the game different than dkc
some other different things are the fact that lives are displayed as hearts you can only use one kong at a time so no tagteam  and you cannot ride the animals only transform into themthe game also has the same bosses kudgel is taken out but they fight differently as well
they also nerfed down k rool which kind of makes me madbuy if you can find it yes
otherwise get it on an emulatorthis was the first mega man game i ever got
the difficulty was hard but not nearly as impossible as some other reviewer mentioned
the shots do tend to be slower than on its nes counterpart but its amazing how well its transferred to the game boys small screen
very fun and very challenging with an excellent ending as well
heartily recommended to mega man fansthis is basically the nes version of megaman repackaged for game boy
its decent for a handheld version but the nes version is better in my opinion
this game doesnt have much of a story and the small screen makes gameplay a little harder than on the nes megaman seriesfor all the arcadestyle fighting games in its day this game was fair in storyline and quality
the artworkgraphics are nice but this game just didnt have the kick that mortal kombat did
its still a decent fighting game and is good for a couple of hours of entertainmentkiller instinct is a fighter that showed up during the huge flare up of fighting games
it is similar to mortal kombat in a few ways but executed differently in others
both games revolve around special moves and combos
killer instinct focuses on the combos more then anything with an announcer who will announced your combo based on how long it lasts
ie  hits is a super combo and  is an ultra combo
the game has a learning curve that all fighters demand but with practice and patience you can get the hang of itits a fun arcade racer that i will not deny
however as someone who has grown accustomed to d racers this game could be hard to play at timesthis is a very good game a little tricky but still a good game
it is nothing like super mario kart and i think that is goodthis is the first fzero game made and it is very fun
the graphics r pretty good but there are not very many colors
they use white and grey allot but the cars r just plain colors like red blue yellow and orange
the sound is awsome and the music is catchy
i love racing games and this one is awsome
the bad thing about this game is the controls r hard and u fly off the track too eaisly
i like the newer ones better because of the graphics but i have to remember that this is the first one and its for the snes
good racing gameyou are just the mario characters in a wild world of the most awesome gokart tracks in the universeyou can get all sorts of power ups that can be used as weopons or traps on the other playersit never gets oldso play on and on and on and i suck at this game but i still enjoy playing it
its always fun to play even better with a friendthis game is a really fun mario racing game
its a really entertaining game that you can play on your own or with a couple of friendsi have really enjoyed this game i think its one of the classics for snes and i would recommend this for everyonei cant remember the first time i played this game
gee it was so long ago
i do remember staying up one new years eve cant remember what year with friends and playing this along with super mario world while the grownups were downstairs drinking and celebrating
this game might be a bit clunky compared to mariokart  but the snes version is still a solid game on its own and was a good precursor to the  versionthis game is not much different from the  version plotwise but of course the controls and graphics are limited
but hey i cant really complain
overall this game was welldesigned and did very good within the limitations of the snes system
two thumbs upthis game started the kart series and many of its features are still staples in the mario kart games made today
the game can be played one or two players and includes single races gps and a battle mode
even during racing modes items can be picked up and used to boost your kart or attack your enemiesits unbelievable to me how many perfect or nearperfect scores super metroid has received from game players all across the internet
to this day gamers still have the time of their lives running blasting and spin attacking their way through each and every area of the planet to reach the final stage and face the evil mother brainnow ill be the first to admit that this game had me totally floored back in  which led to me spending an entire summer playing the game much to my mothers displeasure but im afraid over time ive began to notice a few small problems that make it very hard for me to give the game a perfect grade
keep in mind i think super metroid is still after all these years one of the best adventureshooters ever made but i cant give in to childhood memories and whip out a star rating
sorry
one problem is the challenge
this game is incredibly easy
i cant believe so many people find it difficult to progress through the game
come on those nasty space pirates you fight in the beginning part of the game only require one hit to defeat
its funny how something so nastylooking can be defeated so easilyand the easiness doesnt stop there throughout the game you encounter simple enemy after simple enemy
its a shame because one of the most important things about the metroid series should be the challenge and when you take that away youre left with a game that feels like its intended for  year olds
i just wish it was like the original metroid in that each enemy you walk up to requires a good four or five shots to completely destroy
shooting and killing them with only one shot is ridiculous especially when you consider that the weapon youre using to defeat them is just your regular blaster and not some kind of special upgrade
it also drives me crazy how every enemy you defeat seems to conveniently leave you a purple energy ball and most of the time you will receive the big energy ball and as you probably know the big ball is the one that recovers more of your health
nintendo made the game so you cant lose basicallymy only guess is that this challenge gamers frequently speak of is the difficulty in finding all the weapons and other important items because to be fair many of the weapons and items in super metroid are hidden quite well
without a walkthrough its easy to miss something even if you walk past the same area a hundred times
this is where your weapons such as the power bomb come in handy
many of the secret areas throughout the planet require a power bomb to break through sections of a wall and some of these places are where you least expect because many times theres no sign something is hiddenive heard other complaints about this game
granted theyre not popular complaints and only a small amount of people actually believe them
but i happen to be one of those people and the complaint im speaking of is the lack of enemies throughout the planet
many times you find yourself walking across boring empty areas desperately searching for something to shoot
an example would be walking from the spaceship all the way to the wrecked ship area
on your way you only see a couple enemies around and if you ask me there should be a lot more
to be fair again this isnt a major complaint but the more you play the game the more you notice things like this and in the end you wish more weirdlooking creatures or space pirates were around so youd have something to shoot as you walk to the next area
i guess this is probably just me complaining about never having enough
well tough
this is how i am so you mine as well get used to it
the graphics are phenomenal which is one huge positive with super metroid
youve heard countless times someone refer to something as unique and youre probably getting sick and tired of it
well in this case the graphics are totally unique because i cant think of another game out there that shares the kind of graphics featured in this game
i can understand people who arent comfortable with the music in super metroid and find it disturbing
just imagine how freaky the music was for me back in  when a game like this was the first of its kindanyway the one thing that makes this a mustown game and near classic is the long gigantic maze of a planet you need to explore
yes despite the lack of challenge from the planet enemies all of them and the emptiness of much of the world exploring each new room can be a lot of fun
youll want to keep searching until you discover every little missile or energy tank available and that is what a good adventure game should doone thing that is hard is the wall jump technique which has a tendency to baffle many people
you see you have to jump near a wall and press certain buttons on the controller at just the right moment and you will bounce off the wall any wall and repeatedly bounce in an upward direction
if your timing is off just a little you wont be able to make the move happen and samus will fall straight down not that falling down kills you instantly unless you land on spikes and stay there
some gamers cant master the wall jump while others become really good at it and think its a nifty way to grab hardtoreach items early in the game
i think if you practice enough eventually you will be good at it
it is tricky though
but when you finally get the hang of it youll find out how useful it is
i should also mention that the wall jump technique is not a requirement except in one area
its just a trick to learn if you feel like iti cant think of anything else to talk about oh wait yes those big ugly nasty bosses you have to fight are so cool
kraid as youve read by now is a drastic improvement over his appearance in the original nes metroid because now he takes up two screens
back in the day this was known as the coolest thing ever
unfortunately to bring back a complaint from early in my review kraid can be defeated by using only a few super missiles
once again this is making the game too darn easy and nintendo should have made kraid along with the rest of the bosses harder to defeat
they should have made kraid like in the original metroid where you were required to waste a lot of regular missiles in order to defeat him
i love fighting that octopuslooking thing in the wrecked ship level
that thing is cool
ridley is awesome and packs a mean punch
hes my favorite boss battle because its all about power versus power
the mother brain is an absolute joke to fight
even if you only manage to find  missles theres  of them total shes still a simple boss fight and this includes both her incarnations
heck in her second form when she changes into something bigger and badder shes actually easierthe different areas of the planet are beautifully designed too
i especially think norfair even though its creepy and covered in fire is a cool looking area featuring some of the scariest looking monsters and the sweetest background graphics in the game
maridia the underwater stage is another very nice looking place filled with fish and other creatures some of which live in the sand
im a little disappointed tourian has only  metroids for you to freeze and destroy which is unlike the original metroid where you had to face  of them or soeven though it seems i am somewhat putting the game down i think its a wonderful addicting game and it comes very close to being one of the very best shooters ever
i believe if nintendo had worked on the challenge i would have given the game a higher score
you should buy itsuper metroid is absolutely one of the best games ever made for super nintendo
the graphics are astounding on the system for a side to side motion game and has many different moves and weapons with very little violencewhich makes it suitable for younger kidsthe controls are great but its quite hard to bounce off walls and accend higher and unlike metroid fusion on gba there are no directions what so ever to tell you where to go so it took me a while to find my way around in the game
but there is no doubt that this is an excellent game but i suggest purchasing it at a local game storeim not sure where to begin with this game  well first of all the story is highly original and quite interesting
i like the fact that the game is based on a future earth with real places from history as its dungeons
wonderful idea
the graphics are pretty standard snes fare with a slight combination of zelda and chrono trigger
some of the music is excellent and very moving too
i especially like the little world map tune the mysterious flute tune that plays at the inca ruins and most of all that song that plays when you save the game and choose to quit for now i wish i knew the names of these songs theyre greatthe gameplay is fun and the places you visit are quite exotic from the floating city to the nazca plain to the great wall of china
this rpg spans the ancient world
like zelda the bosses are huge and challenging and they require strategy to defeatso why not all  stars
well theres the story while most of the story is wonderful there is just one critical part of it that seems to have been completely uninspired  the ending
i wont spoil it but i will say that i found the ending very disappointing and even a little depressing
i found myself saying quotwhat
thats itquot  it seems as if they were in a rush to just finish the game and as a result produced a very shabby end to an otherwise awesome gameillusion of gaia is an actionrpg like link to the past except with its own kinks and that is mainly that you can transform to an alternate older character or yourself and the controls are fluid the enemies are creative and easy enough to defeat but there are some difficult bosses in this
there really isnt too much i can say here but that it is a fun game with an interesting story with all of your typical elements and i recommend this to anyone who wants a relaxing but an occasionally challenging gameone of the things that really stand out about this game is the graphics
in so many other rpgstyle games all the villagers look alike even in wonderful games like final fantasy  or  the appearances vary from town to town along with the houses and settings
theres even cool little touches like fruit and the like
its cool that the game designers took so much time on the graphics
the dungeonscastles are no less splendid to look at
id definitely say that the graphics is one of the best parts of the gamei also like that there were actual historical places here angkor wat the great wall of china etc the plotline itself is also interesting and is a kind of alternate universe to our own world when you think about itone of the drawbacks here was that once you pass certain points in the game you can not go back
sure i can understand that storywise such as when they went through mu to angel village but it would have been nice if later on they could have acquired an airship or the like so they could go back to previous areas and explore more fully especially for the red jewels oh yeah the jewel thing was another drawback
some of them were easy to find  located within treasure spots and the like but others were hidden in ordinary things
i had the original instruction booklet for this with my copy of the game and it told me where to find these jewels
a few of the jewels can only be found after certain actions have been performed so the only way to find all  jewels was to have the booklet or some other faqwalkthrough to tell you where they all arelevelups are different
you do not get any exp
only after you have defeated all the monsters in one dungeonfloor will you gain a boost your health or attack the health levelups are reminiscent of zelda games because you have a gauge like links hearts
wills ability to transform after gaia gives him powers and abilities are sweet especially shadowthe ending of this game was nice and while not the best creative
overall this is a fun gamemy subject line says it all
illusion of gaia takes you on a roaming journey on which you never return to any previous location once you leave the area
the story is charming and becomes increasingly more epic as it unfolds
the action rpg gameplay is pretty fun and the fact that you can only clear each screen of enemies once the method for leveling up keeps the player from over leveling and taking the challenge out of the game
the game is basically linear with one collection side quest that rewards the player in various wayswhen someone insults a nextgeneration video games graphics with something like quotit could have easily been done on snesquot she or he may not remember donkey kong country
even on on xbox gamecube ps or that phantom thingy the graphics on this baby are no insult
the cg resolution is crystalclear and the animation in unparalelled
the rain fits perfectly and the transition of weather is flawless
the music isnt bad either 
its great from funky kongs theme and the water stages to candys lovable romance beat and the final battle with king k rool
both graphics and sound really push the snes to its limitsas for the gameplay thats great too
the difficulty can challenge and even frustrate you but youll be coming back for more
if i have to say anything bad about the game dixie kong is not here yet and there are no digitized voices
there are grunts and cries but no actual wordshi everyone
im back
i am here to tell you my review of donkey kong country
i didnt know about it until i recieved the game boy color port for my birthday and it was fun
i later on sold it and tried out the snes original and it was better
it ts where the evil king k rool steals the bananas from donkey kongs hoard and he and his friend diddy kong go on a search to get it all back
the graphics were groundbreaking for their time and looked and played better than anything sega put out no offense i am also a sega fan
the gameplay was great and challenging
the bosses were neat as well
i also tried out the sequels and the second seems a little better than its predecesor and as for the third well a mixed bag
i would recommend the first two for your collection but please rent the third before you buy it best hit me if ya disagree
love the mine ride origionalfun
  because of all of the funoverall
  cuz of all of the fun the greatness and dot dot dotthe only reason that it was  not  is the graphics were not in the upper echelon of the best usage of the system like donkey kong country  and  but with better game but worse graphics usagekillerkiller game yallsdecent game
make sure u have a good partner or the game will be difficult lol my gf sucks at it im the only one beating the levels lolthis game made good use of snes graphic ability making this game fun and enjoyable with a rich variety of levels to explore
this is your basic sidescrolling game as donkey kong has to make his way through levels and defeat baddies
the levels are varied enough to not be repetitive and this is an overall decent game for the snesthe platforming can certainly get annoying at times but overall donkey kong country is one of those classic games that you simply must play if you call yourself a gamerunfortunately i never got to own this game growing up when i had my super nintendo
my friend had it and i borrowed it once or twice and rented it
during the short sessions that i got to play it i loved it
it was so so fun the mine carts were amazingly thrilling and the overall games presentation was just superb
im really bummed that i didnt get to own it because it was awesomeits hard to rate a game like donkey kong country which sold chiefly on the novelty of its computerrendered graphics back in  theres still a solid platforming design underneath the flash but its a pretty easy romp compared to nintendos mario titles
this is especially appearant now that the game is over a decade old
and the flash no longer holds up as well on the gba portstill rareware really did an excellent job and their success here propelled the company to a strong supporting role on the nintendo  gameplay is on the easy side but the levels are still a blast to play through
there are lots of varied environments and things to see with no dull moments in sight
a fitting memorable soundtrack adds to the experience
plus donkey kong country revitalized one of nintendos dormant characters taking him from a pixelated barrelthrowing ape to a rendered barrelthrowing ape with attitudeoverall theres a great experience here just one thats a bit on the easy side
the two sequels ramp up the difficulty level considerably and together the games form a fine trilogy on the snesthere is no question that donkey kong country is one of the best adventure games ever created on any platform
it was easily better than any mario game the snes put out and really raised the bar for what sidescrolling games could do
one can have hours of fun immersed in the dk world
the only problem
hours of gnashed teeth will also be spent rebeating levels because of the stupid saving mechanismthe best part of the dk country experience is that it is so unique
it was kind of like playing a mario gamebut with new challenges and characters
i liked how donkey kong and diddy kong both had unique abilities better suited for certain situations making you the gamer figure out when to use each character
the game is also quite challenging but not to the breaking point
after enough practice most levels can be beaten before the hairpulling stage
it terms of gameplay and presentation this is a star effort all the waythe huge negative
having to beat multiple levels before being able to save a game
now i realize that i have reviewed many nes games and never complained about the saving but that was because the nes technology just did not allow for anytime saving
by the time the snes came around though one could have saved the game after every level
however the game designers decided to make you earn save points by beating a number of levels at a time
in the beginning this is fine as you whip through the levels and pile up the bananasballoons without hardly a second thought
once you get to the icelevels stage though the game requires you to beat  extremely difficult levels before saving is possible
by this time in the game the player is operating on more like a  turn basis per lifespan
i realize the collecting bananas and trying to get specials argument for racking up multiple lives but that isnt why i wanted to play the game
i just want to beat each level and move onto the next without all the monkey business pardon the pun
this issue decreases the whole experience for me by an entire starthus donkey kong country is a classic in the canon of video game adventures
a very frustrating save mechanism does put a damper on the experience for all but the experts but overall it is still a fun gamei really liked this game
totally different from all the other mario games
in this one youre yoshi the whole time and you have to keep mario in your sight the whole game
you use a throwing method in this to get eggs and other things you need in the game
it takes a little while to get use to
this game is really different from the rest
i say this because of the egg throwing you need to do
you need to line your shots and hope you shoot the angle or thing your shooting at
the pros of this game is you always bank time and what the time is for is when mario gets knocked out of your grasp and you have to go back and save him
the con is mario is very annoying with a baby cry everytime you lose him
over all this is a great game and its one you have to own especially if your into mario games
you get a lot of game play with it
its worth the buyyoshis island would be my mario sidescroller of choice if i had to pick one to play single player
while there is no two player option this title offers some very fun and colorful levels for yoshi to explore while protecting a baby mario
a level completion percentage challenges players to replay levels and rewards them with challenging bonus stages for getting enough  completionsif i had one complaint about the first dkc game it was that the game is too easy
this sequil obviously solves that problem
this game is brutally hardthe graphics and music are top notch thanks to rare and nintendos ability to extract the most from the sness capabilities
even by todays standards these games are well above averagedkc is very similar to the first one with the exception of longer levils more enemies more secrets and tougher bosses
the challenge is definitely worth it since it will take even the most avid gamer which i am not a good length of time to complete itwell worth it
if you can get it grab itwell buy form them dvd or games to playing see
them do good job on time
do there playing dvd or gamesthe original donkey kong country game was such a success that it pretty much usurped mario on the snes console for the title of best sidescrolling adventure
this sequel diddys kong quest however manages to even improve upon the gameplay of its predecessor and make for an even better gaming experiencethere are two main reasons why this game is better than the original the level designs manage to be even more interesting
not that the levels in dk were bad by any means but they are just more interesting in this effort
when i think back to the iconic levels in this series im usually thinking of ones from this game
dixie kong is a better playable character than donkey kong
the main trouble with the dkdiddy combo of part one is that dk is such a sluggish character
he gets the job done but only passably for a game that requires so much jumping
in that game diddy is the much better character
in part two though the diddydixie combination are pretty much equals
diddy is still a bit more agile and nimble to work with but the hair of dixie used for flying and throwing makes her very valuable as wellthe only reason i cant give this game the full five stars
it doesnt let you save after every level
i know i knowgamers werent used to that feature like they are now
but it still doesnt make it any better at least for me
after about the second stage the levels in this game get quite difficult
difficult to the point of the gamer feeling a real accomplishment after completing a level which of course is the point
yet there is a clunky system of gathering coins in order to save and even then it is only after you reach the save point in each stage
you may have to beat  very difficult stages often with only a few lives to work with in order to save your progress
i dont care what the times were likethat makes for more frustration and less funoverall though diddys kong quest manages to slide in slightly ahead of its predecessor no easy feat
i always had a bit more fun playing this game than the first onethree things we never thought wed see in a mario game mario in an rpg
mario and bowser on the same team
link in the same gamewe never thought wed see the day that any of these would happen but they did
the story goes that star road introduced in super mario world is destroyed by smithy a new enemy from another dimension
now the world is in peril and only mario bowser princess peach toadstool and two new heroes mallow and geno can possibly save star road
mario goes beyond the mushroom kingdom to meet new people and explore new places
my favorite by far is nimbus land a kindom in the clouds
the play is great and the moves are really cool especially genos moves
the only downside is that the item menu is extremely limited
there are only about  slots instead of the usually neverending
oh well thems the brakes
this game had some of the best graphics on snes and it has one of the best stories second to chrono triggerpsthe third item on the list has to do with a brief cameo
in the rose town inn you can see link sleeping in one of the bedsthe game is designed exceptionally well for an rpg the story line is engages you the battles arent super repeative some enemies have super powered moves you dont expect
plus you can only carry a limited amount of items
the major down fall to this game is its always been expensive  or  dollars when it first came out
now you can get it used for like  but people can beat the game in  hours if you really rush it and most can in under  hours
aside from that this is a rare that you will actually want to get into battles to look at the great graphics
plus the expected funny and challanging events make it fun as well
a good game but maybe not worth the price wish it were longerive played nearly every squaresoft game for the snes 
ive played nearly every mario game
is this game the best game ever made
definitely not
if this is your first rpg well okay then maybe i can see why it appealed to you
but stacked against final fantasy  or chrono trigger
no competition
well lets get into the nitty gritty of this review shall we
graphics admittedly the graphics in this game are really good but they are not the snes at its absolute best
soundmusic goodness
its been so long since ive played
let me put it this way i dont remember any specific tunes from this game
im sure the music was fitting though
characters like many have said the ability to have bowser in your party was just downright awesome
but then i cant help but wonder about this
wheres luigi
they have this geno guy but they dont have luigi
however frogfucius was really cool because i liked his name
but the one group of characters that i didnt like were those silly mighty morphin power ranger lookalikes
i guess they were low on ideas that day or something
storyline you start in the  oclock position on the world map and work your way clockwise edging ever closer to this awesome looking sword that has a face built into it
you go down pipes find old and new friends fight evil go to weddings etc
battle system not too different from other squaresoft rpgsits turnbased
each character has a different weapon and special abilities
overall only squaresoft could have made this game what it wasany other company would have botched it up
if you want a fun rpg with variety andmost of allmario then this is not a bad game
gamers who like the final fantasy series might feel a little let down thoughits a classic for the snes the gamestoryline are fun music is good it never too difficult and never too easy just finesuper mario rpg is a somewhat overrated game thats very fun to play
calling it the best game on the system is pretty dumb though because mario world beats all the other games
the combat system isnt perfect with a few minor flaws and one major flaw guarding against enemies is a pain to deal with
the timing for guarding is difficult to learn and sometimes seems impossible
the minor flaws are in the menu
its not quite as good as what you see in later mario rpgs
also i dont see why people think the story and characters are so great
paper mario  did way better in that category
i thought the way the characters were portrayed was annoying
the story line is just a little bit insulting to the mario series too just a little bit
other than those things its a great big adventure that will keep you busy and entertain even the least patient as in getting bored with a game as quickly as possible people for at least two weekspresentation gets the job done but its not impressivegraphics sound its great and it wouldve gotten a  if it werent so repetitivegameplay replay value it wont be long before you play it againoverall hands down this is a wildly fun and unique mario game
of course its filled with all the essential elements  goombas gold questionmark boxes fire flowers pipes and the like but its very different from other mario games
to be honest i like this game a whole lot better than mario it was cool having bowser koopa on my side for once as well as two new characters geno and mallow i was disappointed that luigi wasnt part of the game but having peach as a playable characters cool
everyone has nice attacks and i liked playing with all of them  i was often switching between characters because none of them were really weak unlike other games where some characters are practically useless and the storyline itself is unique and interesting
the game length was also good you have all of these quests and sidequests to explore along with quite a few bonus quests which turn up a few cool and rare items
overall this really is a lot of fun and gets  stars from me
enjoyin all the new ones for sale that i have seen the sellers admit that it is in fact not new
frankly the fact that amazon doesnt do anything about this blatent lying does not instill much confidence in me about their systemthat said this is a wonderful game
its the game that first got me to actually play rpgs as opposed to just watching my friend play them
its a square rpg too so its not like nintendo just paid some twobit developer to hack out a crappy mario tiein unlike most of their older mario tieins they went with the best of the best and it shows
beautifully d rendered for the snes i mean and a joy to play
definately worth buying if you are morally opposed to emulationi enjoyed the second one the best out of all of them it was a nice concept in the playstation erawhile dated this is still the funnest of the wipeouts to play
there are only  real problems with it
first the game came out before draw in was in wide use so youll sometimes see parts of the track appear out of thin air as you approach
second there are only  craft to choose from and  others unlocked by a code
and third to play multiplayer you need to use the system link cable
for those of you who dont know that means you need two copies of the game two playstations two tvs and the link cablehoweverthe track design is the best of the  psone wipeouts by far
they lay out and the venues are very well done and the soundtrack is a perfect fit
the controls work great even though theyre on the digital pad and the game play itself is unique features innovative weapons and gets very fast
mario cart this is notwipeout xl  circa good a better version of a great and original game goodtight controls really good techno soundtrackbad to todays gamer these graphics look dated but at the time they looked state of the art gameplay is not as fluid when compared to todays racing games if you hate futuristic racing techno or racing while shooting gameswill it fit your taste a futuristic racing game with hovering cars cars can shoot at each other techno soundtrackgame its most assocated too wipeout wipeout  mario cart  for the driving and shooting bitadditional notes all the music is from real and somewhat known americanbritish techno bands this game is basically a remake of wipeout with more unlockable there is a version of this game for the pcsonics days of glory may have ended when he tried to go d but his genesis adventures are among gamings most memorable
in the usual classic sonic formula you run at a high rate of speed at a d view in wonderfully detailed environments
the graphics look nice which shouldnt be a surprise to any bit fan
the controls work great and the sense of speed is awesome
even though he doesnt have any teammates like in the sequel youll still have a great time playing as sonic as you speed through the levels and solve some interesting puzzles to get past obstacles
there is no reason you should hate sonics genesis adventures because they are still classic and a lot of fun to play no matter how old you are as a gamer
if you like the retro oldies this game is a definite musthave for any retro fan
why not higher than an  rating
the camera
the games camera sometimes has a hard time trying to keep up with you which will undoubtedly get you some cheap deaths unfortunately
but this game is hardly flawed and is too much fun to really pick atman i dont know how many times ive played this excellent game for the sega genesis but if theres one thing ive got to admit its very addicting
this is the original classic that started it all and while gameplay is pretty limited you cannot yet do a charged spin attack or become super sonic its still very fun
in addition the chaos emeralds are fairly hard to collect and youll need to collect  coins or more in order to find and retrieve them in the bonus levels
there will be times where you may have to go back and get them all considering that it is rather difficult but its a good challenge for anyone whos up to it
with todays games graphics some players may not enjoy this but retro fans will definately get a kick or should i say spin
out of italso recommended sonic the hedgehog sonic the hedgehog  sonic and knuckles sonic spinball  sonic d blastgreat game
i was always more of a mario guy but still a classic
i bought this due to it being the only game my wife said she would play she didnt but that didnt stop methis is obviously a sega classic
very famous game that is very fun and sonic has seemed to be a never ending character as there are still games coming out for sonic
this is a good game and if you have the genesis then you should have itsonic the hedgehog
the first official sonic game on the genesismost people who have lived around the time that this classic came out remember back in the early s when gamers everywhere held tightly onto their ness and shouted mario
mario
all over the world okay maybe not but thats how the one smb commercial went anyway
so it seemed that with the thenrecent release of smb the plumber would always dominate d platforming or would he
the sega genesis had been out for a couple of years by this point and while there were many classics no mascot was there to stand up to all the koopa troopas and toadstools of the big n enter yugi naka and crew to come up with the true origin of the battle between the bit giants nintendo and sega the creation of sonic the hedgehogso what does this new blue hero in red shoes have to offer that a fat mushroomeating plumber doesnt
well for one sonic is fast
not nearly as much as in any of the sequels but for  this kind of speedy sidescrolling gameplay was unheard of and drew many crowds
i remember being taken by storm when my cousin first bought a sega with the original sonic game
it brings back so many memories of middle childhood
the gameplay is rather basic with only a run jump and spin attack to combat the levels but really thats all you need here
for new gamers that have just started playing the recent sonic games this is the game that introduced rings tv powerups loops animalfreeing chaos emeralds instantdeath spikes dr robotnik underwater drowning bumpers catapults springs and the green hill zone
plus the game is divided into different zones and within each zone are several acts which are merely just stages
with all that it has going for it how does it measure up to its sequels
lets look at the pros and consproswhile the snes probably had better graphics color palettes and scaling effects i still have yet to see a snes game with as smooth of the gameplay framerate as any genesis sonic title im talking about normal ingame play thats not a special fx chip or anything like thatnice balance of difficulty
the first few zones arent too difficult to get the hang of though once you reach the labyrinth zone it does jump quite a bitlarge nonlinear stages
although the sequels get a lot better at this especially sonic  these zones all have original and varying environmental themes and seem just the right length for the pace that the platforming has set
it lets you speed through most of them in little time and also lets you explore their depths as welland speaking of stages this one of the few sonic games with three acts per zone as opposed to twochaos emerald collecting gives the game some replay value
in the mario games you could collect all the secret powerups in the game but the ending would never change
not so with sonic
if you manage to collect  rings and reach the end of a stage you can jump through a giant ring and tackle a special stage to collect one of six chaos emeralds which if acquired enables a better endinggreat variety of enemies
a lot of the robots you fight here are classic staples of the series such as the crab hornet and caterpillar
the bosses are rather interesting as welli cant end the pros without mentioning that this game has an excellent soundtrack
the greenhill zone scrap brain zone and title themes especially will get stuck in your head thankfully all are memorably good
consthe timer for each stage can be an annoyance for those who like to explore the levels
its usually only useful for getting points in beating the levels fast but you will always die whenever the clock hits  minutessince the speed dash ability isnt here yet the game will seem a bit slowerpaced than all the others
just to warn any newcomersthe special stages are tough for most people
im not complaining so much because i enjoy a good challenge but for the sake of beginners its waaaaay too simple to lose in the special stages
interestingly enough it becomes a minigame in sonic  knuckles a few years down the roadthe instant death spikes
i guess the programmers of the original mega man game got together with the sonic team here because what both games have in common is the way their spikes kill the player even while theyre flashingno characters and very little story
tails wouldnt show up til the sequel knuckles and amy rose were down the road a bit and everyone else was just a thought
so that leaves just sonic and dr robotnik
the plot basically boils down tothe animals have been captured by dr robotnik
sonic is here to rescue them
thats it
supposedly i heard that the death egg ship was being built during this games timeline but it was never officially mentioned so ill consider it separate from the sonic  sonic  and sk continuous storiesother than that sonic  is a classic sega staple
pure and simple
its a  star game in comparison to other platformers but im just giving it  stars when standing up to the other games in the series
so if you have an old genesis or if you bought the sonic mega collection and if you happen to be a fan of the games dont skip out on this one
it made the series what it is today and serves as important history for video games
play it nowthe game that started it all ahh sweet nostalgiai first played this at a neighbors house and wanted to go back just so i could play sonic the hedgehog
its not as elaborate or wellestablished as future games though it contains many basic elements like golden rings and the sonic spinball but like final fantasy  or super mario brothers  this is a classic old game which started off a wonderful series
not to be missedit is the first so no tales or knuckles in this versionplus no charging ur roll and the one i received said mot for resale right on the front but did come in origonal box and almost mint in takes the collector value awayi remember when this game came out i played it at a friends house and loved itfinally a platform game that surpassed mario
this game is very easy to pick up and play and very enjoyable to say the least
i have beat the game several times and its still a fun game to play
a classic game that combines graphicsespecially for its timeand stellar gameplay and fun
if you havent played this game your missing out on a classic and also check out sonic cd for sega cd only and the sequel sonic the hedgehog  for sega genesisstreets of rage is a classic beat em up just so fun back in  there was this and there was final fight in the arcades
basicly theres a criminal organization called the x syndicate the group leader is called mr x he turns out to be washington senator george xetheus who wants to president and you have  level  is hard especially you have to fight all the bosses all over again but a couple of years later streets of rage  would be released and put sor  to shamestreets of rage is what i can say is  of the many many reasons that sold me on getting a sega mega drive or as we know it genesis
the  bit era i love it cause you had  companies putting out great games
as a genre beat em ups are my favorite
the genesis had plenty of them
streets of rage among us s gamers is  of segas best known franchises along with sonic
in the late s  early s crime drugs  gang violence was heavy in the news  video game companies were ready to cash in on the fear
in  capcom had a beat em up called final fight also that same year sega had the genesis coming out a  bit system  sega was set to port a lot of arcade games on it cause early on the genesis titles had arcade ports that looked good
capcom was in with nintendo so no final fight for sega although it was ported to the sega cd  years later
sega was like well we will go for our own beat em up which i am happy for cause streets of rage was better than the snes port of final fight ill admit while the snes looks better the port of final fight on snes has no guy  if you wanted to play as guy you had to buy another cartridge theres no  player  you know if you have a friend over at your house or a family member having a nd player adds to the fun
the music in the snes port sounds like it belongs in a g  y p or n flick
if you have a sega genesis arcade stick then that adds more to it
the story is simple  straight forward dealing with a city thats been turned into a war zone hel l hole by a crime syndicate lead by a guy named mr x this group of detectives or undercover cops or whatever they are named adam hunter axel stone  blaze fielding they cant get any help to deal with the rising crime cause the police department is corrupt
so theyre going to put a stop to it
when you st start the game youll notice some good music in the game the composer yuzo koshiro made it sound like this city needs to be saved
you have options if you want to do any cheats or change the difficulty
you can get a cheat where you can have  lives you have  continues when you run out of lives  continues its game over
i usually play as adam cause cause he has great fighting style he has a really good jump kick  back attack
axel in this game just gets his a   kicked a lot unlike in part  his punch  kick combos are fine
his jump attack is lame  his back attack is lame too
blaze is pretty good in this game however axel  blaze were improved in part  you have  levels where you go through  fight your basic punks  these biker looking dudes
in level  you have these whip chicks bosses are pattern based the boss in the st level is this guy with a boomernge if you get too close he will kick you
you have to use jump attacks or grab him  attack him
hes not really a challenge like later bosses like the obese guy on bridge or the blaze clones in level  the music is good in level  really gets you ready to go through the rest of the game
level  is a bad area of the city you have more of the same goons plus kung fu guys  the appearance of an axe wielding clown these guys do become annoying the boss is this game that has these freddy kruger like claws you have to grab him  attack him
or if you got a bat or steel pipe you can stand in front of him  when he comes to you just swing the weapon at him
when you attempt a lock up youll have to do it from the side  not in front of him him cause he will just claw you up
if you need to use a special attack then you can call on back up where they will fire a bazooka  that will take down a lot of the bosses health
you also have to deal with thugs joining in during this boss fight
great track in level  it just captures the mood of this urban area
round  has an excellent track the enemies stay about the same their clothes might be a different color  take more hits to defeat
the boss looks like the ultimate warrior all you have to do is back him up at the end of the screen keep jump kicking him over  over  hes not much of a problem
round  is on this bridge thats under construction which you can knock thugs into holes  you wont have to worry about them any more
you can also be thrown down the pit too  lose a life so you have to be careful
the boss of level  is an obese guy he can be hard he breaths fire too the best method is to keep pressing the b button punching him but dont do a combination if you lock him up don throw him cause hes too heavy  he will land on you just press b  dont use the d pad
he can be a pain cause he does get help from punks that want to join in
if have to use a special attack go ahead then on level  youre on some ship you go through the basic punks  the ultimate warrior decides to show back up  you can use the same attack method you used in level  plus you get a fun challenge as more  more enemies appear on screen
you get an extra special attack youll need it for the  blaze clones
if its your st time there not so gentle theyll knock you down or german suplex you
as adam i just stand  do my back attack
see what made the    bit eras so unique was that not very many people heard of the internet so the only way to find out about cheats or tips to beating a level was for to either buy a book or a friend tells you how or shows you what to do  that way was actually more fun instead of going online  its all there
leavel  is this factory its not too hard although that obese boss from level  is back put watching punks get hit with the industrial press is still fun to this day
the boss is  of those tall freddy claw bosses from level  its pretty much the same strategy but with  of them you get more of a fun challenge
you do get another special attack so you can call on back up twice like in level  so there is that
level  is classic cause youre on this lift facing off with warriors thugs  whip chicks
you can toss them to their death off the lift you can even call for back up which is a wtf moment cause how did this cop car get on a ship in a factory  can shoot a bazooka from below you  somehow gets to the lift is it a guided rocket or who cares its fun game
you only get  special attack per life rarely do you get  there is no boss on level  its straight into a lobby to go after mr x the game has a great soundtrack level  is just perfect cause it fits with the mob
you have to fight all the various punks warriors bikers  whip ladies
you face all  bosses again  you cant call for back up instead you have to rely on what you learned about their attack patterns
i usually died here until i got good at the game
i am sure a lot of died on level 
 reason is that you fight all  bosses again meaning you get to fight the blaze clones again i dont have a huge problem beating as adam as blaze its not too bad but as axel i just get owned hes pretty sub par in this game
then you face mr x the syndicate boss
he wants you to join his gang this introduces another ending you can have a good ending or bad ending but of course just tell him no you fight off his goons then you face mr x where he  goons helping him he runs around firing a tommy gun  he will smack you up the head with it
you have to use jump attacks if you get the steel pipe try using it on him
if you lock him up go for a german suplex
when you beat him you get a well deserved ending with some great music by yuzo koshiro
streets of rage came out as a final fight knock off but i felt it was better than the snes port cause you got great tunes with sor  players you didnt have to buy a nd cartridge to play as another character
gameplay is solid for the most part the only bad part is when you are punching an enemy if youre striking st the enemy will hit you st enemies dont have meters except the bosses  when you face them again those bosses dont have a health meter
if you have an old genesis laying around  dont have streets of rage then get it its cheap
theres various sega collections on the ps  x box   ps
but everything was improved with streets of rage  which will be my next reviewthis is an arcade game for the megadrive which is on a cartridge which has six games to it thus is one of them i rememeber playing this with my brother ages ago i used to play as adam and he was axl or blaze
there isnt many moves except punch kick throw german suplex and weapon strike with various weapons
it was better ten years ago though before ps and whatnot
the levels are generally easy except the th one which i think is pretty hard also the last one is because you have you fight all the bosses and then the main boss
like i said before this was good back in the dayz but is good for a play every now and thenthis final fight wannabe is of the lowest quality  graphically and otherwise  out of the three streets of rage games that were made for the genesis but it still has stout gameplay
you play a white guy a black guy or a womandepending upon which character you can identify with
the object is the same as it is for any such game beat the crap out of the same three or four enemies that come at you without end pick up steel pipes to bash opponents and eat food out of garbage cans to regain your strength
finally meet a tough boss at the end of each stage
rinse and repeat
overall an enjoyable yet somewhat repetitive gametreasure the game deleloper behind obscure jappenese titles like this one is all about d cartoon graphics
all of there games radiant silvergun ssaturn mischief makers n silhoute mariage ps and ssaturn even a ronald mcdonald trippy game are sprites
be on the lookout for these games collectors and those in search of quality games
egm aka electronic gaming monthly has stated that a possible remake of the original or an entire new adventure the treasure rep was more akin to the later is a strong possiblility for gbabecasue the game is non stop action  or  players
like contra but without instant deathslife meter
you die about  times per boss but it still an action shooter and not an adventure
you will never get lost but the weapon powerups will have you killing everthing in sight more like a top down shooterdid you ever see an orginal arcade ninga gaiden
you get to use a move similar to the swing on the street posts but unfortunaly not as offense but as a way to shoot in  directions
some areas take place crawling on scafolding aka ryu but nothing as acrobaticthe game was released in  correct the same year as smetroid and equaly deserving a sequal
i wish vecotrman released a year or two later was as good
i only played vman on emulator but the similrities are there somewhere
i just remember die ing alot more because of infinite pits which are few and far between in gunstar heroesa little too cartoonish for my tastes but i bought this mainly for the investment value
the game goes at a frantic pace and was ahead of its time when it was produced
completely unlike todays style of games which is really nicesince i reviewed that new ps  golden axe and told you it was god awful this however was a port of the  arcade game which is a hack and slash beat em up
the music in it is great very playable  more levels that were added  or  players and arcade power stick is a must for it if this game is kicking your butt at the player select screen hold down  left and press b  start
if you own a genesis get itthats pretty much all this game entails
however this is one of the best games ever made for the genesis
the graphics arent great the music and sound are pretty weak but the gameplay is awesome
you pick from  characters each has their own weapon attacks and of course different magical spells its the perfect balance of streets of rage with dungeons and dragonsthe game can be a little slow at times but its still a true classic but not as good as the streets of rage games though or other walkthrough beatem up games like the punisherok so maybe this game is alittle old but all those who still own a genesis like meif u dont have sega genesis get one
then get this game if u dont have it and heres whygameplay choose to be axe battler a blue barbarian with medium volcano magic tyris flare a girl with best magic with fire or gilius thunderhead with worst magic but awsome attack and ride dragons and bizzare chicken legs
spoilers
spoliers
there are  levels of gameplay an thieves that look like sqquirels
u can do  player team or vs but team is really fun if ure nervous u can u can start out on begginer mode an change health meter  or  before takin on arcade modestory cheesy story but i dont care really it duznt affect gameplay u set out on a quest to kill death adder and his son death adder jr must die as well along with the soldiers cuz they took over your village as well as they killed ure family
now u seek revenge against themo an u need to free the king an princessgraphics great graphics  a sega game
i like how spoilers

the death adder last boss tune song rocks
an even level  tunes
in fact their all great
although i got sega smash pack  gba cuz golden axe was on it an i was alittle disapointed that they cut out alot of the musicreplayvalue it came with everything but nuff about thatlt an i still play it with barbarian cuz he my favorite even though people like gilius the dwarf to this very day player is also jus incredible
i never played the arcade version but it feels like u are playin an arcade game unlike sega smash pack golden axepthis is  addicted jus like any classicrentbuy well ya cant rent this no more but u dont need to
unfortunatley the game is rare to findi got the game boxbookletetc cuz im jus that way with games but its not reccomended so its up ta uthis will make a good rst genesis game to any who duznt own a genesis an this game dont have rating cuz it old but u can tell its e rated cuz no blood an stuff so reccomended  all ages
remember your score death adderthousands grab ure weapon an change the score
well cya an have fun with ure new genesis  if u dont have  an golden axe when u get it
an those hoo do have genesis an game play itbye
psdont think im a knowitall on this game cuz i jus looked in booklet an dont get sega smash pack
this version better
finally i dont have golden axe  or  but they are way harder to getthis has to be one of the most recognizable games of all time
the genesis port is pretty faithful to the arcade though of course the graphics arent as good and the music is a bit tinny
still this is possibly one of my favorite games of all time
choose from warrior warrior maiden or axewielding dwarf
the dwarf kicks ass though he could use some kind of armor or something
whats with the green pajamas
no wonder hes so pissedi bought two of these controllers along with golden axe  for sega genesis
the controller would not work correctly for golden axe   if anyone knows how to correct this let me know thanks falling block games reached the pinnacle of their evolution fairly quickly as dr robotniks mbm from  is easily the most complex and fun example of the genre that began with tetris a primitive russian strategy game from  that has since become iconic
mbm is hardly an iconic game but it is very cute if punishingly difficulti first played the game way back when it was first released at the age of twelve
i got to about level three before it got too hard from my kids brain to cope with
now with the hd version on the playstation  i am able to save my progress and easily restart each level the moment i lose it is still nearly impossible and thats on medium difficultythere are  stages in total the robotnik level is a hidden final stage and with each progression the falling beans get slightly faster with greater variation between them
it was certainly luck and not skill that took me to the final stage and end credits but what a relief when it was finally overgraphics bsound bgameplay alasting appeal adrmbm is actually a puzzle game rather than your average platformer
its actually based off of the adventures of sonic the hedgehog show and it is probably the only game to bethe main game is connecting  of the same color
its puyo puyo but with an american sonic theme
theres a vs mode a training mode which is like playing solo in tetris and a story mode that pits you against dr robotniks halfbaked robotsthe game over screen is pretty funny
during the countdown time for you to continue dr robotnik dances and taunts during the whole countdown
at the near end of it he laughs evillythe puzzling gameplay is pretty addicting and it is still a fun game to this dayi didnt like it the first time i played it
it felt like another stupid tetris knockoff with beans
 months later i decided i would try it again and wow
i didnt realize that this game was based off the adventures of sonic cartoons
you play against all of the bad guys in the cartoon series and they each have some funny dialouge
the graphics were really good
the only problem was you dont play as sonic and the ai was a little cruel but its fun for  dollars or as part of another sonic genesis collection disci guess different reviewers have different opinions on this game
unlike the previous reviewer below i really liked this game
i also agree with the reviewer that said this game was better than sonic d blastin this game gear game dr eggman has committed the most rotten crime yet
he has taken away sonics speed shoes and replaced them with slow down boots so sonic cant run or jump
when sonic finds out about this he becomes so furious he does the only speedy move he can do the spin dash
now he must use it to obtain the keys in dr eggmans labyrinth to get his shoes back or hell never get the chance to be called sonic againlikesthe stages are in d delightyou can set sonics life meter at the options menu wether you want the game to be a breeze a challlenge or in betweencollecting keys and destroying robots increases your timebefore you battle the bosses you can slide down the slide and collect as many rings as you candislikesit is hard to use the cannon in the sea level to fling yourself up to the switch that opens the door to the bonus round
you have to hold the buttons down after you get launched in order for it to work
otherwise it is a really good gameoverall  stars
a solid game gear game i would recommend playingthis was the first and only puzzle game ive ever bought for a video game console and it hooked me from the first five minutes of starting it upthe concept here is really simiple
youre a tiny guy or gal on a big platform of blocks suspended in a world of darkness
youre sitting there minding your own buisness when suddenly huge smashy blocks appear at the end of the platform coming right towards you
theres nowhere to hide nowhere to run to
your only chance is to set explosive devices and destroy the blocks before they reach you
if you failwell lets just say it wont be prettyso you run around frantically destroying the blocks before they reach and crush you
its very simple gameplay but add in the fact that things go faster and faster and the challenge gets harder and harder as the game goes on and youve got a challenging game thats easy to learn almost impossible to masterso weve got fun and challenging gameplay but absoloutly terrible graphics
by todays standards intelligent qube is a visual mess
the charachters are terrilbly ugly and everything has a first generation playstation look to it
the game also gets impossibly hard as it goes on
i never got past the fourth level which says a lot about how hard this puzzle isbut the graphics and difficulty can be easily forgiven considering how addictive and compelling the gameplay is
in its finest form intelligent qube is a perfect example of superior gameplay over superior graphics
this is one puzzler that stands the test of time quite wellthis was the very first game that i ever got with my psx back in  it came bundled with the psx itself
really good fighting game
graphics were really good for its time the cast of characters were pretty good i really had a crush on sofia back in the day lol and they each have their own weapons
the backgrounds were decent and the music was pretty good
the only gripe i had about this game was that the final boss gaia was really cheap always spamming his projectile attacks which really frustrated me as a kid
playing this game now and looking back i realize that the boss battle wasnt so bad its just that i wasnt as good of a player as i thought i was
really good memories with this game
overall this is a definite buy
a really good choice if youre into fighting games or a collector of rare gamesthe classes that you can use are excluding special classes such as engineer or holy knight one of my favorites squire chemist knight archer priest wizard summoner ninja geomancer mediator mime calculator dancer samurai bard time mage and monk
if i didnt get them all feel free to add
remember i only listed the main classes not the special onesthe gameplay is a very strong point in the game
you fight monsters humans or a mixture of both on a field of squares that you move from one to the next
its somewhat time consuming going through the menus to battle but really if youre into strategy rpgs youre used to this
i will mention one thing ive found myself falling asleep to this game because the battles were slow
not that this should detract you from buying this excellent gamethe story is seriously the strongest point in the game
you are in a huge place called ivalice and you travel from town to town occasional going to waterfalls or swamps and what not
ramza is the main character and he experiences betrayal meeting new friends and fighting for whats rightthe sound isnt bad
the main music in battles against monsters which can happen in between towns on the map is ok but you might get sick of it after a while
but some of it is pretty good
not great but good
just dont expect it to blow you awayi think ive touched on the main points
once again if im missing a class feel free to tell me  stars and then somethis final fantasy is totally different from the others its a much more strategic game then a rpg one  but its fun  a little short  and it does not have multi endings   i give it  stars its nice but not perfect   and if you expect a regular final fantasy you will be desapointedwhen square realeased final fantasy tactics after its monumental success in final fantasy vii it recieved some very harsh critisim for its poor translation among other things
but final fantasy tactics built a strong fan base and im sure many still replay it todayfft is a game that took a different direction rather than a traditional rpg
most of the game revolves around battles that are much harder than you may think
the manual even advises that you save after every encounter
before a battle ensues you can place usually up to  characters on a platform which represents your side of the battlefield while the enemy starts on the other side
you then begin to advance a little like chess planning strategically to smite all the enemies before youi definitely agree with the people who say this game is hard
if you dont plan one characters move correctly the whole battle may be out of your hands
but if strategy games isnt your cup of tea then dont get strategy games
fft is a hard game but it is definitely beatable and conquerable it just takes a lot of time and patienceall in all final fantasy tactics is an exceptional game
the engrossing gameplay great graphics story and characters make it a must have for fans of the genre or considering fansi love a good tactics game and this was the one that turned me on to them
while i get a little ocd about it and try to train the characters to be level  billion in all classes oddly the tediousness of that makes me happy
anyway fun game great for strategistswhat can i say ff tactics is an rpg gem
which somehow got over looked by many but maybe thats because it came out around the same time as ff
if you are a fan of chess board rpg styled games like disgaea phantom brave saiyukis journey west etc
i highly recommend snagging this on psp psn or a ps copy sold here for cheap
also if youre a final fantasy fan i recommend this too
final fantasy tactics is one of the first games to introduce the chess board style game play
heres how it racks uppositive  characters are unique and the artwork is on par with legend of mana job classes make this game all the more fun and each job has its unique attacksstatsarmor equipment lots of different weapons to choose from even more abilities to make you character awesome
example have a gun wielding knight who can also use samurai skills
yep thats possible in tactics soundtrack is amazing its not nobou amazing but whoever was in charge did a fantastic job
at times it can be soothing as youre fighting in the rain on some mountain tops or creepy as youre fighting an uber boss in a castle
music sets the mood big time in this game you can recruit just about anyone to join your party
monsters humans a crazy robot and even cloud strife as a hidden side quest levels are unique
not just the same painted over texture board over and over again
each place on the map has its own landscape weather different times of day enemies trees water you name it
lots of work went into this part which shows a lot overall it takes  hours to finish final fantasy tactics  with all the side quests
one can miss a lot of hidden things on their first play through so it definitely has replay valueokay now the negatives like the title to this review says difficult
final fantasy tactics can be just a pain in the butt sometimes
especially when a  minute battle takes a turn for the worse
your party starts missing attacks on enemies the enemy uses status attacks like petrify confuse charm and theres no medic in your party to heal those conditions or they just dont know that move
yeah a lot can go wrong in a battle
or simply the enemy is just too strong and dominates your party
a great example of this is one part in the game where youre prompted to save just before an uber boss fight
if you cant beat this boss tough cookie
since you already saved theres no going back to level up
better find a way to beat this uber boss
theres a couple of fights throughout the game like this one and man it can be frustrating
if you are a fan of really hard games then youll love this game for the difficulty aspect at one point the story just kind of loses its edge
mainly towards the end where the main character has no idea what is going on
hes just trying to get his captured sister back from the bad guys
the ending also lacks any real punch line or what is it called meh ill just say punch line
its kind of like  and everyone died but not really type of ending
not the best but there is some closure
so that is what counts
like what happened to such and such character
mediocre endingoverall tactics is great and delivers as a unique rpg for its timehappy gamingif battles are what you want then youll be very well pleased
final fantasy tactics gives you the opportunity to use the job system like in final fantasy v allowing you to create customized character that can use magic and summon creatures etc
all of the classic job classes are present in the game along with a few others that only certain characters can posses
the classics like black mage white mage summoner knight monk etc
are very common but there are a few other classes such as engineer holy knight dark knight princess that are classes that only specific characters can possess
you can also have monsters on your side as well as chocobos
a portion of the story is told after every new battle you encounter
the story is there and it is pretty thin but it still has the basics of a final fantasy plot
the music is wonderful just like the rest of the series and the main characters have their own unique personality that makes the game memorable
if you are looking for a role playing game that is only battle after battle after battle then you wont be dissapointed but if you are looking for a traditional final fantasy game id rent it before id buy itpros battles that require strategy and skills not just dumb luck and high levelscons thin plot not a traditional ff game can become boring if you dont like the never ending stream of battlesoverall a nice addition to this wonderful series and a must buy for someone that likes games like chess dampd and the like
the game is a lot like chess but with more excitement and strategythis is most definitely a much much different game than the other entries in the final fantasy series
you control the young hero ramza beoulve and a party of adventurers as they become involved in what starts out as a relatively simple case of kidnapping and politics that eventually turns into a crisis that involves a trip into the underworld to save the world from the forces of darkness
your party starts out as ramza and a bunch of generic characters but as you progress through the game you will meet up with a number of friends that will join your party all of which have their own unique abilities ranging from forgettable to helpful to awesomelyoverpoweringthere are a lot of good things about this game
there are a total of  quotjobsquot in the game ranging from the usual things like wizards healertypes and swordwielding knights to exotic classes such as the ninja the calculator and those everpopular summoners
each character starts out as one of two quotgenericquot classes and as they level up and learn new abilities more and more of the other classes are unlocked and become available
most of the battles you participate in allow you to take a party of five characters into action although there are a few exceptions
so the possible combinations of battle parties one can create is almost endless
the customization part of this game is probably its strongest point because it allows for hours of fun experimentation as you learn the different jobs strengths and weaknesses
the battles themselves are somewhat like a giant chess match where you and the computer manuever your men around a d battlefield trying to take and hold the most advantageous positions to use to your advantage
one of the best things about all this is that you have to be careful how you use magic
the highlevel magic spells in this game can be quite powerful but the player must learn how to use it properly or else you will kill off your own group members in addition to the enemies
there are many different types of battlefields ranging from open prairies to castles and dungeons to swampland and everything in between
the story battles are filled with drama and danger and the random battles you get into as you move from town to town will keep your skills maxed out since the monsters in random battles level up along with you so you will always be challenged even when revisiting areas near the beginning of the game
the ingame music and graphics are excellent given that this game is several years old
the shops in the game are where you will go to purchase the vast majority of your weapons armor and items and there is a very welldone quotfitting roomquot system to ensure that you know ahead of time what you are buying and what it will do for you before you spend money on it
once you have been through a few battles money worries will rapidly fade
its also easy to keep plenty of items in stock so you never run out during battle
there are also a number of sidequests as we have come to expect from all final fantasy games and they are rewarding fun and generally worthwhilethere are a few flaws though
the plot of the game is rather convoluted
its tough very tough to keep track of the dozens of cast members and who is on what side who is betraying who and so on
there is a feature in the game allowing you to replay key scenes in the story and also read biographies of all characters and i found myself going back here often
if you can keep up with everything the plot is compelling but it is tough
the ending of the game is very sad and haunting and wont soon be forgotten
another flaw is the rather poor japanesetoenglish translations that this game contains
it doesnt really detract from the enjoyment of the game but it is very jarringdespite these flaws i really think that this game takes many of the wellknown traditions of the final fantasy series to the next level
anyone who has played and enjoyed the other games in the series will enjoy this one
i know i didi may be somewhat prejudiced but final fantasy tactics remains one of my favorite games despite the fact that i am not generally a fan of tactical gamesfinal fantasy tactics follows the adventures of a young soldier who discovers that the simple world he believes in is far too complicated his best friend turns against his family and friends and trustworthy figures transform into monsters
along his journey of discovery civil war and heroism he is thrust into many battles and must learn along with allies and friends he gains along the way to be a master of tactical warfarethe latter of course is really your task given that the poor schmuck is just a programmed drone under your commandfft when released had what may have been the most aweinspiring introductory cgi ever made and even today its pretty darn spiffy
the music is quite simply gorgeous i bought the cd collection and dont regret it for a minute
while following the main plotline you can also take on other adventures and jobs gaining little perks along the way and if youre sharpeyed finding injokes and references to other squaresoft games
you can end up getting cloud strife from ffvii in your party and meet aerith of the same game at one pointthe sd quotsuperdeformedquot versions of the characters that you see most of the time are pretty  very nice character design  and for the most part you view them in tactical mode in an adjustableangle d display
by todays  the view isnt amazingly detailed but it plays out well the characters can develop skills in a wide variety of professions ranging from wizards to monks and straightup fighters each of which has its own peculiar talents and powers
each individual character also has his or her own special talents and as they gain experience can be built up in a myriad of different waysoverall its a really fun game with a nice plotline gorgeous music and smooth wellthoughtout gameplay
anyone who likes tactical games should enjoy this onefinal fantasy tactics is for people who have lots of time and dedication for a good rpg
this game can be over  hours long so dont think its short because its one disk
excellent battle system and overall a must have for anyone who plays final fantasy gamesi dont know how the wild arms series managed to escape my notice for this long
i thought id already tried all the ps rpgs that were any good but apparently i missed this series
my first exposure to wild arms was wild arms  which i had rented from gamefly
i didnt get to play it very long but it seemed like a nice game
so i decided to start collecting the wild arms series to try out starting with the original wild armsgraphics score  well whats the nice way to put this
um the game looks pretty simplistic for a ps game with very simplistic d character models and flat backgrounds that look like they couldve come from an early final fantasy
when i first saw this game i actually thought it might be a revamped port from an earlier system
i did some research and apparently its not a port at all but it did come out rather early in the pss lifespan and was certainly preff
taking this into account one can forgive the poor graphics
youll notice that theres a lovely intro cutscene thats rendered in lovely anime style and as we all know those age quite well so they made a good decision there
however youll never see any more of those anime cutscenes ever again throughout the rest of the game
too bad reallymusic score   the music is all pretty good as far as rpg music goes
i like the fact that much of the music is reminiscent of the western vibe they were going for in the games setting
i especially like the whistley intro music
i wouldnt say this games music is terribly memorable but its good enough during the game to keep you engagedcharacters score  well this game has three main characters and thats it
you have rudy who strangely never talks jack and cecilia
they are all decent enough characters who have some sort of personality and much to the games credit they all have some sort of backstory and character development to them
have i come across characters i liked better and that were more memorable
sure but these characters are just fine especially for an older game
there are a few memorable side characters here and there too
the villains however are pretty cheesy
they are the sort of oldschool rpg villains that are a bit onedimensional and frankly hard to take too seriously
they also dont get a whole lot of characterization or depth to them but that was sort of the standard back thenstory score  first off the games setting is unusual for an rpg
im used to sort of quasimedieval fantasy settings but having an rpg set in a fantasy westernstyle setting is quite a breath of fresh air
as for the story itself its decent enough for a game of its time
it certainly has a more oldschool vibe to the story and simplicity that is more similar to older final fantasies think ff than it is to the later rpgs that came on the ps
that being said although ive certainly experienced better stories in rpgs this ones not bad
its interesting enough to keep a person playing but youre not going to weep with emotion while playing it eitherbattle system score  anyone whos played an older rpg should be familiar with the concept of turnbased combat or menudriven combat if you want to get all technical
thats what weve got here
i rather like turnbased battle systems so im pretty pleased
i do wish the menu were actually a bit more understandable though
the menu consists of little squares that have images on them and no words
its rather inconvenient that you cant see what any of the icons do without pressing and holding triangle
why cant we have a normal menu with words
thats my gripe with that
as for the rest of the battle system its pretty standard with attack defend magic special skills etc
not much to say theregameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
the gameplay for the most part is decent but there are a few little irritants here and there that couldve used smoothing out
first off the dash option is horrible
you just run forward with no control in a straight line until you either stop pressing the button or hit something
thankfully your walking speed is decently fast or otherwise the inability to run properly would drive you mad
speaking of controls ive noticed that there are points in the game where you need to angle your character diagonally such as to use a grappling hook and its very irritating trying to get the right angle due to imprecise controls
to make matters worse here theres no support for analog control so youre stuck with the arrowpad
moving on from that  the ingame map you get later is horrible
its absolutely tiny and doesnt show you the names of any of the dots on it leaving you to guess what towns those might be
also ive noticed that this game lets you have rather a lot of customization when it really shouldnt
for example you can recolor or redraw the menu icons
why
it wouldve been better to have menu options made of words
it also lets you rename spells and reorder them in the magic menu
youd think thisd be a good thing yes
no
its so irritating arranging a ton of spells into an order that even vaguely makes sense it wouldve been far more useful to have them automatically arranged according to type healing attack support etc
lastly i need to comment on the quests
it gets somewhat confusing at times about where to go next in the game as there are points in the story where youre really given no direction at all
especially after you get the boat you could wind up wandering around for ages before figuring out how to trigger the next story sequence
sigh well overall the game is not terrible but it does have lots of little minor irritants that hold it back a bit and keep it from feeling like a totally polished experienceoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
well wild arms is a pretty decent game overall
its certainly got a very nostalgic older feel to it especially for those who grew up right around the time of rpgs in the s
id recommend it if you are an rpg fan or are looking for something to pass the time with while you wait for square enix to make a new final fantasy thats actually good againive been gaming since the nes days and the ps was out during my high schoolcollege years
due to my nintendo loyalty and lack of funds i only owned one system at a time nes snes n so missed out on the whole ps game collection until later in the ps cycle
i love rpgs since the nes days and wild arms is a solid fun rpg that all rpg fans should at least try out
this may not be the cup of tea for new gamersrpg fans as it is turn based a fairly linear story and is opposite the open world and freedom of todays rpgs
everything about the game outside the graphics which were average for their time is aboveaverage
nothing really stuck out such as in games as ffiv or ffvi but for some reason i really enjoyed it the music grew on me and it left a good taste in my mouth after i beat it
recommended for the rpg fana couple of years ago i picked up a copy of wild arms  and i really enjoyed the game despite hearing that it is the black sheep of the  wild arms games
i enjoyed the game so much that i was willing to track down a copy of the first wild arms game and give this one a shot too
once again i wasnt disappointed
this was one of the first rpgs on the playstation one and predates final fantasy vii
right then you should understand that the quality of graphics is naturally going to be much weaker but this is an rpg and graphics really should not matter
what matters is that the game is fun to play even years later
in many ways this game is more similar to the snes rpgs that preceeded the playstation rather than the games that followed but once again this game was a lot of fun to playthe story is the basic save the world plot but it has to grow into that story
we take three characters who have no connection to each other jack rudy cecilia
these three characters come together and get involved in a quest that with each step grows larger in scale and scope until it eventually builds into the save the world quest that we have come to know and love
for the most part the game feels like it is mission based
you have to go someplace fight and return and find out where the next place you have to go and fight is
i know this is essentially any rpg or video game for that matter but it just feels more like a mission based story than unraveling the story as you progress through the gamethere is a strong puzzle solving element to this game though not as bad as the block puzzles from wa but it was used effectively in wild arms
the story was fairly interesting and the minor characters were fun to see pop up from time to time
by the end of the game things started to get a little absurd but this is a fun little game and it should not be overlooked due to age or graphical deficienciesi love this game
its simple and easy to play
there arent multiple dimensions or options so it keeps things nice and easy
the directional references are easy to follow but not red light obvious
i liked the battles nicely patterned but not boring
the story line is just lie every other story line group develops each has issues to overcome so they can save the world from what man has done to it
they face a monsteralien enemy
there are plenty of dimensional shifts and an android thrown in for fun
overall this isnt the worlds hardest rpg but its fun and thats what gamings all aboutnot as good as secret of mana but it is quite fun to play
a bit difficult for my liking so ive never completed the gamethe best thing in this game is the man in the market he is always so funnyi was a huge fan of ninja gaiden  back in the dayin fact one of my most lasting impressions in video game history was rescuing irene lew from the tower of lajaso this should be perfect for some retrogaming quality rightwellnot quitefor one the music has been enhanced as the box saysto be honest i think it sounds pretty terribletecmo has replaced the flutes with horns and it just doesnt sound that good in ninja gaiden also in one of the last scenes where jaquio has been killed and his blood flows toward the sword of chaosthere was some major editingin the original his blood was redin the remake it is now greenthat really takes away from the effect in my opinionthere is  also no end credit roll for ninja gaiden which means we dont get to hear that cool theme as all the various cinemas play outhuge disapointment
i will agree that the password system makes it easier to a degreeon ninja gaiden  howeverthe last password you get still puts you two levels behind the last bossi think the same holds true for ninja gaiden all and alla great attemptbut i would rather play ninja gaiden  which is my favorite of the series anyway on my top loader nestecmoif it aint broke dont fix it
original ireneryu music plays in the backgroundi knew what i was getting before i bought this but does the game really push the snes to its limits
i mean damn you only get like one worshipper when you fight  cant they add a little morethis game is great not the best looking of entertaining game ever but it is hard and very cool playing two player
the game could use more fighters
other then that the game is a very different fighter and if you are into those games this one is great for any collectioni own the original for nes but this one for the snes is really fun great pricing fast shipping no problems during game play cant beat it thanksbattletoads in battlemaniacs was an extremely difficult game ex the cool boarders level the snake board and the rocket rollercoaster level
seriously when i first started this game a couple of parts were nearly impossible
what made it worse was that there was nothing you could do about it besides get better and lets face it that should be the payoff from playing most video games righti will admit that once you got good at the difficult parts usually after the bikes because it felt like it was impossible you got really good at the rest of the game
there were still parts here and there but other than that you could dealyou play as either the much quicker rash or the brutally strong pimple
eitheror battletoads will challenge you in a lot of different ways from playing the levels to defeating enemies to thinking of your strategy for this gamethe bad thing about this game is that it requires way too many hours considering that it doesnt have that many levels and its just a fightingactionadventure
i played this game for at least  weeks before i finally got the hang of itif youre looking for a challenge than this is it for you
if all you need is a good quotwhoopingquot fixx than this is unfortunately not for you on the basis that you have to dedicate a lot of game time to it
if you need a good fighting fixx than i would suggest any other great fighting title that is on snes such as mortal kombat ii street fighter ii or street fighter alpha either is a great title
its still a good game but if you dont have the committment for it its not worth itwell i have had this game for a month and i can say i like it
the graphics and sound are good even to this day
the only down side is that it is very hard i have had it for a month and i am still stuck on level  but all in all this is a great game for retro gamers and battletoads fans i recommed iti dont really care for these type of fake animal lizard things moving and talking
but it is fun when u go back in time and play this old famous game
it is very fun on multiplayer because there is more people to beat the enemies
which there is a lot of
the graphics r better than most snes games but it is still not very good
the sound is good and the music is very catchy and good
the controls for this game can be hard to get used to
the thing i do not like about it is it is a very hard game and the story is weird
i mean lizards and pigs fighting each other
it is weird
but unstead of the weirdness and how hard it is it is a fun fighting gameone of the many memories of the bit console wars between sega genesis and super nintendo i had was comparing games that had come out on both systems
typically the snes version of the game was better
however there were a few rare occasions where a sega genesis version of a game was superior
in this instance i remember being very pleasantly surprised because both systems got very different games and the sega genesis version was clearly much better and more funthe plot of the game is pretty simple
beavis and butthead find out their favorite band gwar is coming to play in their town soon so they purchase a pair of tickets
the tickets get eaten by the neighbors dog who then pukes them into a lawnmower
the wind sweeps away the ticket pieces
rather than go out and buy more tickets i assume they couldnt afford another pair beavis and butthead embark on a quest to find the ticket pieces
and so our game beginsfirst off the style of this game is quite enjoyable
beavis and butthead are both playable characters
two players can lead beavis and butthead or one player can control either beavis or butthead while allowing the computer to control the other character
you can switch at any time and only the character you are playing as will take damage
in short the computer will not get you killed which is a giant reliefbeavis and butthead start off without items or weapons
beavis will belch a noxious green gas to attack enemies while butthead relies on a slower fart move
right off the bat beavis is the preferrable character
you pick up items and try to figure out the use of each item as you explore highland hig school the mall burger world the drivein the hospital the street and ultimately the gwar concert
you choose which area you want to visit and each area can be visited multiple times
the whole point is to pick up items and figure out where and how to use them ultimately to find the ticket pieces
this is quite a fun inventory game that almost reminds me of the old sierranevada games like space quest or kings quest
for example at burgerworld find a dead rat by the dumpster go inside to where the deep fat fryer is drop the french fries and the dead rat in the fryer to make a disgusting deadrat fries meal and then serve it to the angry customer
he will pay you and then eat the fries dead rat and all and then puke
in his puke is a ticket pieceyou will find other neat things such as different weapons
a straw can be used as a spitball shooter and there are also toy dart guns which you can use
if you have the spare cash you can purchase a frogball bat for butthead to have as a weapon
one of the tougher situations to manage in the game is money management
there are only a few items in the game you can actually sell and you will not get much money
the drivein requires you pay  admission so be sure you have what you need before you seriously attempt this part of the game otherwise you risk wasting your money and one chance to get the ticket piece for that area
this should also dissuade gamers from jumping the gun and spending the money unwisely too earlymost noteable about the game is the couchfishing part of the game
once you have the fishing pole you will be able to use certain items as bait for couchfishing
i will go ahead and spoil this much never use the boot as bait or you will die
plain and simple
the rest is for you to discover
this game can seem pretty tough at times because of getting stuck on a certain situation just think things through in a beavis and butthead mentality and you may be surprised by the solution
also there are a couple hints hidden in the game most noteably mr van dreissans classroomtheres alot to like about this game
the music is actually really good for a sega genesis game and the sound effects are also good
beavis and butthead sound great and the only audible flaw is the overuse of the stock soundbite grunt that is applied to all the enemies when taking damage
the game looks very good and represents mike judges cartoon very welltheres even a very cool hidden ending
if you got the extra items in the game you can use them after gaining admission past the gate at the gwar show to be a slave during the gwar show
very coolthe game has some funny hidden jokes and some of the manners in which you acquire the gwar tickets are hilarious
a little practice and patience are required during some of the tougher areas such as the street or the chase at the hospital but other than that the toughest part of the game is figuring out what you have to do to acquire the ticket pieces
figuring out what to do is half the fun thoughthe only complaint i have about the game is in regards to couch fishing
you are going to seriously blister your fingers trying to reel in your catch unless you have a turbo controller
other than that this is a very overlooked installment in the genesis library
even beavis wouldnt be able to say this sucksi know they came out with one or  based on mike judges animation its obviously not that difficult but not all games have to be difficult to wanna own and to enjoy
it a classic to add to the restthis game is fun and all but it hard
its funny to hear beavis and butthead laugh almost the whole time in the game and the concept of the game is fun
but this is a game only for beavis and butthead fansbeavis and butthead was fair
not even ok
because the game itself was way too easy and i thought that it was going to be funny and it really wasnt
sure i laughed a few times but when it all came down to it the  dumbest teens in the world were about as funny as a rockthat and this game was way too easy
there was no true challenge with the exception of the hospital board but other than that very simple game and for a lot of the more advanced gamers this wasnt even a walk in the park
it was more like taking a nap on a sunday afternoonthe last thing that bothered me about this game is that the ending was better if you lost on the last board the gwar concert because if you lost it was more like the real beavis and butthead
you know a couple of morons who lost their objectivethis is a renter first
its entertaining while it lasts but unfortunately the feeling doesnt last very longbesides my gaming integrity being slightly scarred by near impossible obstacles and i use the word near really loosely i do have to admit that this game is awesome
if you really enjoyed games like ys zelda andor landstalker youll especially dig alundranever have i been so tested and challenged since the old genesis adventure title landstalker
and climax has made alundra twice as hard twice as challenging and twice as good as its landstalker counterpart
play the part of alundra a young boy who possesses the power to venture through peoples dreams
hes like one of those dream warrior chaps from nightmare on elm street but instead of fighting freddy krueger alundra instead faces difficult mazes challenging puzzles and nasty monsters
maybe not the best analogy but you get the picture
not only does this game possess a really cool story but it also has some great music and graphics that totally suit the game like wild arms
sure its no final fantasy vii but alundra has that classic more traditional rpg feel that has literally faded away since the introduction of polygonal graphics
im not saying that evolution is bad but i honestly miss these types of gamesthe game may look outdated but alundra does in fact possess a level of gameplay that doesnt appear much in todays roleplaying games
i mean am i the only one whos tired of turnbased rpg titles
alundra shares the same gameplay elements found in the classic nes version of zelda a link to the past and like i mentioned before landstalker
staged in a pseudod environment alundra builds on the basic fundamentals of those old console adventure titles and simply makes them better
with improved character animation better level design and more puzzles climax has turned this fizzled genre into a game that most if not all rpg fans will enjoy
because of alundra i now own three busted controllers and have two holes in my wall  im kidding
however i will warn you that there are some levels in alundra that were so dang difficult i literally broke down and cried
and get this  when you die may it be by the hand of a skeleton or a slight miscalculation of a jump you have to start all the way back at the last save point
when this happens and you can bet it will you can do one of two things
you can either give climax the middle finger or a thumbs up for making the game challenging
hey i gave them a thumbs up most of the time
besides my gaming integrity being slightly scarred by near impossible obstacles and i use the word quotnearquot really loosely i do have to admit that this game is awesome
if you really enjoyed games like ys zelda andor landstalker youll especially dig alundraif only they kept this form when they had ms pac man as part of other games for the nextgen systems
this is great
i guess some people are nostalgic for the shadless oldschool arcade style of gameplay but i think this is perfect
i mean the graphics have more depth meaning the colors are more attractive and you knowturok rage wars is not perfect by any means but it has enough content with its interesting singleplayer and good multiplayer that unfortunately feels a little incomplete
but its a good oldfashioned splitscreen multiplayer game that will keep you entertained even in todays world of xbox live or playstation networkwhat the game is your basic game of fragfest you run around arenas and shoot dinosaurs or challenge one of your friends to a game of fragfest singleplayer also plays a role in this game but it feels shallow and a bit unimaginativegraphics there are better looking games on the n though it has the blocky look of many games from the timemusic theres none
it would have been nice to have some rock music play as i blast away at my opponentssound shooting and dying screams as you or your opponents diegameplay controls could use some finetuning
the fragfesting will keep you entertained for quite some time but i wish the multiplayer was a bit more like the n classic conkers bad fur day which has some of the most kickass multiplayer modes like war
there are a number of guns to choose from but you better keep your ammo in check because if you run out all you get is the war hammer which is really lameass
luckily this really isnt an issue considering there are so many ammo containers laying around the arenas
you will easily get into blasting away at your enemies and win it alloverall this game will keep you busy with a friend for a few hours but it can never beat conker when it comes to multiplayer or quake iii arena so its basically a poor mans version of these games due to its undercooked and shallow areas of gameplay there could have been so much more put into it but the game just settles for being good and not spectacular
it wont kill you to invest in the game though it will do just fine in your n librarythe good good fragfesting gameplay interesting arenas good multiplayer a decent singleplayer modethe bad its a poor mans conker or quake iii no music not enough modeswell this can be a very chaotic game
the creature noises are very entertaining the weapons are pretty good the graphics are really cool there are a lot of boards etc
the reason i gave this game a  is because the firstperson character movement is odd
you have to manuever the yellow buttons while youre steering otherwise your character will just look around which can be cool but it can also be hard on my hands after a whileunlike the other turoks this game is mainly focused on multiplayer
dont have anyone to play with
thats fine you can duel bots on any of the maps
its nice to have a multiplayer in which i can play bots because i have no other person to play with
its definitely a blast though
tons of futuristic guns and maps to play
its not quite as good as the quake games but there is still plenty of fun to be hadthere is a steep learning curve with this device and it takes some getting used to
when i first tried it on quake ii i got spanked by guys who only use the keyboard thats rigth only the keyboard no mouse
however now i am always in the top  or  with my lan buddies when they use a mouse and do very well over the internet usually being in the top  in quake ii and top  in halflife counterstrikei found my siderwinderdual strike at a local biglots for 
it was and still is the best damn controller ive ever had
though i do have a gripe about the hatswitch
i not only used my ds to play driving games like need for speed and knight rider but i also used it for my snes and game boy advance emulation
i configured the hat to be my dpad this worked for a while and i was happy until the switch broke offnow it has a screw in it and the up direction doesnt work anymore
i still use the controller but only to play racing games and quake
my suggestion to sidewinder would be to make a different version of this gaming tool but with an nes crosstype directional pad instead of the hard plastic hat
aside from that one defect this controller kicks the crap out of any gamepad or wheel that ive ever usedyou can map any button to any key
you can use the swivel as your mouse which is very useful in first person shooters
you can also use the shift key which can allow you to have two different functions for one button
being able to map buttons to keys is great for zsnes or any game that will let you choose which key does whatmaybe if we sent enough emails to the microsoft people they would remake this awesome controlleri think this is a good invention but it does have one flaw to it
it causes a glare on the screen of the game boy so you cant see where you are or whos coming at you
other than that this is a pretty handy light for playing in your room when youre supposed to be asleepusing a nyko worm light is a very good way to get light on your screen
although it blocks the screen its still very useful
its even a very preety color bluethis is a must for any gameri had read all of the reviews saying that myst is a great game and everyone should play it but i just thought these were some gamers who still had nostalgia from back when they first played games
i was wrong
the fact that myst is such a great game  years later just shows how great a game it is
i played this game on windows xp so somehow the other reviewers that said it isnt compatible on there are wrong
also the only difference from myst masterpiece and myst is that the choppy gameplay is better
id recommend this version as it also comes with an ingame hint systemstoryyou dont really know the story
i started the game and i found myself facing a picture thinkingthats it
no intro
just start to explore and the story unfolds itselfgraphicsouch
this is the reason i took off a star
compared to the graphics of this day and age these are just painful to look at
they look more like oil paintings than they do graphics
there are  characters to talk to in this game and they are real people that the creators put as actors into the game
they look fuzzy and out of place in backgroundsoundmusic only plays at certain points in the game but when it does it well suits the atmosphere
the voice acting is good and the sound effects are nice as wellgameplaythis is a first person pointandclick adventure
your cursor is a hand and if you click to the right you can turn right or sometimes clicking to the right turns you around
same with the left
the puzzles in this game were rather hard but i found that most of them were solvable
whenever you get stuck however there is a hint system that gives you hints that can increase in magnitude until they just give you the answer
for instance asking for a hint just gives you a tiny hint that doesnt necessarily tell you what to do but it points you in the right direction
then if you are still stuck you can get a stronger hint which tells you basically where to go and look
and so on
i used the hint system several times and i would have been quite stuck without it
i thought that this gameplay was easy enough to understandfunthis game is a blast
the story once you start to figure out what it is is fun
i just thought it was a really fun gamelengthit took me  days to finish
there are  different ending though so you might want to play the game over or rather just save near the end to see them all
only one of them is a good ending thoughoverall this game has stood the test of time as it is still a fabulous buy
definitely get it for  or less and if it doesnt work on your computer find out why because you need to fix the problem and play this game
on a final note this game really hints at a sequel so i now am going to have to get the sequel because while the game ends there is something left to do that you must do in the next game riven
anyway get this gamei recently bought this game when i got my new home computer
it was recommended to me by friends who thought this would be a great game to start out withaloneon myst island you must discover the locationn of quotlinking booksquot
these linking books transport you to other quotagesquot where you are in search of red and blue pages
the pages must be returned to their books in the island library each time you do this you learn more and more of the storyartius has entrapped his two sons inside the books where they cannot escape
his sons had betrayed him and artius himself is nowhere to be found
the search for the pages is the main point of the game and the puzzles vary in difficulty
a nice feature was the quothelpquot options which gave you hints on solving things or the out right solution if you were stucklike all good stories this ended with a plea for you to be available to help artius locate his wife catherineand now for the sequelall in all i enjoyed this game and its puzzles
it was a point and click mouse game but the puzzles and the storyline were the best partsi originally picked this game up when it first came out
i remember how many people raved about its originality and its amazing game play
compared to other games ive played in that era i definitely have to agree that it was very original
i mustve been about eleven or twelve when it was first released
i will admit that while playing this game as a kid i couldnt figure anything out and i played it for many hours scratching my head trying to figure it out
eventually i got to the point where i gave up and had to use the walkthrough guide
this game was really quite enthralling with very interesting and complex worlds regardless of my first experiencei recently replayed the game and even over a decade later i still have the same thoughts
however some of the games limitations became much more apparent to me
basically youre thrust into a world and have to use the discovery method to figure things out
you go around click a few switches here turn a tower there very elementary and obvious stuff right
not really but i will say that i think i was playing the game at the wrong age
i think i was a bit too young to see the obviousness of the puzzles
what took me months to work out at age eleven took me a few minutes at my current age
i was seriously able to blow through this game in a few hours and this was actually the first time ive played since the last time that many years ago
i remember a few of the basic things but i couldnt remember much of anything about the other worlds you link tothe general story premise is that you somehow end up on myst island presumably you linked there from some other book on your home plane of existence and you teleported to this one
anyway you find the island uninhabited but its obvious that people were once here
theres a little building with a library in it but most of the books are burnt
clearly something is amiss
there are two other books on pedestals to the right and left when you open them you find people trapped inside
i would later learn these are called prison ages
both prisoners naturally want to be released and ask you to help them
the object of the game is to find all the missing pages of their books so you can release them
the basic setup of the world is that the books are more than just books they are gateways to other worlds
the worlds in the myst universe are called ages and you get back to your original location by using a linking book
its actually a really creative concept
the world is vastly different and they actually used live actors for the scenes in the game
you have to realize that this was practically revolutionary when it was first coming out
it wasnt the same kind of live actor design mortal kombat was using they were actually having people act in a blue screen environment then transporting them into the myst worldmyst was really a ground breaking game when it was first released
its partially a puzzle game and part mystery
the way people could interact with small portions of the environment and see their effects was really interesting as well
basically you have to find out why the two brothers are so accusatory of each other and why they were imprisoned
you find out more as you find more pages on different ages which is where the puzzle part comes in
you get clues on myst island in order to find ways to get access to the other ages
then once youre on that age you have to figure out how to get backits actually a really fun game except for the fact that after you solve an island you can only bring a page back with you
but then you have to do that a second time if you want to bring the other page back
now its not nearly that bad all your solutions are still done and its much quicker to run through the age the second time but its the fact you have to do it a second time
for example if i find the blue page on the other age and then i find the red page i cant carry them both back with me
thats kind of annoying that you cant carry two you really see the games limitation at this point
so i bring the blue page back and listen to that guys new message then i have to go back to the age and get the red page then come back and listen to his message
you have to do this every time and thats what lost a star for this game
its rather inconvenientoverall this is one of the more creative games developed in recent times
the story line is vibrant and it has a shock ending that you dont really guess until you get there
there are actually three different possible endings for this which is pretty cool
so save your game before youre about to beat it then you can reload it and watch another separate onenot too many games make you think
this game had me taking notes
as a general rule i dont take notes for anything
thats how interested as i was
considering the age of this game it looks just as modern today as it did when it first came outthis same game if created today would probably have complete moving video but this has still screens where you use the mouse to navigate from screen to screen
the game runs fine on my system though i have had some crashes during the treehouse level
outside of that ive never had compatibility or operating problemsthe game will take a while to get through but you wont mind because youll get sucked into it
time goes by pretty fast when you get into this game
ive lost quite a few hours in the wonderfully rendered worlds of mysti was impressed enough with this game to buy the sequel riven on dvd
im more likely than not going to pick up myst iii exile as wellwhile this game is not for people with a short attention span those who enjoy a good strategy based game would do themselves well to get into mystokay lets cut the hype
this aint halflife
comparing this game to halflife is ludicrous
if this game is hamburger then halflife is fillet mignonthat said it is an utterly fun game to play
aside from  the gorepoint system there really isnt much innovation in the game but  what it does do  which is to provide a fun diversion where you blow the  living  out of enemies  it does really welland dont get suckered  into believing that this is a realistic shooter like rouge spear or swat   it isnt
sure your enemies can get killed by a well placed bullet to  the head but you personally walk around as through you were wearing an  invisible tank
and thats just fine because realism isnt what this game  is about
this game is about being some sort of latterday rambo
on that  level it delivers in spadesand yes the game is intended for mature  audiences
and mature as always means having the sort of  quotmaturityquot where you smirk everytime you take some poor animated  saps leg off at the hip
in otherwords its a game for the demented  teenager that resides in at least some of usso yeah but it play it  have fun
it aint fillet mignon but sometimes youre just in the mood  for some quick and cheap junk foodi dont know why everyone claims this game is gory  its not much  different than any other shooter
basically this game is what youd expect   its a newer shooter than some so it took all the best parts of those  and added a few nicer things
nothing radically different  its just a  nice incrementally better shooterit is unfortunate that a lot of the hype surrounding this game is all about the level of violence
behind that shock value is a solid and highly entertaining game
you are put into the shoes or combat boots of a  mercenary and sent to various regions around the globe to track down   stolen nuclear warheadsthe game mechanics are in the usual raven  style very well thought out and implemented
before each mission you are  given a chance to load up on weapons and supplies
this isnt typical  firstperson shooter fare where you can haul around an entire arsenal you  must choose a few weapons and supplies based on a limited number of slots
in mission you are allowed to drop weapons to pick up different ones a  very nice touch indeedthe graphics look exceptional for being built on  an aging engine
the environments are very well done and are varied enough  between mission to break any monotony
the levels are designed to keep you  on track with the action
probably the most impressive part is the  character animation and hit detection
the models move extremely smoothly  and react to location based damage
shoot someone in the shoulder and they  are thrown back in that direction
shoot someone in the leg and they hop  around point blank in the facewell
although it is very extreme it  adds a lot to the war is hell gritty feeling
raven has even gone as far  as to include various violence lockdowns with passwords or you can just  opt to not install any of the violent featuresmultiplayer includes the  standard deathmatch in addition to a couple of excellent alternatives
there is a realistic deathmatch where oneshot kills are prolific and  fatigue play a factor
there is also arsenal and assasinall in all  this is a great game
while it blends some realism in it is still an  action game in its heart
the story is interesting design well thought  out and the graphics are sweet
you wont regret picking this one upsoldier of fortune is a smart graphically good looking and easy to get into game but doesnt quite come up to the masterpiece that is half life
its not as smooth and the levels are too short to get completely involved  in the atmosphere of a particular locationits more like the old  quotoperation wolfquot arcade came but in first person
the most  enjoyable part is being able to use the sniper rifle to dispatch baddies  from a distance is great funthe best part of the game is the variety in  the locations
you start off in new york move onto a train traversing  russia at night end up in kosovo
theres a consistent plot between each  scene toosmall downside on the speed of your machine
having the video  card is okay but the khz bit sound can be really jerky on a slower  machine celeron a with just a normal sound card
which is a shame  because the dynamic music really adds to the atmospherethe violence  isnt that bad reallyas of now this is possibly the most realistic d shooter ive ever played
no kids allowed here
theres a walmart censored version but its not as fun  the graphics are excellent and everything could have  happened
your objective is to destroy  nukes that were stolen
no  aliens zombies plasma guns or super death rays are in here
the weapons  are even modeled after reallife ones for crying out loud
of course the  funniest thing is the quotgorezonesquot  depending on where you shoot  a guy a gun shot or a knife mark will appear there
blowing off half of a  guys head with a shotgun can be the untimate stress reliever
sure its  more violent that even kingpin but in sof an fword isnt inserted  casually into every conversation
however sof is not perfect
the ai can  be quite stupid at times with people running in circles or ignoring you  entirely
plus in the later winter stages there is a fog which can get  really annoying when the ai can see you but you cant see them
other  than those problems i think sof is an otherwise flawless gamethis game has just about everything a firstpersonshooter enthusiast would want
it has well designed levels great graphics good sound and realistic weapons
the gorezones add another cool element albeit a grisly  one
the only thing that soldier of fortune lacks is decent ai which can  be downright stupid at times
also to get the most out of the single  player experience you should use the custom difficulty setting and make it  as hard as you dare
this is because on the medium difficulty setting it  is very very easy which might leave you feeling a little rippedoff
other than these minor flaws this game comes highly recommended  especially if you like your shooters goryi love this game
its really fun
its completely different every round capturing better pokemon pictures and experimenting with pokeflutes pokefood and pester balls and seeing the reaction to different pokemon
but ill say it again not worth purchasing
i rented it and the price was worth it
the price is not worth this game that gets old within a week
you already know all the secrets you have a gazillion pictures of pokemon you may of even printed them on stickers i mean your through
its a real fun game and i love it but its not worth more than priceto keepi know nothing about pokemon however i have learned with this game and i had some fun while doing it
this is the first game to bring the pokemon to life in their true d habitat as you ride in a little car taking pictures of the pokemon
there are only six levels each with about  or  pokemon in each
the pokemon each have their little powers and when they get together they fight or do little dances
the game moves a little slow because you are stuck in a car that is moving along a track but there are items you get later in the game to speed up the car and to help you get better pictures like sneeze balls apples to feed them a flute
parents should even play this game to learn the pokemon names and habits to better understand their childrens interests
this would be a five star game however there were only about  pokemon and not all of the original i would have say this game was a little fun but there are some cons
frist the game is so easy ive rented it and got though it in a day
the pros
the graphics are good and so is the gameplay
please rent itthis is a classic
its a pretty easy game and does not take a lot of your time but is very enjoyable if you love pokemon
of course its very nostalgic for me so i am biasedalthough i miss traveling and battling i really did enjoye this game
plus i like how this game was geared more for adults and teens who dont  like pokemon insteed of for kids who like pokemon who might get bored of  this game very easiely
plus its good clean no violence and very fun  and challenging
i highly recomend this game to everyone who dont like  pokemon and arent under love pokemon
definitely a great purchase
i missed playing this game when i was younger and looked forward to playing it againyou take pictures of pokemon throw apples throw pester balls and play a pokeflutethere arent as many pokemon as there should be
out of the first  pokemon you can only take pictures of sixtysomething pokemon
but still its awesome
you get laughs from the different ways you take pictures or get a pokemons attentionall in all i just wish the game had more to it because i was able to finish the game in just a few hours
i love ityou got the game
you got the camera you got the film
now to complete this game you have to snap at least  pokemon for your report
professor oak must see it first before putting it in your report
if you do not like oaks results you can keep your pictures in your photo album
away from professor oaklife span average of  to  months before getting boreddurability can last a lifetimeendurance basically only one player mode availableoverall this is a  star game cuz no multi player and only  pokemon
i really like my mew picturethis game is a very welldone cross themed game
it is a shooter at heart but it has many elements of strategy puzzle and adventure games
as twins gemini juno and vela and their dog lupus you are the last of the once mighty jet force a kind of intergalactic police you must stop an alien infestation against a peaceful species the tribals
the terrorist mizar a giant robotic bug has created an enormous army of bugs to send at you and if youre not careful youll be exterminated
these soldiers are smarter than the average bug mind you
they snipe duck execute hostages and even surrender
but you have your own tools to rid the world of these pesky insects including a pistol a machine gun a rocket launcher and a homing missile launcher
the story is pretty good for a shooter and it includes a number of puzzles to solve
the three character system is pretty cool because each character has different abilities so you must explore each world with everyone to find everything
this is no easy task because the worlds are huge
this game will keep you entertained for a long long time because even after you finish the story you still have the great multiplayer mode to tackledeveloper rare in its heyday was like the steven spielberg or martin scorsese of the game industry  they always put out a high quality title for the public
theyve put out great games like goldeneye conkers bad fur day the banjokazooie games blast corps perfect dark and others
even their disappointments were disappointing only in comparison to rares own work otherwise the game was still high quality
jet force gemini is among the disappointing titles
it has the graphical quality of a rare title and is fun to play but it lacks immersionin rare fashion jfg is not particularly innovative but it mixes and matches so many genres it feels unique
the game is a third person shooter that allows you to switch between three different characters each with unique abilities
in order to reach certain areas in a level requires using a certain character which means each level has high replayability
unfortunately other than the one unique ability the characters are exactly the same
it would have been nice to differentiate them in other ways such as weapon types they can use
instead every character has the chance to unlock the exact same weapons
the guns themselves arent anything spectacular either
a pistol machine gun grenades flamethrower sniper rifle mines and other weapons youve already used in other shooters
with such a neat fantasy world rare could have at least thought up some original weapons to use
some of the more unique weapons include a plasma shotgun shurikens and fish food but these are still hardly originalunsurprisingly the game is a platformer as well as a shooter
as in most platformers the camera can be an issue since it is always directly behind you and cant be moved manually to get a better look at jumps
but platfomers are generally more than just games that have you jump from platform to platform
they also involve exploring and collecting which is my favorite part of the game
you can explore each level to find tribals weapon upgrades to increase maximum ammo multiplayer features and more
its always a reward to find that ammo increase or that last tribal though the latter is a pain to search for
i found the shooter elements less enjoyable than the exploration but both are very well donein all this is a fun game and i would recommend it
it is among rares most unique games though its quality doesnt quite raise it amongst the echelon of their best
in fact on the nintendo  its on the low end of the scale for them
still rare had an amazing run on the n creating their best games and making the console among my favorites
unfortunately rares quality began to go down once the gamecube came out with a subpar outing in star fox adventures and a switch to the xbox that included the underwhelming grabbed by the ghoulies the decently fun kameo elements of power and an inferior version of conker
though jet force gemini is a disappointment in its own way it serves as a reminder that once upon a time rares disappointments were still very enjoyable gamesanyone who stuck by nintendo during the late s knows that waiting for quality games tested your patience
thank goodness rare was there to fill in the void when it was needed
already establishing themselves as a reputable nd party developer with hit titles such as goldeneye  diddy kong racing and banjo kazooie rare brings out jet force gemini in  its another classic title from rare worth playing even though it has flaws that somewhat compromises the overall experienceyou play as one of three characters out to defend their galaxy from an evil tyrant who wants to take over and bring misery to every one
some of their allies the tribals ewoklooking bears need their help especially and this is where you come in
you start out as juno and must rescue his twin sister vela and their dog lupus in order to play as them later on
each character has access to a bunch of weapons and upgrades while they have their own unique ability to access areas others cant
along the way you collect parts in order to reassemble floyd their trusty robot who has his own side missions in the game
you have a long long way as you travel through multiple planets before you face off with the big bad boss of the game
playing through the main story mode will prove worthwhile because its the only way to unlock extra content present in the multiplayer modes so grab some friends and play the multiplayer modes with enough options to rival first person shooters at the timethe pros jet force gemini looks and sounds great thanks to the guys at rare
without even needing the expansion pack this game brings graphics music and sound effects that pleases the player
you wont be blowing through this game so quickly because it packs quite a fight
its also a big game so expect to spend many hours finding all the weapons and upgrades for all three playable characters while finding objects that unlock additional content
there are even side missions to try out that hold surprises for the player
you can save anytime and the game provides numerous slots for you or you can opt to save your progress on a memory pack
want to feel the effects of your actions
connect a rumble pack for force feedback that is decently done
the multiplayer modes are fun so its worth trying it out with your friendsthe cons even though jet force gemini is a fun game there are two areas in which it stumbles on
first off lets talk about the controls
it takes getting used to for awhile for the simple fact that there is no lock on to aim at your enemies
you have auto aim for all the enemies on the ground but you must manual aim for those who are hiding in trees and fly around you
to switch from auto aim to manual aim is always a chore
you cannot tweak the controller settings so either you grin and bear it or watch someone else play this game
second the camera is just awful
unlike other games that let you steer it so it lines up with your vision jfg does no such thing
the camera wont turn to the left or right so youll have to hit the manual aim button to straighten the camera
you can strafe around your enemies while you shoot them but be prepared to take enemy fire outside your line of vision
one more thingif you were never a fan of backtracking through areas you went through already to get to areas that werent accessible the first time around then this will annoy you as you will do that a lot with each characterthough it has flaws that dampen the gaming experience they arent deal breakers as the good qualities of jet force gemini outweigh the flaws
its a great single player game and a pretty good multiplayer game for anyone and their friends to enjoy
this game sold well so if you can find this game cheap give it a try and see what players from  were experiencing at the time
thank you raredont get me wrongthis is a great game
blasting insects is always fun especially with great graphics sound and control and the fact that the insects splatter hilariously silly blood when you blast them with a trirocket launcher
its even better once you get rainbow blood
but if you dont have a guide like me this game will be very frustrating
apart from that the multiplayer mode is a blast but i wish there were more creative weapons and fewer locked features
great game otherwise especially if you have the guiderated t for cartoonish shootemup violence and insect blood
no real surprises about this ratinganother great game for the n
very addiciting and fun to play
a must have in my collectionits always nice when video game developers strive to push the limits of a systems hardware and top their previous efforts
rareware has been especially wellknown for doing this and the company really went all out for s jet force gemini
though it was overshadowed by donkey kong  jet force gemini is not just a solid game but also a vast vast epic  and maybe just a bit too ambitiousjfg is a homage to the simple classic video games of the past where players went around blasting enemies left and right
juno vela and their dog lupus are part of an interglatic peacekeeping force and must save an alien bearlike race think ewoks but even cuter from an insect invasion led by the evil mizar
at their disposal are pistols machine guns rocket launchers grenades and even fish food
the level designs are varied including forests ships mines volcanos temples and more
while the graphics are occasionally stretched and ugly the environments are huge
everyone is nicely animated and enemy intelligence is high  they duck evade attack in force or run when outnumbered and even try to kill hostages before you can save them
the games music also rocks from the heroic opening theme to the more subtle atmospheric
you know the music is good when rareware has released almost every single cue on their website
there is a nifty coop mode which lets one player control the action while the other follows them around as an extra set of weapons
throw in a decent multiplayer mode and lots of surprises and jfg is a quest worth blocking out your calendar forso what makes jfg overly ambitious in my opinion
as with almost all of rares games a lot of backtracking is required to completely finish the game
in this case your three characters can visit different areas of the same world and you must resuce every last hostage to get to the rematch with the final boss
what makes this tedious is that the game only saves your highest score
for example a level has  hostages to rescue
you rescue  only the last one is killed
this means you must go through the level and collect the all the hostages again
this can get seriously frustrating and i keep wondering why rare chose to extend the game this way
indeed id say over  of this game involves saving the bearlike tribals
and unlike other games like zelda and donkey kong where you get a minireward every so often nothing happens in jfg until the last tribal is collectedjfg pushes the n hardware like a good video game should
there are lots of elements here that make this game a highly recommended purchase but i wish rare had packed in more levels instead of extending the quest unfairly with tedious collecting
like war and peace youre entitled to serious bragging rights for completing this onebought this game years ago and played it but being younger i got stuck in certain areas and eventually put this game down
i sold it and then years later through amazon bought this game back
the mechanics are good for its time
the graphics are good and i suggest you get an svideo cable if you have an hdtv
the storyline was interesting saving the little tribals from giant insects
difficulty is still up there so take your time with it and enjoyi bought this game and it only took two days to come which is great
anyway after playing it reminded me of a game that looked like it originated from this game
conkers bad fur day
i played through the game and i finally seen how long it is
super long
it can also be challenging at times
this game is playable in coop if you find this robot named floyd and search for his missing components and they are nearby
the multiplayer is fun and has many unlockables
my few problems were that when you delete the previous game files it wont delete the unlockable characters
aming can also be hard at times
the game may occur with slow downs sometimes but it rarely bothers me that much
i say the multiplayer unlockables  and easter eggs are the best about the game
there is much to do in the game
in multiplayer there arent any bots but if you wanna get together with friends and play the modes are really fun
the game is similar to conkers bad fur day modes but this game came first
there is racing thirdperson shooting and target practice all up to four players
you can unlock a lot more levels and characters for the game even though most of my characters were already unlocked
anyway i like to say this game can be really fun and boring at times
if you have time to spend with the singleplayer throughout your days and you love long games or just like unlockable features buy this game
it is a nice adventure
also it makes a great addon to a rarerarware collection if you are a fani have grown weary of the new genre games yes the graphics are superb in the xbox gcube and ps but the all round gameplay lacks in most of the recent games titlesi bought this by accident actually and i must say this is the best ever
i get the feeling sometimes when i am playing jetforce gemini that
n never really got the recognistion it deserved ps mauled n even though the graphics in the n was superior you must admitt that n have some of the greatest game titles everenough about n however
if you like long exciting action packed games with beautiful colours and graphics then jet force gemini  might be just what you are looking for so
dust off the old n and play this game even if its laterz folksexcellent stuff here
very good graphics simple interface and the lowest learning curve ive seen since diablo
remember those old commercials for the board game othello
quoteasy to learn hard to masterquot describes this to a t my only real problem with it is that the ai seems as if it could be a little more intuitive places you think your sims will walk dont and sometimes sims will stroll right by a nonoperational place without working there in a city with  unemployment
drives me up the wall but adapting yourself to the ai is rather like being a freeverse poet and writing sonnets eventually youll pick up the nuances
highly recommendedi bought pharoah first so when i played caesar i realized im just in a different country
dont misunderstand me both are really good games not too easy not too hardreviewed for big boss games by timyou start out as a boy named justin
he dreams of becoming an adventurer just like his dad
justin has a childhood friend and cousin named sue
sue has a great pet named puffy that justins dad found on one of his many adventures
as you start your adventures you will meet tons of funny and interesting people
like feena a fellow adventurer guido a wise if enigmatic bunny rabbit gadwin the masterful warrior milda an amazonian that likes using her body instead her head rapp a hot blooded young man with a bad attitude and a host of other cast members that make this game a joy to playthe story   this game starts out a bit slow till you are about  hours into the game
that is when this game starts to shine and keeps shining
you will laugh cry get upset and feel joy while playing this great gamethe battle system   this is your typical turn based battle system with a unique leveling system
you must use your attacks and magic over and over again because they gain experience with every use
then that leads to new spells and attacks
you must also change your partys weapons because each weapon type gains its own experiencegame play   the puzzles in this game were just hard enough to give you the feeling of accomplishment
i loved the mazes in this game because most of the dungeons had a degree camera control with a nice little compass to point you in the right direction
my advice is to use the compass if you get lost
you will get lost at some point this game has  hours of game playoverall   this game was a joy to play
it has its ups and downs like  hours into the game you want it to be over but the games story  keeps the plot twists coming and the game keeps you glued to your seat to find out what happens nextif you want a great game this is one of the best rpgs for the playstationps
dont forget to get the strategy guide for this gamegrandia primas official strategy guidegrandia is simply a gem
the cast of characters are a little predictable but definitely distinct and unique from one another
it is a decent port from the dreamcast but i have seen better level up systemyou level up just like any other rpg with experience points after each battle
however your weapon level up upon their usage
each character can use up to three different weapons
upon leveling up a weapon something is leveled up such as hp vitality strength ect
this is the same for magic
magic is first aquired by finding mana eggs and using them to buy magic
afterwards the more you use a certain magic fire water earth wind you level it up giving you more skills
this makes leveling up a lot more fun and even adds to the battles as you need to use certain magics to aquire new skillbattle systemthis is one of the best types of battle system
first of all it is a mixture of active time and turn base battle
every enemy shares the same active time bar
once a character reaches a certain point you have all the time you need to select your attack
not only that but certain attacks can affect the active time greatly sending the enemy or your characters backwards in the active time bar
oh
and did i mention there are no random battles
the enemies run around in the screen with you and you see them before you come in contact
once defeated they disappear
come close enough to them and they will chase you thoughcharactersthere are a few characters that join and leave the party
however there are two that stay throughout the entire game justin and feena
each character has their own history personality and special movies
this still does not make for good character development though
they are highly predictable
the voice acting and even dialog script is laughable
such phrases such as quot degrees
take thatquot and quotoh wind twist like a tornadoquot seems a little cheesy for me during battlegraphicsthe graphics are decent but theres nothing special about them
the world is in d and the camera can be rotatedstorythe story seems very cliche to me
a young adventurer named justin wants to find new quests for himself
hes a troublemaker and later finds himself on the journey of a lifetime
he meets up with many new people and eventually realizes only he with the help of his friends can save the world
it is not very unique or at all intriguing enough but many of the small side stories is what makes it interestingoverallthis is a great game
its fun and well worth your money
it claims to give over a hundred hours of gameplay but i beat it in  hours
though the character and stories are weak the gameplay is not
grandia ii is just as good and with the hopes of another grandia to follow things should only improveprosgreat system for leveling up magicskillsfun battle systemgood length for a gameconslaughable dialog and voice actingweaker story  cliche  cheesy at timesvery linearwow this game is great
i took off a star for some annoying voiceover and some annoying cloyingly emotional plotlines that have simply been done to death
at times the plot felt like it was written by an nineyear old who watches too many daytime soapsbut the magic
the combat
the ideas
the world of grandia is simply amazing to watch and participate in and the possibilities for a characters development are almost unlimited
i eagerly await the sequeleverything about it is good
the characters storyline gameplay audio sound fx all of them are excellent
the graphics are very good for a saturn port
if you want to play a nonsquare rpg give this a shoti was surprised that i actually had fun with this game because i usually hate kids games aside from retro nintendo classics over the hedge and the cars games
the storyline is about spyro and his dragon fly companion who want to go to the beach but instead get caught up in trying to stop an evil villain named ripto and have to retrieve fourteen talismans to stop ripto and save many worlds in the process
this game may revolve around killing stupid enemies finding items and collecting a lot of jewels but it never really feels repetitive mostly just fun and over the top because of your strange companions and enemies
the biggest problems with this game are the graphics controls and camera troubles which can get you killed during certain gameplay sequences
but while this may sound like a long list of complaints this game never really feels hampered by its flaws but rather fun that anyone can enjoy if they appreciate it enough
too bad the series seems to suck with critics these days ever since the time insomniac games and sony computer entertainment officially sold the rights of the series to vivendi aka
sierra
hey vivendi can you get a developer whos good at making games to make the next entry so the series doesnt suck anymore
because it really doesnt deserve it
this game will always be a fun platformer and while it may not compete with other platformers of its time like super mario  and tomb raider it does put up a good fight despite its agegraphics   fantastic effort in this area
there is hardly a fault to be found all the settings look fabulously wellplannedsound   good dragon sound effects and neat little sparkling sounds as you collect and find things
the little things matter and the big things boomvalue   i havent played this game much but after my friend let me have a turn i was really intrigued
spyro  because it has neat missions and cool effects is well worth the price you pay to buy or rent itoverall   i would like to play this game more
it is intriguing and not too hard but has the odd dose of complexity that gives it the intelligence and less cuteness than most of the fantasycreature gamesthis game is a great game
it has awesome worldsthe music is good
and it separates itself from the others
the only thing i dont like about it is that it doesnt really have a big story line
spyro the dragon you had to find crystal dragons around the worlds
in spyro year of the dragon you collected eggs
in this one all you really did is collected gems
but besides that its a good game
i do recommend itthank you i played the game and beat it not long ago
product worked good with a few imperfections in the skipping of character speech and that of music but i got to play the whole thing through
thanks again clutterducksi love this game
i played this one before the first one and its still a favorite
theres so much to do
swimming gliding mimigamessome of the minigames take some practice but they are all completable
some of them you even get to play as spyros new friends that he sets free
find codes to change spyros color
finding the baby dragon eggs all of them takes some time
or a strategy guide
which is also good
but they all have names and are so cute
the minigames are all so original
its hard to stop playing this game and there is never that point where it gets too hard to continue
too bad there are only  of thesegamesfor ps
this is the best series ever madethe original spyro trilogy is by far the gaming mark on my childhood and will always stay there
the first one is downright amazing and this one isnt short by much at all
the only reason i docked it a star was because it seems like it takes much less time to beat than the first spyro game which i can understand because its a childrens game first and foremost
regardless if youre a fan of retro gaming or a little bit of history play this and fulfill your desires it is well worth itthis game is kind of good but not as good as spyro year of the dragonbut still this game kicks of spyro the dragon from the shelvesits has better graphicsgood sound and cool bossprosgood graphics  starscool sound  starsnice music starsbetter boss then before  starsconsdont have any but the game is  shortas you can see that you migth want  rent the game first but if you already have spyro year of the dragon you migth want  skip this game  spyro enter the dragonflyok ill go on and tell you this is a very fun game
its a bit more challenging than the st because you have harder things to do to get orbs
sometimes you have to do something for someone while others you just have to find a hidden orb lieing around in the bushes
anyway this isnt as fun as the st as ive already said
its only diffrence are the sound spyro makes when he hops and the plot
heres a reviewgrapicssoundplotcontrol dpadanalogshould you buy itif youre a true fanafter recently getting twisted metal headon extra twisted edition i decided to go back and check out the older twisted metal games
in this case twisted metal  while i agree with the majority that  studios brought down the twisted metal series to some degree its saving grace was twisted metal 
 studios did try to rectify what they did wrong in twsted metal iii by making more hidden areas than in the previous games sharpening up the look of the game bringing new characters to the foldalthough some are downright forgettable and improving the control of the game
it is however still too easy to flip over in the gamewhich was downright annoying in tm iii or to miss a landing and whatnot
the soundtrack in the game is awesome with appearances by rob zombie cypress hill cirrus and skold
the createacar option is a good start but i agree with most that more variety in this area wouldve made a huge difference
in some respects this game was refreshing due to its new take on the series
it is a solid  fun gamealot more so than twisted metal iii
yet still is an easily forgettable game in the series
i can only recommend this as a rental at bestnot as good as twisted metal  or twisted metal black
did anyone notice the poster of a naked girl in the stage where you fight in the kids room and it has the hot wheel tracks
there is a poster on the wall somewhere of a nude girl
anyway good gameit is a bit harder for a firsttime gamer of gran turismo seriesbut gt is awesomeit has to be released in  discs because it has a lot to offer like more tracks more modes cars etclots of automobiles available but their features are different from each otheri think that driving in manual transmission is easier than driving in automatic mode i cannot control the car well
argh
im pretty lousy at racing games but i love this onethe sounds are well done but for the graphics its still a pixel framestill imgetting more and more addictive in this game you just have to get a lot of practicewhen i first put my hands on it the first time it was one of the best racing games available
now more than ten years later it has little to offer
despite this it was a good game
i have recently purchased it and added it to my retro collection which i think was a good choice although im probably never going to play it againyou get your licence buy a car fix it up add new parts get it washed race win money and then start all over
this sounds just like what you would do in real like which is why this game is great it is very realistic
there are over  cars from every brand you can think of and  highly detailed tracks that will never get boring
so why did i only give this game  stars
like stuntman which could have been an amazing game this game was ruined by its difficulty level
in order to enter any of the races you must get the first two licences
the first one wasnt too difficult and the second one wasnt either until number  this took me atleast  tries
okay i finally got my second licence which means i can go and enter many of the beginer races
i started a race being very anxioussadly you get spinouts at every turn
which makes racing more about luck rather than your talent
when going at  mph a little tap on the digital controlls will make the car swirv all around the track and then ending in a spin out
i truely believe that beating a race on the game will be even harder than beating the same race with the same car in real lifeim not too far in the game that i have too many cars but i know that the first couple that you can buy dont have good controls
if some of the more expensive cars also spin out every time then im just going to give up on this gamesometimes it seems like a chore instead of a gameif you have paincence then go ahead and buy it i do recomand it but realize that the difficulty of this game is intencei started with gt
it took a while to get used to the handling  hrs of lic test
the handling gets better with different cars
to get better handling amp traction for tighter turns get racing tires
i love gt so i picked up gt just know
great
great
great
more cars
more tracks
its the only ps game thats worthy enough to get some play on my ps
that speaks volumes all in its selfthe good great graphics for its time a lot of races to do rally races are fun you can tune up cars just like real lifethe bad feels nothing compared to todays gt games doesnt have as much content as most racers these days due to its age it doesnt feel like a racing simulator anymore no car damagei remember playing gt to death back when it first came out
i never got a chance at gt but now after playing it i realized what i missed out on
of course it feels nothing like a simulator these days but you can still feel it seeping through its age
while gt doesnt boast a lot of races or modes like in gt or  it still holds its own ground
with the introduction of rally races and a new lineup of cars gt it a really good racer
of course you can take your tests wash your car and tune them up just like with todays gtswhile the cars are before the new millennium its kind of cool to see what was popular back then and how things have advanced
while the graphics are nothing to todays standards gt was one of the few games that pushed the ps to its limits
you have to play gt if youre a racing fan regardlessnever played any of the mario kart games
hard to believe 
well its true
but i can say that i love crash team racingit is a great little racer that you can play straight out of the box
easy to pick up darn difficult to put down
its lots of fun with well animated characters and tracks
the music is light as if ripped straight out of a saturday morning cartoon
honestly great for kids and adults alike
and while i love racing alone i cant emphasize the true joy of team racing
grab a multitap for your ps or ps and round up some friends
this where ctr truly shines
youll be laughing and bashing for hours at a timeso thanks to nintendo for coming up with the kart racing kraze
and major kudos to naughty dog for putting on a fesh set of tiresi love the crash games i got this back in o but this is still a great game
the graphics arent that bad and its a great game for kids and not one of these violent games
this is something everyone can enjoy
you race main bosses from other crash bandicoot games and theres a new alien guy whos not hard after the nd time you play him
these is a great famliy game and your parents can enjoy it toracing games arent my favorite type of games
in fact they usually smellthe only good one ive played before crash team racing was that old game wipeout
this game was rather good for a racing game but the only reason why i bought it was because it was a crash game and ive been following the crash bandicoot trilogy since the very beginningthis game has good graphics and powerups but sometimes its quite difficult like when you have to acquire gems and ctr tokens by going through impossibly difficult levels in a very short amount of time
the best thing about this i think was the storywhich is one thing that mario kart  didnt have at all
the story for this game was good because of its uniqueness
instead of having to battle dr cortex and uka uka again crash has to challenge a new enemy an alien named nitros oxide to a race that will decide the fate of the earth itself
not only that but this sudden turn of events forces crash and cortex to actually team up for the first time everexcept ofcourse if for some reason you consider cortex fooling crash to acquire the crystals for him in part  teaming up
not only that but crash and cortexs friends and minions coco polar tiny dingodile etc
also join in to make sure nitros oxide doesnt take over the world for himself and leave cortex out of iti would give this game  and a half stars but i gave it a  cause as ive said before i love crash to much to give him a coming from the tradition of mario kart this is a great game
ill say right off the bat that the bombs are lacking when compared to the green shells but that is the only complaintthis game is fun especially with  other people
the graphics are great and the sound is entertaining  especially of the characters when the launch a weapon or such
game  controls are excellent if a little confusing at first which makes it hard  for inexperienced players to get started
the basic controls are simple  but working in jumps and powerslides take work but thats how it should  be
the analog controller is great with this game
its very precise and  the vibrations add a lot to this gamethe multiplayer games is the  reason to buy this
you can play with  at once and on a decent sized tv  screen this is not difficult at all
i even played on a quot for a  while and it was ok  for beginners some of the tracks can be very  difficult but there are plenty of easy ones to start out onif you miss  mario kart and dont have a nintendo ctr is a great buy
its a great mix  of simple racing and fun additionsthe cd wasnt in a very good condition and would freeze up on my playstation system
i popped it into the playstation  and it was smooth sailing
 game with  quality cdfollowing their revolutionary ideas the designers of crash decided to design a racing gamei did not like the quotcrash bashquot that much and i never liked any racing games
it never appealed to my taste
and i expected to hate this game i might have given it a star beforehand but wow the game was excellenti prefer it to quotcrash warpedquot and maybe quotcrash bandicootquot but of course not quotcrash quot the game was everything i did not expect
the racing cars are flexible and fast but this was not enough for me to like it
what i liked about it was the introduction of weapons
man who could have thought of that
in order to hamper your opponents you can throw dynamite hit with a pikachu like smart electric ball or a directed missile get faster andor scatter some glasses containing chemicalsit is not a very hard task to win the adventure mode
the hard task is to get the gems and the trophies
do you want the truth
i did not get any of those
they were extremely difficult
you must be very skilful in order to get  percent
a master maybeand for me to recommend a racing game means you should try it at least
i enjoyed the game and am waiting for any new releases in the crash seriesthis game is a must have for mario kart fans as well as crashbandicoot fans nonetheless the game is simple to understand and takes a day or two to master
people should have a lot of fun with this game unless theyre mentally slow or you dislike fantasy racers
the game features quite a lot of options including battle mode and arcade which should fare well for  player ventures
however the best experience can be drawn out of this game from a playstation multitap
it is unstoppable fun after you gather friends around and play with the multitapif you like mariokart you will like this game
the differences in gameplay are miniscule
great multiplayer fun
if you have ps though you need a ps multitap
there are codes to unlock more battlemode stages
i like mariokart better but this is a more than adequete gamethis game was my first experience with resident evil and it was a good experience at that
the control system takes some getting used to and theres always the f inventory problems but you get used to them after a while
the gameplay is superior to the first one theres plenty of ammo this time around and the puzzles actually seem to apply to reality in a distant kind of way
there are a total of  story lines two for each character making for very good replay value
an enjoyable albeit short experiencemy hot and cold experience with capcoms infamous survival horror series resident evil has been something ive endured for years without the satisfaction of actually defeating any of the games
its a group of games that makes it incredibly easy to become stuck frustrated or cornered and as a result give up altogether
though i enjoyed the unique perspective of the first game the integrated elements of past horror movies and the whole premise of an underground city filled with zombies i really had a hard time correctly rationing my ammo my gamesaving ink ribbons and my time
its a strange marriage a brainless ballsout action title merged with a time consuming brain teasing puzzle game
capcom teases you into adopting a final fight mindset then completely derails the player by halting the action altogether and throwing them coldly into a kings quest style item gathering and puzzle solving mission
thats like hopping into a dodge viper pulling it out to the highway and shifting from fifth to first without slowing downas with any sequel re borrows a lot from its predecessor
the controls the camera angles the weapons the enemies everything is very close if not the same
but again as with any sequel this second installment improves upon the original in every way
perhaps the most notable improvement of them all lies in the storyline itself
comparing the stories of the first game and the second is like pitting sam raimis first evil dead against the recent blockbuster the ring sure theyre technically the same genre but the differences in budget acting talent and overall production quality arent even in the same ballparkchapter two is for all intents and purposes a true sequel tough perhaps this is a sequel where the filmmakers couldnt convince any of the original stars to return for a second run
it picks up three months after the storyline of the first game and ties in closer and closer with the original plot as the story goes along
put simply the virus that created the zombies of resident evil  has spilled into the city streets and infected an entire town
as either leon a rookie police officer enduring his first day on the job or claire the sister of res chris you enter the horrific world of raccoon city and attempt to save the world from the brink of disaster one more time
the two strangers meet thanks to a stroke of luck agree that the police station is the safest place to hold out and are almost immediately separated before reaching their target
once there its almost business as usual again firing on monsters uncovering an elaborate maze of tricks gimmicks and puzzles and shooting for the head of the evil umbrella corporation once againthe graphics of the second installment have taken a big step forward from the first game
both the main characters and the creatures themselves move much more realistically this time around
zombies will lunge when you get close theyll stumble backwards when they take a couple bullets
leon and claire as well show the effects of the damage theyve taken
both have three different methods of walking an uninjured trot a mildly harmed walk with an arm around their midsection and a nasty limp dragging their weapon behind them as they go
the more damage you take the slower you move and the more likely you are to take additional hits
every character human and zombie now comes fully equipped with an independently moving head which locks onto the nearest moving object and follows it staring as it moves around the roomif youve played the first resident evil or any installment since you understand the gameplay of this series
it really hasnt changed all that much in the last six years
you either love it or you cant stand it
the action is presented from a series of static camera shots overlooking all the action and switching  angles as you leave the plane of vision
this setup offers positives and negatives for one the backgrounds are much more detailed than they could have possibly been rendered in three dimensions
unfortunately the rapid changing of screens and immovable camera angles still make it easy for your enemies to get the drop on you
the zombies lickers and evil plants can see you from down the hallway but you cant see them until theyre right on top of youthe audio is the only portion of chapter two that isnt a notable improvement over the first
its still a strange subpar performance of tense symphonic arrangements mixed with elevator music
its quiet at the right moments it crescendos at the right time theres just something strange about it
something that doesnt fit right
many of the sound effects are carried over from the first game but theyve been joined by some all new samples
zombies still make the same characteristic shuffle when they move they still occupy themselves by mumbling incoherently and its still entertaining as hell
leon claire ada the chief and the other half dozen characters with speaking roles put on a notably better performance than the talent in the first game
this isnt emotional professionalquality voice acting yet but its a world and a half better than chris and jills boring unenthusiastic delivery in the first titleall accounted for resident evil  is everything a sequel should be
it integrated many of the elements that made the first game successful improved upon the areas in which the original was lacking picked up the story and ran with it and delivered an overly solid presentation
there are still some major flaws with both the gameplay and the story but on the whole this is a big step in the right direction
resident evil  was an unexpected surprise solid but not necessarily legendary
part two really put the series on the map as a serious forceok  here is my list of fav re games resident evil  resident evil  resident evil code veronica x resident evil  nemesis resident evil survivorback to re it has a good story and ok graphics i dont own it but i rented and beat it within  days so i feel i am entitled to write a review
what it lacks in difficulty and replay value it makes up for in story and scare value  recvx is a very long game for the ps but isnt scary at all and has a very long and medocre story  if u have a ps  buy this game and a psone mem card for the same price as the new re game and u will be more happyif you been gaming on sony playstation up to its successor the playstation  you might have forgotten how to play the  ps games and frustrating it could get to you
heard rumors that capcom is planning to remake resident evil  game so if you are a collector or lover of the re games you better get the game now  and enjoy it
playing on this game will take me longer than usualhow many words can be used to sum up this game
how about awesomeokay its dated
the graphics arent sharp and the voice acting is sub par
their mouths dont move and the characters look like they were made out of melted lego blocks
but kids this was an era where every other game was either sidescrolling or full of platforms
this game was a welcome change to the monotiny of racing games platform games and horror games that did not scare us anymorethe story
well its science gone awry of course
a scientist does not want his experiment stolen so he releases it onto himself and kills his attackers then the experiment is released accidently as rats drink up the remains of a broken vial
as rats tend to do they spead the disease and the city is covered in zombies
a girl named clare who is dressed inappropirately for a zombie outbreak but well enough for a frat party comes into town searching for her brother
leon arrives too a rookie cop eager to start his new profession only to find his fellow officerse are now shambling through the streets killing anything that moves and breaths
sure you could find a similar plot in a scyfy channel budget movie but this game executes the story so well
there are zombies mutant monsters and a frankenstein monsterlike monster called mr x that big trench coat guy was so menacing my mother was watching me play one day and the big guy exploded out of a wall surprising my mother and forever more he would be called mr oh s
ah fond memoriescharacters
well i will not lie clare is a tomboy in tight cutoff shorts
leon is a whiny looser who suffers from some sort of inferiority complex
the police chief is a nut
the scientist who caused the outbreak is one fry short of a whole happy meal
the little girl sidekick is unnecessary but a nice addition
and ada the asian spy is completely dull
each character due to the limitations of the system can only move their arms and bodies to convey emotion as the faces are merely plastered on a square head
often they will move thier hands as they talk to convey apathy disgust horror or anger
this is well done in the game but the limitations of the technologies of the time show like a festering pimple
still it holds upzapping
well thats what they call it anyway
it just means that at two points scenarios affect each other
see there are four scenarios
leon a clare b clare a leon b bounus modes are unlocked by beating the game with a high score ie not using your first aid or finishing within a certain ammount of time
the scenarios of the two characters interesct at two pivotal points an item pickup and a puzzle choice and thats it
dont get me wrong the gimmic is okay but it is barely zapping
the music
well aside from the credit music there isnt really a soundtrack
but the background music is subperb
really the subtle music cues are exactly what the game needs to convey emotion urgency peace and outright chaos
if you do not run near the end when the sirens are going off with the threat of a facility explosion only to realized you can take your time then you are clearly taking riddilinethe gameplay
the characters control like forklifts
they are stiff responsive to a degree and varied
the enemies attack in various ways mostly clinging to you and taking a bite out of your collar bone and your only defense is the weapons scattered through the area and the meager munitions availble in the infested police station
to flesh out the game there are many puzzles
you will run back and forth checking the map and looking at odd ends of puzzle parts fuzes tiles cables ect
and trying to figure out where to shove what
that and avoiding getting your last ounce of life taken from you makes for an intense experiencethe game is intense
oh yes
you would not think so when you see the start screen and a giant crocodile is staring at you with a bloodshot eye but from the very first moment of gameplay you are thrust into a world of zombies
the stiff controls narrow corridors ambient music and the shambling groaning enemies make for a sharp gameplay experience
many times you will find yourself cornered with barely enough ammo to escape and the prospect of a boss after finishing the many smaller enemiesreplay
as previously stated the game has four scenarios not including bounus modes
each scenario takes around two hours to complete
so in a fast play through there is eight hours of gameplay
in a regular session you could expect to take anywhere from six days to half a month finishing the two stories
basically there are two games with this one game
you can start as leon and finish as clare or start as claire and end as leon
the stories change with both tellings and it is worth playing through both
moreover the bousus modes are decent
there are alternate costumes a time attack mode a toffu time attack mode where you play as a giant block of tuffu and arrange mode should you get the dual shock version
arrange mode is basically a mode where they hold your hand for you
they give you a gun with infinite ammunition and let you goif you have a playstaion system any of them then get a copy of this game
in fact if you have a gamecube then buy the version released for that system
if you have psn then buy it there if they have it
it is worth every pennythe original driver still has fun to be derived from it but it doesnt have as much class or finesse as its sequel
the graphics look terrible and the city feels lifeless most of the time
the police chases missions crashes and a few other things keep this game from slipping into total mediocrity and keeps the experience fun most of the time
the controls and camera need work because of how unsteady they can be
like i said this game still has plenty of fun left in it but you should look for better options before turning to this gamequotdriverquot is the realization of any driving fanatics dream which is to get behind the wheel of a flashy car and speed through a crowded city on a joyride avoiding cops and other pitfalls
even without going through the story mode you can have fun exploring the welldetailed cities and perhaps ramming a few cars off the road in the processin terms of graphics and sound this game excells at both
despite some pixilation and bleedthrough the graphics are fluid and fastpaced
the music is funky s era driving music just the thing needed when attempting to outrun three police cruisers
the story mode takes you through four cities san francisco miami las angeles and new york
you are the driver for a mob cartel and you must get your clients to and from their various jobs
you must get them there quickly safely without getting caught by the cops or wrecking the car
my biggest complain about this game is the horrible quotdriving testquot that you must complete before engaging in the story
you are given  seconds to perform various moves with the car and you have to do them all
it took me about  attempts to get them all rightthe best thing about quotdriverquot is the intricate attention to detail
the car shows damage just like a real car and you even loose hubcaps at sharp turns
the cities are huge and well detailed
you can cruise through chinatown in san francisco speed down the oceanside expressway in miami or tear down wall st in new york
the designers of this game went all outwhatever your taste is this game will become one of your guilty pleasures
it is also a great way to relieve stress which can only be a bonus
any playstation collection should have this game in itthis is good but the pc version has better lighting effects and more features
but this is the next best thingthis is the very first driver game to come out
it is a very fun game at the begining because u can do anything that u want to
however u cannot get out of ur car but it is fun to drive around and destroy things
the graphics r not that good but it is an old game even for the ps
the cops r hard to get away from but that makes it challenging and fun
not trying to make fun of anybody but the cops r fat too so it is so funny to watch them get out of their cars and walk around
i would tell more but it has been a long time since i have played it because it broke a long time ago
this is a great game that started it alli got this game because i wanted a good streetarcade racer where you could just drive around smashing into things
i got what i wanted
driver includes four real us cities relatively accurate in street layouts complete with traffic and police who generally want to smash you up because youve broken the law
the traffic is fairly realistic going so far as to have their own accidents occasionally and honking at you for reckless driving or nearly broadsiding themthe free play option as i like to call it as opposed to the actual storyline is a much better use of the game
the storyline itself while originally a good idea is rather vague and becomes repetitious
in addition the final mission is impossible
let me repeat that
the final mission is impossible
read it and weepof course one of the really big fun factors is being able to customize your replays
the replay editor allows you to position various cameras from all kinds of angles in car chase from full  degrees and various stationary cameras which can be told to follow your car as it goes by or not
make sure you have a lot of memory cards if buying this game
youll soon fill up your spaces with saved replays they take two blocks eachthe only reason i didnt give it five stars is because of its poor storyline impossible mission and its tendency to freeze from time to time
there are plenty of graphical bugs as well and ive found myself inside a building every now and then
collision physics have gone haywire on me a couple of times where ill be coasting almost at a stop brush a car and go flying seventy feet into the air
oh well you cant have everything be perfectthis my friends is one fun game
i loooooooooooooove it
i used to play it into the ground no joke mine fell apart
 the best part is going for a drive cuz there is no time limit or objective you can do what you want and try to stay out of trouble but i cant help but speed past cops so i can put on a chase
weeeee
i almost fell out of my chair when i read there was other driver games
i cant believe i missed out on the funto start things off go for driver  but if you want to play the first one here are some pros and cons
gameplay is fun and there are plenty of missions
also there is visible car damagebut graphics are bad
you cant steal other cars in levels but you can on driver 
if a cop sees you he will come after you even if you do nothing
so like i said go for driver  but if you really want to try this one out go ahead it is funthis game is pretty fun to play
its not as frustrating as the original nes classic however this game can be hard at times and has its moment where i want to put it down and play another game but if you like a challenge or if you like the kid icarus series then you should pick up this gamethis is an excellent iteration of the kid icarus series perfectly capturing the gameplay of the original kid icarus for the nintendo entertainment system with some welcome tweaks to gameplay that make it an even more excellent title
it is a little easier than the original because of intelligent features like being able to move backward and forward in a level
in the climbing levels it is nice to not die just because the screen moved above a platform
i was really enjoying this game full of hearty joy but then when i got to the fourth level my save game was lost
that is what youll want to check for as a buyer
the save game feature worked great for me for quite a while probably a week of consistent gaming
then i must have done something wrong when i was saving because when i turned the game on it wouldnt allow me to access the continue option
unfortunately prior to listing this review i havent gotten to the bottom of this problem but i just want to offer this advice
play this game as soon as you get it
if there is a saved game good that is a good sign but then you should also play this game until you can save it at the end of the first level
save then shut it down turn it back on and then see if your game is saved
if so congratulations you have purchased a good copy
if not then the seller has sold you a flawed copy unless they specifically stated that the save feature doesnt work then youll want to see if the seller will issue a refund
this should require you to mail the game to the seller who will issue the refund when they get the game
if they let you keep it you are lucky but what have you gotten besides a game that you cannot shut off if you want to get to the end of the gamekirby made his short and sweet debut on the game boy in  with kirbys dream land
at the same time a new nintendo franchise was born
before he was a cute pink puff ball he was just a plain old white ghost looking ball who had to rescue his homeland from the clutches of his nemesis king dedede
while the kirby games were better efforts the first one proved there was something about him and his platform game that was simple and funkirbys dream land lets you control kirby through  stages filled with enemies pitfalls and spikes
kirby can inhale his enemies and either swallow them or spit them out at other enemies
he can also pick up health power ups and ups to help stay in the game
at the end of each stage you face off against a boss and use a simple pattern strategy to beat itthe pros a platform game that didnt star mario would normally mean it wasnt going to be good
this isnt the case with kirbys dream land
from the bright and crisp graphics to the pleasant music and solid controls this game pleased anyone who managed to play it from beginning to end
nintendo knew they had a hit by keeping things simple for the time being and for that its a game that is fun to playthe cons with only  stages its over before you know it
and while you had to beat it in one shot no passwords save system or continues here it wasnt a hard game at allit was short and sweet but fun at the same time
millions of copies were sold and only prompted nintendo to make sequels which were better efforts overall
so if youre curious about where kirby started out and you have yet to play this game search for a used copy and pop it into your game boy
you wont regret itive been anxiously waiting for this to arrive in mail today and planned to have hours of entertainment but beat it in  minutes
this is the first kirby game on the game boy which is not only short in length but falls short of expectations from a kirby game
unlike all kirby games this fellow cannot absorb enemies powers which beats the purpose of a kirby game
regardless it is still enjoyable and youll encounter familiar foes and landscapes from other kirby installmentsthis is still another must have for a game boy collector despite the short lengtha classic
whats not to love about kirby
my boys love this game and the adorable kirby
its good funkirbys dreamland is a fun game you can sit down and play for  or  minutes until you beat it
its short even for a gameboy game but its very fun
this is kirbys first game ever and not being able to copy abilities makes this game slightly more challenging but still easy and for beginners
kirbys dreamland also has arguably the best graphics and sound on gameboy like kirbys adventure did on the nes if you look closely kirbys dreamland looks like a colorless kirbys adventure
this is a great game taking into consideration its age and systempresentation a simple gameboy presentationgraphics amazing for black and white
superbsound catchy and memorable a true kirby soundgameplay classic kirby just without copying abilitiesinnovation a humble platformer the first of its series
sounds innovative to mereplay value just dont expect to sit around for hours to play this
if you get bored and want to kill time for a few minutes or play a short video game while someone else is driving in the car this game is a perfect ideaoverall a nice game i reccomend owningcapcom released a much improved sequel to the game boy title mega man dr wilys revenge in  simply titled mega man ii it was met with commercial success and mixed reaction between players and critics
it follows the same formula and fixes some of the issues that plagued the first game
while it is still not perfect mega man ii was still fun to play and provided a fix for those players who wanted to take another mega man game on the gomega man returns to stop dr wily after he steals an experimental weapon to escape into the future
so you started with picking one of four stages containing robot masters from the nes mega man  game
after clearing those stages you must clear four more stages with four robot masters this time from the nes game mega man  finally you must defeat a new robot master quint before you can face dr wily and stop him once and for all
the password system returns so you can write them down and save them for the next time you decide to continue your gamethe pros the results were good this time
the game plays just like a mix of mega man  and mega man  for the nes
the stage layouts are a little more easier to navigate and the enemies are manageable this time around
the music tracks are alternate takes on the original versions and for the most part they sound great
the controls are the same so there is no problem controlling mega man
this time rush from the nes mega man  game joins you and you can acquire his special abilities just like in the nes version
finally the game has  stages altogether so the experience lasts a little bit longerthe cons capcom didnt really mix things up as much
if you played the first game boy title and didnt like it this game wont change your mindonly time will tell if capcom will release this title for the ds eshop so that for those who didnt play it can get a chance to
otherwise if you loved the first game youll have to do some searching online as there arent a lot of copies floating around and only if you are willing to pay a premium price for it
it was worth it and if you are still not convinced you can check out some youtube videos and judge for yourselfmegaman has it all precise controls catchy tunes amazing graphics and incredible gameplay
that has been spread across the  games in the classic console series and the  games in the classic handheld series
so what is the deal with megaman ii for the game boywell its supposed to be a version of megaman  for the nes
as the game starts there are only  robot masters to encounter wood man air man crash man and metal man
this is because of cartridge limits but when you play the first game on game boy and get to the dr wily teleport system that part actually has you fight the other  robot masters from megaman  so whats in this games teleport system
well since this part is at the nearend of the game ill tell you further in this reviewanyways the game is just as fun as all the other megaman games
the controls are still precise the graphics are excellent and the gameplay is spoton
while it is supposed to be a version of megaman  however the level layouts are different and the music is nothing similar to the original in fact its rather poor compared to the other games but still somewhat catchy
nevertheless the game gives you that sweet and familiar megaman  feel as you play through the respective robot masters stagesuntil you get to dr wilys castleonce you reach dr wilys castle that mad scientist throws megaman into a trap
that trap is the teleport system
there are  teleports right
well that means that there are  more robot masters taken from megaman  that you must fight
however in the first game you just fight them
in this game you actually have to play through their stages
so i think its safe to say youre no longer playing megaman  youre playing a fraction of megaman after defeating those robots you then play through dr wilys stage
challenging
well it may take trial and error for a part or two but lets hope you still have energy tanks
the final boss will require you to use some as your health bar may deplete during the battleoverall this is a great game that i recommend any megaman to purchase
plus the difficulty is more fair here than in other megaman games so new megaman players should start here
buy this game for your game boy color or even advancein  konami released the sequel to s castlevania adventure on the game boy
castlevania ii belmonts revenge was much improved and better than the first game because it addressed most of the issues that plagued castlevania adventure
while the sequel isnt perfect fans of the series quickly pointed out that it is worthy addition in anyones gaming collection
it sold well enough so for those who were fortunate to play this game will tell you its also one of the better game boy games at the timeyou control christopher belmont who returns for the sequel as you guide him through  castles and then gain access to the final castle and to do battle with dracula
this time around you get to choose the order of the  castles you must battle your way through each with its own theme and traps
your whip is once again your primary weapon and once its fully powered up it can launch fireballs in the direction you swing it
like the first game you can pick up weapons to arm yourself eat pork chops to refill your health and collect hearts to rack up ammo for your weapons
you can earn points to get extra lives but if you use all of them up your game ends and you can either continue or write down a password to continue where you left on the next time you playthe pros one of the good things about the first game was it had good graphics and music for a game boy game
belmonts revenge blows that game out of the water in both of those areas
the sound effects are good and the controls for the game are still as good but rigid as before
this game fixed the issues the previous game had no more super precise jumping hearts now act as ammo more weapons were added to this game and only certain enemies that you touch have the power to downgrade your whip
plus the game is a couple of stages longer which rounded up to be a more satisfying gaming experiencethe cons its still a one player affair but that is how castlevania games are anyway
your character still moves like molasses
also castlevania ii is harder than the first game and so is the final villain dracula
he was a real hard ass compared to when you faced him in castlevania adventuremany fans will quickly tell you to pick this game up instead of the first one simply because it felt more like playing the nes series
so if you like castlevania games and have a working game boygame boy advance this game belongs to be in your game boy collectionthis game was one of my favorites when i was little you are super humans by the look of your strength and you have to destroy the evil from wherever it is you are
at the beginning of the game a spirit tell you to quotrise from your gravesquot
in this game is a concept i thought was pretty cool certaun enemies you kill drop powerups these power ups quotupgradequot your body you could say
each time you are upgraded you buils more muscle until you transform intoa creature
maybe a wolf a dragon or a bear
you transform to a different creature each level first level was a wolf as i remembered
the only problem i had with this game was that it was too short i beat it too easily but dont stop that from you getting it
this is still a really interesting gamea fun game that is imaginitively created
along with great graphicsfor the time it came out you would have a fun and entertaining game that is worth playing over and over againaltered beast is a game that early on in the sega genesis era came with the system
you are playing as a character  or characters in  player mode that have been resurrected
you go through the game fighting various enemies such as zombiescreaturesdemonsghoulsectas you play through each level
you encounter herds of oxen
when you see the blue ox you must hit it to get a power up
your character becomes bigger  more powerful
after several blue ox encounters youll have transformed into a beast with powers
each level you become a different beast
the st level you are the beast on the covera ware wolf type dude
next level you are a dragon then the rd level a bearect its a pretty basic and repetitive yet fun game
when it first came out on arcade and sega consoles it was a great hit
it still holds up pretty good for how old it is
the controls are simple
the music  sound effects are catchy
id recommend this game to anyone that enjoys old school classic gamesscifi gamesrpgsfighterbeatem up type of gamesbatman returns on genesis is a challenging game
the first couple of hours of play then death repeat ad nauseum i was too frustrated to continue for a while
all of what i chocked up to cheap deaths bad collision detection etc really would have marred my opinion on this game
ive never been more happy to be wrong
i ended up picking it up not long after and im glad i did
though batman returns can manage to be a frustrating video game it certainly isnt a bad oneyou control batman as youre trying to clear your name after oswald cobblepott aka the penguin frames you for murder all the while thwarting off the red triangle circus gang moonlighting rooftop encounters with catwoman and dodging enemy gargoyles and the like
batman moves quite slowly across the screen for a bit platformer almost surprisingly so but running and jumping will be the least of your worries
combat is really the meat of the gameplay hereas batman you have an inventory of gadgetsweapons to choose from all of which are absolutely necessary for completion of this immensely challenging game
from the batarangs to the smoke pellets these weapons are necessary to deal with the barrage of enemies youll be facing and this was a great design choice from the developers perspective
this is the first batman game i played as a kid where i felt his arsenal was not only correct but very well implemented
most enemies at first glance seem to have erratic and unfair attack patterns
since batman moves slowly dodging enemies while possible can be tough and certainly shouldnt be relied on
since you do have your gadgets though youll have to think your way through this one
you cant throw these weapons about just to waste them on lesser enemies that can be taken care of with kicks or punches
as batman youll have to survive
youll have to know when to use the smoke pellets the heat seeking batarangs the batcall frequency etc and the enemies herein are varied enough that the game never becomes stalethe levels here are absolutely huge and filled to the brim with hidden weapon pickups and extralives for the adventurous gamer
youll really have to search these levels and know them forward and backward to get good at this game
thankfully level design is handled exceptionally well
throughout youll fly through the sky with batmans cape off of buildings no less grapple onto chandeliers traverse the top of a train and battle your way through a deadly circus to name a few
the best thing about these levels is that theyre designed with batmans arsenal in mind
when you reach the top of a trapeze and have scarce options of removing that clown from the next platform youll be thankful you saved those heatseeking batarangs and the game remains strategically challenging in its level design throughout the whole experiencethe boss fights are another story though
some of these are not well though out in the slightest
youll have  encounters with catwoman with each fight playing out nearly the same as it did before as well as  fights with the penguin
the first two being ridiculously easy the last being one of the toughest challenges ive seen in a game
batman returns has balancing issues to be sure but makes up for it by simply being an otherwise wonderful experiencegraphically the game looks nowhere near as good as its snes counterpart but the sega team deserves commendation for their visual design in respect to remaining faithful to the film and the game is faithful enough in that regard that i have a hard time faulting it for its visuals
there are some impressive animations on not just batman himself but on the enemies as well
the spinning clown in the descending broken down building comes to mind lending a pseudod effect to the game and the levels themselves do look great if a bit dark or grainy
the darkness i dont mind its faithful to the film in that aspect
the graininess however i dont care for
simply put there are much better looking genesis games for the time but thats almost not being fair to this game
batman returns does look good and theres nothing that grossly offends me within its visual design
just dont expect it to blow you awaysound wise the developers really knew what they were doing with the genesis sound module
there are some really memorable tunes here ranging from dark bell tones to almost a synthpop sound in some level themes and there are some great nods to elfmans score here
this is easily one of my favorite soundtracks on the genesis and it helps batman returns stand out
the bass sounds full the treble melodies arent grating and dont sound as tinny as other genesis games and most if not all of the soundtrack is memorable
this is really really great stuffthe games biggest problem however is its difficulty
while there are no difficulty settings there is an option for extra lives which i recommend cranking all the way up to get the most out of this game your first time through
theres also a stage select code if you feel like taking that route but completing this game from start to finish without a stage select is really something you shouldnt pass up
once you understand when to use your gadgets how to avoid enemies to the best of your abilities and make it through levels without using up too many of the lives you have stocked batman returns ends up being a really great really challenging experience
for those uninitiated though its bound to frustrate and i can see how that would turn a lot of people off to this gameall in all batman returns is a great genesis game
its not quite up there with classics like gunstar heroes or the other great movie tiein game aladdin and it definitely doesnt look or play as well as either but its overall charm strategic gameplay elements wonderful soundtrack and brooding visuals certainly make for a great game that deserves a better reputation than it has
just dont expect to get through this one on your first or even fifth trybatman returns cant beat the original on genesis but it comes sometimes close because the graphics are so good it follows the story line in such detail its not funny it could stand up to todays graphics i would give it a  and a half stars if i couldif thee hates this game thou hath wasted thy darn life
oh btw im a big castlevania fan
bloodlines came two years after super castlevania iv and while iv has some better graphics and definitely some better sound quality it has its own merits
sure you go kill dracula so what
actually the plotline itself is a refreshing change from the others
in this one you can choose to be either john morris or eric lecarde which allows a different change of pace of having just one character to start off with faintly similar like castlevania iii for the nes except in that game you start with just one
the graphics are essentially good for the genesis so i have no complaints yes theyre better than the nesoverall
a great game
it may not touch symphony of the night but this game is essential to any genesis collection
it may be difficult but its worth it
personally i rank super castlevania iv a little higher but thats just because its my favorite
is it better
judge for yourself
nevertheless get it
after all it is castlevania and you would be depriving yourselves without it fathers of this game are castlevania  not    and legends
no babies implies that there hansnt been a castlevania quite like it since
straight linear levels prgressions w boss at end of level
no eqipment or ability upgrades minor item power ups think power up in altered beast  playable charachters infiite pits boss paterns cheap deaths romantic atmospheresah greece romania industrial russia
but lacks the nonlinear gameplay first spawned by dracula x pc engine avoid snes dracula x heir equivalent and then enhanced by symphony of alucard circle of the useless spell books aria of should have been titled white night concherto and harmony of  castle rip off of the iverted castle induced by the grandady
not castle  played it recently very cheap hits but solid enough control
in conclusion i have decided not to buy the new castlevania lament of innocence due to its devil may cry heritage
i am glad footsteps are made away from d and the tried and true formulas of symphony but i want a remake of castle   i guess you will have to look there for why
conclusioncastlevania meets smetroidit is notsonic versus mariogetting more lineardecap attack versus chakansounds like my teen spiritinteresting idea of konami to use the idea of each stage taking place in a different country some players may find it difficult to finish theres one thing i thought wasnt fair  if you start with  lives then go on to stage  with  lives you use all your lives  then when you get a password then you decided to use it  you find yourself starting exactly with the same number of lives at the stage where you left off  lives i would recommend trying to find a up so you have more lives than you originally started with  then use them all up so you can get that password i dod the same exact thing for every level so i would never be short on livesfollowing the lead of the previous years japaneseonly pcengine classic dracula x chi no rondo rondo of blood bloodlines is highly ambitious in attempting to create a sense of a bridge between the old castlevania and the new
it even copies the dracula x chi no rondo boss that throws a ton of the bosses youve already beaten formula but it allows you to fall back on the trusty old password system
the game is even but it fails to rank among the best games in the series for a number of reasonsits interesting to point out how portions of the level designs were reused for next years s super nintendosuper famicom games dracula x and xx respectively
that tells us its designers were strangely attracted to some points of their bizzare little creationon the plus side the environments are varied the music is great for the genesis composed by the same person who went on to write the music for symphony of the nightnocturne in the moonlight and the graphics are colorful
the special effects are considered by many to be in the same league as contra the hard corps and even gunstar heroes and it certainly comes closewaiti didnt just say the graphics are colorful did i
drat
the graphics are stronger than many other genesis games but i feel a sense of horror at putting this title above comix zone or ecco
of course no genesis titles are truly ever beautifulask rembrandt to paint the night watch and then squeeze that into the severely limited genesis palette
color and shading is central to castlevania as we know it today and have known it since  with super castlevania  and the genesis doesnt really allow much in the way of subtlety
in order to make up for the low palette the games critters are instead drawn in a way similar to your average early s genesis title in a cartoony fashionas a result the game is somewhat bizzare
ingenious and silly creature designs freely mingle here from the old standby of the zombie to the skeletons refitted with world war i era helmets the common enemies of the game look a bit too garish and outlandish for my taste
i like a lot of what is done in this game and some things such as the cutup and upside areas in the final stage havent been done again anywhere but the game gets a bit far off track at timesof course the controls are perfectly adequate for myself but they arent without fault each character has a major quirk with their weapons special function and it adds to the confusion at first
the stair climbing animation however is particularly horridkonami as you could guess can be counted to make great use of that  megabit cart space the programming gives us something that the super nintendo was hard pressed to do move a ton of large sprites across the screen quickly and easily
the limited space has a drawback though if youre used to the modern masterpiece cv games on cd format symphony from  and rondo from  even castlevania chronicles to a degree youll miss the great amount of interaction with the environment
thats simply a drawback inherent to many titles in this series
for over half a decade it has remained one of the last of the old barebones gameplay examples of cv and likely will remain so unless konami changes the formula after three gba games the asyet unreleased aos appears to follow the format of the metroidstyle cv
and a year later i can say it did
its pretty hard to go wrong buying this game as cheap as it may be found
while the japanese version will snag some good cash if you let yourself get hornswaggled the us version is basically more genesis ballast to get rid of as far as many game stores are concerned and can be found for a few dollarseven complete or unopenedif you liked golden axe dont worry it looks and plays the same but is it the same
no i had more fun with this the soundtrack the movement and just everythinggreat game with friends you can fight in a few different ways fun and slice jump and slice or just run in there
this game is fun and is woth no more than  with box and manual
if you have a genesis what are you waiting fori like this second version of golden axe for sega genesis
a lot of action and good gameplay
thanks very muchgolden axe  owns if you loved golden axe  youll enjoy this  its  not as remembered like st golden axe  is but is still very good
it has an improved magic system  slightly tweaked combat
now the other reviewers on here say the music sucks the music is actually pretty good not as good as the first games music but still very very solid
this game is a really good sequel
if golden axe was the father then golden axe  is his son and he turned out to be a better kid the the father hoped
golden axe  is the retarded kid but hes polite and hes  of the easiest people to get along with
golden axe revenge of death adder hes the kid you love so much but he moved away  he hates you
golden axe the duel is an inbred cousin that everyone in the family hates
golden axe beast rider is the bh ex wife that divorced you you hate her she hates you
yes dumb analogy but i compare them like a family
i think golden axe went downhill either at the rd game or after golden axe golden axe ii is a great game for multiplayer fun
it is improved from the original in several ways including being able to attack both behind and in front of the player with one move
the graphics are a lot better and the attack range has improved
the there is a more variety of enemies with varying difficulties and better stage layout
its not as easy to fall to your death accidentally in this game
the life bar takes more damage to go down than in the orignal as well
the powers can be used at different levels depending on how the player wants it
in the original when you use the magic it was all used upbut the original did have more continues while this game only has  it doesnt help that continues must be shared between players
so if one bad player uses multiple continues the more experienced player may end up getting game over first because all the continues are gonethe controls are good for arcade standards but i do have one complaint
for some reason my super controller the ones with the extra buttons and modes does not work well
the control pad is useless and instead you must maneuver the character using the extra buttons and even the start button
yes
the start button moved the player foward
so if you are going to play use a normal controllerif you have never played the other golden axe game you should know that players can harm each other but by staying apart you should be fine working together to fight off barages of enemiesthe difficulty is pretty leveled except for the few continues
if you play this game enough you should be able to learn how to battle different enemies without taking too much damage
this is a must if you hope to beat the gameoverall it is a great game in the genesis library
it has a few problems but those can be easily overlooked by the fun that this game provides
it is recommended that you play with a friend as there are tons of enemies that will attack you simultaneously plus it makes the game a whole lot more funas golden axe is one of my alltime favorite games i was expecting great things of golden axe ii
unfortunately it just doesnt live up to the original
for one thing the graphics got uglier
everything looks lores and very drab though some of the enemies are nicely done
another thing that sucks about this game is the sound and music the sound is of the tinny quotclink clink swish swishquot variety and the music sounds pretty bad
as with the original golden axe you take control of a musclebound human warrior a woman or a dwarf
sometimes i play the woman because i get my jollies off of seeing her videogame anatomy though usually i play the dwarf because he kicks asslike i said a great game
the graphics are great and best of all it is a lot of fun
some things though kind of bug me
for example the game play controls are bit slippery
sometimes when you try to jump on a block you will slip and fall of easily
i have no idea whether it is the character you are the samurai jason etc but it does make the game a bit frustrating sometimes
the music is pretty good although it is a bit repetative
the possibilities of weapons items etc is awesome which is probably kid chameleons best assest and what makes it so much fun
be aware though this game is not easy
it is difficult especially in the levels where you have to avoid the meat grinder following you
also it is looooonnggg
there are at least  plus levels you have to go through not including the alternate levels
anywaysget this game you will enjoy it for hours and hours trust methe idea of virtual reality was starting to float around and sega lacking the actual means to attain virtual reality made a game where the character is playing a virtual reality game that takes your life should you lose
this game is brutally long with no saves or even passwords to save your progress
the only way to quickly return to where you are is by taking warp spots which put you an undisclosed number of levels ahead
you get no indication of how far you are and since this games is quite long and difficult being able to know how far you are would help quite a bit
problems aside it is still a fun genesis game to playownif youre a fan of mj and love sega genesis this is an excellent buy
the game overall is pretty fun but can get repetitive at times with all the doors you have to open and close and children to rescue
some see this game as a metaphor for mjs wackyness and others see it as just a fun video game
my opinion is that you should go with the second option because its a great game to add to anyones genesis collection or for a mj fanrobo cop is awesomewhat can i say this game is chalenging and fun
it has stood the test of time as it is still fun to play today as it was when i was a young kid
of course the graphics are outdated but they still look good today
it is a challenging game i must stress but it is a lot of funits basically the sequel to sonic  but its not sonic  anyway in this game you can either play as sonic or knuckles in an attempt to stop dr robotnik eggman to fans who didnt know his old name used to be robotnik from rebuilding his death egg its like the death star from star wars but with robotniks face anyway its an excellent buy for your sega genesis oh and if you buy the original sonic sonic  or  you can lock them on to this cartridge since sonic  knuckles is a lockon cartridge you can unlcck special featuresi remember getting this for genesis and popping it inthis game that uses leftovers from sonic the graphics were goodthe level design chalengingand lockon patch for sonic  a great ideato methis is the last great sonic game before sonic turned into a  year olds gamei was mildly irritated when sonic  ended or should i just say stopped
the game pretty just closed with a black screen and no sequence
sonic  knuckles is the true end but not before spinning through  more levels and yet another confrontation with robotnik on the death eggtheres nothing breathtakingly new about the level design
if youve played one sonic youve played em all in this regard
but the varied themes and tunes will keep you entertained
i think that lava reef zone may well be my favorite sonic tune everive still to play as knuckles and use the lockon technology
but no matter how much i play or how hard i try theres no way ill be able to get through the entire game and grab all  chaos emeralds
the emerald stages are just too hard
with all  chaos emeralds you transform into hyper sonic which i have never seen
but to be honest i think there are only about  people in the history of the world who have been able to unlock hyper sonicthis was the last true d sonic game
he has controversially lost his way and his fans since sonic  knuckles
the sonic advance games are good and sonic adventure dx was also loads of fun
but somethingi dunno what has just been lacking
where sonic has failed again and again mario has succeeded many times over
strangegraphics asound agameplay blasting appeal bim sure by now you know the sonic  splitup thing which i dint like
but maby this isnt too bad
i see some benifets in the sonic   knuckles split
 sonic and knckles has a blue sphere mini game buildt in
 if sonic  and knuckles were  game they may have used the sonic  theme and knuckles theme insted of the sonic and kuckles theme and knuckles theme which are way better but its not that big of deal
 you can play as knuckles in sonic  wich is enjoyable
 you for the first time ever see super tails if you connect sonic  to it
the only bad thing i can say really is if you have sonic   kuckles connected to a game genie it as tall as a building
and i cant imagine how tall it would be if you have a x on your genesis with sonic  and knuckles and a game genie in the slot
sonic and knuckles also for some reason has no save slots if sonic  isnt hooked up
but other than that its a great game
do not hesitate to buy iti wondered if there ever was a hidden reference to the american political system with these two sonic being blue knuckles being red i also bet i am reading way into this lolanyways onto this review this is one of the best sonic games ever made right up there with the legendary sequel to the first game and also the mind blowing sonic d blast
the worlds are very detailed and the music in some of the levels are really good like lava reef and death egg zone to name  of my favorites
the game is designed very similar to sonic  with a subboss in the middle followed by the mustache maniac robotnick
the fact that you can lock it onto sonic  makes it that much more enjoyable and makes sonic  that much longer
you lock it onto sonic  and now you can enjoy all those classic zones as knuckles and discover new secrets about the gameone of the best in the sonic series and highly recommended to anybody who likes adventure gamessonic  knuckles
the fourth sonic game on the genesis or nd half of the third if you prefer to call it thatonce upon a time sega became a worthy bit contender in the early s thanks to the release of a fastpaced adventure starring everyones favorite blue hedgehog sonic
then the series really took off in  with the release and success of its sequel
the sega cd harbored sonic cd a worthy cult classic though for some reason it became forgotten over time
this brings us to hedgehog day of  when sonic  was unleashed on the public
originally the game was slated to be one massive adventure but in order to meet deadlines sega decided to cut it in half give the fans the first part of the game early on and save the rest of it for a later date in the year
in the meantime sega also thought about incorporating a special lockon feature to this second half of the rd sonic game which allowed one to stick sonic  and  on top of it and it would change the game to a certain degree
of course lock on technology was nothing new cough game genie cough but this was the first time that it was incorporated for a specific purpose more of which ill get into soonso this time sonic must traverse the rest of angel island after bringing down the death egg again onto a volcano and stop dr robotnik once and for all
however tails is gone for this round in place of being able to play as knuckles the echidna for the first time
he taunted and tricked you all throughout sonic  but now you can rip through the stages as him or get your revenge on him at last with sonic
either way sk holds up as its own giant adventure with the same size of levels graphics engine powerups and other features as the previous game
ive covered the basics of the game in my sonic  review so ill just go into the new stuff hereproslocking onto the older games gives them a new fresh replayability
stick it onto sonic  and now youre traversing the casino nights hill tops and wing fortresses of old as knuckles given the advantage of his new abilities
however stick it onto sonic  and youll get the massive adventure that sega wanted to release all along  in other words the biggest and best sonic game ever conceived
play as all three of the furballs going through both games and collecting 
chaos emeralds to become hyper sonic
on top of that stick it onto sonic  or any other genesis game and youll now have access to unlimited random special stages styled from sonic knuckles is a nice alternative to play as from the others
he doesnt fly like tails or jump as high as sonic but his glide climbing and smashy fists enable him to reach places that the others cant get to
plus a lot of the areas of certain zones that you traverse are completely different from sonicscool new bonus stages
there are two of them now and are far easier to access as well
one is an energy sphere magnetic place where you have to reach the top and the other is a combination of casino night zone from sonic  and the special stages of sonic excellent music here
id forgotten how awesome sks music actually is and is overall a step up from sonic s
none are bad here and they seem closer to sonic s soundtrack especially the flying battery sky sanctuary and death egg themesthe zones are varied from previous games
yes there is another volcano zone but now you can explore new areas like the massive tombs of sandopolis the flying ruins of sky sanctuary and the inner sanctums of the giant death egg ship
plus now you get to take out the giant flying battery ship which attacked you near the beginning of sonic  strangely this seems to be the only sonic game without a water zone which renders the bubble shield useless but oh well
in contrast you will find more use out of the fire shield thoughperhaps the best final bosses of any sonic game
there are a bunch of them to take out near the end and when you collect all the chaos emeralds you can go through a special doomsday zone as super sonic
plus knuckles has more difficult versions and some original bosses of his own to fight so it never gets boringconssince this is technically the other half of sonic  there isnt a whole lot of new stuff for sonics adventure
pretty much sonic has all the same attacks animations and powerups as in sonic  and now with tails gone his reaching abilities are hindered
his absence is fixed however by locking it onto sonic the save feature from sonic  is sorely missed
with as massive as the levels are being able to save after sandopolis zone act  would be nice but again this problem is remedied after locking it onto sonic no change of special stages here
basically these new ones are simply styled after the sonic  sssdont let the  stars deter you at all
sk is certainly one of the most memorable sonic games of all and if you liked sonic  then i see no reason for you not to like this one
as a whole sonic   knuckles deserves its full  stars so whether you want to find their original carts or just play them on pc or the new sonic mega collection find them any way you can because these are some of the best d games that defined an age of gaming
gotta juicelike sonic the hedgehog  this game is enjoyable but feels incomplete
to get a truly full experience it is best to couple this with the sonic the hedgehog  game for a full gaming experience because on their own these two games dont quite reach stars
this game is also fun to be played with sonic  and the graphics in this game are just as visually impressive as those to be found in sonic  overall this game is a lot of fun to play whether by itself or with sonic  or i like side scrolling fighting games i find the graphics very colorful i felt that it was a little too hard to finish heres what im talking about you have to play the game on a highrer diffculty level just to finish the game completely  not playtwo thirds of the game  telling you to try the hard level your going have to do so if you want the true ending get the best ending possible especially when it comes to mr x you have to beat him within a certain time limit  the characters fighting styles were very impressivea true arcade classic and a true classic on the genesis as well
while its a bit scaled down when compared directly with the arcade versions graphicssound however the soundtrack to the genesismegadrive is superior
the individual who composed the music for this game did a very good job
its also about one of the few areas where this version beats the snes version which has really good graphics for a bit version
this game is very easy to figure out particularly the first few stages
the third stage is a bit tougher just rememmber to focus on the hk airs flying machines and not the endoskeletons
you have a decent amount of weapons in this game the first half of the game you have a particle beam rifle that you can upgrade with plasma energization where in the later levels you could upgrade your basic rapid fire weapon to a gattling gun
your secondary weapon also changes from a rocket launcher in the begining of the game to a shotgun
this game is a lot of fun and its really fun with  players
the only really flaw of this game is it is freakin hard
there are a few stages that i swear are impossible or just so hard i havent had the time or patience to figure out why i havent beatin it yet
though this is a really awesome game and so is its snes counterpartabout ten years ago when terminator  was a blockbuster smash hit at the movies midway released a light gun shooter in arcades later on it made its way to bit home systems
terminator  the arcade game is still as fun as it was all those years ago i still own it and play it now and then and still get a kick out of it
you get to blast away hordes of terminator endoskeletons in the first few levels as you play as a resistance fighter in the future than you get to play as the t in the present where you get to protect the young john connor destroy all of cyberdyne systems and eventually face off with the t
all in all if you still own this game hold onto it it is still as fun as it was yesterday and is a better game than the recently released terminator dawn of fateshipping was slow
paid for expedited but somehow got sent to wrong sorting facility but seller refunded me the extra price of the faster shipping
so was very pleased with their customer service
it said the tag was clean but the sticker was ripped off and had the name written in sharpie which they had  games advertised and i paid extra for the one with the better name tag on it but it looks like they sent me the other cheaper one they had advertised but im still happy with it
love the game played it when i was young
glitches from time to time but like i said still a good gamemortal kombat for the sega was much better than the snes version for a very simple but almost crucial part of the game the blood could be unlocked
the game came in the censored version but if you knew the code you could get the real thing and thats why mk on sega was just betterthe graphics werent as smooth as snes but that could easily be overlooked because of the blood code and being able to get the real deal
and of course how do you go wrong with the original characters
cage kano liu kang scorpion subzero raiden and sonya plus the sorceror shang tsung and the mighty  armed goro
along with test your might challenges the mirror match where you fight yourself and two on matches the original mk tested your ability for what it wasif you owned the sega you needed mortal kombat theres really no excuse for you to not have this game
so really pick up mk and also check out super street fighter ii the new challengers streets of rage and even ballz
just whatever you do skip eternal championsmortal kombat good stuff the fighting engine wasnt the best but you could mix it up theres a lot people that think this was the best port i agree
this game was awesome in the arcades mainly because of blood and gore take it away mk is not mk
so nintendo as much as i liked mario zelda contra among others the snes version sucked  grey sweat edited fatalities oh i love it when snes fanboys bring color palett graphichs dont make the gameplay does
snes gameplay you have to be cheap trip trip trip toss throw oh btw its really buggy  glitchy so snes version was crap
there was a sega cd version that was definitely better than the genesis version better music not that the genesis version had bad music but sega cd was a better version so if you have the sega cd just get the cd version bur the gen  cd version both play like the mk shouldi remember being   spending insane quarters with my best friend on this arcade
we couldve probably used those quarters to buy a arcade ha ha when mortal kombat was coming to the home consoles sega genesis  super nintendo snes i was very excited
i had  still have both systems
i chose to get this game on the genesis first
it was great
finally being able to play this groundbreaking fighter at home
mortal kombat has  characters raidenscorpionkanosubzeroliu kangsonya johnny cage
each character has a fatality which you can do after winning  rounds
characters also have trademark moves much like its competition street fighter  this version of mk is has pros and conspros fun gameplayeasy controls especially with a  button controllerblood code which enables blood  the acrade fatalitiesthe code is abacabb
do this while there is a screen explaining mks history stone looking screen with a bunch of wordsfastfluid action game movementcons sound is slightly less quality than the snes versionthe graphics are not as crisp or arcade accurate compared to snes versionoverall this game is a good addition to your collection
its still fun to this day
though it has definitely aged a bit it is yrs old afterall
its replay value is going to be mostly in gamplay against your friends or familythe original mortal kombat on genesis was a decent port at the timethe gameplay was alot better compared to the snes versionit had a cool cheat menu and of courseit had the blood and gore that the fans loved so muchit does fall short in a few areas thoughfor onethe graphics were not that greatespecially compared to the snes versionthere were also animations missing in the genesis version as wellthere were little flawslike subzero not having his original stancebut looking like a blue colored version of scorpionthe music is pretty goodthere are some missing soundssuch as fatality or johnny cage wins
overallthe genesis version is fun to playand its still a really good gameif you can ignore the little flaws that it hasbut if you want mk for the good graphicsanimations and all the soundspick up the snes version insteadthis controller worked out very well for me and was easy to use
it is a pretty solid gaming systemonly a year after phantasy star through its relative obscurity established itself as a landmark amongst rpgs of the era its sequel accomplished much of the same
phantasy star ii set  years after the first game again proved that sega was the company going that extra mile to provide gamers with quality entertainmentthe setting returned the algol star system with its three unique planets three primary races and mixture between the mystical and technological
the epic story added another layer as rolf descendant of the heroine alis finds himself pitted against an immeasurable threat in order to restore prosperity to algo
some time following the defeat of king lassic a technological marvel was created to supplement the struggling ecosystem on the world of motavia
previously little more than desert with a scattering of towns the advent of the mother brain super computer transformed motavia into a world bristling with vegetation and new wildlife
but something went wrong
the biosystems lab responsible for breeding animals suited to the new environment suddenly began to produce dangerous monsters complete departures from the engineering of normal animalsrolf working as an agent out of the town of paseo is commissioned by the governorgeneral to retrieve the labs data recorder which would provide some insight as to what was causing this bizarre malfunction
teaming up with nei  a mysterious girl he met three months earlier who bears traits of both human and animal rudo  a hunter who kills biomonsters to avenge his slaughtered family and amy the doctor who in the name of science wants to determine the cause of the troubles as well rolf sets out to the biosystems lab
what he discovers there only raises many more questions and thus does his quest truly begin as it seems the malfunction may very well stem from mother brain itself
meeting several other characters along the way each with their own stake in this fated quest rolf must uncover a dark secret one which extends into the depths of history and even beyond the algol star systemphantasy star ii welcomed back the innovations of its predecessor along with adding a few of its own
whereas in the original phantasy star ally attacks were represented by slashes and shots from a first person perspective phantasy star ii shows the characters fully animated on screen delivering a variety of attacks from sword slashes to shot gun blasts slasher throwing to technique casting
phantasy star ii also drastically increased the number of techniques at each characters disposal presenting over  to the original phantasy stars with an interchangeable team of  characters only  deployable at a time players had to determine which to choose for each new situation
unlike the rpgs of today where there is little balance and all characters can be souped up to godlike strength if you have the patience phantasy star iis characters had their strengths and weaknesses proving useful under certain conditions and useless in others
for example hugh the biologist at higher levels can cast a wide array of techniques which can harm or cripple biomonsters
however these same techniques do absolutely nothing to machinetype enemies
this is where kain the wrecker comes in utilizing his arsenal of techs which lay the mechanical minions to wastephantasy star ii also still stands as one of the most challenging games ever created
its dungeons were so massive sprawling and complex in fact that the strategy guide was included
you would be hard pressed to find anyone today willing to tackle the games labyrinthine dungeons without those convenient maps right beside them
even with the maps they took a good deal of labelling and figuring out in order to proceedphantasy star ii also prevented the common strategy of maxing out your characters for the maximum level was  while reaching this level did give you a much better chance at defeating the final boss it did not make it so easy that the challenge was eliminated completely
afterall one of the bosses has abilities that prove terribly effective no matter how strong your characters are
weve all seen poison paralysis and sleepbut how many enemies have you seen crush a character with their own despair or instill greed within them making them use their turn to steal other characters items
once again yuji naka proved that quality gaming lie in innovation presenting the world with another gem
phantasy star ii managed to keep gamers enthralled and in a high state of anticipation for its sequel which would be released a mere  years later
it would be enough to establish a massive fan base in both the east and the west for as the genesiss first rpg it quickly gained the recognition it deservedthis is an excellent game for the old sega genesis keeping in line with the cool phantasy star series
this one is the best on the genesis though so if you must choose one this is the game to getits much better than phantasy stars  and  in just about every way
i wont even comment on  though that game was just a poor excuse for a sequel im afraid
anyway though phantasy star  keeps tradition with the technological setting the cool techno music stylish anime graphics and unique storylinesthe characters are quite interesting as well particularly alis and rune
i dont have too much to say about the game unfortunately since i happened to have a defective copy
however from what i did play of it it was definitely the best in the series for the genesis at leastive had to buy this game four times over the years
but this copyi almost had the feeling it was my old copy if not for the fact that i still have my old case and instructions
a great game that sega could have made better if they hadnt scrapped their original designswhat a classic
this shows nearly all the poor genesis rpgs with a few exceptions how an rpg should be made
it has brilliant characters some great bad guys zio can you get cooler
and fills a lot of gaps in the excellent except for ps overall phantasy star storyline
if ure thinking about getting a genesis for old times sake get this and shining force  as they really are its two best gamesthis is one of the easier atlus games so i was able to make it through several stages before getting stumpedpros most of the in game functions can be done via touch screen the main character can change outfits in order to use different abilities there are a variety of weapons in the game the game is difficult enough to be challenging but not so much so that it isnt fun combat takes place in real time using the stylus to control the main character with an attack and defense modecons the design of the touch screen controls makes it difficult to switch between atkdef modes when you tap an npc options to attack him appear right next to the talk command
ive lost count of the number of times that i have accidentally killed npcs this way all of your stats level up with use eg
getting hit increases your hp
and to beat some bosses you have to grind up your stats the outfits that unlock your elemental powers are kind of hidden which means you can miss them
this can be problematic because your elemental powers also level up through use so if you miss an outfit and find it later that elemental power will be severely under leveled compared to your other abilities to recover you eat food
unfortunately your character has to digest his food before he can eat again
this takes between  and  minutes in real time the first boss is annoying because you wont have any recovery magic yet and you wont be able to eat enough food to absorb the bosss damageit took awhile but finally completed the game
although contact doesnt really require you to spend  to  hours to complete it
you can probably should do more than just run through the game
otherwise you are liable to miss out on some cool sidequests and other items that you would miss
you are controlling terry or whatever you name him as he has washed up on a beach on deserted island
the professor and his pet make contact with him waking him up after hes collapsedhe gives you this way of contacting and coming back to the ship you will also be able to heal yourself with other decals that he comes across and gives to youyou will also be able to collect different decals mostly from monster drops and attach them thereby gaining a bonus in whatever the decal says
you can equip up to four of them at onceyour goal is basic at first and that is to collect this cells that the professor needs to power the ship
it is innocent enough for awhile but hes not being totally honest which youll find out later in the game
you have many skills vocational fishing lockpickingthief cooking and proficiencies in the many different weapons that youll collect types slashing striking and punching
using the different weapons will up your skill in those areas
he is also able to cast different types of magic earthwaterfirewind and their secondary skills in each of those areas as wellyou will also build up terrys statsstrength up it by attackingdefense getting hit helps heredexterity hitting fast enemies ups thisagilitywisdom using different magic boosts thisstamina again taking damage ups thisspeed spend some time running around to boost thisalso personality statsfame defeating enemiescourage defeating stronger enemies than himkarma self explanatoryit seems like a lot but once you start playing the game things will flow along pretty quickly
main goal is collecting the cells but you run across others trying to do the same as you
youll cross paths and battle from time to time and as you collect the cells you are able to venture out further and further to other islands and what not
very enjoyable pretty straight forward as long as you build up your character along the way you should have no problem beating whatever the game throws at youso give contact a try and play it through straight forward or take the path less travelled and take your time through it
either way its a journey thats worth taking and a well done game in its own rightthanks atlusthis is a weird little game
its crazy unique and so incredibly fun and addictive its insane
if you like earthbound and killer seven youve just found their love childit is a fun little game i recommend it as a gift story is simple and easy to understand and it works have fun playing it if you get oneim a fan of the spiderman franchise
after getting this game i was looking for it to be really fun and exciting
i can definitely say that i wasnt disappointed
thanksspiderman  venom separation anxiety is the sequel to the fan adored genesis hit maximum carnage
releasing as late in the genesis lifecycle as  this is a quality beat em up game through and through
both games play similarly enough as to make separation anxiety immediately recognizable as a direct sequel though there are some very notable differences between both gamesseparation anxiety is definitely a much more accessible game than maximum carnage
this is aided by the fact that the game runs on a password system while maximum carnage opted for the out of continues
then you lose
go all the way back to the beginning school of design
if you found maximum carnage to be too tough a game then separation anxiety is probably for you
on the other hand if you want more spiderman beat em up goodness then separation anxiety is still probably the game for youthe controls are a bit more forgiving this time around as the developers were probably being cautious of all of the times inexperienced maximum carnage players would inadvertently pick enemies up and not be able to move for a second or two all the while being vulnerable to a barrage of enemy attacks
the combat here runs a hair slower in direct comparison and you have to be much more precise with both your screen placement and web shooting antics to connect your hits
however this is still a solid beat em up that controls much like youd expect and for my money is a smoother playing game than the critically lauded streets of rage or final fight seriesyou can choose to either play as spiderman or venom from the start and the game also supports a really well implemented coop mode
the coop is enough to recommend this game by itself since thats something maximum carnage was sorely missing
this isnt to say separation anxiety is the better game of the two thoughpersonally what made maximum carnage so endearing and memorable to me was its absurd difficulty
if you didnt know the placement of virtually every secret room in the game chances are you never saw its ending
playing the game for countless hours upon hours though and finally completing it down to my very last life and continue is still one of the greatest memories i have from gaming
no other moment from playing video games had my heart racing as muchthis is something severely missing from separation anxiety
the game doesnt feel as hightension at all times
it feels as though its lenient on mistakes when one mistake in maximum carnage could have lead you to start the entire game over from the beginning
all of this is due to the password system honestly and im sure if you want that hugely tough challenge that maximum carnage offered you could opt to ignore the password
the problem being this makes the game virtually unplayable as the continue system is done away with here
you start the game with  lives and thats it
no continues at all so you better get used to writing those passwords downthe visuals in separation anxiety fare well for a genesis beat em up
we dont have the flashing lights and insane color palette of the streets of rage games but separation anxiety boasts extremely smooth character animations
every animation here is fluid and is done in a stylized way that makes the characters appear if they leaped right out of a cartoon
it looks fantastic
the actual character sprites on the other hand are a downgrade from maximum carnage
theyre a lot smaller and not nearly as detailed and clearly this was done for the sake of squeezing in as much animation as possible
its a trade off that does work and it all comes down to which visual style you preferthe levels here are more varied than those that maximum carnage offered since its nice to see environments that arent city streets for the first  or  levels of the game
there are parks which unfortunately look like forests bridges to traverse laboratories to fight your way through and even some shopping mall levels that employ elevators into the level design
there are also some branching paths in these levels which could potentially lead you to finding extra lives or what the manual calls cameo appearancesthese cameos allow you to call in an ally to aid you in your fight and there are four of them in total
ranging from captain america to ghost rider these allies work just the same as they did in maximum carnage
they all have specific uses but to a lesser degree this time around
you can virtually clear every enemy of the screen with any given ally which is a shame as i thought the ally system in maximum carnage was handled wonderfully
knowing which characters worked for certain situations was a blast to figure out
again this is sorely missing from separation anxietythe soundtrack here is good for what it is yet theres no way it could top the awesome green jelly music from maximum carnage
that being said i do enjoy the soundtrack here and i probably wouldnt have been disappointed at all with it if i hadnt played maximum carnage first
the sound effects for combat are much better this time around thoughessentially thats how a lot of this game comes off to me
its maximum carnage with some downgrades
that isnt to say some things werent improved mind you
the coop play is a great time the password system could be considered a godsend to some and the branching paths in levels are awesome to see
it just doesnt have the same brutal difficulty or charm of its predecessor
that being said it is a great game in its own right by all means
the visuals are great the music does sound good for the genesis and all in all its an enjoyable beat em up experience
its not quite up there with maximum carnage and possibly not as good as spiderman vs the kingpin but it is a great beat em up game and a great spidey game by all accountsid say for the most casual player they could do without this one in their collection when maximum carnage definitely has more appeal to it
for hardcore spidey fans or genesis collectors though you could do a lot worse than this especially in the beat em up genre
its a solid game and id recommend it to fans or collectors
you wont be disappointed with it
even as an inferior sequel its still a fun time and if you havent played maximum carnage im sure youll enjoy this game much more
dont let the negatives deter you from picking this game up
the positives outweigh the negatives by a long shot and this is simply a fun game to pick up and play
it isnt perfect but it is some great fun especially if youre playing it with a friend on the couchi was disappointed with how primitive the nes was but i still wanted to get into retro gaming
so i picked up a genesis
good system
obviously
but nowhere near perfecthardware the core  looks pretty cool
the games play well thanks to quality hardware
cartridges work the first time most of the timecontroller the controller feels great
unfortunately the  buttons thing is strange
when sega made these controllers did they do it to have more buttons than an nes
on games like street fighter this can be bothersomesound music is good most the time but voice recordings are terrible
they all sound the same in all games
its a good thing the genesis has a lot of good games with good songsgraphics excellent
i have no complaints
no annoying sprite flicker however some games do have frame rate dropsgame library games like street fighter ii ce the sonic trilogy and the numerous beat em up games are great
but to me the selection isnt very appealing
yes there are many many great games but they arent always in plain site when browsing the library of gamesfun factor as long as the game your playing isnt overly complicated or requires six buttons you should have a good time
however there are some extremely hard and unfair games toooverall good system but has a limited controller bad voice audio and has a semiappealing libraryi think i sold this eventually or something
it is nice sleek but the first model has way more appeal and functionality
a freakin audio jack almost implying it can play music files
a lot of sega genesis games have a menu where you can play the soundtracks used in the game
so if you can get a way to have your sega genesis on while you are walking around  just insert which music you want plug your headphones in and enjoy
a big gaming mp player
also the model  has better default sound it is noticeablewelcome to the first adventure of one of capcoms best series games
you are jill valentine a stars member and you are trying to investigate some strange dissapearances in raccoon city
you can play as jill or chris redfield
you start in the game by going out to the outskirts of the city and see a house a mansion
there is a monster chasing you outside while you investigate thats why you enter the mansion
once you arrive in there you look for things around the house and notice a zombie that ate one of your pals
you kill him and go tell your friend barry burton what went wrong
this game is the hardest of the whole series in my opinion because there are more puzzles and more zombies that are so hard to kill with your weapons
you will go through so many rooms and so many doors and find clues and clues and clues of to whats going on
ill only spoil one part of the game if your new to resident evil
the mansion has a research lab in the back yard that youll find later in the game
the whole mansion and lab belongs to the bio chemical organizationumbrella
i promise though that you will enjoy this gameresident evil  circa good considered classic to many gamers the roots or start of a super popular franchise was really considered too scary to play in its time pretty good story with twists and turnsbad graphics look very dated voice acting is laughably bad controls feel datedwill it fit your taste slow moving survival horror game which is more about moving boxes managing items and unlocking doors then actually fighting for your life a scfi horror game set in a kooky old mansion filled with zombies huge spiders and sharksgame its most assocated too silent hill dino crisis alone in the darkadditional notes there have been a few remakes of this game on ps such as a version where you can use a duel shock controller and a version that is a director cut there was also a really really good remake for the nintendo game cube in japan resident evil is called biohazarda series of gory attacks in the area surrounding a remote biotech lab brings in stars
special tactics and rescue squad to investigate
on arrival bravo team communications are abruptly cut off
now its up to your team
you arrive at the isolated mansion underpowered and on the run
arm yourself with anything you can find knives pistols shotguns flamethrowers  search for hidden rounds to stay alive
there are puzzles to solve traps to disarm and mysteries to uncover while trying to avoid a bloodbath with the freaks of nature that populate the mansion
each lurking horror you survive will bring you closer to the source of the resident evilhi allknowing this collection of namco games was rather rare i was fortunate to find this game on amazon being sold by someone for a very reasonable pricethe collection is a trip back in time for all including the games super pacman xevious mappy grobda dragon buster and gaplusmy personal favorites are super pacman gaplus and mappy three well known games
xevious should be fairly well known as well though i am not sure of grobda and dragon buster
i personally have never heard of them before seeing this collectionsuper pacman gaplus mappy and xevious are basically the original arcade versions and play like it
the other two as i am unfamiliar with them are more difficult to rate though they are decent games to playthe one negative with this collection is the relatively slow load times between switching games
one annoying thing and not the fault of the game is the inability of the game to use the ps analog controller forcing me to use the directional controlsbut the game is still worth a buy if you can track it downthe title says it all
if youre an arcade completist like me this disc contains one of the few home versions of gaplusgalaga  as far as i can i tell it is the original arcade version
the other games have been released on other compilations but this disc is a worthy buy for gaplus alonethis game is one of my favourite rpgs
it has a very crude feeling in graphics and basically everything is crude but that made it more fun and adventurous
its very difficult to compare i agree with the others who said it is not like final fantasy and has gameplay and grinding comparable to dragon warrior
you choose one of seven adventurers trained by king lemele to gather the seven runes and gain ultimate power
choosing your adventurer means you are not choosing the other six who will show up again and again as you compete for the runesi know the difficulty is very high but that is part of the charm of the game if you will
you can always improve your level by grinding
one of the interesting components is that the other six adventurers always have the same level as your main character except your companion can differ when you choose one of the six as your companion
there are a very few times where you have to fight one of the others over the runes
so it becomes a challenging boss fight that you cant level up before completing
leveling up before this fight may make it more difficult
also if you lose to another adventurer they will take all your runes
i always reset my game if that happened because the runes provide a lot of combat benefits increased defence magic healing and trying to fight the counterpart without the help of the runes is a suicide missionyou will probably have to try to go through the dungeons several times in order to succeed
this is part getting an idea of the layout and part were you lucky enough to not get wiped out by monsters before reaching the boss
the music and sound effects are crude and loud
i might even say blaring
but this isnt a bad thing
the tunes are very catchy
the feeling is not annoying but more like a busy marketplace
the story is simple yet very satisfying as you watch it slowly developone more thing always remember to defend first then attack
this will temporarily increase your hpattack power
 the first rpg i played where the end boss battle was not all about who has the most healing potions and the highest health points but actually having to use a little thinking in the ways the runes are used
i also have to say that this game has sooo many random battles its crazy but i loved the replay value in it that you could play as the different characters
you can choose to be a host of different characters but depending o who you choose can make the game difficult or easy
i had chosen to be the demon first time around so it had made the game challenging  since no one wanted to pair up or help me  or they would steal your rune one you got it but you could get it back later but that is what made it funi can remember playing this game in the early s
i remember it being rather direct in where to go but i remember the fight system being odd compared to many rpgs in the day
i used to have trouble getting far
there is quite a bit of time devoted to leveling and building your characters
i also remember playing the demon most of any of the characters
i found it fun but i didnt play much devoting more time to final fantasy  and   i forget the numbers in the original sequence but remember the snes na numbers
i was also playing shadowrun quite a bit at the time
however with all that said about memories th saga is a game worth playing and spending time exploring
the games overall flow is more like dragon warrior then final fantasy which is very refreshing
the fact that each character has a different focus gives each person something to enjoy
pick a copy up
you will enjoy spending some time in a classic snes rpgyeah i had trouble coming up with a decent introduction line
how can i explain what actraiser is like
honestly i dont have any experience with simulation type games
this is the only one i have ever played and its not even completely sim according to all the reviews
its only part simwhen i was a young kid and the super nes was just released i loved looking through the pictures in this one big gaming magazine i had and seeing which games i wanted to buy
this is one of the games i wanted but for some reason it took me  years to eventually get the chance to play it
i guess this had to do with me losing interest in video games for a few years
the spark has returned though so dont fear for i am backnow as i was saying i didnt bother with actraiser when it was originally released
the type of friends i had at the time didnt think simulation type video games were cool and since back then friendship was so extremely important to me i ignored the game
a part of me really wanted to play this game in the early s but damn it peer pressure
maybe it was for the best maybe not
i cant go back in the past to find out if id made the right decision
i probably wouldnt have liked the game back then anyway
it took me until my early s to become openminded to things i previously wrote off immediately so i can only assume i would have shut down a simulation type game right away in my childhood and teenage years
my friends were pretty cool despite thisim an adult now and im finding out things about this game that i didnt know  years ago
one such thing as people frequently point out this is one of if not the very first video game to mix simulation with side scrolleraction gameplay
playing this game it does feel like im playing something original but i find it funny how people werent aware of it back in   i can only guess because so many creative ideas were being thrown around back then in the world of video games that an innovation of mixing sim with action was so small and insignificant at the time and so people didnt care or didnt noticepeople back then were too busy having fun and throwing parties for games like super mario bros  super mario world and zelda link to the past games that were really groundbreaking and people probably werent paying much attention to actraisers little unique featuresbut as i mention above i havent even bothered with any other simtype game so this is my first and only experience with this kind of genre
the sim parts of this game which cover about  different lands feel extremely simple
you are an angel and you fly around shooting monsters and building towns
the entire point of this part of the game is to create towns and destroy monster lairs with your arrows so you can gain points and become stronger for the action part of the game
you also talk to people along the way and to be honest sometimes its an inconvenience because sometimes they have a lot of information they want to give to youbut many times they give you items important items which can be used for either another area of the land during the townbuilding parts or for the action parts of the game
youll eventually see that all the items the townspeople are giving to you can either be extremely helpful when fighting bosses or extremely important for progressing to another part of the landthe music is interesting
i think all the best music is featured during the action part of the game and the music that plays during the simulation part of the game can get pretty boring after a while
the bosses you will encounter are very fun to fight and some of them are slightly challenging but i have yet to come across a boss that was really hard
they all have a pattern and the pattern you need to defeat them is usually something like finding a safe place to stand waiting for the boss to come near you and then slash away at him until hes defeated
but its still fun because the bosses have cool attacks and they look amazing
dont give up if you have trouble defeating a boss
sometimes it takes a few tries but eventually you should find the pattern and once you find it you will have no problem defeating them the next time you play the gamei especially love that boss where you are located on a series of ledges with a river behind you and you have to face a giant flying snake
i also love going through the volcano leveli should also mention that during the action part of the game you arent the angel anymore
i guess your character is god
sounds crazy but i think its true
i really dont know
my game didnt come with an instruction manuel
supposedly you can make the bosses even easier by using some kind of special magical move on them but i havent figured out how to do it yet
i mean i know its the a button that delivers the special move such as a fireball in one instance but you collect these special moves during the simulation part and i cant figure out how to bring those moves to the action part of the game
theres gotta be a wayoh yeah the music
back to the music
if you like the music in this game check out the old rock band genesis
no not the genesis with phil collins as the lead singer the genesis of the early s with peter gabriel on vocals
that band has music that reminds me of some of the level themes in this game
check out the foxtrot or nursery cryme albums to see what i meanthis game sure makes me feel all magical inside
maybe its the release of the new harry potter movie a few months ago that got me all excited to review this game i dont know
but according to many reviewers this game is unique in the way it mixes two separate types of video games simulation and action
the sim areas all feel very simple to me and thats probably the point
the action part while containing some rather tricky jumping movements awkward play control
is still the part i enjoy mostthe graphics could have been better but we cant complain about a game that came out in the beginning of the super ness successful run now can we
at the time we didnt know the system would soon release so many classicsif this game is going for less than  bucks you must buy
there must be something in this game for you to enjoy
i still find it creepy when i save my game shut the super nes off come back later turn the super nes on that angel asks me if i got enough rest
how did that guy know i was restingi grew up playing act raiser and loved it as a child
i recently downloaded the title on my wii via the virtual console
the game still holds it own even to this day
what separates this game for most is the mix between sim city and d action
the game features different areas that first require a d action level to be completed
upon completion a city needs to be built
as the city grows new abilities are discovered and new ares can be reached
the new areas feature more d action followed by more city building
each area has a unique landscape and basic story
overall the game is just unique and well balanced
excellent titleone of the cool things about this game is that you have both actionsidescrolling with killing monsters with your sword and a sim cityesque worldbuilding game six cities total with two action levels for both it might not be for everyone but i have played it several times through and have genuinely enjoyed it
it also helps to maximize your potential to rack up points in the action parts not too much to ask for for a total of at least  points between the two levels for any one city
its not overly complicated and i do wish there had been more cities and stuff but for a snes game this was pretty enjoyable
its worth a try if you like simstyle games with actionyet another fun enix action rpg with a creation theme
you play as a god who must clear various countries of monsters using d platforming segments and then build your civilizations using a very basic simtype of development systemwhen i first purchased the super nes back in  this was one of the first platform games that i had my eyes on
i had already beaten adventure island  and  for the nes so when i tried this one i was extremely disappointed with how short and linear the entire game was
this is the only downside about the game and that is why i gave it  stars and not the  that it truly deserveswhat i do love about this game however is the awesome catchy bouncy and euphoric musical soundtrack
i honestly cant get enough of it and that is the main reason why i continue to play this game at least once a year
the graphics enemies and locales have also been updated quite well
its just too bad that hudson soft didnt bother to create a cd soundtrack for the entire adventure island series ie
the nes super nes and game boy  its much too good to pass upin the end i still recommend super adventure island to all gamers but as i stated before you might get much more meat and potatoes out of adventure island  through  for the nesst ill say this in no way has anything to do with the the arcade game that was made by capcom this is by activision and this game was made in  avp arcade came out in  both beat em ups  totally different stories
this game was quite good and you basically go around and beat up aliens fight guardian aliens some ive never seen before but hey the newer alien vs predator games tend to add there own alien guardians
some of the the bosses like the alien queen are cheap
not a great beat em up but still pretty good
better than the jag version where everyone including the predator and alien is in first person viewi really like this video game in some strange ways
not because it has awesome graphics graphics are ok amazing controls controls are choppy and cool music for a game with an snes soundchip its ok but this game still rocks
i remember when i was very young i saw it at some video rental place and then i tried it
i am a huge fan of both the aliens and the predator characters so i was pleased by that
this game is almost like maxximum carnage as its a beatem up game but you fly solo through out it being only one player
you have spears throwing discs wrist blades and of course your legendary shoulder cannon
there is a trick to beating the hordes of aliens that attack you through out this game and once you figure out the right attack combinations your all set
the levels are pretty long and the bosses are one of the coolest facet of the game they look like the figures from the aliesn action figures from back in the day
though i did say this game had a few flaws like choppy controls the graphics were kinda cheap and not very impressive and the music in some of the levels was cool but had a very cheesey sound in some of the stages
still a great game and one of the best on snesbefore i get started let me put a guideline for how i use the stars
 means its great or perfect  means its good but could be better  means it has potential that it doesnt use but its still a decent game  means the game does nothing for me and  means i hate the game with a passionthat being said lets get startedi never played the sega cd or game gear versions of the game so i cant judge thosei think the super nes version is the best one ive played
it has nice tunes fairly good finalfightor double dragonstyle gameplay tight controls and the graphics arent bad eitherthe game could have benefited from extras such as a playable catwoman but im not going further down that road in this reviewunlike most of the other batman games this one actually contains music from its movie counterpart
i dont know if its digital or midi but it sounds goodfor its time this was probably the best batman game to have come out on any of the classic systems and it remained to be the best one up until arkham asylum came out for the newer generation of system ps  
the game play didnt always remain repetative and you can use various batman gadgets in this game and it was overall pretty fun
it gets somewhat difficult as you progress but its still fun and still the greatest classic batman game
if youre into older games and have a super nes  want a good batman game this is the one to go withi said that the games based off batman returns varied from platform to platform  i will review the sega cd version after this but the snes version was probably the best version it does stick closer to the movie  has great cut scenes for  this version is a beat em up which is not surprising for back in the day its a better beat em up than batman forever on ps
the soundtrack is a good  bit version of danny elfmans score that he did for the movie
it has a batmobile stage which was is ok ill talk about that more in sega cd version which were done better you should pick this  up its a good beat em up on the snes  it shouldnt cost more than   this game kicks a lot of ai always loved beat em up games for snes and this game was one of them
nothing was more satisfying than roaming the streets of gotham beating up bad guys
what made me happy was it was from konami
the controls were easy to master you press the y button rapidly and start kicking butt batman walked a lil quicker and grab opponents to perform excellent combos
its a fun game
i recommend it for any die hard batman fanscastlevania was a standardsetter on the nes
all three nes castlevania games were best sellers and loved by many
now castlevania makes its bit debut on the snes as super castlevania iv and it does not disappoint
great graphics great sound effects and music great gameplay in the style of castlevania  and castlevania  some consider castlevania  to be the best in the series and some killer bit effects
huge bosses and even a rotating room
its one of the best in the castlevania seriesthe short the most cinematic and moody game in the series up until this century
great gameplay and unique use of system technology makes it stand among the best in the series yet its also the shortest it can be beaten in a few hoursthe long the old nintendo castlevanias were great
they had solid gameplay and some of the best graphics for their time and all had a familiar feel and style to them that was addictive and funscv for the super nes carries this tradition making one of the earliest games for the system one of its most classic
an almost ambient moody background score expertly highlights the action and varies well between the different stages
the graphics are very well done and colorful and the gameplay is solid as well
your character has complete whip control in any direction this time and he uses it to swing across chasms and hang from chandeliers like a medieval indiana jonesadding to this is the games exploitation of special effects that were heralded as unique to the system scaling rotation and vertigoinducing tricks make some of the levels truly stand out as innovative and uniquethe only problem is that the game is very short
maybe its my experience as a castlevania player or maybe its just an easy game but the first time i played it i beat it overnight
nowadays its a game i only pick up if i want a couple hours of cinematic castlevania actionits a good game for sure one of the best examples of scoring graphical capability and gameplay
for its around  dollar price its worth picking up if youre a fan of the series or if you just want one of the more fluid snes action games
just stay away from its follow up dracula xlike many early snes games this one basically was a similar remake of the first
once again the player controls simon belmont arguably the most famouse as he once again venutres into draculas castle to battle his nemesis
this time the castle is much larger with many more traps and dangers awaiting to include a quadruple boss fight in the endthe game layout is level based however within the levels certain routes can be taken not always but sometimes
the bosses varry in difficulty and follow the tradition of many action platformers the easier the level the harder the boss
one key difference between this and many other castlevania titles is that in one level i think level  the room rotates which takes full use of the whip skills
this idea was all the rage in early snes action platformers as games like super ghouls and ghost and super mario world also used this techniqueoverall this is a solid action platformer that is challenging to the gamer but fun at the same timepersonally i found this game fun and i have no idea how these other reviewers can criticize it
this game was my first experience with the series and i had a lot fun with it
who cares what the story is i dont know and definitely dont care beyond all belief
the graphics may be bad but who cares
now i do wish to play final fantasy ii  iii but this final fantasy game gave me a spectacular look at this amazing seriescome on people
lets stop slamming this game and take it for what it is
its a simple basic game designed for little children or others who are completely new to rpgs
this isnt meant for people whove been raised on ff  and now when you take it for what it is its actually pretty cool
 mandatory battles before proceeding is really not that bad compared to random battlesat least this way you can do your fighting and get it over with instead of getting attacked every  steps like in ff or also this game has the absolute best battle music ive ever heard in a final fantasy gamenow the graphics are simple the music is simple the story is very simple everything about this game is simple
its like the sesame street of rpgs and thats exactly what it was designed for
if you just take it for what it is its not that bad at allthis is the first rpg that i had ever played
in that way it was a great introduction although it doesnt hold up so well now that ive played other games in the final fantasy series
this game is very simple as it was meant to be an introductorytype of game
if you like retrogaming though this is worth a look
i thought it was worth my time and i still play it every once and a while all these years lateri would have to say that the constant bashing that this game has received from people is inevitably over a misconception of the way things were for a company trying to succeed in americaim sure that square was grateful to even be on our shores in the early early s it was only about a year or so after final fantasy was released here for the nes
nintendo had to release ff because square was so small at the time that they didnt have the tools to introduce a game overseas on their own
to top it off it was released after ii and iii had already came out on the famicom in japan but thats another story for another timethey needed a strategy that would make more people buy their games and since the snes was about to be launched on our shores it was the pivotal point for them
so they devised a brilliant strategy for its time though a bit of a rude awakening for ff fans and hey it worked
albeit it might not have been necessary due to the massive success that they achieved with the launch of final fantasy ii iv in jpnbut it did something interesting none the less
it taught the next generation of gamers how to play rpgs and in some cases it attracted people that had never played video games before
experienced gamers laugh at it but its simplicity helped the company increase its market when it mattered mosti dont think this game deserves awards or massive praise of any kind
but i do think that if theres a person out there who wants to learn how to play rpgs then this is one of the games that should be played
all in all it was an incredibly average game but the goal it accomplished was anything but average even if that wasnt necessarily squares intentplenty of people didnt like this game and it is different from other final fantasy games the gameplay is more simple and restrained
its better for younger kids and the like so this game is definitely not for everyone but it is worth a try at least initially so give it a try and if after a few minutes you dont like it thats okay just turn it off
one thing that made this game harder was the controls so i cant recommend this game unless youre a diehard final fantasy completisti like this game
i played it many times over and i enjoyed it each time
it is fairly easy to complete not like some of the more complex games i tried to play and couldnt handle
maybe im still just at a beginner level in rpgsthis was actually the fourth installment of the final fantasy series released in japan but as numbers  and  didnt make it to america this was marketed as ff before its debut on the american sneshaving played the original a couple of times i really enjoyed this game
you can easily get this game on an emulator and play on your computer but i highly recommend this game for the game boy advance final fantasy iv advance because the advanced version is basically the same as the game but control has been smoothed out and additional dungeons put in
but even before it was updated for the advance this was a great game and is a true final fantasy classicas much as i love this game it is no where near perfect
if you are a fan of snesera rpgs i would consider this a mustplay and almost certainly a mustown
if you are simply a fan of rpgs or the final fantasy series i would recommend either of the two nintendoconsole remakesfinal fantasy iv advance for the gba advance or final fantasy iv ds for the nds
both games have superior translations as well as the readdition of items and spells which were removed from the game when it ported from the super famicom to the snes
their graphical styles are different however as well as their bonus content and difficulty the gba game feels easier than even the snes versionlargely due to the extra contentwhile the nds game is harder than bothi heartily advise against the psx version of the game which has abominable load times and an unremarkable translationthis one heck of an rpg youll be up at midnight playing this after this awesome experience you should consider getting the sequel final fantasy which is also really awesomealso check out skies of arcadiaalthough this game is called final fantasy  in reality it is actually ff
anyway i didnt start playing final fantasy until just recently ive owned an nes since  but i never even thought of buying final fantasy until i saw a tv show about it on gtv
since then ive played all of the following final fantasy titles final fantasy final fantasy ii final fantasy mystic quest final fantasy vii final fantasy viii final fantasy xi final fantasy i  ii dawn of souls and final fantasy iv advance
out of all of them my favorite title was ffii for the sneswhy
because ffii had the best story and charecters of all of the other final fantasy titles that ive played so far
unlike in ffyou dont choose your players you just start out as one and meet more from therethe heros cecil the dark knight rosa the white mage kain the dragoon cid the engineer yang the monk rydia the summoner tellah the sage edge the ninja and fusoya the sagethe villans golbez the dark wizard  elemental warriors a brainwashed kain and a slew of other enemys each more sinister then the lastthe story gets better and better as the story progresses
i wont spoil it for youbut one of the coolest moments in the game is when cecil discovers that golbez the most fearsom fiend in the game is not the one behind all of the chaos
plus golbezs true identity is revealed
no hes not cecils father
all and all this is my favorite final fantasy so far i highly recomend buying it
but be warned
final fantasy i  ii dawn of souls does not include this title
so if you want to play this and ff youll have to buy them bothfor more details read my review on final fantasy i  ii dawn of souls
enjoyfinal thoughts if you have the money and own a gba check out final fantasy iv advance
its the same game as this one but its been upgraded with all new featureswritten byshadowmage the game maniacthis sequel is just as fun as the original and it includes new things not seen in the first final fight
like the new locations new bosses new weapons a multiplayer feature and a new character
in multiplayer mode you and your friend can beat each other up and kill each other while in coop
the fighting techniques are just as smooth as the original
so if you like retro games this is a musthavethe second installement in the final fight series or the cousin of streets of rage
final fight was like streets of rage for snes back in the day
the gameplay handled much more like an aracde style game than a streets of rage game
streets of rage had a lot of grappling and other special attack tactics
this game lacked that
ff had mostly simple combos and basic clobber everything super attacks
still this game was a lot of fun and had some cool stages here and there
it was produced by capcom so it had a lot of similarities to street fighter some people even wrote it off as a street fighter meets streets of rage kind of hybrid
decent game thoughthis item works very good if u want to beat the game fast and easy
it has a bunch of letters and numbers and etc that u type in to get things in games
the only thing that i have against it is that it is very hard and comfusing to use
it does not even work on half of my gamesit seems everyone who grew up with the super nes will have memories of super ghouls and ghosts and particularly the extreme difficulty
my memory of the game is somewhat blurry and short
in fact i only ever played the game once
to no ones surprise i lost in a few seconds
but it didnt seem like the hardest game ever made or anything
according to people ive talked to i had to play the game for about an hour and then id realize the game was impossibly hardits fascinating how the difficulty hasnt stopped the game from becoming a classic
when i talk to people about the super nes super ghouls and ghosts always comes up
you just dont forget a game like thisanyone who ever played any game in the ghosts n goblins series will tell you that only certain kind of gamers can handle it
only those who thrive on high difficulty intense challenges and hours of grueling game play can withstand it
super ghouls n ghosts is part of that legendary series
super ghouls n ghosts was a classic snes title released in  this game made boys into menand then those same men back into boys
those who knew about the ghosts n goblins series dared to play this gameyou play as arthur a brave knight who sets out to rescue his girlfriendprincess from the clutches of lucifer
you must go through multiple stages and battle many enemies before you face off with the big boss himself
then in a horrific twist you must go through the stages once again and this time you must find a specific weapon
if you do not you will not be able to go all the way
no game messes with the minds of gamers and hits you with intense difficulty quite like the ghosts and goblins games super gng holds up this tradition proudlythe pros this game has great graphics music and sound effects
controls are easy from the get go so no worries since you will be focused on getting through the stages
capcom added a new double jump feature to get through sections of gaps thus added even more variety in the game play
you wont be able to beat the game in one setting so they added a set number of continues and if you get a lot of points you can increase it as wellthe cons if there is one thing that i can say here is that this game is hard
you will not beat this game in a few dozen tries
you will scream
you will get angry
you might break your controller in half
you might end up tossing your super nes against a wall or out the window
if you dont like incredibly and brutally difficult games do not buy this
consider yourself warnedsuper ghouls n ghosts is truly a unique game
on one hand you have a action platform game that is great to play and carries on the reputation of the ghosts n goblins series
on the other hand it is so brutally hard and unforgiving that only certain gamers who thrive off on that stuff will truly enjoy themselves
i cursed the name of the game for every time i played it
and then i went back and tried again
would you feel the same
theres only one way to find outtake a visit to the classic arcade games as you are a knight on a side scrolling zombie  monster killing quest to save your princess from lucifer himself
along the way to lucifer through eight action packed worlds you pick up different weapons like the knives crossbow torch and various others to battle zombies monsters birds magicians wolves skeletons ghosts ghouls and tons of traps
this would be a five star game if it were not for its huge difficulty
hundreds of enemies coming at you no save points when you die you start at the beginning of the level and two hits your dead that spells a short lived play time for younger players
good graphics side scrolling platform gamedo you like to get mad
does a game whosbrutally unfair original nes port spawned an almost equally unfair snes port
do not let this name deceive you this game is really ghosts n goblins in disguise
capcom probably renamed it because they knew everyone still had a grudge against the first one
then people got duped into buying this seemingly different game obviously this wasnt there true motive and people arent that dumb
if you have heard of ghosts n goblins this is actually an easier version but dont think that means youll be dying any lessthis was the first shooter i played on the snes and even to this day its just an all around great game
i have played both this version and the arcade version available on gradius iii and iv for the ps and personally find this port to be more fun
the difficulty of this version was curtailed a bit and allows for more of an enjoyable  experience while still being challenging
while the graphics are good unfortunately this title suffers from some heavy slowdown
although it can be annoying sometimes its not a bad thing and can allow you time to better take view of the hundreds of bullets and enemies coming your way to plan your aerial strategyperhaps my favorite part of the game is the option to customize the powerups for your vic viper at the beginning
in other words instead of choosing between a few predetermined rows of powerups you can change each individual stage and mix and match
for example maybe you want the hawkwind missles but you dont want the laser guns and would rather have the ripple gun
you can change that
gradius iii features all of the goods that the gradius franchise has to offer great powerups imaginative level design a moai stage with giant moai bossand more
if you can find an affordable copy which should not be a problem these days pick it up
it is worth having in your shooter collectionthe game is fun and all plus the music is amazing but what the hell is up with an enemy firing as it dies
when they explode before you know it a projectile is coming at you hidden by the explosion and bam
youre dead
cheap shot and it wastes my lives sometimeslong ago in the ancient city of oedo or was it just edo
ah forget it
heres the scoop
the game is both a  multiscroller meaning you can go up and down as well as left and right and a sidescroller depending on what part of the game you are in
the legend of the mystical ninja is a whacky actionadventure video game and has to be one of the best to hit the super nes
in addition to whacking baddies with a drainpipe wet towel flute or yoyo you get to play lots of fun minigames and travel across ancient japan in search of whatever
i have only four complaints the game can get too hard goemon was renamed kid ying ebisumaru was renamed dr yang and my favorite female ninja yae is not playablesorry if this review seems a little vague
id tell you the storyline but there really isnt onei also recommend pocky and rocky  if you can find itamazon
get your pictures straight
this is not pro evolution soccer i purchased this game since there are not all that many  player snes games out there that are worth playing and the best ones are too expensive
this game is tough but if you and a friend or relative really put the effort in you will probably be able to beat it
it plays a little bit like other rpg games on the snes particularly secret of evermore or illusion of gaia
i only got to level  before i gave up but up to that point it was corny and enjoyable
would recommend for teens on a rainy or cold winter nighti rented this game out one time because it looked fun
you know you have to find mario and save him
as soon as it showed the part where mario dissapears it takes you to a dungeon with around  or  doors
you can go in them in any order
whenever you go in it you come out of a pipe and you are in a city
when you come off the pipe there is one of those things that yoshi eats on the pipe so you cant go back in the dungeon until you get yoshi
this game also teaches you some stuff in each place you go too
the golden gate bridge the eiffel tower etcthe only dissapointing thing about this game is you cant get hurt
its and i really mean it physically impossible to lose
sure its cool you cant die but it takes all the fun out of it
you need a challenge instead of just winning
however there is a slight challenge
in the city there is nowhere to go mainly it all leads to a dead end
there are those paratroopa things running around and on some of them if you step on it theyll drop something but i dont want to spoil it
but i gotta tell you this part about the paratroopas and all is challenging
if you are thinking of buying this game its ok so make sure you dont spend too much on itpilotwings is still the best flight simulator you can find
the challenges are very engaging youll fly numerous aircraft through these obstacles youll get pilot licenses as you go through different instructors and youll have a ton of fun while doing it
this game never really gets old to play and this is one of those kids games that i have not grown out ofi would actually give secret of mana  stars if i could figure out howsecret of mana is a very aesthetically pleasing fun nice game
while all the characters and scenery are done with bright vibrant colors and much of the music is cheery and uplifting there is an underlying theme of sorrow that traces its way through the story in a very complimentary fashion
personally i feel it is a great parallel to what is going on in the real world in the sense that as beautiful and wonderful and mentally absorbing as nature is there are villains behind the scenes who seek to destroy it by using up natural resources
the interactions and dialogue between the games characters in general are somewhat limited for an rpg but the combination of intense visuals and intuitive music along with the heavy natural themes seem to add a layer of depth and understanding that requires no verbal explanation
most of the environments are wilderness areas of some sort and many of the enemies resemble real animals though i suppose they are supposed to be evil versions since you must kill them to earn points
the movements of the mana seeds affect the natural environment directly and spirits representing elements such as fire earth water and wind add an extra level of personification to mother earth
all of these things make you care very much about the outcome of this worlds struggles and about the survival of the mana tree
all in all the atmosphere of this game is fantastic
the pure land i might add is on my top ten list of imaginary places i would love to go andor take up residencemy only real problem with this game is the lack of complexity in the playable characters stories
their beginning and end stories are very interesting but there isnt very much in between they really sort of silently put their heads down and plow through with their duties
while this is an admirable character trait in anyone real life or not it makes the middle part of this game feel more like a singleplayer game than an rpg
i like all of the characters but i wish they had more complicated stories
i also was somewhat baffled at the varied amounts of power orbs available for the different weapons i found myself able to upgrade my javelin higher than i thought possible but my gloves fell short one orb
however i found out recently that the cause for this has to do with random treasure chests towards the end of the game and is not a bug as i had previously thoughtsecret of mana is definitely worth a play if you can get your hands on it
it is a pleasantly long game with a variety of settings tasks to accomplish interesting npcs and realtime battles in which you can experiment with a variety of attacksthe gameplay is easy and the graphics are beautiful
buy it if you canwith the immense success of games like zelda it seemed only natural that square would follow in those footsteps making a game that featured realtime combat
we will take a look at how squares interpretation of realtime combat fares and what contributions it made to the gaming worldstory unlike the novelish final fantasy  and chrono trigger secret of mana som has a rather basic story with only a few exceptional moments
for this game i felt it worked rather well
since the focus is on realtime combat it only makes sense that the gamer spends most of their time fighting not reading textthere is only one ending and its not  minutes long but it does wrap up the story very well and makes the player feel rewardedmusic hiroki kikuta did the soundtrack for this game seiken densetsu  som and the much lesser known soukaigi
all are great soundtracks and worth hunting down
the music in this game is a nice change of pace from the epic works of nobuo uematsu
in general i found the music to be more playful and optimistic in the villages and calm spots of the world
many of the palaces and dungeons feature music that is more mysterious than it is forbodinggameplay this is where i really disagree with some of the reviews of this game ive read so faron the one hand it is very obvious that the gameplay in this game was the precursor for the combat system in final fantasy  where you have  characters fighting simultaneously two of them automatically
so in that regard the gameplay in som was very influentialthe actual actions of using magic and swinging your swordweapon around are not complicatedtheyre just as intuitive as they were in zelda
however i found a few areas that could have used some attention tedious magicleveling system
to go from level  to level  for example you might have to cast a spell about  times
to gain more levels you have to cast that spell more often
what i found really annoying were these two sidefactsa there is no point in leveling most of your magic
especially the girls magic with the exception of undine
you could leave most of your other magic creatures at level  or level  and still beat the game
even the boys magic is not necessary to raise all the way to level b if you do want to raise the girls magic the best way to do it is to cast it on yourselfhundreds of times
sounds fun doesnt it
if you want to raise the boys magic again you have to cast it on enemies hundreds of timesin my opinion allocation points would have worked better where you get to pick which magic you need at full strength and change your alignment as neededfinally many of the spells are just plain worthlessgranted the final fantasy series is guilty of this as well but it is annoying when youre building levels for a magic creature who only has one spell that you may only need for one or two boss fights pointless weapon charging systemwhen you build levels with your sword you can charge it to do a better attack
in my experience it simply multiplies your damage
so if you charge your sword to level  and cut loose you might do  damage instead of the problem is this while charging your sword if you get damaged or take any status ailment you have to start the charging process all over
at that rate youd be better off hitting enemies with several  level  attacks corners and snags
your party consists of  characters but you can only play one of them at a time
what results if you want to avoid enemies and just run through the dungeon
you quickly find that your movement is restricted due to the actions of your other characters
theyll constantly get snagged on corners stuck downupstairs find themselves fighting enemies or getting struck with a status ailmentlimitingstopping your movement until they recover
instructing your nonplaying characters to guard and keep away has little effect either
they still sometimes take a swipe as they pass an enemyeven with all this the game is still playable but can be unnecessarily frustrating
once you get to higher levels you become so powerful that like in ff you pretty much just walk right through enemies and nuke everything in sightgraphics not the best that ive seen on the snes but pretty high up there
the villages look very rustic and welllivedin featuring nice touches like flower pots outside vines creeping up the roofs and plants growing between the roof tilesthe bosses look pretty impressive and there is a nice variety that come in different sizes and alignmentsi felt this game did an exceptional job with presenting colorful varied environments
my favorite being the shadowy mushroom forest of king trufflethe overworld mode  map is very impressive and alot of different effects are used such as spinning it around when you exit a cannonballon the downside i found that the magic spells were very basiclooking
i felt that the spells should have looked better graphically with each new level as this would have given more incentive to improving your magiccameos santa and rudolph make a brief appearance in this game
cool points if you get the kilroy reference when fighting the robot bossmultiplayer this game is known for the fact that if you have an adapter and  snes controllers each player can control one character
ive never seen anybody play the game this way
i can see how it could be frustrating if one person continually uses magic meaning the other characters have to wait until the spell has subsided before they can move againsuggestions i think the lesserknown terranigma is an equally good game with many similarities but fewer annoyancesoverall i think its fairly obvious that this was squares first effort at realtime combat in an rpg
the graphics story and music make up for the moments where the gameplay is a bit lacking or nonsensicalno rabites were harmed in the writing of this reviewthis is a fun rpg with a different style of battle
you control one character while the other two act on their own which frees you up a bit and you can also change between all of them at your convenience
the story itself is fun and the plotline goes along fairly smoothly
the graphics are pleasing to the eye and i liked the elemental creatures that would join me during my quest
some of the dungeons and palaces were beautifulhowever the repetition required for leveling up magic spells took away from the game
much like final fantasy  you can only build up your magic through repeated use which gets annoying and frustrating after a while
having magic levelups contigent on use is one feature that has never worked for me
i also didnt like the seemingly random opportunities to power up my weapons
weapons upgrades coming with level ups would work just fine but it got harder to upgrade weapons later on in the game since the higherlevel upgrades became increasingly difficult to find because they were dropped at random
i actually ended up using a cheat game genie to unlock all the weapons upgrades near the end of the gameif not for the magicweapon upgrade hooha here this game would have gotten five stars from me
still its overall a fun game to play and i enjoyed itshadowrun created in  is mix between the blade runner and the matrix movies i hate them all and makes for a unique roleplaying game
while fun to play it is one of the easiest games ive played in my life
its so easy that the final stages are quite trivial
even the ending was pretty sucky and anticlimactic at best
i think the reason for the decreased difficulty is due to the numerous bugs of the game
if you stood in a certain position you are able to off the enemy without being inflicted of damage by guns
you are able to build up karma so quickly in the beginning that you can be nearly invincible for the rest of the game thus a lot of labor in that process rather than just following a linear type of game play
you can infinitely make lots of nuyen and karma through a couple of simple tricks
one is using a rubber band on the a button on the ghouls with a uzi while standing behind a coffin in the basement of dark blades mansion for hours
another is going through bremerton portal and going to dark blade to kill the vampire and get  nuyen every time in a  cycle
third one is the gold naga trick where you can come from behind him and killing it for  to  karma each time and going back and forth without picking up the serpent scales
it may sound boring due to the bugs but shadowrun is actually fun to play
despite the intentions of the game i hardly used any of the magic spells except for the heal which was the biggest reason why i won so easily and i never hired a shadowrunner
all in all shadowrun has its shortcomings but its well worth playing and could have been a bit improved for a much better playing experienceahh i can already feel the rush of nostalgia coursing through my veins
this bad boy was one of the first video games i ever played back when i was too young to really understand how huge of an impact everything in this game made you feel like you had
for the super nintendo soul blazer has touched the hearts of many many casual and hardcore gamers alike myself obviously included in that mixturestory the setup is pretty simple this time around
king magridd a greedy and ambitious ruler of the land decided that he wanted to become an eternal man of riches never seeing his fame and fortune wither away into nothing
so he demands that a famous scientist dr leo to create a magical machine that can give him contact with deathtoll the lord of evil
magridd agrees to give deathtoll what he wants in exchange for eternal wealth and fame
agreeing to this deal deathtoll grants magridds wish but at the cost of every single life on the planet including his
now that the world has become completely empty and barren of life the masterotherwise known as godsummons you the hero down to the planet to resurrect the worlds life and eventually find your way to the world of evil to destroy deathtoll
and thatspretty much it
now dont get me wrong its not a bad plot whatsoever
like i said its easy to follow and understand and the game itself does a good job of keeping you focused on the plot
but even so that doesnt mean we cant add more to the story along the way
most rpgs including some during the time this game originally came out were deadset on including stories in their games since in those days it was finally possible to actually add one
as such they were so determined to include hours and hours of content that was strictly for the story not to mention all of the extra stuff they put in
with this game there arent any kind of expansions to the story itself until the final part of the game and even that is just a speedy plot twist that doesnt even really make much sense
oh and a brief romance subplot that seriously was just thrown into the story at the last second
thats seriously the extent of this games story
its good but incredibly lackinggameplay revolutionary to be blunt
this game introduced something referred to as a realtime battle system being that every fight you haveevery enemy you killis done so in real time combat
theres no taking turns to hit an enemy and theres not really much of choosing what kind of attack or spell you want to use
you have one button for using your sword one button for a spell and a button that can bring up a small reference menu which tells you things like how much exp you need to the next level or what level youre on at all
enemies are divided into glowing red circles known as lairs and each lair houses a different kind of enemy to cut down
after defeating a certain number of enemies from a lair the lair will be purified and you will be able to step on it and activate some sort of switch
these switches can range from a number of things such as removing a previous obstacle from the area to reveal a path ahead or the releasing of a soul of a living form to give more life back to the world
thats what youre here to do in the first place right
you can utilize a number of different swords to defeat the forces of evil and each of them is stronger than the next
however you will also have to reach a certain level before you can equip anything too strong
this is one of the problems i found with this game to be honest
unless you destroy every single monster lair in every single area of the game at your current point youll find yourself too weak to equip anything remotely good
granted there are only a small handful of available weapons and armor but that doesnt change the fact that theres no decent way to accumulate a vast amount of exp so that you can equip the next best weapon or armor
its not an incredibly bad aspect of gameplay but it can definitely get annoying at times especially when you realize that there are certain enemies in the game that can only be killed with a specific weaponyou know the one youre too weak to equip right nowpresentation pretty solid especially for an old game like this one
as mentioned previously this game is an arpg meaning that you can certainly expect some good elements to be thrown in there
you can amass a collection of varying items and accessories as well as a small but powerful collection of weapons armor and magic
youll explore vast colorful areas across the land that will leave you awestruck and breathless in terms of visuals
for a snes game the visuals and art design are extremely solid but even so thats not what makes a game good
each area you traverse is beautiful in conception expansive in territory and all told brilliant in design especially the very last dungeon of the game the world of evil
i still remember my days of being scared of stepping foot in that cursed landeven though i was only six when i played it
however even though theres a lot of pretty things to look at and a bunch of shiny equipment to collect it doesnt change the fact that this game is way too short
there are only eight dungeons some of which are just temporary places that dont even contribute a lot to the actual game
the only purpose most of these dungeons serve is to either net you a new item or to reference you towards getting a new item and if you havent already guessed youll need said item if you want to go any further in the game
im not against this practicebut im certainly not all for it eithersoundtrack wonderful
every song in this game is incredibly atmospheric and some of them are even touching and emotional
the game executes the proper music for each scene you witness and the dungeon themes are all unique and individualized for those areas
they dont repeat a whole bunch of tracks here but when they do its acceptable and perfectly reasonable
you cant exactly have the happy town theme playing in an area that you havent restored yet can you
that just wouldnt be right
that being said some songs although they start off strong in every area get incredibly boring and irritating after looping for about  minutes
at first i didnt want to say these songs were annoying when repeated considering i love this games soundtrack but i couldnt hide from the truth anymore
youll want to keep your remote control handy after about the third loop youll hit that mute button faster than a cheetah hunting preyoverall rating a fantastic game through and through
its not perfect by any means but hey what is
creditable to my occasional dosage of nostalgia drugs i can honestly say that this game will forever hold a special place in my heart as one awesome rpg and to anybody reading this review heres the whole reason you came here in big bold letters just for you i highly recommend that you buy this gamewhile this is fun and loyal to the spiderman franchise the gameplay can get kinda repetetive and difficult to understand at times
good spiderman game and considering ljn had something to do with it its a huge step up from their other gamesthis game is a good snes game to play great visualshowever i like the separation anxiety game a little better because of the two player gameplayfirst of all i want to wonder why everything but the cartridge says the game was created by acclaim entertainment when the game itself says ljn did itanyway i think this game rocks
this is one out of  super nes game cartridges that i know of which has a different color than boring graykiller instinct is the other its black
in the game you start out as spiderman and later you can also play as venom
many other heroes and villains most of which i never heard ofwhos ever heard of carrion or demo goblin also feature in the game maximum carnage
every couple of levels you get to watch a short comic book animation which bridges the gap between stagesmaximum carnage has a no save feature which is very frustrating at times because the game overall is extremely challenging and you only get one continue where in other games like captain america and the avenges and spiderman you can choose several continuesthe graphics i thought were outstanding for the snes and the music was alright but the human sounds were redundant and everyone sounded the samei took one star off because you cant save your game and its very challenging but i recommend it to all marvel lovers
nuff saidspiderman games prior to maximum carnage were not very good
games like spiderman and the xmen arcades revenge or spiderman return of the sinister six were pretty lousy
finally a good spiderman game is on the horizon with gamers also being given the very cool choice of playing as venom for a few levelsfirst off this game is better on super nintendo than it is on sega genesis
the genesis copy is still a fun game but because the framerate and the sound is better on the snes i would recommend to serious gamers interested in this game that they pick up the snes copy
on top of that the snes red cartridge is very attractive
for the life of me i will never understand why the legend of zelda a link to the past on snes was never produced as a gold cartridge
after seeing maximum carnages red cartridge i figured that snes was capable of colored cartridges
in the case of zelda they simply just chose not to do a gold cartridge
anyway the genesis also had a limited edition red cartridge but it just isnt as attractive as the snes red cartridgeso the game is based off the part comic book series of the same title
instead of cutscenes we get to see panels from the comic books to help move the story along
in the first few levels you take the role as spiderman as you go around beating up bad guys in new york city
spiderman can shoot webs to ensnare enemies or pull them towards him similar to mortal kombats scorpions harpoon move
spiderman can also climb walls or swing away from trouble with a web
and of course spiderman is perfectly capable of some very excellent and acrobatic street fighting moves to defend himself against typical wave after wave of enemies in sidescroller beat em up action
the game keeps track of your accuracy and if you land enough hits without missing spiderman will be capable of executing a power move to take out a bunch of enemies or execute a single enemyaiding carnages campaign of terror in new york city are his friends shriek doppelganger demogoblin and carrion
these enemies all have their own methods of attacking and you will find yourself fighting them two at a time multiple times throughout the game
but spiderman and venom have some friends of their own to help out such as black cat captain america firestar ironfist cloak dagger morbius and deathlok
you will find tokens which will allow you to call on them to attack the onscreen enemiesafter a few levels you will finally be given the choice to pick whether you want to play as spiderman or venom
both characters have their plusses and their minuses
spiderman is more acrobatic and faster while venom sacrifices the speed for raw power
in that instance it is just a matter of personal preference
however the levels will play out differently based on whom you choose to play as
if you choose to play as venom whenever given a choice you will have a much shorter game since venom spends a significant amount of time being captured and tortured by carnage in the statue of libertyso the toughest part of the game is continuously dealing with carnage and his friends especially since they become progressively more aggressive and tougher in the later stages of the game
doppelganger becomes a step quicker but shriek becomes a hellion with her sonic blasts in the late stages of the game
demogoblin is always tough due to his ability to jump on his glider if you dont stay on top of him and carrion will always be a nuissance floating around waiting for his chance to sap some of your strengthcarnage on the other hand is the toughest of all
you will fight him several times and some of his attacks do considerable damage
during the last encounter you will have a difficult time drawing a bead on him because of his doublearmed swinging axe maneuver which can rob you of a full life if you are unfortunate enough to be in the way
be patient and pick your openingsthis game takes a bit of practice to master
although the typical action fights are pretty simple the boss battles may have you begging for mercy at some points
once you know where all the ups and continues are though you should be fine as long as you remember to rely on your help tokens for the boss battlesall in all this is quite a fun game
it isnt the best side scroller beat em up and of course it doesnt compare to some true classics like streets of rage  or teenage mutant ninja turtles iv turtles in time but for a better than average sidescroller beat em up its hard to go wrong with maximum carnage especially for spiderman fansalthough this game isnt as good as its n successor this scifi adventure is still among the best in gaming
while the d graphics look horrendous its interesting to see how it worked back in the bit era
in some ways i like the level designs better than starfox s because they feel more creative and more interesting
for example one part of the game is like a space version of the ocean with whales stingrays and more sea creatures in this interesting environment
i like how the villain andross is designed as well in fact its kinda creepyand hes a fighter in the upcoming super smash brothers brawl
the missions are still exciting and wierd to this day and it is a very rewarding experience
though time has done some damage to this game it doesnt feel very worn
oh and by the way slippy is still an incompetent pilot as he was in starfox  and falco is still an ungrateful d as he was in starfox star fox wasnt a bad game at all
in fact it was pretty good
i dont think it was a  star game but it was definitely a good gameyou are the trickfighter pilot star fox and you are accompanied by a frog and a rabbit sorry the names arent coming back to me and with their help you destory evil enemies and their warships in an attempt to bring peace back to the galaxyok
first off the game play was very easy to get used to
all you had to do was aim shoot dodge and occasionally pull off the barrel roll shooting which was fun to do
anyone could get this game and get good at it and for a lot of people thats a great part about a gameone of the things that i truly didnt like about star fox was that is was a p only game
honestly why give you a couple of guys that help you through out the game if you cant have a couple of your friends come over and take control of those characters
i think if this would have been a multi link game a lot more people than already established would have been all over this gamethe other thing that bothered the pants off me was that your  buddies never help you when you need them
i was getting grilled by a dozen enemies and all those  could do was hang out and watch me get beat up
again whats the point of having extra characters to help you when they dont do anything to help you
all they did at least when i played was get beat up and id have to save them everytime but whenever id have someone on my tail oh watch out fox
thanks for nothingeven though those were  really annoying parts of this game it was still fun to play and again any level gamer could get really good at this game
id get this one and also star fox  because it was even a great improvement to satr foxits amazing to see how nintendos earlier ventures into the third dimension played out and how they hold up to the scrutiny of today without the ever present lens of nostalgia many have for this game
to say that it is still relevant to this day is a testament to the hard work that nintendos developers put when making it
its said that the ideas of this being a tank game and the like were thrown around during early development and that shigeru miyamotto chose the on rails flight based combat to avoid the game being gimmicky and deliver an experience that would be fun on its own merits rather than people going oh my god its a d game
best game ever for sure
and buying it for the novelty of a d game rather than the potential it brought to the table
cough
 kinect cough
 while it is a bit dated they are more because of the limitations of the console it is on this is a d game on a bit system rather than glaring design flaws during development
if you own a snes buy this its definitely worth the purchasewhen nintendo release the snes there were new physics and graphic improvements that included geometric calculations and shading
the star fox team did a great job of implementing the polygons and making them look fantastic
the game starts with a flight tutorial and there is a campaign to play through as welli had completely forgotten about this game until i stumbled across it on amazon
this game is so much fun
usually i just favor the mario and donkey kong country games but this game is really entertaining
if you like old fighting games i definitely recommend this onethis game was a huge improvment over the original
there was new moves modes colors there was a hyper edition and champoin edition plus you could finaly play as blarog vega fagat and major bisonthe best thing about it was entering a code that was very easy and i still even remember how to do it today  down r up l b a on the title screen and youd hear a sound and then you could play hyper edition on up to  stars for the speed it went fast and was so much fun ssf was the better game and better graphics but it never ran as fast as hyper editionthis game is fun but challenging if you can beat contra then this games easy
this game is fun with  players but can be played alone
there wasnt to many coop games for the snes kirby super star donkey kong country chuck rock are a few others the snes version is better than the genesis versionin  nintendo and sega were knee deep into the bit battle so it was common for fans of both systems to argue which one was superior
as developers made sure that certain titles were released for both systems super street fighter ii the new challengers was one of those titles
it was released in  and was based on the fan favorite arcade game of the same name
while street fighter and fighting games in general fans debated on who had the best version there was no doubt that it was a good port that came very close to mimicking the arcade game
no matter which system you had gamers everywhere rejoiced and they had good reasonmost people know the drill already about super street fighter ii you pick one of out  fighters battle  others fighters including the bosses to win the game and score as many points as possible
on top of the main mode capcom added  player vs mode group battle mode and tournament mode to round out the complete package
these extra modes further the replay value of this game so anyone can get into itthe pros while there are a few things here and there that were omitted so the game can fit onto the cartridge this game is a near perfect port
the graphics are good enough the music sounds decent and the controls are spot on
you can set the difficulty level from  to  stars so it can be super easy to super hard to play
all of the fighters and their stages have made it in and with  player support you can have a friend join in anything for a match
the extra modes are great to get other people around as the controller gets passed around so everyone gets hisher turn to playthe cons as stated already there were some things omitted
missing frames of animation certain announcements were cut bonus stages are from the previous snes street fighter games and the sound effects are not as clear compared to the arcade game
but that is to be expected and its just minor flaws considering they got everything elseit was a great time to be into fighting games
street fighter fans couldnt get enough of it and played super street fighter ii in the comfort of their homes
if youre not into fighting games then you wont want to check this out
but if you like fighting games youll want to get this
there are two ways to do this you can do a quick search online to find a copy or download this game to the wii from the virtual console service for  points  usstreet fighter ii was one of the greatest fighting series of all time and it still is
it was so great that it made the mortal kombat series look like a broke franchise but wait until midway is done with mortal kombat deadly alliance 
no matter what new and interesting street fighter capcom makes today including the vs series no other street fighter game would be better than the street fighter ii series
while things needed to be changed during the year of  capcom has decided to make yet another addition to their popular sfii franchise
after the successful release of street fighter ii turbo for the super nintendo capcom has released super street fighter ii for the arcade super nintendo and sega genesis
a lot of fans had agreed that this is a true street fighter hit but a lot of people had noticed some ingame flaws while playing but well get back to that later 
for now heres the lowdown 
the graphics of the snes version of super street fighter ii looks great and little better than the genesis version
as always the animations still retain its old glorified  goodness 
as for the sound this is where the problem begins
sure the songs sound perfectly remixed on each stage but just listen to the voice acting on some of the characters
some of them sound weird and they dont fit the character at all but not all of them
just guile dee jay and sagat including that annoying announcer
i tried not to pay any attention to the sound but its too noticeable
as for the lineup of new and old street fighters the best collection of fighters ive ever seen
you still get classic numbers from the sfii universe like ryu ken chunli guile blanka dhalsim zangief balrog sagat vega and m bison
plus some new fighters like fei long cammy dee jay and t hawk if you want to know who they are read my genesis review of ssfii
and as always anything bearing the name street fighter ii has the best gameplay balance of any d fighting game
the controls are slick and easy to master once youve played the sfii series numerous times
no flaws just pure gameplay perfection
and its even better than the playability of the genesis version considering the fact that the snes controller had a wide variety of buttons than the genesis pad
if youve played the previous sfii games thats the way how the game plays
this may seem like the last street fighter ii but actually it isnt
the last of the sfii series was super street fighter ii turbo which released for us arcades but never for home consoles for some reason
it released on the dreamcast in japan somewhere around  as super street fighter ii x grandmaster challenge and it also released for the game boy advance as super street fighter ii turbo revival
not to mention it was featured on the street fighter compilation for the playstation called quotstreet fighter collectionquot
this was the first street fighter to use super moves but since it was  or  the super bar can only last for one level
it was better than the early super street fighter ii but it couldve been cool if it had released on home consoles on that day
oh well 
just as long as it released on specific systems 
anyways if youre looking for a street fighter game this is the one to look for 
even with its flaws the game itself is fun and long lasting like the other street fighter games the street fighter series was never better than when it was on super nintendo
the next generation attempts were decent but nothing to the original
with that being said this is probably my favorite game in the series bringing in new characters
i love the tournament modethis is one of the best in the quotside scrolling beat em upquot genre
i consider final fight and streets of rage the tops in the genre but tmnt gives em a run for their money
great graphics great sound you even hear the real tmnt theme song complete with actual singing albeit for about  seconds when the title screen comes up and great gameplay makes this a winnerafter konami released  games based on the turtles franchise for the nes  under their subsidiary company ultra games and the last one by themselves directly they were ready to move onto the super nes
in  they released teenage mutant ninja turtles iv turtles in time which was based on their mega hit arcade game teenage mutant ninja turtles turtles in time
for anyone who played the arcade version it was a great game to play and the snes version is almost as good
thats because konami made some changes to the game before it was released
nevertheless konami does well with the excellent snes portyou pick one of  turtles and go through  stages beating up foot soldiers robots and boss characters
the goal is to reach shredder and beat him to finish the game
you can go it alone or have another player join you
the entire game is based on the arcade version but konami threw in extra game modes to lengthen the experience  player vs mode where you and another player battle it out to see whos the best  the time trial mode where your goal is to beat up the enemies in cornered off sections of stages in the fastest time possiblethe pros this is a near perfect arcade port and the only thing that beats out the snes version is the actual arcade game
its fun and looks plays  sounds great
its even better when a friend joins you
konami knew the game itself doesnt last too long so the extra game modes are a nice bonus to have since it adds some replay value in the endthe cons the fact that the snes only had  controller ports meant it was pointless to bring over the  player support from the arcade version
and then there were the changes to the gamethe intro from the snes port was different from the arcade game voice overs from the turtles and bosses in the arcade game were cut from the snes port new enemies were added to the snes port baxter stockmans st level boss attack patterns from the snes port were different from the arcade game the large group of pizza monsters waiting for you at the end of the rd stage from the arcade game were replaced by the rat king for the snes port the th stage from the snes port was exclusive you could mount the dinosaurs in the th stage of the arcade game but they ran past you in the snes port the mud boss at the end of the prehistoric stage in the arcade game was replaced by slash in the snes port tokka and rahzar were the boss characters at the end of the pirate ship atage and they were replaced by rocksteady and bebop in the snes port they were the mid stage bosses in the exclusive snes stage the neon nightriders stage in the snes port moved in the background from top to bottom instead of left to right in the arcade game and the ending from the snes port was longer than the one in the arcade gameif you had an snes you bought and played this game to death
konami hit it out of the park with this arcade port and this is a game that belongs in your snes game library
buy it anyway you can if you dont own it
i highly recommend itthis totally brought the turtles into a whole new light big bold graphics no new challenge though its the same d fighter that it has been since turtles  the only real difference between this game and the other turtles game for regular nintendo is there are dozens of new tricks to learn and far more enemies and varieties of enemies to fight against as once so the game mixes it upi loved the arcade version of tmnt no tmnt game has come close to beating that
but that version only got released on the nes but didnt have the same graphics or action to make it as good as the arcadethis version was also released as an arcade version but it was probably better known for this snes version
i hope these games get revived one day id love to play new and improved versions of these classicsi must admit as much as i want to give this game credit why did they censor it
i dont care about the gore or anything although i will admit it made it comical andor more action packed
however why are you shooting crazy giant rats evidently shooting dogs is so much worse both are animals
i would go farther but its not necessary now this next thing maybe a positive or a negative more than likely a negative to the fans
this game isnt actually wolfenstein d so im told its actually more like wolfenstein d and its sequels greatest hits only briefly played the original pc game
plus its shorter than the pc i understand that pc version had  stages and the snes only has   now why do i say  stars you say mainly two reasons one being the game plays very smooth and has a logical enough progression
for a person who just wants to play a wolfenstein game and dont want the pc version this game is fine also you benefit from playing stages from both games  
the second big pro is well this game is pretty advanced for its time
i mean slightly dumbed down graphics but the game holds true in its game play in relation to its pc counterpart
all and all if you want an idea what wolfenstein d is and you arent a hardcore fan of the pc game you will most likely enjoy this and please do
doors are hidden in the same areas slightly shorter load times than the pc version and you dont need to turn on you computer its a good port
if you want an exact port seek elsewhere it couldnt happen this system just wasnt built for it
all and all good game that suffers from a few flaws and wasnt  true to its pc counterparti had to speak up after seeing so many star reviews
if epics like ffiv can be given  stars then semiepics like breath of fire have to be categorized differentlythis game has a lot of great featuresa good battle system with the exception of guts mode which irritated mejust give enemies higher hp if its gonna take so long to kill them nice graphics a pretty good story andthe best partvery original characters
the problem is the dialogue is so drastically abbreviated that i couldnt feel very much about anything that was going on
i can understand that there are capacity limits in making games and that the makers can only do so much but the dialog scenes
all they have to do is insert a bunch of text maybe a few flashbacks here and thereits not like it would have been difficult to have the characters interact with each other more or explain their feelings better or sometimes just explain what the heck was going on example every time you approach a human villain to fight them when you go into the battle screen theyre suddenly a monster
i guess youre supposed to just assume that theyve turned themselves into monsters by some magical power but maybe that couldve been explained a little better
i dont knowim sure a lot of people have had this problem while playing the game and maybe it was really one of the best when it came out but i recently replayed ffiv and even though the graphics and gameplay were on a similar level there was a huge difference in the dramatic presentation of the story
part of this may also have been that the music was better in ffiv
in short if you are okay with an rpg feeling like the legend of zelda gameswhere you only have one character in your party and the game is all about performing quests that dont involve emotional scenes pertaining to your character then youll like breath of fire
if you need more from an rpg howeveremotional cutscenes drama between characters within your party and not just npcs etcthen you probably wouldnt like this game
my overall impression of it was just important npc says one line telling you what to do
travel to next place battle battle battle go through five dungeons battling all the way retrieve artifact battle your way back to town get one or two lines of appreciation from the npc who gave you the quest and sometimes not always a vague hint about what to do next
thing to do next same as above rinse and repeat
oh and the music changing when you go from outside a house to the inside of a house annoyed the crap out of meyou all remember playing that bloody graphic game mortal kombat on your snes or sega
it was gory and fun as hell
if you missed it because you were too young you should definitely try this one out on the ps on psnmortal kombat ii upped the character amount the gory fatalities and all of the games ruthlessness
old favorites such as raiden lui kang scorpion subzero and johnny cage make their return here while newcomers like mileena kitana jax and baraka made the game much cooler than its predecessor
the graphics were crisper and made more colorful the sounds more varied and the settings much more detailedeerie
the game was just an allaround delight to experiencenot everything was perfect however
the main thing id like to say about this game that brings the score down  is the difficulty
playing through on normal was somewhat tolerable but any higher and the game gets damn ruthless
you would find yourself dying over and over again even if you were just facing the second person up the totem pole
to this day i still havent completed this game in all of its difficulties and i have no desire to
the game just gets too cheap too soon
but thats what player mode is forall in all still one of the best fighting games you could ever ask for
it had nice graphics for its time contains my two favorites characters subzero and kitana introduced babalities and just made the series that much harder to live up to itself later on
iii was solid but it wasnt ii
deadly alliance was great but it as well as some of the characters didnt have the same umph
when in doubt ii it isa near classicoverall score  this review can also be found at gamespot
com under the name darksongbirdthe sequal is what continued its greatness the old cartridges is the good old way to play it works well and fast shipping thanksthis game caused allot of controversy in its heyday
i think it was unfairly judged
it was accused of being to bloody
but it comes with the option of turning off the blood and fatalities
and in the face of some games of today this game would be considered rated g
it teaches handeye coordination as well as brings hours of fun
you can play a single player game or  player game
each charachter has many special moves that are their own
with so many character and so many moves to learn and master someone could play this game for many years and not get bored of it
this game is fun
i have no problem letting my kids play this game either
in fact it has become a regular in our house on family night
my husband and i both play it as well as our kidseverything about this game is great with the only flaw being the box is a little worn
however it is roughly  dollars less than buying it brand new so cheers to the worn boxwhen midway released the first mortal kombat to the arcades back in  they probably never thought of doing a sequel
but the game was very well received
for the first time digitized actors replaced handdrawn fighters the action looked very realistic and most of all it took violence in a video game to a standard that had never been reached before
it all lead to the inevitable release of mortal kombat ii which is widely considered the best and most original of the seriesthe snes version is probably the best home conversion available
everything from the arcade version is included from blood and gore to fatalities and hidden characters
the story behind the game is fresh
at the end of the first tournament liu kang has managed to defeat shang tsung and banish him to the quotoutworldquottsungs master shao kahn has restored tsungs youth in exchange for a plan to lure the earth warriors to a tournament held in the outworld itself
this tournament is none other than mortal kombat iimk introduces a host of new kombatants including kung lao jax kitana mileena baraka and the now playable reptile and shang tsung
the original fighters return minus sonya and kano
each fighter has at least two fatalities plus a friendship and a babality
the old guys have been polished up a bit and given some new moves to match them with the new ones
there are two brand new bosses
the first is kintaro who is of the same clan of creatures as goro from the original but is far more powerful
the second is shao kahn whos insults are his own downfallwhat the mk series is really known for is the finishing moves and mk manages to satisfy any lust you would have for blood
these make mk look tame
especially violent are johnny cages torso rip jaxs arm rip and face smash and barakas blade lift
new to the series are friendships in which the winner shows his friendship towards the loser and babalities in which the loser is turned into an infant
three new stage fatalities are present as well
two brand new secret characters are present and will appear during the game giving various clues
they are of course smoke and jade
unfortunately you cant play as them but only fight thema noticable weakness of the game is the irritating scratching sound that almost always appears when something is announced
the music is also not much in the quality department but then again mortal kombat was never known for its music
the visuals were pretty amazing for its time but will hardly impress anyone today
controls though responsive are a bit awkward
the characters tend to slide too muchanyway after all these years it can still be quite addicting
snes owners looking for worthy fighting games should pick this up
you might also want to try mk but not ultimate mk please
if you are a fan of mortal kombat  then you will undoubtedly enjoy this
for the ultimate in snes fighting games however consider street fighter ii turbo hyper fightingmortal kombat  was a bit weak on its own since it was the first in the series but made a good setup for this sequel which had more characters more of a storyline and better features
definitely a classic in the mk linea very enjoyable fighter for the super nes
for  this game looks sharp with detailed character models and cool backrounds
the music and the sound effects are just okay a bit on the repetitive side for memortal kombat iis gameplay is much like street fighters
a d fighter you move with directional pad and push the triggers to block while the action buttons make an attack
the special moves while a bit hard to pull off are very rewarding and the fatalities are well deliciouswith only  playable characters with a couple of hidden ones
and the lack of a decent savepassword feature this title lacks some decent replay value but this is still a fine entry in the mk series and is well worth your moneyhaving been a tetris freak for so long i knew about this game way back from reading nintendo power when it was released in early if youve already played previous versions of tetris or dr mario i would strongly suggest this version a lot more
the major differences here are the enhanced soundtracks sound effects and the addition of a vs com mode
sadly you cannot play against the computer if you choose the mixed match game
but otherwise this game should leave you very puzzled  in a good wayin tetris you need to clear lines by placing tetriminos correct spelling
on the bottom of the screen
when you fill up a line it clears and lowers the stack
try to get a tetris by clearing  lines in a row
in type a marathon mode you keep playing endlessly
but watch out as you progress because the tetriminos will start to fall much faster
ive managed to make it to level  so its a real doozy
type b mode allows you to clear a set amount of lines which is   you can adjust the speedheight levelin dr mario you have a set amount of viruses to get rid of
use the falling pills to line up the same colors in order to clear the viruses either vertically or horizontally
there are  levels with  speeds
spoiler alert  if you finish level  in high speed mode you should receive the best ending to the gamesince ive listed the various tetris games from another review i will list the other platforms in which you can play dr mariodr mario gameboy  nes dr mario   ndr mario  puzzle league  game boy advance too bad the designers didnt make another version of dr mario for the nintendo ds or dskirbys avalanche is actually a puzzle game rather than your average platformer
its actually based off of the japanese video game puzzle series puyo puyo
in fact its just like that but covered in a kirby themedr
robotniks mean bean machine also did this exact same thing but with a sonic theme insteadthe main game is connecting  of the same color
its as simple and addicting as tetris and columns
theres a vs mode a training mode which is like playing solo in tetris and a story mode
all of the modes are very fun and you can just keep playing them until youre dead tired of puzzle gamesthe puzzling gameplay is pretty addicting and it is still a fun game to this dayfor real alot of people go nuts over wolverine i agree with this other guy wolverine is cool but why not make a single game for beast or gambit what makes wolverine so special
sure his power is cool
but in this game it sucks
the story is cool
i only keep it because im a big xmen fansuper hero fan
i like to collect super hero stuff
so it makes since
but i wouldnt buy for over a buck
and for one thing the only classic xmen super villian you battle is lady death strike
and the game is pretty easywolverine may be more in his own in the s newest iteration but back in the day wolverine had another great title
adamantium rage
you can take charge of wolverine and slice through enemies and climb walls
the game even has wolverines health regenerating properties making it easier to make your way through levels
the graphics are very good considering their age however there are problems navigating through certain portions of the game
some of the objectives are unclear as well
bottom line is the game is fun
i recomend it to anyone looking for a comic book action gamewily stage  theme for the win
most people will say this game is not as good as the others and they are right
mega man feels clunky and his slide is anything but smooth but this has some of the most unique music in the series and the final boss will make you want to destroy you gaming devicethe first six mega man games for the nes proved that there was love for the blue bomber
and just when capcom ran out of ideas they established the mega man x series for the snes a darker and edgier take on mega man that won over the fans instantly
so it was a big surprise when capcom announced they would release mega man  on the snes and in  they did just that
the classic mega man series marched forward onto the snes and while it doesnt bring anything new gameplay wise its still fun to blast robots and take on dr wily againmega man  takes place right after mega man  while dr wily was locked up his secretly programmed robots activate and wreck havoc on the city and eventually break him out of prison
mega man is back on the beat determined to catch and put dr wily back behind bars
after completing an intro stage you choose from one of  stages
once you explore them and defeat the robot masters you get access to their weapons and use them on other robots
after going through the mid point stage  more stages open up
ultimately you reach dr wilys castle and finally face off against him
youll come across numerous power ups and even have the chance to buy them at the shop with metal bolts the games currency
after each robot masters stage is complete you get a password to use later on as there is no battery backed save feature availablethe pros its exactly what you would imagine of an nes mega man game updated with bit graphics and sounds
it looks plays and sounds good
you will feel right at home except now you use a snes controller instead of the one for the nes
capcom did try to add new things like buying powerups and collecting letter plates to gain access to your canine pal rushs other useful functions
while using the password system is a bit cumbersome its still better than having to start from scratch when you turned off the gamethe cons as fun as this game is it brings nothing new to the whole concept gamers has come to expect
a lot of elements and past influences from the previous nes titles are sprinkled throughout the game so if it feels like you played through these stages before thats because you have
some of the robot masters are truly unique turbo man spring man and slash man while the rest use similar themes already covered from the previous nes titles
this game is also not as hard as the others but beware when the difficulty level sharply rises from dr wilys castle stages up until you fight him as he is next to impossible to beatmega man s release was met with a lot of mixed reactions and sharp criticism because it was compared to the mega man x series
due to poor opinion and a limited amount of copies available at the time it didnt sell as well as other snes titles
later on we would find out that the developers had little time to make it and it makes me wonder what else they could have done if it wasnt rushed out the door
but for what its worth its a good game and an excellent addition for mega mans fans to have in their game collection
good luck finding a copy so if you decide to give it a try you might be better off getting the mega man anniversary collection which has mega man  through  and extra goodiesthe graphics in this game were really good and the gameplay is not much different from the nes megaman games   robot masters upgraded weapons rush and so on and so forth
the intro and ending are actually nice to look at and if you liked the first  games then youll like thisall of the boss levels can be replayed but you only have to defeat each boss once so you can pick up more energy cans as well as looking for proto man and secret items
some of the boss weapons can unlock secret areas in each level so this is a game that can be played very thoroughly
of course you could just skip the search for secret items its not required to complete the game but the password feature enables you to explore the game as much as you would like and stop as neededoverall its not a bad megaman title though its the last one i ever played since i didnt have the new gaming platforms needed for mm and the rest of the original seriestaken from gamespotcom under the name darksongbirdthe characters are somewhat special and the music at its best is very good
some battle music and battles themselves get very repetitive after a while with the same old same old especially if youre in an area for too long
but its an rpg
that might be a bit expectedthe most priceless part about this game is probably the dialogue
its amazing
i am currently watching the mother marathon may th and wish that they would just slow down a bit when it comes to some text so we can read it allbut ive played this game before so i already know some of itwhat else
there are four main characters ness your average silent protagonist from onett the keen magician in training paula from twoson the great mechanic and bottle rocket launcher those things rock jeff from winters and last but certainly not least poo the prince from dallom
in the far east who eventually weilds some killer ninja star magicanother huuuuge highlight in the game is its quirkiness
there are jokes here and there some hideous characters piggy anyone
and just all around weird things occurring all too ofteni really cant say enough about it
but i think im in the minority when i say that when things get hard they get hard
and playing through this game while interesting is a bit long and i dont think it has that much replay value
thats probably why the score isnt perfect like everyone elsesits not without its faults but this game from  is a gem if i ever knew onenow if theyd only bring mother  and mother  to the usgraphics bsound bstory bcharacters blength boverall bearthbound for the super nintendo may very well epitomize the term cult classic more than any other game ever made
it fits all the criteria oddball game design that most mainstream gamers will find too strange for their liking lacking sales and critical disapproval at the time of its release a smallbutdevoted following hefty price tag constant rumors about incredibly rare beta versions sequels etc and most importantly a really interesting game underneathearthbound is a traditional bit rpg dragged through an insane lsd and pop culture gutter
the swords and staves are replaced with frying pans and yoyos
the fantasy worlds of final fantasy and chrono trigger are replaced with a modernday world with a zany sense of humor
you fight against hippies businessman ants mushrooms and abstract art
you order zombie paper from a pizzeria to save a zombie infested town
and you recieve your opening mission statement from abee
not only do these ideas keep the game fresh they also are used to satirize many of the more overly serious aspects of rpgsthe battle system is pretty basic but it works well with characterunique abilities psi powers and a rollback hp
system that rewards players with fast fingers
the lack of random battles is also a welcome surprise
be warned though the game is unusually tough and is very unforgiving towards unprepared or impatient players
with a little practice however youll be able to tackle the more threatening battles without getting too banged upthere are a few flaws mainly the items dont stack meaning youre oftentimes running out of room to place things
also the diffuclty could be adjusted so that the normal enemies are easier and the bosses are harder but its not too much of a problemanyone who is tired of normal video games should check this one out but be prepared to search abit or pay upwards of its not the cable for the best resolution but it works great i cannot complain about that
however its never better  than an rgb cableis a cheaper version of the original cable but still works for me and the gamecube nice option if you dont find any morei purchased super nes av cable because i miss placed my old cable somewhere and im still looking for it somewhere in the houseyou will need this to play on your hd tv but i have mine for the snes and the n but i can not mix them
i have to use the one that is grey for the snes and the black one for the  if you get one of these cables and your system looks blurry or discolored then it may be your system itself since the snes systems had like  or  different video chips and some were very sorryi just bought another snes console
i had almost forgotten what fun it was without the use of realistic graphics and sounds
its still one of the best systems out there
its a little hard to find games and accessories but thats the least of my worries
a must for any game collectorsuch a good console
cartridges were a little bulky but the games were fun and fairly easy without all of the finger twisting and  buttonsif you like the sega genesis or liked playing mario on the nes youll love the snesor super nintendo it has video games for every type of gamer some of my favortites are zelda adventures of kid kleets yoshis island and illusions of gaiathe consoles are a fair price but replacement controllers can go up to  so make sure it comes with controllersi bought this right after i got an n
i always played n with my cousins and i always had ports of snes games for my gba but never owned one
it is greati dont like this one as much as the nes but i still like allot of the games on it and i still play it now
yes i know that the nes has bit and this has bit and the sound is much better but most of the games for the snes r kind of weird
i have a whole bunch of games but i do not like have of them and the reason i have them is because this was my uncles
the only games that i like for it is mario zelda metroid battle toads and kirby
and i love each and every one of them
other than the weird games this is an excellent systemthis console brings back so many memories
games are much easier then i remember
wish there were more games availablefirst off my snes is currently about  years old and still works like new
so its a wellbuilt little machine
second of all it may be old but it has great games
and the graphics and sound are all right too
its such a fun console even after all these years
i would seriously recommend the three donkey kong country games zelda a link to the past and illusion of gaia
theres not really much else to say
i just really like this console so i think youll enjoy it toopurchased games system because my game system was not working like it should
this system is in great shape and works welli thought there were some things i found to be clever about this game you play as gomez you pick a destination all are located in the mansion   at the end of each one you fight a boss once thats accomplished you rescue a member of the family you myst rescue all of them before you rescue mortica before you get to her you have to fight the final boss he is the judge  for anyone who may or may not recall the movie version there was a judge in the  motion picture addams family movie many of the elements are not based on the movie but its still a fun game to play it has alot of ways to get extra lives some of them are in hidden rooms or out in the open if it werent for the password feature this game would prove to be more difficult to finish one of the reasons for that is you energy meter is shaped like a heart  hits  you lose a life you can get  more hearts by battle certain bosses at the end of certain areas in the game you can max it to  heartsbreath of fire  pretty much improves upon the mechanics of the first title in the series in every way
the game lets you build and customize your own town as you progress even allowing you to recruit your own villagers and craftsmen
from the introduction of the game the plot begins to slowly build up to a weird and dark religious conflict that is at times eerie and hilarious
call me nostalgic maybe but for some reason ive always preferred bof to the sequel  though i enjoy this game toothe last x title to be seen on a nintendo system for almost  years and also the last snes titles
like x and mm before it this is one of the rarest games to find online and in terms of bitness this is probably the most visually striking
the goods that come from this title include silicon graphics doing a great job with the d renderings in many of the bosses in the game which were some of the most challenging and deadly the increasingly challenging level structures and the introduction of zero as a playable character
add on two big subbosses four reusable ride armors and those peskily hidden heart tanks subtanks and capsules and you have a recipe for a potent entertaining x title that ended up being better than x but still not reaching the stratospheric rise of x
despite its sticker price in this day and age its really worth it to get
consider it the holy grail of the x seriesthis game is great in story and that fact that this is the only mega man x game where capcom has decided to added extra capsules that are chips that will enhance your armor
its cool that zero is a playable character but he becomes pointless to play as because mega man x becomes so much stronger than zero when he gets his armor plus zero cant fight bosses
i say get this game because you get a new villian called dr dopplerwe all enjoyed this game and had fun
my oldest boy lists it as one of his favorites
the ending kept me from giving it  starsgreat game but i just wish it was longer
it has a great plot an concept
its a very unique snes gamestreet fighter ii made such a huge impact in the arcade scene and video games in general
the first game in the series made a little bit of noise and had a cult following leading up to the release of the second game to the arcades
who knew that history was being made as sf ii gave birth to the fighting game genre and revolutionized video games at the same time
everyone went crazy as soon as they played this game to death while mastering all of the characters moves combos  strategies players were sharing what they knew or found out between each other
no other arcade game had such a deep and devoted following and created tournament style gaming like street fighter ii
then capcom shocked everyone by announcing a port of street fighter ii was coming to the snes and it was released in  this port was revolutionary for its time because while capcom made changes to the game the core essence remained and it was still as fun to play as it was in the arcadesstreet fighter ii is a fighting game where you face off against the computer in a series of matches that lead up to the games main villain m bison
you choose from one of eight characters face off against the other  characters then you go up against  boss characters including m
bison
each character has hisher own storyline and ending so you find out their specific reasons for wanting to fight m bison
after every third match you enter a bonus stage where you get to earn additional points before the timer runs out there are  bonus stages in total
the game features a  player vs mode so you can take on another human player but you can only choose from the  characters and not the additional boss characters
finally there is an option screen where you can change the buttons on your controller play audio tracks from the game and adjust the difficulty level of the game
as an added bonus theres a code you can use where both players can use the same character in a matchthe pros this was revolutionary because they took an arcade game that was  megabits in size and shrunk it down into a  megabit cartridge
while changes were made it looked and sounded close to what the arcade game was
on top of that the controls were perfect
the game used every button on the snes controller so capcom did not have to compromise the button scheme at all
the rules of the arcade game were the same as the snes port so you werent missing out at all as far as how your character moves or what strategies to use against the computer or another human player
the same character code was such a sweet bonus as it was not featured in the street fighter ii arcade gamethe cons like i said before this is not a perfect port
in order for the game to retain the same feel capcom had to make changes across the board for this game to fit and work properly
there are too many to list but it doesnt hurt the overall experience too much as there were people who never got the chance to play it in the arcades
for them buying this game for the snes was a perfect way to find out what the hype was all about
what is surprising is that when you put the difficulty level to its highest point it is  times harder than the arcade game so only the most skilled sf players were able to defeat m bison at the highest difficulty levelit was a great time to have the snes as capcom would release a port of street fighter ii champion edition for the sega genesis more than a year after street fighter ii was released for the snes
not only did fighting games become popular but the gap between the quality of arcade games and their ports to home consoles became smaller and it was starting to become common to see popular arcade games ported to snes genesis etc
if by chance you have never played any of the earlier street fighter ii games you can either pick up a used snes copy look for the numerous street fighter anthology collections that are out there or download this title for the wii via their virtual console service for  points us 
i recommend you try it out if you havent done so yetsuch a fun game good price fast shipping and no problems during game play i recommend to anyone with a super nintendo thanksexcellent classic fighting game brings back the old days just playing it again
of course in my opinion sf turbo was a little more fun having all the characters and smoother action
still great gamechristmas of  is when i started to get hooked on street fighter ii
executing the special moves were a bit of a challenge for me at first  but i relied on that instruction book  of the time and i learned to master the hadokens dragon punches sonic booms whirl wind kicks and yoga fires in no time
ive acutally first played street fighter ii in the arcades but i had no idea on what i was doing and didnt have too many quarters to be waisting on figuring out the moves
this was one of the first fighting games ported on a  bit or any console and the graphics were true to the arcades
my favorites characters to use were of course ryu and ken and both have amazing endings however you must finish the game on normal or hard in order to achieve an individual ending for each of the eight characters
the harder the difficulty level the better the game
chung li blanka and guile were great choices too as fast agile powerful and easy to use as ryu and ken
since there are unlimited continues on street fighter ii you have the option to practice on defeating your challengers from around the world plus take on the bosses saget vega balrog and m bison the main villianantagonist of the game who happened to murder chung lis dad and guiles best friend charlie
i would only recommend purchasing this game for true old school gamers
street fighter ii turbo and super street fighter ii are definitley worth your money and more superior
the champion edition on sega genesis has a better soundtrack but i gave it a bad review due to a missing pause button and limited contol buttons
because of that i consider the super nes version the better out of the original street fighter ii console releasesi got this game when i was eleven or so years old and it quickly became one of my favorites
this game is of course the one that started the oneonone fighting game craze inspiring at least about a million imitators
i thought it was a very fun game back then and i still like it although its very limited by todays standards
i havent actually played the snes cartridge version in a long time but i have the game on a few gamecollection discs for ps and ps
most of the characters only have a couple of special moves the hadoken dragon kick sonic boom yoga fire etc
 you dont have meters that let you use superspecial moves
but in my opinion the area where the game suffers most today at least it didnt seem so bad at the time the game first came out is the character selection itself which is tiny or even almost nonexistant compared to the character selections of most later fighting games with only eight fighters  ryu ken chunli guile dhalsim zangief blanka and e honda  to choose from you cant play as the bosses balrog vega sagat and m bison
and when you consider that ryus and kens moves are exactly the same in this game the selection actually becomes even smaller in a way
my favorite character was dhalsim because he was so stretchy and and could breathe fire
my least favorite playable character was zangief because i found him so hard to work with
i believe i beat the game at least a time or two but it was probably with the game at an easy difficulty setting
im giving the game positive ratings really more because it was a childhood favorite of mine than for any other reason its still a good game especially if youre waxing nostalgic but it has been way outdone by many other fighting games both within and without the sf seriesaside from mario kart and fzero top gear is my most fun racer for my super nintendo
i had no idea what i was getting into when i bought this game i had bought other racing games for my snes but this one stood out
it has a great cartoon and arcadefeel to it
the nitrous is fun to use during the already fast gameplay
you compete against a little less than two dozen racers in this game and its very fast and you always have competition against another racer who acts like a second player via splitscreen
you race through numerous cities and countries to earn your way to the top as it is with any other racer
this game is a lot of fun both single player or multiplayer and should really not be missed by any snes fan despite grudges against kemco for future disastrous titles that followed
oh and choose your vehicle wisely because your car can run out of gas during a particularly long racei remember getting this game and being hooked back in my snes halycon days
i recently got a dule nessnes system and bought the game again
so how does it stack up in the good its definitely accessible there are different difficulty levels so youre not just going to get owned from the start it offered a choice of  cars and this is important on certain tracks etcthe bad theres only  songs during the races obviously this is going to grate on your nerves even on the easier settings there is a fair amount of rubber banding youre not just going to kill the cpu like on other races this could be a good point in selling the game too infinite frustration in hitting lapped cars lol overall for the price this is a solid purchase for your snes
just dont be expecting the same kind of value you get in todays psxbox  racing gamesgood game but the soundtrack is awesome to listen to while playing i think it really stood out more than the gamestar trek games keep getting better and away team is good entry in the growing library of quality titlesyou are in control of  sometimes up to  crewmembers on an away team
before each mission you are given an excellent briefing and then you are allowed to choose the members who are best suited to the mission
once your selection is made you beam down and begin the missioneach mission contains a briefing before and during the mission
the controls are very easy to master and memorize
while the main screen doesnt contain a quotfog of warquot there is still a lot of strategy involved in completing the missionsthe graphics are nice but not earth shattering
the sounds used on my soundblaster live
are excellent using both front and rear channelson a whole this game is fun but quite short
when played on the easy level you an complete all of the missions in one night if you had the time
while this isnt a major title like elite force and the fallen it is a quality trek title and worth the purchasewhat a great game
the graphics are solid the game play is easy to learn and there is a lot to do
i have heard this game being compared to xcom
i will not do that because i never played xcom
instead i will compare it to commandos
you actually have to think to play this game
its not some mindless d shooter
there is a lot of strategy involved
mainly you will run covert missions in enemy territories each mission getting harder than the last
there are a lot of neat gadgets to use along the way as well as unique skills for certain racesi was leery about buying this game because it had gotten so many mediocre reviews from the general public but i bought it anyway in  because i found it at a reasonable price on amazon
i must admit that my trekaddiction really paid off here as i found the game to be a pleasurefor those of you who have played the squadbased cowboy game desperados you will find that away team is very similar in progressing through the missions
stealth is the better part of valor here and it makes for a very exciting game as you try to flank your enemies evade detection and coordinate attacks at just the right timesyou play as the captain of the uss incursion a federation vessel that uses holographic imaging to change shape
as such the plot of the game is to go behind enemy lines and win covert battles as you try to figure out the ultimate solution behind the plot
you send down away teams of  crewmen each with thier own special characteristics on clandestine missionson the positive side i found the all the quotsneaking aroundquot in the game to be very quotrealisticquot or i should say quotconsistentquot with the way that events play themselves out in the star trek universe
vulcans can do mindmelds phasers can be set to kill or stun but they do set off alarms sometimes and most importantly you only get a few shots before the borg quotadaptquot
this makes the game very intense especially at those times when you evade being detected by a gnats hair
also the storyline is thoughtful and makes you want to finish each mission to see what happens nexton the negative side i do agree with some of the reviewers on at least  points
first the game is very linear as opposed to more openended squadbased games like fallout bos and you will have to save often as many of the quotappropriatequot ways of winning missions can only be discovered by trial and error
second i agree that the characters are not as well developed as they could have beenbut in general the game is a great buy if you are a pc gamer and a trek fanthe dragon warrior franchise makes its way to gameboy color with a fantastic game that adds to an already fun epic dragon warrior rpg
this game is far different than dragon warriors of the past because now in this game you are a lone adventurer who can find capture and tame up to  monsters at once to fight for him like pokemon
you can get s of more monsters but you can only have  in your party at a time the rest must sit on the bench
you can train your monsters by walking around the world fighting monsters fighting in competitions of  battles or fighting other trainers who wander around like yourself
the sheer depth of this game is amazing because when you capture monsters tame them and raise where they will have unique skills then you pair off mature male and female monsters to have a wedding and create a baby monster with all of the skills as the parents
that is pretty much the plot unfortunately the world which you must roam around to train your monsters is not really a world its more like a random maze
literally random each time you enter the world its different
with all of that being said this game like all dragon warrior games is fun and highly addictive however the graphics are very poorim a diehard fan of the dragon warrior series to the point where i contacted squareenix via instant messenger and told them of my ideas for dragon warrior monsters  due to copyright issues i wasnt successful
after having played dragon warrior monsters  taras adventures i desperately wanted this game
i managed to get a used version and as of now have put a total of  hours into the game
this game is a very long game
its not hard but a majority of the time spent in this game is for training
the goal of this game is to rescue your sister milayou who was kidnapped by warabou some stupid looking monster
in order to save you sister you must get and train an army of monsters and win all the classes especially the s class to enter the tournament where if you win you get to make a wish which is obviously to save your sister
this is how i rated this gamegraphicsmusicreplay valuegameplayoverallhowever this is one of many games that has a very bad replay value
however you dont have to replay this game you could just either train or compete again in anything
the only problem with this gamne is there are no other side quests like in dragon warrior monsters  that makes the game boring while you train
the only problem that got me away from this game
well thats all i gotta sayto getting  stars
this is in many respects an excellent game
i am a big fan of the regular dragon warrior series and one of the big features of that series were the wellconceived battles
they arent quite as interesting in dwm because there is a maximum of  foes at any one time allowing for less complexity
however there are many compensating featuresthe monster breeding the tournament levels and particularly the random dungeon layouts
and the game does not end at the endfar from it
far off in the distance is the possibility of defeating the master trainer and farther still the possibility of collecting all the monstersand it is in that last area alas where the games fatal flaw resides
the final monster is generated by a complex multigenerational breeding process
and two of his many ancestors that cannot be bred can be found only in a couple of dungeons that can be accessed only by winning on three diferent occasions five consecutive games of rockpaper scissors against other characters
think of itthat means you would have to try an average of  times before doing this
and to add insult to injury you have to suffer having the instructions read to you each and every one of those  times
a true masterpiece of playtesting stupidity
however theres enough else in the game to warrant  stars
just dont say i didnt warn youtimestalkers for the younger crowd is the sequel to the sega genesis hit landstalkers
in typical sega fashion this game breaks new ground and leads the rpg genre into a risky and very different direction
first warning if you like to level up until you have godlike powers and then storm through the level look elsewhere
you start off in each dungeon at level  and can carry only a few items with you when you enter
what i feel is the hardest part about getting into timestalkers is the break from the old quotlevelupquot stratum that the rpg genre seems to be bound to at the hip
there is no i repeat no level gains between dungeons
all level ups are done in the dungeon and once you beat the boss you are back to level one again
however you do increase as your class increases allowing you to have more abilities and skills which do follow you from dungeon to dungeon
the graphics are quite colorful and are a pleasant break away from the squaresoft style which has permeated virtually every rpg on the face of the planet
the music is downright strange but if anything interesting enough to keep me listening to it
combat is an interesting matter
you are placed on a grid with your opponents and engage in turnbased combat
the only real difference that separates this from the traditional rpg is the ability to move along these grid squares in combat which can affect your various skills and strengths
as though pokemon has spread a virus throughout the world yes monster collecting is in the game and yes you can use them in combat to either help you or battle your opponents
if anything i suggest buying this game simply for its artistic courage and innovation
the game is not for everyone but a pleasant distraction for one willing to try something newtimestalkers is a dreamcast rpg from the creators of such great games on sega systems such as landstalker realms of mysteriablazing heroesone and the same and shining series is it another classic well lets look at the pluses and minuses to find out the graphics on this game are retro cool and beautiful it will remind you of classic games on saturnn psone but they are better next generation graphics the graphics if you read my dreamcast review looks like someone made a cd rom for the n they are clean and good but not a huge upgrade the characters in the game once you get past sword and a doll character are from some of the most classic games on sega systems well once you get past shining not everyone is going to know these characters considering most were overlooked or did not come to us shores
lady of ladystalker for instance also some of the characters have been changed their personalities from the original games so while it is nice to see them it goes to show you not to miss with something not broken seeing as to how fans would have fond memories of these characters the innovation of going down to level one in every dungeon once you get used to it actually makes the game quite interesting and fun getting used to it takes time and patience and may lead to frustration especially on the limitations of items you can getbringcarry most of the time you level up so quickly in a dungeon that despite everything you can do quite well and since you get to carry more items as you level up it is not as bad as it sounds once you unlock the other characters you can play as them unfortunately you cannot play as more than one hero at a time catching monsters for allies is quite fun and makes the game interesting some of the monsters are useless for anything but completing your monster list the battle formation is interesting it is also frustrating seeing as to how you better have your monsters lined up just right or they are useless also you can be sneak attacked from behind or the side that can also render them useless unless you move them around in the middle of battle the realm this takes place in is interesting unfortunately the inhabitants of the realm are very generic and add very little to nothing to the story also the story is actually not that good anyway does have some interesting endings though  the dungeons are randomly generated and there are mini quests for you to complete after you meet the strange rabbit unfortunately do to the randomly generated dungeons the dungeons dont look that good and rather plain also those mini quests may not be able to be completed pending on your objective for instance catch a certain monster that may not appear at all you can learn skills and spells via leveling and class leveling unfortunately due to the fact that you start at level one in every dungeon may take a bit for you to be able to use those skillsspells monster allies tooso overall is this a good game yes i would say very good it is innovative and i would say for all hardcore and patient rpg  players this is a must own for the dreamcast it is a good value for the current asking price and can be fun and highly addicting unfortunately due to random dungeons and boring story it falls short of being a classic or maybe it is a slightly underachieving classic if there is such a thing solid  star gamethe dreamcast might be dead but this game is very much alive
id recommend it but you know gotta getta dreamcast first ifya catch my drift the only reason i played it was cauz i already had one a dreamcast  but ifyoure lookin to play a good game and you dont own a dreamcast this would be a great reason to get one
this along with mabey a few other games but dependin on the gamer idk if a fewz a good enough reason to actually buy one but for me
itwas good enough to keep so i kept it along with the legacy ofthe otherfew aka the chozen few good games this console was actually able to provide
itwill not disappointthis game is very good
lots of cars to pick from real weather conditions and time of day
one thing i really like about this one is the way it puts you in training from the beginging by making you earn everything you start with nothing you have to race to get your first car
a few times around a track and you quickly over come the interace issues
from that point on you become a better driver and the game continues to become fun rather than a struggle to drive using an awkward controller set as some racing games dofour out of five stars because i really like the control options and the graphics are above averagethe badand things to consider  the game is hard and it is a simulation not arcade like  if you want the most graphicly appealing racing game for dreamcast this is not you stop
try quottest drive le mansquot or quottest drive vrallyquot vrally for arcade lemans is simulation like this game
 the menuing system is one of the worst i have ever delt withthis is the hardest racing game ive ever played in my life
in every track i have to pull the handbrake to make the turns in order to earn enough kudos to unlock the tracks
not just that u also have to make it to the line on time too
if i drive regularly by just pressing the brake amp downshift i dun earn 
this game is really really hard i have to play a course over amp over at least like  to  times in order to get enough kudos
btw i agree that when the car just slightly hit the wall the car just completely stops
come on man
where is the momentum
shouldnt the car be bounced off and keep going
anyway im kinda disappointed that u cant modify your car amp thats wat i love to do in gtamp one more thing there is no replay datz kinda  u knowwell even tho i have complained a whole lot i still rate the game  stars
i have to admit the game is fun
i didnt regret buying it but i think they can improve amp do better than this
and since there are hundreds of tracks needed to be unlock this game can last for quite a long time
unlike other racing games beat the game in  days and never feel like playing it again anymoregreat game
mindboggling superbness
except one thing
any and all fr cars frontengine rearwheel drive cars are nearly impossible to prevent from spinning out in the rainsoim in the final few chapters and my best car is a toyota celica gtfour cuz its the most powerful car available to me that isnt fr
and for the difficulty
damn
frustrating muchbut thats what makes a good gameeven though im not able to skillfully drive an rx like id like to
overall out of note again that msr has great graphics
however in some areas in the several tracks the lighting is so dim i cannot see turns clearly
the game frame rate seems just a bit slow so i dont feel adrenalized driving a car at  mph in the city
also when you bump into barriers the car just stops it wont bounce back or spin the car around
not that ive ever ran into walls in real life but msr just doesnt seem to have that realism id imagine
alright so ive been negative about this game
but i am glad to have purchased it
ive played many many racing games both on playstation and dreamcast big names like granturismo amp tokyo extreme racer  test drive lemans etc 
msr is one of the most interesting as well as enjoyable racing games to play
theres something about racing in the city thats different from a racing on a circuit track
there are more surprises and possibilities to do well or screwup in the streets
msr im sure youve heard is not about how fast you drive its about how you drive fast
you need precision and lots of practice to win kudos but with the games great controls you should be able to drive quite well after a few run
the game can keep you addicted as you try to unlock new tracks and cars
the game play is simple and tight
the driving is solid
the graphics are great
only thing is there is a longer learning curve than most racing games trying to get good at this gamenamco museum for the n is a really good retro game
individuals  years and older will remember these games well
for those individuals who are younger than  namco museum provides an opportunity to play some of the classic videogames that started the whole video game frenzy
namco museum consists of  games
ms pacman galaxian galaga dig dug and pole position
ms pacman everyone knows about
galaxian and galaga are space invader type games dig dug is a unique digging and destroying enemies game and pole position is the classic arcade steering wheel racing game
all games are great fun for a quick pick up and play
the lack of a battery save feature for high scores reasoning for  stars is sort of a disappointment but writing scores down is not that tedious of an ordeal
overall namco museum is a great port of the arcade classics for a quick  minute game between class meetings or a lunch break and is a good addition to everyones n librarymy youngest son insisted to him mom that this should be my gift for fathers day
being a sound and worldly adult i said i didnt care
now that i have it i just smile and grin
i dont think i can count the number of quarters i spent on these games in my youth in fact a coffie shop near the house has ms pacman and galaga and i spent quarters there with both of my boys
the games themselves are a joy but there are several weaknesses
the contols for the pacman games respond slowly or maybe im just slower and standard n controler isnt easy for pole position
on the whole this is a great set of games invoking a great set of memories and most important fun i can have with my sonsnamco museum has been hogged with by playstation for  volumes
it was time for the series to come to nintendothis compilation contains  arcade classics pacman ms pacman galaga galaxian pole position and dig dug
each one of them has simple gameplay but it can easily become addictinghowever you might overlook this for the more popular n games such as super mario  but overall its a pretty good collectionthe playstation may not have a whole lot of action rpgs but brave fencer is one of the best
its fun addictive and its made by squaresoft so how can you go wrong
the biggest drawback is the short play length around  hours if you take it slow
its still one to check outgreat game
entertaining storyline and voices
fun concept on being the herothe one flaw i have noticed is a need for more save points
several times i found myself either continuing on when i didnt want to or just turning the game off without saving simply because i was not able to find a spot to be able to log my progressthis game is very fun and i recomend it to all action rpg fans
it is much like zelda in several ways but has many new features that other action rpgs do not have
the voice programing is great
each caracter as thier own personality and most of them are halariously funny
that was very well done
pluse instead of the quot traditional sword and shildquot musashi has two swords
the game play hours are pretty good too
it probably takes about  hours to master
the graphics are pretty good
i never expected square to come out with a quotaction rpgquot but hey those geniuses had to make one sooner or later right
it is not chalangeing enouph so that wiped a star off my rating
but overall it is a fun game and im sure you would enjoy itquotdiabloquot is something of a compromise between true rpgs and arcade games like quotgauntletquot basically its all about going into a hole in the ground killing whats there and looting the bodies
the quests and puzzles really arent challenges but rather let you know what sort of critters to kill and loothaving said that the game is addictive especially when playing with another person who preferably is using one of the other classes of character available in the game
roaming the dungeon under tristram hacking your way through hordes of demons and the undead all for an even shinier and fancier new weapon or suit of armor  or most fun more spells for your sorcerer  is a great way to kill an afternoon and a sure cure for bad days at workthe graphics in the playstation version are a slight improvement over the disappointing computer graphics  the camera is zoomed in significantly letting you see whats going on in the dimly lit dungeon  and the interface while not as intuitive and relatively unobtrusive as the one in quotdiablo iiquot works extremely well and the learning curve for most players will be very shorttwo player mode while lots of fun does have some limitations mainly that both players are trapped on a single screen together and a zealous partner can inadvertently trap the other character behind walls or barrels in the middle of a widespread meleethe violence here is gory and theres references to violence against the young prince of the land but for the game is far less graphic and intense than most horror movies and should be something that teenagers can handle quite easilythe game also has appeal for adults whove tired of the thinking involved with quotwarcraftquot or who have experience with paperandpencil rpgs and just want to smite some demonsand while quotdiablo iiquot isnt yet available for any videogame console systems  and will likely suffer when it does  this bargainpriced original game will serve as a good primer on the game and its setting and sets the stage for the computer game sequela solid game despite its age and one well worth owningfirst i want to say that im a huge diablo fan
ive been playing this game on the pc on my windows 
and since this game is too old to be played on the newer pcs i did some digging around and found a port version on the ps so i bought itfirst the game itself stays true to the opening cut scene to the menu and music
its a really good port in that aspect however i have some complicated which knocks off a starone is that for some reason it could be my memory card but still frustrating for me the games dont save right
either you have to save your progress or save your character and do everything all over again
again it might be my memory card but thats a letdowntwo is the two player coop
its very limiting but while fun its hard to explore without the other person also its terrible trying to equipment a new weapon in coop because you have to pause the whole game so the player can equip their weapon and armoroverall fun game not as fun as the pc version but it gets it right for the most partdiablo is pretty faithfully ported over to the playstation however the graphics arent as clean as in the pc version of the game
but this game is still a worthy addition to your playstation library simply for the fact that the dungeons characters items weapons etc
hold such a diverse amount that this game can keep you occupied for weeks and weeks
the twoplayer option is really cool allowing you and a friend to tackle the dungeons together
everytime you start a new game the dungeons quotrandomizequot so you wont find things in the same place as you did before
sound is on par however if youre used to the mouse in the pc version the controls associated with the psx will confuse you at first
a little practice is all thats needed to master it in no time
overall an excellent game worthy of addition to anyones library of playstation games if theyre into a good oldfashioned quotdungeon rompquota great game for the occasional gamer this game combines a very interesting fighting game with a fullfeature rpg
plus you can play teh game as cloud tifa vincent and yuffie all from ff
this is a very fun gameplay with your buddies beat on your little brother or sister in this great fighter game
some how i feel as if this game was tucked under the covers of the video game world and has not been exposed enough to othersthis isnt just corner your opponent and hack until they are defeated
there is some skill actually involvedtheres quite a few features to this game but some of them i left hardly touched
the rpg game included in this to me was gross in design and not very fun
i wasnt captivated by it at allhowever this game is not about the rpg feature its all about the action between two opponents and unlocking great characters such as vincent and yuffie from ffvii
you can also unlock other neat characters and new outfits for everyonea great game for its time sadly overlooked by many
to me though it got boring after a while but it still is great
not as addicting as some of the newer fighter games
however some may find discovering many moves and using them quite intriguing
the controls are quite good on this game
some of the arenas to fight in seemed smallbe warey of the prices it is going for
i found this game several times between   
however if youre a collector money isnt always a factor
besides it all its kind of a hard game to findif you like this game or are considering it other games that may interest you aresoul blade  psxsoul calibur ii  ps gamecube xboxbloody roari rented this game because it has final fantasy people in it
and its fun to battle them but theres not much more to this game
the graphics are standard the sound could use some improving the control is pretty bad and the overall game is mildly amusinggraphics sound control fun factor the title said it this is a game that tried some new things while adding some familiar characters of the time
there are secret characters to unlock combos to discover and various d arena environments which either help or hurt you
it seems like it did inspire quite a bit of future games so if you are looking for nostalgia than this is the game for you
if not then you could probably passneed for speed is amazingcool trackscool effectsand cool cars of courseneed for speed is a fun game for anyoneif you try it you will love itwelli wont tell you what you are going to see in the gamebecause its a surprisebut there is also tournmentsracesand you can try to unlock trackscarsand moreif you complete some tournmentsthe rest a surprisei hope you like it toolike mei recently purchased this cdrom and having owned its prequel need for speed  hot pursuit i expected need for speed high stakes to be considerably better
unfortunately all in all its no betterneed for speed  is a great game visually more than in any other way and it also has a plethora of setup options and hot pursuit modes of play which is why it was such a fun game
however it had some major flaws as well its biggest flaw arguably was the driving physics theres a slight delay in the steering response and the cars feel like their floating from side to side instead of firmly grasping the road which made driving the cars very tedious aggravating and nearly impossible to avoid hitting sides of the road and other cars making the game a lot less fun than it should have beenin like manner need for speed high stakes is visually eyecandy it also has a lot of setup options a new career mode of play and vehicle damage not to mention the famed hot pursuit modes of play
however i was extremely disappointed in two major flaws which severely detract from fun and entertaining gameplay the driving which was already severely flawed in need for speed  is even worse in this game astonishingly
why electronic arts didnt correct this flaw i have no idea but thats totally incompetent of them and unacceptable
also the cars exteriors are very botched they look like kindergarten artwork whereas in need for speed  they look very accurate and greatalthough the game is still very good overall certain flaws nonetheless severely detract from gameplay unfortunately
the game should have been and could have been far betteri got parasite eve because i remember a family member playing it when i was young and she was hooked on it
i was slightly less impressed though it may be due to the slightly lessthansmooth translation and graphics both of which can reasonably be expected from an old game such as thisi loved the battle system
like most rpgs battles happen randomly throughout the game
you operate off something similar to an atb gauge
however you are able to move away from enemies and their attacks then move in to attack with something powerful
also you have to pay attention to the amount of ammo you are carryingoutside of gameplay controls can be a bit annoying
you may find yourself like me searching a drawer  times only to find something on the th time because you happened to be at just the right angle
however this shouldnt stop you from enjoying the game itselfthe characters are all interesting each with a minimum of backstory
the script however reads like a really bad s action flick
annoying but workableif youre looking for scares look somewhere else
the gameplay runs more the route of suspense and disgust and even that is at a minimumall in all an enjoyable game if you look past the flawsother than some control issues this game rocks
i really had a great time battling all the different creatures in the game especially the boss monsters
its one of the few games that i really enjoyed makingsquare began to experement with cinema style rpgs with parasite eve based upon the book of the same name
as far as i am aware it seems that this game is a sequel of sorts to that novel and alothough i do not believe the novel has been translated to english there is a movie based upon it that has been released state side by adv films
the film is subtitled and not very good but does help to add more depth to the universe of parasite evei wont write much about the story it is sufficent to say that the story is the driving force of this game which is a lot of fun but like with other experimental games not without its flawsthe first flaw that this game has is that is controls seem a bit un responsive and aya moves very stifly
this game could have benifited from the motion capture techneques that were later used on final fantasy viii
the next flaw is that the random encounters simmer down and eventually stop
you can wip out all enimes in a particular area making it hard to level up to riduculous levels of speed an power
random encounters are a pain as it is but if youre going to have them let me have enough of them to get up to level  and wipe the floor with the end guyhowever the weapon mods are interesting the overall gamplay is very innovative and over all this game was great
it is just a shame it was so short and impossible to make aya an all powerful unstopable juggarnaut like you can with other rpgsif you are a fan of both survival horroradventure and role playing then pick up a copy of this interesting video game
if not dont even bother
its a fantastic experience that almost everyone can enjoyparasite eve is a game that blends both the survivalhorror and rpg genres together keeping the best of both worlds
ultimately this makes this a unique game the likes of which ive never seen successfully repeated yes the sequel is quite bad
that being said i really enjoyed this game and im sure you will toographics score  the graphics look a bit dated by todays standards and werent even the absolute best for their time
however they look good enough and are not too displeasing to the eye
the cg cutscenes still look excellent in my opinion and do a good job of showcasing the freaky creatures that the game featuresmusic score  i really love the music for this game i even went and got the soundtrack because i enjoyed it so much
my only complaint is that the opera scene in the game uses a synthesized vocal track which sounds absolutely hideous compared to the regular opera singers voice on the soundtrack
why they didnt just use the unsynthesized song is beyond me
also of note is the excellent explorationrelated sound effects
i dont think ive ever heard squeakier creepier door sounds in my life
yes these sounds are a bit unnaturally loud but they are wellsuited to this type of game and add to the creepiness factor
unfortunately in battle sounds like gunshots are oddly mutedeve the rocket launcher is quiet
one more thingeven though the music itself is great there are times when it is strangely absent
at times i can tell that the silence is used for dramatic effect at other times it just seems random
for instance the weapons department of the police station where i store my excess crap almost always has no music but the rest of the station does
this makes no sense at all
oh well
rest assured that the negative points to the music really dont detract much from the overall fine experiencecharacters score  aya is the main character and the only character which you will get to control
that being said i really liked her and think she is more than capable of carrying the game alone
being a survivalhorror sort of game only having one character helps add to the feeling of loneliness and fear since you are on your own
one thing i really like about aya is that she is not treated like a stereotypical girlygirl nor as a blatant sexobject
this unfortunately seems to happen a lot in games where the main character is female
she is very much a believable nononsense cop
after seeing too many games where the female characters fight while wearing miniskirts and heels who fights monsters in a miniskirt
 ive really started to appreciate the fact that the designers opted for realism in parasite eve and put aya in jeans sneakers and a jacket
its really unusual to see such a believable female lead character and im very pleased
as for the other supporting characters and even aya herself they do not get a lot of background information or dialogue and do not really get a lot of character development
the other characters are really more archetypal characters such as the workaholic cop who doesnt spend enough time with his family or the nerdy socially inept scientist
even though their personalities arent deeply developed you can still understand and relate to them as characters because youre familiar with the archetypes
this lack of deeper characters normally wouldnt work in a traditional rpg but the game pulls it off well because it is more storydrivenstory score  the story takes place in a fairly short amount of time  days but its very engaging
true the premise of sentient mitochondria is a bit farfetched but if you suspend your disbelief the story is incredibly enjoyable
square did a good job of crafting a creepy tale full of hideous monsters thatll keep you on the edge of your seat
the main storyline is great but one thing i must point out without spoiling anything is that the bonus ending for going through the chrysler building in the ex game is a real bust
i felt so cheated after seeing that endingit is way not worth the effort to get
however if you stick to the main game youre likely to have a great timebattle system score  the game designers did a great job of blending action elements and turnbased gameplay to give us an enjoyable hybrid
you can move aya freely around during battle to dodge enemy attacks while waiting for your time bar to fill
once its full you hit the x button to bring up an attack menu and a grid
the grid shows you the range of youre weapon
simple yes
also you can opt to open up your menu when you get your turn and use an item instead of attacking
the game features many guns and armor which can be customized by using a tool to add features from one weaponarmor onto another
you also get bonus points when you level up which can be used to increase your inventory size the speed of your time bar or weaponarmor stats
overall i found the customization feature to be very enjoyablegameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
one thing that i found annoying was ayas running speed its like her feet are sticky or something because she runs really slowly
another thing that was a bit annoying is that the game has random battles but they arent exactly random
there are hot spots on the floor that can trigger random battles if you happen to step in that area
unfortunately these are somewhat few and far between and the more they are triggered the lower your chances of getting that spot to trigger again
while this is good because you have fewer random battles than a normal rpg it wouldve been easier to levelraise if the game featured just regular old random battles that trigger every few steps or so
other than that the gameplay is mostly positive
i really enjoy how you can return to previous locations to levelraise or get items cant leave the final area at the end of the game unfortunately
i also like the fact that they kept the survivalhorror feel of having limited inventory space but also gave you a convenient place you can store extra items in the weapons department of the police station
overall i think the game designers did a very good job of combining the best elements of survivalhorror and rpg gameplayoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
if youre a fan of rpgs and always wanted to play a survivalhorror game but really hate the gameplay element of the latter then parasite eve is for you
its really quite sad that parasite eve is the only game ive found that successfully pulls off this blending of genres i really wish there were some more parasite eve  unfortunately was quite awful
i strongly urge you to add this game to your collection you wont be disappointedits a shame that in this world in this age we rarely see games that have a female hero
parasite eve is one of those rare jewels that has a female to fill in the main role and is a good game
not only is aya the hero but she isnt some tiny girl whose boobs are so big it looks like she stuffs them full of basketballs
shes a realistic looking girl she still is quite a looker who can keep up with the big boys
ok enough with that the actual game is sweet
the setting takes place in present day and still is completely realistic
yeah i know what you people are thinking its not realistic look at the psx graphics
i gotta admit this early psx game doesnt hold its own graphics wise anymore but with an awesome plot and a good battle system it just kicks simply kicks
aya is a police officer who ends up being our only hope
even the military cant stand up against the enemy who fights on a genetic level
the games plot goes all the way to eve eve is really a woman they found in africa everyone in the world is related too seriously look it up on a search engine and connects to the genes we all have
the idea that our mitochondria are against us is just ridiculous but this game pulls it off and is still extremely realistic
the games selling point is the awesome plot that is simply genius
before there was silent hill and the creepy atmosphere it created there was parasite eve this game had a creepiness of its own but most likely because of silent hill and resident evil it isnt known for its creepy side
hell aya is a sexy gun toting girl next door you got a killer crazy woman the police hell the government cant lay a finger on and an awesome plot and battle system what more do you want cant wait to start playing parasite eve this game is pretty cool but i think it could be better
first of all the main character needs to walk faster
it takes way too long to get somewhere
the graphics are amazing as well as the sound
i look forward to getting the sequel and examine the changesim a big rpg fan and have been playing them ever since i can remember
parasite eve is an excellent well designed game but it does have its shortcomings especially when compared to the mainstream rpgs like the final fantasy seriesyour protagonist is aya a policewoman who starts the game by going to an opera show
during the solo singing part from a mysterious girl the entire audience spontaneously combustsexcept for aya
you proceed to unravel the mystery of this girl the power she has and her connection to aya
its an original if simplistic plotline that flows pretty wellgraphics are nothing spectacular but granted it is a psx game
sound is more ambient than anything else
no fastpaced battle musicthe combat system is an important part of rpgs
unlike most games you only control a single characterthere is no party of characters in this game
she can walk freely during the entire battle while her attack meter builds up to maximum then she can take an action whether it be attacking using an item or magicwell not really magic but its the best description i can give without spoilers
then you proceed to run around an dodge enemy attacks while waiting for your attack meter to reach maximum again
a tad repetitive
or it would be if the game was longer than  hoursunless you want to try that massive  level secret areawhen you level up you also get a bunch of points that you can spend
you can spend them directly on aya and improve your base statsor maximum inventory space to carry more healing items or upgrade your weapons with themkind of pointless since you get a lot of new weapons at least in the beginning
nifty system but it doesnt make up for the shortcomings of the gameparasite eve is evidence of how a game should be made
it is very well designed
however it lacks the fun factor that other rpgs have
if you are looking for older rpgs to try give star ocean  a lookmark lauerparasite eve  circa good different and interesting story customizable weapons and itemsbad graphics looked dated to today video game players tough game some dungeons are tediousif it fits your taste a scifi urban rpg set in nyc not turn based but action based with turn based elements multiple endings customizable items and weaponsgame its most assocated too resident evil  parasite eve additional notes this game uses real sites and places from nyci was expecting alot better when i bought this game
there are a few reasons for this first of all aya walks way to slow it takes an hour to get to where you wanna go so i usaully skip getting the item which affects the gameplay
also some of the fmv are disgusting a rat coming out off his skin to a horse setting on fire to a crowd of people melting
i did like the battle system though in it you run around the enemy and when the meter fills you get to shoot it
this game is fun but appeals to more of a survivel horror crowdthis game is definately interesting
the story is very scientific and supernatural
the battle system was cool as well
you must let your parasite energy charge to do special attacks
like mp
the games very short but has a replay mode so you will play it again giving it  hours of gameplay
if you can pick it up cheap then pick it upif you love the original resident evil trilogy or dino crisis you will love the parasite eve franchise
excellent artwork for its day excellent sound design and gameplay and one of the weirdest game storylines that doesnt happen to be from kojima himselfi purchased this game solely on its amazing tv commercial
i never quite enjoyed resident evil but this is more than mere clone
for instanceit incorporated real facts
whole theory about mitochondria eve is well preserved and used very well to give otherwise straight forward storylinebattle system is more rpglike than action game
ive been playing rpg extensively so this battle system came natural
also if you are not good at handon combat style this battle system gives you breathing room to make your decisionit doesnt hurt to include gorgeous fmv and preview discall told this game is definately worth shot at least for rentingthis is a classic from the original sega title brought to the playstation
it has all the classic features of d racing and road rashing
although this title brings forward a new idea of common racers with a bar chatting theme
you can beat on other members of the group or ride by them and see how they react to your actionsoverall the game is pretty unique with new cinematic to view and new bikes to explorethis game has one good quality pure and nonsensical violence
however unlike other games out there this is truly macho violence
first off this game is about riding a sport or harley motorcycle and whacking other gang members and most importantly winning the race
next the controls are simple and easy to learn and the bikes are variably responsive depending on the motorbike that you choose
true the graphics are a little predated as compared to the playstation  but it does the job
there will be some popup and vanishing acts of people
it does offer a tremendous multiplayer game from coop to versus
with the gang members whacking you with various weapons and cops on bikes chasing you this has to be the most fun
this game even offers quotfiveoquot mode where you get to be the cop
that has to be one of the best modes for this game
the cutscenes for this game are weak they are really really bad
overall this game is great and this should be a fun and exceeding addition to any playstation libraryi loved the first game with its quotchose your own adventurequot format and its enchanting tales of a futureisticmystical world full of vampirelike mysitcs and vengeful superheroes so when i read in my favorite gameing publication psm that square soft was releasing a sequal i was thrilled
as soon as it appeared on the shelves i bought it and began playing as soon as i got home
sadly the game play can get tedious at times and it lacks the wide range of immediately playable characters that the first outing had other than that the game is pretty good
if you look at sf as a standalone title instead of a sequal you stop compairing it with the original and see it for the intriguing story it is
it may not be lunar or final fantasy calliber as far as story and character development but the battle system has been improved scince the first game and there is plenty of humor to be found scattered about
all in all saga frontier  is just a good game for a rainy boring dayi borrowed this game from my friend for laughs you would no what i mean if you played the first but i was very wrong
the music is great very very catchy the graphics are good and the plot is okay
but with all that is good there is flaw the battle system and the way the games plot prgress
the battle system is way to complicated with weapon points and all this other junk who has the time
and the plot progression is very weird you pick what happens by clicking on the scene that you want
this confused me and the plot watching gustavs  year old story before i watch his  year old story
if you liked the first one which is somewhat impossible than youll love the secondill start off with my honest opinion of takahashi and his wife too
as a storyteller and game designer
i honestly believe that this man is capable of making some of the absolute greatest stories and games of all time
unfortunately it seems that with every game of his that ive played i have enjoyed either the story or the gameplay much more than the other aspect in question
for xenogears i found myself very intrigued by the story
at the same time the gameplay while fun at times definitely felt dated and slow to me
this has to be a personal feeling though because so many other people on the internet and elsewhere find the gameplay to be some of the best in an rpg to this day
dont get me wrong though the battles can actually be really fun especially when you get to create deathblow chain combos
despite my qualms about the game feeling slow and clunky i still have to hand it to takahashi for creating easily the most ambitious science fiction story that i have ever experienced in a jrpg
for this fact alone i could easily recommend xenogears to anyone who wants to experience a jrpg with a very interesting and captivating story
in the end i would highly recommend xenogears for anyone looking for a great story or even if you are simply a fan of takahashis later workprosthe story is very deep and interesting and keeps you playing the game even if the gameplay turns you offthe characters are very well done and you will likely get attached to some of themthe music composed by yasunori mitsuda is amazing as per usual with his workmecha combat while painful at times looks really badassthe ambition of the game as a whole really shows and its greatdeathblows button combos in combat on foot are actually really fun to mess around withconsthe gameplay as a whole at least to me feels dated and slow especially in gear dungeonsthe dungeons themselves can get quite tedious and several of them can take hours to dredge throughthe encounter rate in certain areas can get annoyingly high but not enough to make you ragequitwhen walking around in an area with encounters there seems to be a lag between when an encounter is programmed to occur and when it actually starts
you will notice this and at times especially when you are about to enterexit an area it probably will annoy youmixedthere seems to be a slight preference by the creators towards gear battles
depending on how much you like battling in gears this could either be good bad or not an issue at allthere is some religious symbolism in this game and while it does not specifically target any religion someone who is or isnt religious could be offended by it depending on how they view fictitious depictions of religionthere is some nudity both pixelated and in cutscenes but you dont see too much
it still could be a bad thing if youre strongly against nudity in any form thoughthis game wold be perfect if not for the horrorible terrible cursed cd   squaresoft what hapenned
run out of money
the programers died or misteriouselly desapeared
this is the felling you get wen you play the game the goodthis game has a really good storyline and we get a main character thats unique in the sense that he doesnt want to fight but he knows that he must
the storyline has often been touted as the best plot an rpg ever had and while that can be debated i always thought chrono trigger had the best storyline its still awesome
a futuristic tale of social class warfare with various different symbolisms very complex
i was a bit disturbed at the games athiest point of view but oh well
ill let that slide
the battle system is also quite good featuring several different combos your characters and gears can perform
the music is top notch and since its the same composer of chrono trigger yasunori mitsuda you can expect a gold musical score here
the multiplayer feature is quite good too and i shun all those people who have beaten me by using xenogears the ultimer cheating gear cough cough someone i know cough coughthe badthe unfortunate downside of this game happens to be in the presentation
this game is virtually  dialogue and story and  gameplay
im not kidding
i came here to play a game not watch it
i guess the rpg fans just want to sit there in awe but when a battle is going on i expect to participate in it
i was vastly disappointed when it cut to one of the characters in a chair talking about the battle with the pendant in the background swaying back and forth
this happened a lot on the second disc and its a shame
i also felt the love story albeit far from bad didnt quite get the boost that it needed it just seemed to happen
oh welloveralldie hard rpg fans no doubt love this game and while its far from terrible i do think its overrated
a great story with interesting characters but not nearly enough gameplay involvement
if i wanted to watch something ill watch a dvd
nevertheless i do recommend this game to any rpg fan but only to those with a lot of patience
i might get negatives for this but thats just because the people that give negative votes are usually very shallowdo you like square rpg games macross anime and all scifi in general
we have a winner
this game was a very ambitious project origionally launched by square soft
lets jump into the world that is xenogearsgraphicsthe graphics were done very well for the time this came out
the anime cut scenes compliment the ingame graphics
it isnt seemless but it isnt as obnoxious or distracting as it is when done in other titles
the d rotating map was distracting hard to follow and made me want to throw up at points
sometimes you are exploring an area in human size
sometimes you are on a large overhead map  but you can board and exit your gear robot
in areas where you can pilot your gear i dont recommend exiting unless you want to be stepped onthe storythe story in this game is the thing people still talk about to this day
this game addresses and sometimes spoofs politics philosophy religion economics consumerism aliens ufos and large stuffed animals
it was as if the programmers borrowed from every point of media that they have ever enjoyed and stuffed it into the story
for large robot stuff they borrow from the guyver neon evengeleon gundam  all of them  voltron and bunch of other cartoons i cant even remember right now
the rpg elements borrow from almost every video game ever
the main story and character arcs you will recognize from a multitude of sci fi tv shows and films
off the top of my head i was reminded of the twilight zone outer limits and soylent green
some of the ques they borrow from anime scenes might have people ready to cry plagerism
if you dont get out much or watch too many things then the story will probably captivate and enthrall your attentiongame playthe other place this game shines is in the gameply department
the game uses an active time battle system
the enemies dont wait for you to act and if you arent careful you get hurt in a hurry
you get these ap points to determine the strenght or combination of attacks
differant buttons have differant point ap point values
entering specific button combos will activate specific super attacks
you can save your points up to unload with a super finisher combo
instead of magic you get ether points for magic attacks
your ether stuff is the usual attackbuffheal rpg fair
fighting in your gear is the same
some gears have different special attacks that use ether that are only available to certain characters
these are weak and its typically better to use your physical attacks instead unless youre fighting one of those magic damage only monsters
also you can store your points in hopes of going into hypermodethe bottom linethis game has alot of things going for it
xenogears was released in a time when square fans had begun to feel alienated and even insulted by its later offerings
after the final fantasy series became dead to me xenogears was a refreshing breath of life
it was a very ambitious title that i dont even think the developers were able to complete
disk  was a non stop rolercoaster ride
disk  was a lazy remember when that happened retrospective with a grandfather clock ticking in the background as you sit on a rocking chair and jump from one scene to the next via flash backs
its like if young steven speilberg directed disk  and disk  was directed by old man george lucas
it gets alot lazier but the programmers had a deadline to make
this is one of the greatist games i will never play again
i enjoyed it
it was resonably deep but xenogears is a pilgrimadge i will only be making once
play this if you consider yourself a hardcore squarerpg gamerxenogears is one of those premier titles that for some reason you cant attack
unlike final fantasy vii which has just as much naysayers as it as fanatics xenogears is one of those kind of games where any attempt to label it less than a masterpiece is met with you just didnt get it or you dont know good videogames then
so allow me to be one of the few that will say the game is in the gray area its a good even great game but its just shy from the awesomeness everyone says it isstory fei lives in lahan a quiet pastorallike village
one night massive robots called gearssimilar to evangelions evas land and fei jumps in an unoccupied gear to fight them off
something is awakened however inside him and he unleashes which doesnt bode well for his village
shunned by the villagers he leaves and finds himself in a massive plot with serious religious overtonesgraphics its the playstation so it does look a bit outdated
however the graphics at times are nice to look at during the citieslocations
the overworld looks awful while battles look pretty decent especially the gear battles
the only problem is the camera sometimes
its d so you can rotate the camera but sometimes the camera wont go higher or lower so sometimes its pretty much guesswork how high something issoundmusic funny how both opposites these are
first off the va during the anime cutscenes are fine but the lipsync is even worse than old kung fu movie dubs
the music however is excellent and you should definately track down the soundtrackgameplay the battle system is slightly different than that tap x stuff but not by much
you get  moves weak mid and strong
weak takes  ap mid  and strong takes  you have a certain limit of ap that you can use
however you can decide to save it and add it to a meter
save up enough and you can unleash one deathblow move after another
the only problem is that i couldnt find any indication on what your deathblow moves were
its pretty much trial and error trying to figure out what the combos are or simply research on the internet
i went through a good  hours before i realized how to get a deathblow cause there was no way of knowing what they were let alone how to get onethe gear battles are somewhat the same except each move costs fuel and you have a preset limit
you can charge to replenish your fuel or you can booster which costs fuel but your attacking is better
your deathblows as a human are important because they carry over to your gears as well
and theyre quite important too
one early battle in my gear i was doing all my best attacks against one boss and i didnt know how to heal gears yet so he completely beat me before he even got close to dying
learning deathblows i quickly beat him afterwardshows the story
well its wellwritten sure with a lot of religious references and elements
however the games so serious that the characters in a way feel like ways to advance the plot without being fleshed out
also what i call the teaser happens too often
thats the wait this happened could it be hes
parts and you find out  hours later what that is
questions upon questions get piled up leaving you quite confused until laterits certainly a recommendable game its just not one of those best rpg ever ones its merely one of their better onesi absolutely love this game
people always review games and movies saying this is the best ever
well i will not hesitate to say that this is the third best game ive ever played
in rank tied for first place is final fantasy  and ico third place is xeno
ff and ico are just far to supurb to rank lower but to different in styles to say which is better
xeno follows up so closely heres the lowdowngenre rpg scifi
mecha styled with anime as its foundation for themes and artstylegraphics psone level entry level graphics

characters and such are depicted with d sprites with many many frames

 member battle party
 euipment  weapon  accessories same for gear
support and elemental magic
save points
xp epmp
cg and anime cutscenesbattle system  the battle system is unique one would think that this game was a beta test for chrono cross
there are two combat modes walking or gear
walking of course is person to person fighting sprite graphics
you have several options but what drives the entire walking combat system are death blows
at the beginning of the turn you have a full attack bar anywhere from  to  points can be spent
three attacks easy medium and heavy cost   and  points respectively
after a certain combination is inputed the character will execute a deathblow given that it is learned
this is a major part of the walking combat system
if you do not spend these points in the attack bar they go to an ap meter
after enough ap is acquired if can be spent for a chain of death blows
ap resets after the battle
the gear combat is similar except only one attack can be made
after every attack the characters gains an attack level up to  levels
at any level ther can be a combo pulled off for more damage that will reset the attack level
now gear combat is also driven with fuel and it is used for every action except an ether attack magic
items help to add do the damage quickness and other stats
deathblower items add the deadliest combos to the gear battles
booster mode spends more fuel but hightens speeda very neat thing that square did with this game was to make the hps of the gears and the players relative
players have a hp max while gears have a  hp max
while palyers level up with xp gears only level up with parts
there is no part on a gear that makes it  though scene once in a storyline battle
a character may cuase  poins of damage to a gear usually a killing blow to many walking enemies but a mere scratch to the gearsquare really tried to make a great game here and they have
i believe they made a great game but thats becuase i can see its potential and really judge rpgs more from a storyline basis and a character basis than anything else
what really happened here
square made a game that exceeded the psones capabilities
simple
what happened then
square sacrificed so many things to make the game playable on the ps and thus almost ruined it
it lacks so many things that we now find standard
the controls are easy to get but there is no customization menu no text speed control just options for sound mono stereo wide stereo
the menu is easy to maneuver and the save menu allows you to copy games and delete games even nonxeno games which is a plus
what else well they sacrificed the cutscenes too for the legnth of the game they kept the wonderful anime to only the most important scenes and the cg only covers what seems to be just what is most cool looking
i found many moments when i was yelling at it saying and you didnt animate that scene
god that was one of the most important scenes
after having beaten the game i can see that the truly vital scenes are what is animatedthere is a neat little battleling between gears
its tekken like kinda
not really
it has  attack buttons a jump ether missile dash and block
its a neat little minigame that will let you acquire two of the greatest items in the game deathblower  and the gnsrsummnorother which increases the gear attack by 
the strength of your gear does not effect the gears performance in the battle arena thoughwhat really bothered me was the text storyline sequence in the second disk  just about all the second disk is key battle to key battle
i would assume that this was to save room in the story maybe it would have been too long any other way but it just seems less fun more movieishlike in the second diskand about that storyline its really good
i liked it
but the way it is expalined and handed to you is so confusing even when they go to explain it to you youre confused
im pretty quick and got it but boy my roommate mind boggled
its kinda good in a way gives you a reason to play it a second timeit is essentially a good game
but it seems that it could have had more to it though it was long i would have liked to see the rest of it first hand instead of through the words of the characters invovled
it is really twisted plot that holds many mysteries and ultimately will make sense
but just as you think you understand you really dont
i would highly recommend this game to those with patience
power gamers would like this game too
i would also highly recommend this game to squares rerelease board for a remake adding more to it now with up to  times more space on the ps dvd and better graphics such and such
it is a good game
has a little anime blood in it but nothing really big
a common violence package that final fantasy games are used to seeing
has a religious context but really isntif you know chrono trigger lucca makes a cameo appearancehappy gamingits a shame to know that such a wonderful concept of a game had to go through budget cuts due to other final fantasy games coming out
xenogears is a pure rpg classic
however i only recommend this to those who are in love with the rpg genre and also whom dont mind to read for long periods of time
this brought a great gaming experience but some times frustrating
often the mazes the characters were forced to find their way through brought on a lot of aggravation when there were a lot of random encounters
by the time the battle was through one could almost have forgotten where they came fromthe pros excellent story with strong believable charactersbeautifully done animated cutscenes with voiceoversfun battle system with learned combos and magicquite a lengthy game took me  hours to completea gorgeous musical score get the soundtrack too
the cons often times frustrating areas to exploregraphics can be quite pixilatedthe battle sounds are quite repetitiveoverall xenogears is one of those hidden treasures in my oppinion
however if you are not an avid rpg player young into the genre and lack patience for lots of reading xenogears may not be the game for you
though the game is hard to find which may change since it may soon become a greatest hit although if you cant wait and believe your game collection is not complete with out it which is what i believe run and get it now it is worth a great cost
if the gameplay doesnt capture you then at least the heartwarming yet complex story willand vice versa
theres enough to love about this gamewhen i first played xenogears i thought it was absolutely awesome
its been awhile and after thinking about it this game is pretty messed up
it has some good qualities but isnt as incredible as i thought it wasfirst to mind is the characters
they are really cool and somewhat unique like billy the guntoting priest or rico the arena battling green thing
what could be better
i did have some problems with the main character fei though
i have never been able to forgive games for having characters which refuse to fight because fighting is bad and it kills people
especially when their own and others lives are on the line
i cant stand that
anyway fei gets over it and i got over it but that is cliched and quite frankly lamexenogears has an excellent turnbased combat system
it uses varying levels of attacks you can do  or  light attacks or  or  heavy ones combines those with combo moves and the ability to build up combo chains to create a fun challenging battle system
there are magic attacks of course but they are almost always worthless useless magic is another feature which annoys me
the addition of gear giant robot battles adds a lot more to the game
gear combat is essentially the same as normal combat but they are tougher have different moves and tend to fight cooler bosses
i dont think there were too many gear battles but the second disk definitely could have used more unarmed combat like i said the characters are coolthe soundtrack is good better than a lot of video game music but i dont really remember anything spectacular about it
the graphics are just okay but xenogears is old and it is an rpg
all in all i didnt mind them
they werent good or bad enough to ever pay attention to
the xenogears jewel case claims that there are  minutes of anime cut scenes
there are about  seconds through most of the game and  minutes at the end
although anime cut scenes fail to thrill me in nearly every situationnow on to the story
the plot line of xenogears is potentially excellent involving a nice mix of commentary on religion and ethics and it was gratifying to have a change from hero goes on a quest saves the day repeat
however the story was flawed
it was difficult to comprehend and almost ruined if not by its complexity then by its poor translation
the words the people say dont make any sense especially towards the end
in addition most of the philosophicalreligionsciencewhatever stuff turns out to be sort of pointless in a sort of lets have a cross somewhere and maybe something about the purpose of life or something sort of way
it is also full of the classic cut scenes that wont make sense until  hours later or ever
they add some ambiance but several of them never do come back up again
there were issues that left me scratching my head that were never resolved
the ending itself was difficult and awesome
it is worth it at least as worth it as any  hour games ending will ever beall in all xenogears is probably one of the best playstation rpgs out there
it might be somewhat overwhelming to younger players or those new to the rpg genre although it was only the third nongenesis rpg i ever beat and i was  at the time
xenogears is a classic that should be played by every rpg fan
i highly recommend itone of the best games of its time
i recently started playing this game and now its hard to stopstory gripping story especially for ff and gundam fans
dont expect to sleep for a few days thinkin bout the storyrating out of   gameplay is it not nifty
best battle system in any games ive played besides baldurs gate
control is very easy to do
easy navigation especially with jumping and camerarating anime prepare to laugh for weeks when you see how many minutes of quotstunning hand drawn animeacute
but its still coolrating graphics heres where it got a  note i capitalized the words of its time at the top
pretty bad graphics while on the map and in battles without gearsrating overall great game if you dont mind graphics muchrating there are games that we play once and never touch again
these games fade into history with little thought or attention
then there are games like xenogears which fall into another category classics
a type of game that people will still be playing for years to come
legions of fans exist for games like xenogears that keep interest alive and well in internet forums and chat rooms and even amazon review pages
so after  years i decided to revisit xenogears the classic ps rpgthe most striking thing about xenogears is how well the game has withstood the test of time
for being over  years old the graphics are still competent and actually quite good
the cg sequences show squaresofts flair for jawdropping sequences
a chill ran up my spine reading the introduction to the game i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end
truly epic words that mark the beginning of an epic game
the game itself is a composite of sprite based characters and polygon based backgrounds
everything is colorful and well rendered considering the age of the source material
the biggest feat in my opinion is that the environments are completely d you can freely rotate the camera for a better perspective
contrast that with final fantasy titles that features mainly static environments and camerasthe storyline is as complex and mature as square games get
youll start with the main chracter fei wong who lives in a small village and remembers nothing of his past short of small flashbacks
what unfolds is a world changing storyline thats a cross between a brave new world and the christian bible
a game like xenogears makes you wonder whether what you know as fact is really just that
i dont want to spoil anything by going too much deeper so ill stop there but anyone interested in a deep story will absolutely love xenogearsgameplay is centered around traditional japanese rpg turnbased mechanics
though your characters control more like a fighting game than a rpg
characters can execute combos that require inputs of button presses
the combos are initially hidden and the more you fight the more combos you can unlock for each character
magic is of course present in the game and the various characters have their own specialty whether attack magic or healing
by far one of the coolest features is the extensive use of gears in the game
gears are in essence giant walking mechs a la mechwarrior
gears are combat multipliers that make absolutely devastating attacks
throughout the game characters will use gears at an increasing rate and the gears play a central role in the titlethe in game musical score is in my opinion one of the best of any squaresoft game including the heralded final fantasy series
the musical tracks can at times be haunting when a particularly poignant scene is taking place or riveting when in the midst of combatso why then only stars for xenogears
well there are a few problems with the game
first xenogears features various platforming sections throughout the game
none of these sections control very well and can be frustrating when repeated missing jumps and having to trudge your way back only to miss the jump again  all while constantly battling off enemies
second xenogears is a disc game though the entire contents of the nd disc feel rushed
its almost like squaresoft rushed the development process along of xenogears halfway through
youll go from playing the game and experiencing the set pieces first hand to reading about battles and story elements via ingame dialogue
its a dramatic turn in the game that isnt wholly welcome
this shift doesnt ruin the game but its disappointing because of what could have been had the game been fully developedas of this writing xenogears has not yet made it to the playstation network store
though hopefully that will change soon so more players can have access to this incredible gamei like this game
why
because i grew up with it so to speak
when ps came out we bought it right away along with this game
the graphics are not very good comapred to other newer games but if you look past it you have yourself a solid game
the variety of rides and places to build theme parks is wide
it is a very fun game that deserves more credit than it gets
it can get old and may not meet all the standards graphic wise but it lets you create
this game with work for any playstation consolesim theme park is a fantsatic game with so many different possibilities
there are four different themes to choose from space zone land of wonders halloween and the lost kingdom where you get to decide what rides you want and you even get to ride on them
as well as choosing what rides you want in your park you also get to choose what shops you want in your park
this is a great game and you will get so much gameplay out of it so its great value for moneythere arent enough games
playstation has much more game than n
also as someone already said cartridges only hold so much like  mb or something like that
cds hold so much more
thats about the only faults i can think of
besides that the graphics are way better than playstation
thats my oponion though
you might think different
the controllers are great
the joy stick works very well
but there is one fault on the controllers
after long time using them the joy stick instead of standing erect just loses its balance and just flops over to one side
thats about it
great system with a good amount of faultsyouve probably heardread from many magazines and reviewers that the nintendo  is comparable to the house of usher fallen
but the truth is that nintendo  has a lot to offer
she doesnt have as many games her cousin the sony playstation but the n can hold her own in the console wars with exlcusive hits like super mario  perfect dark and wave race  to name a few
nintendo s main weakness has been that she uses cartridges instead of cds cartridges are more expensive and would cost billions to hold as much memory as cdsshould you decide to purchase this system if you havent already here is a list of my recommended gamessuper mario perfect darkbanjokazooiebanjotooiemischief makerswave race goemons great adventurediddy kong racingthese are just a few games
experiment a bit and see what suits youi personally do not own a n but i did borrow my friends for a month and a half during his summer vacation and it was fine
i myself prefer a gamecube but this would end up being my second choice
the controllers are okay
the cartridge makes for no load times but are expensive
overall a  star systemthe n is a nice gaming platform and has alot of cool features
nice graphics decent games and a user friendly interface
the one reason i would buy this console personaly is because of tony hawks proskater
this game uses all of ns graphics and the ease of use goes beond simplicety
i am going to get a n over a playstation because it just looks allot prettier and because of tony hawks proskater
hehehethe n has been on the market for five years
it is still a pretty good console but mostly for younger kids
there is no other  bit systym out there but the n will soon be outdated by the gamecube
however the n still has games with beutifull graphicspros capabiliti of great graphics  players  great games like perfect dark and goldeneye cons soon to be outdated small game library compared to playstation games cost more because of there cartridge formatthe n closest competetor is the sony playstation though the playstation is  bits because it uses cds the sound is better and you can see real people in most of the game intros
the reason why i think the n is  better is because it has some of the best games ever made super smash bros and goldeneye are a fewthe n can also use the expansion pack wich enhances games so you get more levels and better graphics like with zelda majoras mask and perfect darkone complaint most older kids have is that most games are too childish  which is true but there are still lots of great games for older kids like goldeneye and perfect darkthe ns game library is alot smaller then the playstations 
i find the n lacks quality sports games on the n the playstation comes out with new ones every yearif you like more sports and you want more mature games get a playstation but the nis uneaqualled with the quality of its gamesthis system is one of the best systems on the market
i would give it four out of five stars in the graphics department a five in its games and a five and an honorable mention for the controller the controller is the best on the market and the games are some of the best
the only trouble is it is difficult to buy games anymore but this still is greatof all the demos on my old now wellworn underground disc shipped along with my original psx back around  i liked this one the best
sure the first levels pretty ugly but the explosions and action are greati managed to find a copy of the game roughly a year ago and i feel that it was well worth it  and that the long wait didnt really hurt the game too much
apocalypse sports some impressive visuals with great but short fmv sequences and even working video screens within levels similar to those in aliens vs predator  always amazing on the ol grey boxone quibble is with the apocalyptic united states deal the rather unbelievable enemies and the many lines bruce willis yells at an invisible partner  the game was originally a bit bigger in scope and had willis as your partner rather than as the player character  but i only found this as a reason to pay closer attention to the proceedings since the development history of a game always fascinates memoving on the games other sin are the jumping segments
some are fine but others are terrible  and youre saddled with one of the worst early in the game where you need to dodge falling rocks while moving along platforms in a cave
the first time i played through that it mustve taken me at least half an hour to get through it
today i managed it after losing somewhere around five lives but the game over wasnt welcomestick with it though and youll be rewarded with some cool fights and levels my favorite so far is the cityi dont disagree with the other reviewers about the graphics and sound although once again the first level looks pretty terrible by todays standards i think it gets a bit better later on but this is forgivable
bruce himself looks awesome and moves well especially with the analog sticks if you have analog joysticks on your controller theyre a must  especially for aiming shots when sniping enemies with the submachine gun type weaponhe sounds good too with a small but awesome variety of snappy quotes
sure some are rips but they get the job done and i often still find myself chuckling about them
ive always been confused by the quote in the gamespot review above perhaps the reviewer was guilty of the classic error of turning the machine on once to get an impression
sounds may echo depending on your location get into an open area like the city and youll notice that the sound effects including the voice are very clear
the only voice clips i dont really care for are the police clips in said city level  the humors a bit meanspirited but unimaginative theyve been tweaked to sound very oddbasically they suck
but hey the rest of the sound effects are good and poes soundtracks definitely add to the game as wellagain the game controls beautifully if you have dual analog sticks
i played the game for roughly an hour using the dpad and face buttons and really wish i hadnt but when i switched to the sticks it felt great
its a bit hard to aim precisely with it which will be a problem mainly when sniping so youll need to wave your firing point around a bit
that said the game works perfectly when it drops you into the middle of close quarters battle and at times i cant help but feel that this simple pure gameplay is among the most enjoyable on the playstationthis game is really fun some people think this game is easyif you think this game is easy you should go to the option menu and switch it to hardthis game has a lot of actions from the begaining to the end you have to face enemys that have all kinds of abilites like some are fast some have more powerful wepons some are hard to killone of the best part about this game is that you can use the right analog stick that makes the game ten times more fun if you dont have a analog controller you might want to rent this game before buying it because it gets pretty tough to controlanother thing is that you get infinite ammo for your machine gun so you dont have to worry about running out of weponesthis game is like a d version of contraone of the most note able problems of the game is that the talk gets a little boring its great that they put bruce willis voice in this game but it would have been better if they but a little bit more words into the game and occasionally you will find that there is to much jumping in this game and some of the spots look the same but except for those problems this game is must have for action adventure fanthis game was a blast from the past and was definitely a fun game
it similar to twisted metal and even though it doesnt surpase of of the twisted metal games its funthis game is probably the best cararenafighting game next to destruction derby  this game is amazing but since the graphics are ish it is to me hard to see whats going on at times but for a  game this game should be an auto buy for someone who can find itevere since i heard cc was going to be released i couldt wait to buy and play with it
but once i got my hands on it i immediately noticed some weak areas
being a close combat series hard core fan i had already bought  all the previous three titles and found some plus and minuses especially  if compared with quotthe russian frontquot cc
minuses units your  battle groups have fixed types of units meaning you cannot adjust your  forces from defence to offence posture those shermans seem to be useless  in defence against german armor
in the end it gets very boring to play in  the same map with the same units over and over again
in cc every battle  is different since you can adjust your forces each time
the detail  offered in cc is also more specific going down to the single soldier  level
this used to be useful both during battles and during the plannig  phase where you coluld notice that a particular soldier or unit had been  with you for even a few years
in the end i found a tendency not to use the  older units because i feared they colud get killed
battles strategic  overview means you will be playing over some maps over and over again  having to go thru a complete cycle before you can move your forces again
ai the ai is much more stupid than in cc
i played the first time on the  german side and won every single battle
it does not like to move very  much even if winning
pluses graphics better and more ralistic
air  amp arty support you now can call in support during the game
it gives  some more flexibility but not enough to have a real impact on the game
strategic level you now have a strategic level where you can move your  battle groups around befor playing single battles
this feature adds depth  to the game but sometimes prevents flexible movement
one unit per square  is too few and makes transiting battle groups thru controlled maps  impossible
you first have to move out any unit that is controlling the  area reconquer it with the new unit and then you can move to the offence
a pain if you are in the rear areas a nightmare if you are moving on the  front lines
this feature looks like something out of an amiga  strategy  game
my suggestion if you are a cc series fan buy it since it gives  you a completely new battlefield to play on
if you never played a cc  series game before buy cc a much better game overallbattle of the bulge is a realmtime strategy simulator set in the historical setting of the second world war
you can choose to play as either the americans or szie germanz the latter seems to be the most fun
the game sets itself apart from other alternatives in the genre such as starcraft and command amp conquer by focusing on realism
in battle of the bulge you order troops around and not single individuals as is the case in real war and your units wont necessarily do everything you tell them to if their morale falls too low they might for instance decide that its a better idea to retreat and find cover if they suddenly find themselves under heavy enemy fire
and its no good sending infantry troops up against a heavy armoured tank division
the best strategy to deploy seems to be using your infantry units to spot the enemy since they have a better visual range than your armoured vehicles and then keep the tanks close by for protectionthe graphics of the game are good enough explosions and smoke grenades look especially nice
but it can quite often become a painstaking job spotting yours and the enemys units on the map and your units dont always fire at will
the sound mixing is good
whenever you finish off an american tank youll hear a satisfied german declare that the enemy is neutralized and the americans will be shouting bailing out
much fun
but if youre fresh to the series like i was you should be prepared spending a few hours getting used to the gameplay
so if youre after quick action this game might not be the pick for you
but if youre into strategy games with historical and realistic elements then this game should be just right for youi own the entire close combat series
my favorite is still cc but the battle of the bulge is definitely a close secondfirst what i likethe use of multiple battlegroups as in cc has been returned
the addition of artillery and airstrikes is cool and does not disrupt game play
the ability to move battle groups on an overall map makes the game more interesting
the sounds are spectacular and there are lots of cool videos
infantry units arent useless as they were in ccnow whats wrong with the gamethe germans are too easy to play with american campaign is difficult but excitingthe game has a severe bug that doesnt allow you to finish the grand campaign
the short of it is that once a map takes too much battle damage or has too many wrecks on it the entire campaign crashes
this can be fixed with a patch however the patch doesnt work with all systems
the patch also fixes some other problems if you can use it
includingadding tigers into the game which were used extensively in the real battle of the bulge improving tank ai which frankly was quite terrible at times and other smaller detailsthe close combat series is a very effective tactical battlefield game
you command units to achieve your objectives
i could not get enough of the bridge too far game and still occassionally fire it up after three  years of playing
needless to say i was thrilled to hear about cc
as  prior reviewers noted it is not up to par with cc but i still found it  challenging and fun
i am sorry ms rights to the game to ssi
while ssi  has a good pedigree for creating wargames this time they seemed to spend  as little as possible on the game
the box was cool but the instruction  book was poorly done and more reminiscent of cheap instructions from the  far east
i dont think they were too careful with the ai programming as  well
despite these concerns i really enjoy playing the game and it still  is head and shoulders better than most games out there todayreally fun but kinda old
plus starcraft is way betterthis is a really fun game
it is not half as fun as its predecesor starcraft
i thought the campaigns were a little too easy and that the whole game was a piece of cake
this is one of the better games ive played so i gave it  starslet me start out by saying this really is a good game but it does suffer from some problemsfirst off it runs terribly in directd unless you download the patch problem solved
dont think you can get away with this either
i have a piii with mb ram and a mb geforce cardthe ai is pretty terrible
sometimes it does what it really should do and alot of times it doesnt
sometimes a group of enemies will hear me and storm the room other times an enemy will run around in a circle  feet in front of me allowing me to cap him to death
you can pick up dead bodies to hide them but most of the time the enemies just walk by their dead buddies and just assume he is taking a nap with a gaping head woundanother problem would be crashes
my first day playing i locked up  times had to ctrlaltdel to get out
and also had  fatal errorssave games take up anywhere from mb to  and possibly even moreload times between areas is pretty bad especially considering i have a decently powerful system
i couldnt imagine the length on anything lessall that aside i really do enjoy the gamegreat story pretty good graphics and great sound effects
but i think system shock  is a much better game by far if you havent played that yet i would suggest trying that firsti have had more fun playing this game than any other since the quake seriesyou play jc denton a nano technology augmented government agent in a not too distant futurethe game can be played in three different character quotmodesquot making it possible to play it three times with  different endingsyou can play as a quothackerquot a quotstealthquot player or a combat quotsoldierquot or a blend of allit all depends on the augmentations you choose as you play along
be sure your computer meets the system requirementsbecause the graphics are awesome and the sound is excellent especially if you have a soundblaster live cardi own over  pc games and this ones right up there at the topits a keeperi feel bad not giving this game five stars its certainly one of the best ive seen in a long time and i cant believe i havent heard more buzz about it
i bought the game based on the other reviews here and i have to  say theyre right on targetdeus ex really delivers serious gaming fun
its like a game with an xfilesesque plot without the aliens rogue  spear gaming strategic fps and soldier of fortuneactionoriented fps
it really delivers and gives the player the opportunity to take a  ballsout guns blazing approach or a more stealthy sneaky method to get  what you need done either way you get just as much skill points so  youre not penalized for not getting a maximum body countthe graphics  are great
nothing particularly revolutionary as with vampire but  definitely nothing to complain about
generally very smooth with lots of  detail nice lighting good atmosphere you really dont see this on a lot  of the screenshots
the plasma gun really has a nice effect as do the  grenades but when things blow up like crates its just a bunch of  polygons yawn
i guess we cant expect all games to have the detail and  gore of soldier of fortunethere are a few holes in the plot such as  its feasibility but with a little willful suspension of disbelief its  rather engrossing
ive had more than my fair share of hour playing  sessions with this puppy
travelling from new york to hong kong to nevada  youll see plenty of places and meet enough interesting characters to keep  you going
i dont know if different responses to conversations give you  significant variances in the plot but its interesting all the  sameespecially the different ways you can solve your missionsive  become very picky in terms of the games i buy i dont have a lot of time  to play them and i dont have a lot of money to spend on them so theyve  got to be good
this is one of those games i am delighted to have bought  and certainly recommend to othersthe only reason this didnt get  five stars is because of the unplausible premise in the plot and the lack  of anything really groundbreaking in the realm of gaming though ill  admit this is one of the best games ive ever seen at really having the  feel of an authentic rpgi am a big fan of fps first person shooters and when i read about this game i thought back to half life could this be another step up for this genre
after i played it i answered that question with two words oh yeah
this game is the best action game there is and its large enough and challenging enough to keep you going for a while
i was playing this game for quite some time a month and a half to be exact before i got all the alternate routes figured out
it wouldve been shorter if work didnt intercede with my gaming time but i have to pay for my bills somehow right
the story involves two brothers one being the veteran and the other being the rookie take a guess on which youll be playing
anyway you start off the game by wiping out the terroists that have taken the statue of libery
now heres where this game sets it apart from most shooters
there are multiple ways to complete an objective either you can go in and kill everyone in the area or you can sneak by them and knock them out
i usually choose the second approach since its more of a challenge that way rather than just start blowing things up which gets old real fast
once you complete your objectives you get a set number of experiance points which you can give to certain abilities such as sniping my favorite or other attributes like hacking or electronic bypassing
this gives the game maximum replayablity with all the choices you can make in the game if you foul up a mission you continue on you just change the attitudes of some characters you meet later
the only problem i have with this game is it has a slow start but once you get past the first couple of misions its a breeze the rest of the way with a great story that twists and turns with every step you take its great gaming defintly a must have for any hardcore gamerpokemon stadium for the nintendo  is a surprisingly good adaptation to the evergrowing pokemon family
the graphics are good and avoid being constantly the same through brilliant camera angles
the game is easy to just pick up and play the controls are very simple
even a nonfan like myself can play well without any pokemon experience
sadly there are no fourway battles but multiplayer still rocks
you cant use the game with gold silver or yellow and i can understand why that would be annoying
stadium  will be out soon though and if its anything like the original there could be another hit on the horizoni like pokemon and this was a fun way to show it
fighting is cool and the different pokemon is cool too
gets tedious at times but still fun if you like pokemonmy  year old lves this game
it is a nice diversion and keeps him entertainedthis game is a musthave for any pokemon fans out there
it allows two players to pit their favorite pokemon against each other and duke it out until only one winner is left in the ring pokemon dont die when they  lose they just faint
you can also download your existing pokemon champs  from your gameboy into the nintendo so you can use them to fight the  computer generated monstersmy kids like this game a lot
it has good  battles all of the pokemon to chose from to battle with
it has other  smaller games included which kids can play if they get bored with stadium
it can be played by one player against the computer or two against each  other
my only quibble is that the action seems a little slow sometimes  there is a commentator who they would do well to leave out in the next  versionbut the bottom line is especially for pokemon fans this is a  game that will give many hours of satisfying playill admit im not the biggest fan of pokemon
i have a friends game boys blue version that he didnt want anymore and thats about it
this game really isnt worth getting if you dont have a game boy pak but it does come with the transfer pak which is nice
anyway down to the specificsgraphics these are some of the better graphics on the n
watch as an electrode busts out a thunder or as golduck uses surf all on a big screen
play control its just as easy as the game boy games and control is really not used in much of it
the menus are easy to navigate and the minigames dont take much effort to play
game design this is basically just the battling feature of the game boy games
there are also minigames if youre tired of fighting
an interesting note is that you can store your game boy pokemon on the n start a new game on the game boy and then transfer back your traded pokemon
satisfaction at the prices its going for now its worth it even when i got it for  it was worth itespecially because of the transfer pak
sound the sound effects and music are appropriate but the announcer gets old really fast
overall its worth a rent and if youre a pokefan youll want this in your collection but otherwisepokemon stadium is a great game that allows trainers to battle with the pokemon that they spent sooo much time training on their gameboy pokemon red blue  yellow games
note you cannot use pokemon from the gold silver crystal ruby and sappire games not to mention frlg versions of the game
i used to love playing this game back in  but during the time that i used to play this game i started to realize strange coincidences that always seemed to work in the enemys favor
for some strange reason moves with low accuracy such as fissure that also terminates one pokemon in a single hit
would strike my pokemon way to often
just to clarify this is how it works fissure only has a  chance of hitting an opponent yet it seemed to strike my pokemon every time without fail
i have been know to refer to these coincidences as cheatdetectors because they only seem to happen if you are literally dominating your opponent
fissure is only an example these cheatdetectors can pop up at any time and effect any attack you may find your attacks continueously missing you opponents pokemon for no appearent reason
these cheatdetectors also exist in pokemon stadium  but i am not sure if they exist in pokemon colosseum for the gamecube but ill bet that they are
this is not so much of a setback as it is an annoyance cheatdetectors dont make the game impossible to win but they do get in the way of winning as well as annoy you to no end
pokemon stadium  pokemon stadium  are worth the money and are entertaining to play
i recommend buying them but be ready for lots of strange coincidences that effect overall game playnote if you want to use your game boy trained pokemon from red blue or yellow version in pokemon stadium you will also need to buy a n transfer pakwritten byshadowmage the game maniacthis is another good ff game but it didnt appeal to me as much as ff did
the game has excellent graphics and movies and support for all video cards but i liked the gameplay in ff better
what i got most hooked on in the game was the minicard game
its very fun and you can get items for obtaining certain cardslike in ff ff has an excellent storyline in which squaresoft does best anyways
the junction battle system didnt appeal to me as much though
there are guardian forces you must collect in the game and you must junction to one to get even the most basic commands
furthermore you must find rare items and magazines to get upgrades on your weaponsit is also the wierdest ff game ive played
usually in rpgs you get a whole bunch of experience for defeating a boss
in this game you get no exp for bosses or certain enemies
also money is salary based in this game
you wont get a single penny from the wandering monstersall in all another smash hit ff rpgoh no more materia to power your weapon and magic ok replace by some powers you have to find and win ok new challengeyes no more saucage charcters human finally
if only final fantasy  could have human type character instead of those funny d balloon looks well then ff would have kicked  of fffolks did you know that ff has one the most amazing ending it is in the top  of the best ending game of all timeif you havent played the game get it ride the chocobos use alexander materia oh oh and use the so powerfull bahamut zero and omega materia ouch i killed sephiroth like that oghostrider the spirit of vengeancei have just one thing to say
the demo is no indicator of the finished product
it ran fine on my system so i figured that the finished game would as well
this is not the case
i counted down the days until this  game was released only to find out that my  mb d accelerator was  quotinadequatequot to run ff
what the hell is this
if the demo is a  small part of the whole game wouldnt it have the same hardware  requirements
as it is i cant risk buying this game
i definitely will  buy itwhen i get a new system because it is a great game
anyone who  has info on the hardware really needed to run this game please send it my  wayfinal fantasy viii defintely has the look and feel of a true final fantasy title
the game plays well and tells a great story
it is worth the purchase for the pc version even though the graphics were not upgraded from the playstation version
i was personally happy when the game came to pc  i dont buy game consoles anymoreff is not the best final fantasy title out there
in my opinion ff is the best with ff and ff  and  in the us respectively tying each other for second
then ff not released in the us then good ol ff
thats my list and im stickin to it
i am going to assume that you are reading this review as an avid rpg gamer or a diehard final fantasy fan
with that assumption i will leave out all the great details of the game since as i said before ff is a true final fantasy title
therefore you know it rocks
but id like to focus on the drawbacks if i may be so bold and explain why it ranks below the super nintendo versions and its pc predecessor
all in my humble opinion of coursefirst the magic system for ff is the greatest drawback in my opinion
it removed the idea of magic points mp
in the old titles if you had  mp and you used a cure  spell it would decrement to 
youd have to replenish eventually or simply run out
in ff however the magic you use depends on two factors  you have to draw the spell out of enemies the amount you draw determines how many times you can use the spell and  the strength of the magic you use is determined by the amount you drew up to  effectivenesscapacityif that all sounds confusing to you it is
it still doesnt make any sense to me and i think it almost killed a great game
but squaresoft is reknowned for altering each release with something totally different
too bad the magic system in ff was such a flopsecond the funnest part of the other titles i thought was the coordination of items like weapons and relics to progressing skills
which ff nailed perfectly
ff only allows a milder version of this coordination
character development isnt such a focus in ff i thinklastly to be quite honest the most fun part about the entire game of ff for me was the card playing  not the actual game itself or the storyline
in fact exploring the ff was actually dull for me
i was surprised to learn this too
but when i found places to play that wonderful little numbered card game i found myself spending hours doing just that
i was hoping squaresoft offered a side version of the card game that i could trade ff in forthe card game for ff was supposed to be like the chocobo development offered in ff
however like i said the card game turned out to be the best part of ffto give some slight pros i would say that the creatures with which you do battle were rendered quite nicely in ff
i also appreciate a lot of the bosses especially the twins
the graphics are also good enough for the rpg genre  i dont complain about that stuff when playing rpgsto close if you never bought ff and stuck with only ff and your nintendo titles youd be alright in my opinion
but if you want it all ff is not a total wastei loved ff and got really involved in the characters and plot
the magic was superb
i had great anticipation for ff
the characters ar not as loveable and the story up until the point i stopped playing it was good but  not as good as ff
the story is too linear and the summons take too long
you may spend  minues fighting and  of that is watching summons
the  interface is also very snesy
the best part of this game for me was the cut  scenes as these are the best ever on the pc
i spent a good deal of time  pkaying this game and was not rewarded enough
i cant help but think this  game is over rated
its good but its not that good
long live cloudmario party is and still is in my opinion one of the best games on the nintendo  its fun fast exciting and it has good music
this may seem trivial but it will become quite important
when i learned about mario party  i was obviously excited
the minigames all seemed cool and the new board games seem funwell january comes and i get it on the first day
overall this game is very good
the concept hasnt changed from the first one  months earlier
whoever has played either mario party or mario party  should know this already whoever hasnt ill explain itthe mario party series is basically an electronic board game
first you break open a box mario style to determine turn order
this game is separated into   or  turns
each turn is made up of when one person quotrolls the dicequot by breaking open a box
a number appears and the person goes that many spaces
you can land on many spaces
a blue space gives you  coins  in last  turns and a red space takes away  coins  in last  turns
you can also land on a bowser space where bowser comes and causes havoc a chance game or a question mark space where a specific even occurs depending on which board youre playing on
after all  players go a minigames starts
it can be either  players  vs  or  vs the boards in mario party  is actually quite fun and most minigames are nice
some like torpedo targets honeycomb havoc skateboard scamper abandon ship a day at the races and the duel games are annoyingthen why  stars
many reasons
the minigame coaster is frustratingly frustrating on the hard setting
it took me hours to pass it
and the music
oh the music
the music as i said is one of the best parts in mario party
the music in mario party  is different and not for the better
some of the tempos gets on my nerves and its just well not mariobut overall this is a good gamesometimes in the video game industry a sequel can often be a difficult thing to duplicate the success of from the previous edition
in the case of nintendo  theyve had very few real sequel success stories with their video games
in the case of mario party theyve made a couple of very decent sequels to the popular game itself
two of them made it to the nintendo  the other is on the gamecubemario party  came out less than a year after the smash hit the nintendo  game screens
the game picks off a little bit from the previous version with the same six characters to choose from but the games are a bit different than before
most of the games are absolutely new to the system including cake factory look away and roll call
there are also another few twists that are here that werent in the previous game
one of those twists is that there is item games to collect items like boo bell to call boo the ghost to collect coins or stars from opponents and the dueling glove
this item you use you can challenge one opponent to a duel where you bet your coins for a win
there are six in general depending on the course your on
although the games on mario party  are a little bit harder to control  it takes a little more time to get used to especially in some games where the controls are extremely sensitive
nevertheless it is just as challengingalthough many places stopped carrying nintendo  games it is a little bit harder to get games like these
you either are lucky and you find them newly conditioned or used or you go on a wild goose chase to get a certain kind of game you like
in this case if youre a fan of the previous mario party for nintendo  i suggest you give this one a roll of the dice toothis game is really fun i think it is the best out of the whole series
this game is better when you have people to play with you
its also good when you play alone but you dont get that same vibe that you would get when you actually have a challenge on your handsi guess hudson soft realized how bad mario party  was so they actually made mario party  a good game
the minigames are better and even though there are a few bugs in the minigamesshy guy says
i liked all the minigames execpt for the windup shy guy one it was impossible
but the rest of the game was decentthis game is a good party game but take at least an hour to play
you play a board game in which is crammed about  quotminigamesquot
most of these are simple like pressing a and b at the same time to wind a mechasomethingorother and tilting the control stick just enough so that your car doesnt spin out
the goal is to get the most stars
unlike its prequel there are no more games with spinning the control stick
this game is competitive but requires too much time
after playing enough games youll unlock a oneplayer mode
hard mode is too frustrating especially on one level i cant beat but normal mode is a good challenge
i recommend this game for people who enjoy competition or playing with friendsit provided me with many hours of entertainment
the deck types are very limited as this only goes up to fossil and there are no sequels so i felt empty after this was finishedyou can tell its not new you have to carefully fight with it to get it work with some controllers
which is okay as long as i dont have to constantly keep connecting and disconnecting like im using nes stuff
with my main controller that only i have owned and taken care off it works like a charm if it has been sitting for some time then i will need play with it a littlethe graphics are pisspoor but the game play and music rarely get betterbulbasaur is better than any other starter ever and always will be
charmander was cute but not as cool
and squirtle as adorable as he was was way too slowthe madness never stopped in my house once me and my bro  and  now got these into our grubby paws
we did next to no trading but tons of gaming pokemon that are in this title arebulbasaur meowth persian starmie dragonair koffing weezing ekans arbok seel dewgong zapdos geodude graveler golem vulpix vileplume articuno electabuzz ponyta gloom tangela lickitung mewtwo chansey taurus jynx oddish golbat horsea dragonite diglett and magmarits only better because pikachu follows you everywhere has a feelings meter and can surf if you know how to access it
also an extra point because team rocket unsuccessfully crashes your party
priceless really
and just like the anime
game play  asound  boriginality  d bit off of blue and reds style like woah
the only thing remotely original was the fact that your yellow adorable pikachu followed you and he surfedand remember the  starters from bluered bulba charm and squirt
if you play your cards right you can have them all helping create a wonderous team to be reckoned with
also team rocket tried and failed each time to ambush your journey throughout kanto
ltxdstory ctrading  afun  areplay  aoverall  b starsits similar to crystal emerald and platinum
theyre all sister games
theyre extensions of the other two in their generation the same game with stuff addedhowever this is still a great game
you start with a pikachu and you cannot evolve it
however you can obtain the other three starters
your rival green owns a eeevethis game is based off the anime
however your character red is not ashsatoshi and your rival blue green in japan and na games after the second generation is not gary
still expect many similar things such as nurse joysi am old school when it comes to pokemon and this is one of the best of the original three games
the controls and goal are the same as in red and blue with a few new features such as pikachu following you and being able to check its mood and the introduction of team rockets jesse and jamesabout a year ago i too was drawn into the pokemon fad
i played pokemon red a little bit when one of my friends came over
i enjoyed it but it seemed a bit complicated
i finally got version yellow
the hardest part of the game is at the beginning
but i wont tell you why ltevil laugh  
anyways once you get past that part the rest is of average difficulty for a game
graphics are par for the gbc and the battle scenes are cool
sound is great and the amount of different sounds puts me in awe
now that im over the pokemon craze i see that it is not quite a fivestar game but still worth four starsthis game is just like pokemon red and blue except that you wont be able to capture meowth koffing or even ekans
the good part about it is that you will find stronger pokemon that you cant in red or blue
sometimes you can sometimes you cant
thats what life is all about
here are the pros and cons for this gamepros    improved graphics
  no more errors or glitches
you can get bulbasaur charmander and squirtle
more events are available
you can find pokemon with higher attributescons    training pikachu is annoying
you have to keep pikachu in your party at all times
boss battling is much harder than beforeremember  if you want to avoid this garbage dont buy it
otherwise its still a blast to playit is not easy to train pikachu in the frist place
if you are reading this revie dont get red or blue version if you have this game
i thought that they would be different but i got blue and it was the exat same thing
on blue the boy was named shawn
shawn if your reading this thank youi would have made it one star exept for one thing you can get bulbusaurcharmander and squirtle
the worst thing
you cant get a good start
i mean for example you have to beat brock with pikachu
and it would take forever to train the pokemon in the grass
so i am warning you do not get this game
get gold version much betterpokemon yellow is an upgraded version of pokemon red and blue and its really good being a pokemon game
unfortunately it is somewhat underappreciated like most game boy color games
and the graphics are somewhat crude but it doesnt detract from the game at allin this game you automatically start out with pikachu instead of choosing between bulbasaur charmander and squirtle and your rival gets eevee
the game plays out exactly like red and blue except for a few things such as jessie and james showing up a few times
unfortunately they only show up a limited number of times which is a bit of a letdown if you ask me
and the pokemon have been redesigned to look more like they do on the tv showhere are the pros and cons of this gameprospikachu says its name instead of making a sneezing noise
i really liked this even though the voice clips arent of particularly good quality
some find this annoying but i dont
also pikachu follows you around instead of staying in its pokeball and you can see what kind of mood its in if you turn around to face it and press aas you get to know pikachu it will get to like you more and more
ive been playing my current game for an estimated three or four years now and pikachu now has little hearts flying around his head
however it gets ticked off with you if you put it in the pc or let it faintyou can get bulbasaur charmander and squirtleat different points in the gametheres a minigame in this game called pikachus beach
if you have a pikachu that knows surf you can play it
unfortunately you can only teach pikachu surf through a complicated method involving pokemon stadium and the transfer pak
or if you prefer you can use a cheating device
i do not recommend the latter however because cheating devices can mess up things on your game
consyou cant play as a girlits really hard defeating brock the first gym leader because pikachu has a glaring weakness against rock and groundtype pokemonthis is just a personal thing but i really dont like the plot involving lavender tower having to go and calm the ghost of a dead marowak
of course no pokemon actually die in the game if defeated in battle they just faint but this part of the game is still rather unsettling
it also might bother some younger or more sensitive playersthe item pack is really hard to navigate through its hard to find things in there
fortunately this is improved in goldsilvercrystalsome parts of the game are really ridiculously hardbut really that holds true for almost all video gamesyou cant battle trainers over again except for the elite four so it becomes hard to level up your pokemon after awhile
and after you capture mewtwo there really isnt very much more to do in the game except try to get all  pokemon
fortunately all of this is improved in pokemon goldsilvercrystalin conclusion pokemon yellow is awfully good even if its out of print like so many other game boy color games that shouldnt be
but if youd prefer better graphics then id recommend pokemon crystalas has been done in other pokemon versions goldsilver then crystal yellow tops off the two other gameboy versions nicely redblue
in addition to having pikachu as your constant companion the additional changes though subtle will have you taking up the quest yet again to catch em allalthough the graphics outside of battle are lackluster inside a battle between two pokemon show off the graphical enhancements nicely
pikachus mood meter will have you attempting to please the little guy so you can obtain the best results in certain areassince this follows the tv show early in its career fans of that show might enjoy this version more than the average pokemaniac
a slight improvement over the original two any pokemon fan would be welcome to add this to their collectionprospikachus here and he wont stay in his ballslight graphics improvement during battlesit follows the tv show closer than the original two gamesconssame old same old pokemon game
only slight differencesgraphics are subpar when travelling the world of pokemonoverallthis game rates high with me personally since i am a fan of pikachu and pokemon in general
this game is great for the pokemon collector to obtain and add to his or her library
not to be missed especially at these prices
warning though you might not be able to obtain a complete copy of this game anymore without shelling out some serious bucksone of the things i like most about this game is that you dont have to spend hours looking for keys or more hours trying to solf stupid puzzlesyou pop the game in your dreamcast and the action is immediatethe game is just what it looks like you walk around shooting and beating up zombies and huge awesome looking bosses in streets sewers on top of trains and other really cool environmentsalso this game is just so fun to play with a friendalso there are mini games for your vmu to download and several different modes of playas you beat the game you unlock more secretsall in all splattering zombies has never been so funim not a big fan of zombie games in general but being a fan of segas dynamite deka series i decided to give zombie revenge a try
despite the dated graphics and a few flaws with the gameplay i had a lot of funzombie revenge is a spinoff from the house of the dead series except that the gameplay takes place in rd person rather than st and you can implement handtohand combat with the zombies rather than only shooting them
youve got three protagonists to choose from linda who has the highest rate of gunfire but less powerful handtohand rikiya the strongest handtohand but slow shooter and stick balanced
there are gun powerups and other items such as pipes and axes you can pick up along the way
rikiya has a cool finishing move where he slices the zombies in halfyou battle through various stages such as back allies the sewers a chemical plant a train and even the classic first level from house of the dead
the enemies are pretty varied
they look almost the same from house of the dead and then theres some interesting mutated zombies as bosses and midlevel bosses
there are specific strategies for each one to defeat them with less difficultyand youll definitely need a lot of strategy throughout the game to finish it as its definitely not easy
even with the maximum  credits and easiest setting it took me several tries before i could finish the game
theres lots of secret rooms and hidden health recover items to help along the way if you can find them
after finishing the game you get the option for red blood instead of greenmy complaints are few i dont like the long recovery time when getting hit by enemies its literally  seconds that your character winces and moans before you can move again and sometimes the autoaim doesnt registeri found the control is much better using a saturn controller with adapterdefinitely pick it up on the cheap if youre a fan of the genrei got this game last year but i did not have a dreamcastnow that i finally got one i got to say this game is pretty goodbut it is very hardi can usually beat a game within weeks but this one is differenti got to the last level and got killed  timesi was a little frustrated because all my credits were gone and i could not finishi like the game play and it has pretty good graphics for dci will finish this game sometime when i have the energy to deal with the frustrationi had heard a lot of good things about crazy taxi so when i came across a copy for just a few dollars i figured id buy it
it is a lot of fun
good game play humor and offspring for its soundtrack
theres not a whole lot i can say bad about it
except for one thing and this is a problem everyone has it gets old quick
you can play for an hour or so and then you have to put it away for a few days or a week
it doesnt have much staying power which is what is important with a game
still it is fun and its a good game to play until you get your copy of grand theft autocrazy taxi is pretty great
it features  rather big cities a pretty awesome soundtrack by the offspring and bad religion tight control and pretty good graphics
oh and smashing past everything like a maniac while trying to make it to stops on time feels awesomethe good big levels even though there are only  extremely pickupandplay nice graphics for a  release the product placement is silly to see driving to kfc and levis brings some life to the gamethe bad no multiplayer soundtrack does get a bit grating after hearing it too long has some annoying pop in issues at times especially with destination markers the product placement is a bit excessiveoverall its a rather good game with very little to complain about
as for difficulty its not hard to pick up customers and get them places but it is hard to get a good score which is pretty much the entire point of the game
get in get cash and get out
its crazy taxicrazy taxi is a fun frolick for an afternoon of fun
the graphics are true to the arcade original and the music is good
its great to race around the town without having to worry about actual damage to your car
this is the kind of senseless fun that original video games were created forif you cant resist fastpaced crazy driving games then i definitely recommend that you pick up crazy taxi and save some extra cash on the side too
great controls  huge sanfrancisco type cities with lots of traffic and some fastpaced taxidriving action make this a musthave title for dreamcastthe main point of the game is to zip around in one of four choosable drivers and hisher own taxi and pick up customers
theyll tell you where they want to go and a handy little arrow will point in the direction
the faster you get there the more cash you rake in
this really puts an emphasis on mastering moves like the crazy dash a turbo move and some spin moves that you can learn in the game to improve your times
you can choose arcade mode where the clock is always ticking but time increases as you get more customers or play to a certain time limitbut all this action believe it or not can get old in a couple of weeks
if it werent for the minigames in the game that are so fun and challenging it would probably get old in a couple of days unless you have a friend to challenge on who gets more cash
but still for ten bucks you cant go wrong with picking this up
seize the moment and buy it while you still canthe game is worth picking up as it is cheap
its a lot of fun for you or a group of friends
it only has two cities to explore one more than the arcade game but for the type of game thats enough
the game runs smoothly and is difficult to master but easy to pick up
my only complaint is the sound track
its full of the worst pop punk the year  had to offer
and only a small handful of songs too which leaves you with the same terrible singing and instrumentation that made the s a cultural wasteland playing over and over again
just turn off the music and play your own jams
still i say pick it up
its a dc essentialcrazy taxi is something i wouldve recommended being ported to a portable
maybe it was but thats not why i got it
this was one of the dreamcasts launch titles back when it launched in ol  i would have to say any dreamcast fan should have this in their collection
it represents the time when console games were become identical if not superior to the arcade versionsin the game you pick a taxi driver and zoom from one spot to the next picking up customers and taking them to a location within a time limit
its definitely arcade quality as youll probably only be spending a few minutes before time is up
this is also accompanied by a few select tracks from the offspring band something that was more recognizable back then and probably wont shine as much now
it gets old listening to the same songs so i would recommend to anyone looking to spend a lot of time with this game to pick up the xbox live or psn versions as they probably have options to customize the soundtrack
this version however would be great for someone to play in short bursts which is why it would make a great portable
all in all it makes a great addition to the dreamcast librarysegas famed dreamcast console was definitely known for its wide variety of game styles
d fighters survival horror platformer racer arcade etc
crazy taxi is one of the best under the arcade categoryhowever if you are looking for a game you can play hours on end i wouldnt recommend this one
i got bored of it in around  minutes but rather you are a casual gamer of not this is a nice addition to your dreamcast library as it is one of the classics and if you are very short on time you can mess around inside of the games two welldesigned worldsthis game also has quite a humorous side
hearing the driver and the passenger shouting back and forth betwixt each other while your driving is an experience thats very laughableanother notable side to this game is the music
the songs are great the offspring rarely fails to impress me
however there are only  songs in the game
after playing the game  or  minutes youll have the songs memorized and then the game starts to feel a bit more repetitivei myself think this game is worth buying for  dollars or less
if you cant find it that cheap on dreamcast it was ported to gamecube and ps and later to xbox live arcade  i dont know if psn has it
still keep in mind this game is not worth dishing out the huge dollars for just a little cash for a quick fun ride
just like an arcade gamefun game
i remember when the dream cast first came out and i got this game and had a blast playing it
it was a nice reunion when i had to buy this game again as i lost the original one i had after i lost it
wish it had more tracks other than  the mini games were boringcrazy taxi is a great game with great graphics sound and gameplay
but of course the game has some well alot of flaws
the game was designed from the very popalare aracde game called quotcrazy taxiquotof course  the game does feature this aracade verison along with a new verison for dreamcast
the game clevery mixed in humor a some what different type of gameplay and of course good plain fun
before i go into the basics i must clear up something this is not a racing gameill start with the gameplay
in crazy taxi you must pickup persons and bring them to different areas
like the airport  this is were the fun factor comes in
there is  courses and a mini game area called crazy box
the game also has  different drives each with there own car and strenghts
i must say crazy taxi does hold impressive gameplaynext is the sound and the graphics
the graphics are good they are very smooth clean ect
yes there is a small flaw in the graphics a very unstable framerate
in very dense areas of the game it feels like time stops cause of how slow it gets
the sound is crisp lots of different voice samples
but in the sound comes another flaw its the soundtrack
the soundtrack features offspring and bad reiligon
this wouldnt be a problem if they had a bigger selection theres only like four songs of the game
this is the biggest drawbackoverall the game is worth ten bucks
to be perfectly honest its the perfect game to kick of your shoes and playoff the bat i have to say that crazy taxi is one of the best games on the dreamcast
although the dreamcast team is now making games for other systems they have had a few gems with their own system and this is one of them
if you played this game in the arcade its pretty much the same thing except that now sega has thrown in a new larger city to pick up passengers along with a new crazy box mode which enables you to perfect your crazy taxi moves
this game definitely has more than that of the arcade version and has good control
the only bad thing about this game is that if you were good at the original arcade version this wouldnt be much of a challenge
also there is no two player mode in this game and if there was it probably would have been better
if you play with a friend you can only take turns trying to beat each others scores
also after playing the game for a while you get this repetitive feeling especially with the music and the setup of the city
overall its a great game especially if its the first time you are playing it but it could have been betterthis is probably my favorite dreamcast game out there and everyone should take this one out for a spin
its fun to just pick up and play
i just wish there were more cities to drive in and its too bad that there are so few music tracks
give it a tryi bought this game used in august  now you can buy it new for half the price i paid
figures
oh well
to start the review i must mention that this is not a racing game
its actually a mix between an action game and a driving simulation
but thats what makes the game so fun
thanks to sega you can now take a job you would probably hate and at the same time have the time of your life
the object of the game obviously by the title is to pick up passengers and take them to their destinations on time
sounds easy right
well not exactly
at the same time youve got traffic with cars just waiting to get in your way huge cities that are pretty easy to get lost in assuming that you have the code to turn off the help arrows and a fare clock that keeps ticking away no matter how much you beg it to stop
leave it to sega to take the most aggrivating job in the world and make it seem like paradisegraphically there is a lot to like in this game
the cities are modeled beautifully including pedestrians that jump from in front of your car just at the last second
the game also sports a smooth frame rate of  fps
except in certain parts when a ton of action is on the screen then it drops drastically
but right afterward it shoots back up to full speed
the sound is also topnotch with music by the offspring and bad religion
in my opinion the song all i want by the offspring fits the tone of the game perfectly
the sound effects are cool as well as customers yell at you to pick them up and then complain that youre driving too slow
but sometimes their language gets out of hand
sorta
therefore the game has a teen ratingoverall if youre looking for a game with loads of fastpaced action and excitement and also one that lets you be a realworld cabbie without having to break your bank then you neednt look much further than crazy taxi
its one of the wildest rides youll ever takethis game originally appeared in arcades and it was popular enough for sega to decide to release it on the dreamcast
its a good thing they did as this is a brilliant game
the basic idea is to drive the streets of san fransisco as a taxi driver there are four crazy characters to choose from each with their own car and driving style and earn as much money as possible by picking up customers and performing crazy moves to impress your passengers who will then give you a crazy tip yes the game does tend to overuse the word crazy
the more moves you can pull off in succession combos the bigger the tips you customers will give you
there are two huge areas to drive around in this home version with no limits on where you can go and how you get there
one of the courses is the same as the one featured in the arcade version but there is another course thats exclusive to the dreamcast and it is just as good as the original
the courses are both very varied and interesting and there are always new shortcuts to find and things to discover
for each course there are  options drive for  minutes  minutes  minutes or play by arcade rules where the time limit starts at about a minute and counts down until it runs out but you get time added on for each customer you pick up
in all modes the customers you pick up will have a countdown above their head and you must get them to their required destination before the time runs out or theyll jump out without paying
get them there really quickly and theyll reward you with a hefty time bonus
there are many different characters hanging around the city waiting to be picked up and thankfully you seem to have the monopoly on the taxi business in san fransisco
the main goal is to earn an sclass license by earning over  in the arcade time mode and this is extrememly tough
you can crank the difficulty level up or down by changing all the settings including traffic density initial time limit etc but if like me you consider that cheating youll stick with the regular settings and persevere until you finally get there
if you want to really beat the game you should aim to reach  on the record rankings which means youll have to get about   thats no easy taskthere is another dremacastexclusive mode called the crazy box mode and this is definitely one of the best apsects of the game
basically it consists of  unique minigames with more to unlock
for each section you are given an objective and you must complete it within a given time
each one is hellishly frustrating in a fun way and you will find yourself staying up way too late trying to perfect knocking all  pins down in  seconds in crazy taxi tenpin bowling
completing each one is difficult enough but completing them in a fast enough time to beat all of the preset records will destroy any remains of a personal life you may have
its toughthe game benefits from having licensed real locations such as kentucky fried chicken and the original levis store all with real building styles and logos  it just helps to make it feel realthe graphics are excellent
the designers obviously didnt strive for gritty realism but thats ok the games slightly cartoonish colorful overthetop graphics work very well and give it a refreshing look
i have a major problem with the occasional lapses in framerate and drawin however
every now and then you will be driving along and the game will slow to a near halt and it will stop for a second while the dreamcast wheezes like an asthmatic rhino with a throat infection
and if that wasnt bad enough the background music will skip then the cd has to reset and start the song again from the beginning and during this the drawin has receded to about  feet in front of your taxi so it looks like youre about to drive into an abyss of nothingness
ok so maybe im exxagerating
but it is a problem and theres really no excuse for it
most of the time everything runs fine but maybe once every five or ten minutes the above scenario will happen
if like me you couldnt care less about it then it wont affect the fun of the game but if that sort of thing bothers you then you probably should steer clear pun halfintended of this gamecontrol is excellent the cars all handle very well
i have a madcatz mc racing wheel and i tried it out and although it worked nicely the game is very heavy on the buttonpressing combos and i found it much more practical to use the standard controller
the games physics are generally accurate and collision detection is spoton which is a good thing since you will be involved in a lot of collisionsunfortunately there is no online element of the game nor a multiplayer one
its a shame because a multiplayer option would have been great fun
this is supposedly being rectified in crazy taxi  due for release some time in late  so if you cant stand the thought of singleplayeronly gameplay then you might want to wait for that
the game does give you the option of challenging a friend in a way the menu interface will remember records for up to  players on one dreamcast so you can take it in turns to beat each others records and the game will keep track of who is better
the records section is excellent  you can sort records by name track mode etc
it will even tell you the date you achieved each record and what taxi driver you were using at the time and it can all be saved onto a memory card so you can carry on another timethis probably isnt one for the kiddies what with all the reckless driving and the rude customers who have no problem with telling you if you are a lousy driver
the background music which comes from bands like the offspring and bad religion can quickly get repetitive  i prefer to turn the music off and play my own cds on my stereo
the characters you pick up can also get a little tedious as theyre always repeating themselves
apparently there are a lot of identical twinstripletsquituplets in san fransisco as i often found myself picking up identicallooking people within minutesthere are some very nice touches in the game
traffic is ultrarealistic all the cars buses trucks and trams behave exactly as they would in real life with the exception that they stop at stop signs and red lights and drive courteously
if you cause a massive pileup on the freeway there will still be upturned cars there minutes later when you return with the drivers wondering just what they did to deserve such a  day
the game tells you how to pick up customers by showing a zone around the person in which you must stop then it will display an arrow indicating in which direction the customers destination lies when you are familiar with the courses you have the option of cranking up the realism by turning off zone markings and arrows though this is for pros onlydespite its minor flaws crazy taxi is a fantastic game that is superbly made
i cant wait for the sequel but for now this will keep me occupied for most of my free time
now it is available at a budget price you would be a fool not to buy it
i give it a solid  out of  i would have given it  if it werent for the minor annoyances that plague it
overall highly recommended a musthave unless you really dont like racingaction games
the huge fun factor redeems it from its shortcomingsnow this is an essential game for sega dreamcast owners
this game is so fun and addictive its almost ridiculous
with the faithful port from the arcade plus additional modes crazy box original this game is not to be missed
regarding the graphics they are awesome with the city buildings cars and other various objects in the game looking nicely detailed and sharp looking
the gameplay is of course very fun and entertaining picking up customers and driving to their destinations by any means possible you can smash around garbage cans tables mailboxes chairs knock over other cars catch serious air off inclines and you can even drive under water the dialogue is hilarious between the passenger and driver i prefer axel also seeing how much moola you get from your customers will bring you back for more and more
the only complaint i have with crazy taxi is the occasional slowdown in the game note the  star rating but overall this dreamcast title is a musthave offering good replayibility and just pure brainless funthis really is an arcade driving game
you can forget realistic physics licensed cars and customizable vehicles
crazy taxi has none of that
what it does have is an enjoyable blend of frantic quotforget the rules of the roadquot driving and timed passenger deliveries
there are four modes of regular play and two maps to drive on
there is also a little extra part where you have to perform certain tasks to continuethe graphics are not too bad but there are many situations where the graphics get slowed down considerably
when these slow downs do occur its never for very long and they dont happen very oftenim not a big fan of the music but i suppose its not too bad
it does go along with the atmosphere of the gameoverall this game is well worth the little amount of money youll likely pay for it
even if youre not a fan of racing games this is a real good game for spontaneous play when you dont want to get involved in some epic adventure
this is a game that every dreamcast owner should have in their collectionjust bought a dreamcast for cheap off ebay and this was one of the games included
the game is awesome at first
i mean i had never played it before or anything like it for that matter
the graphics are pretty solid and the music goes well with the game
not sure how long it remain fun but if you can get this game for around  bucks then go for itin crazy taxi you play a cab driver that must race back and forth across a san fransico like town picking up and dropping off fares within certain time limits
you can earn bonuses for stunts and combo moves
this is a simple driving game that you can pickup and have fun immediatelythe game looks spectacular
the city is nicely detailed the animation is smooth and the overall look is bright and crisp
the sound is good but a little repetitive the same songs from offspring and bad religion repeat over and over again
similarly the characters seems to have a very limited vocabularythe biggest problem with the game is its lack of depth
sega has added some skill testing mini games to lengthen the overall experience
however the game does get slightly repetitive racing back and forth over the same territory and it doesnt give you the option to start from different locationsoverall fun to play looks great but lacks depthcrazy taxi gives you a simple goal pick up the people drive them to their destination and then make money and earn extra time
what isnt included in that description is that the people are often grumpy and fat and that to get to their destinations in time youll have to break a few traffic laws
this makes the game an absolute must have
it is very hilarious to hear the customers insults blare through the speakers as well as to accidently drive off a building into the river or through the subway while you are supposed to be taking a lady to kfc
yet as funny as not playing the game right can be playing it correctly is also very addictive
trying to keep the time up is a very difficult task and when it ends you get your rank based on how much money you made
ive only gotten up to rank  seriously if you dont like taxi driving madness there is something wrong with you
i do admit that it can get repetitive after all it is a direct arcade port but it is great fun when bored upset or when you are just wanting to play dreamcastthis game is pretty cool the first time you get it
it seems like a huge landscape with a lot of different people to pick up and drive around untill you beat it
it has great music and great graphics but there isnt much to do in it
there are two levels to choose from and four taxi cab drivers to chooose from
there are a few special levels to do that are pretty hard
you probably wouldnt play this game very long
i beat it the first day i got it played it a few days to do everything in it and havent played it since
it gets four stars because its fun when you first get it and the areas are big untill you explore them a littlethis game was good back in the day when i was younger
but now i wouldnt be as interested in playing it
but the game has pretty good graphics
the city scenes are pretty nice
the gameplay isnt bad has pretty good control over the taxi you drive and stopping etc
its fun picking up people then afterwards dropping them off at their certain destination within a certain amount of time
and you have to drive through heavy traffic etc
fun game but very repetitive
the whole game is this
you cant really unlock anything
there isnt much to do in this game
theres some mini games that are easy and dont take long to beat at all
so what do to after that
no idea play original mode
but its a decent game for a certain amount of timeas the editor mentions it is very tedious and repitious
you will find a monster in the exact same spot where you had previously killed another one
and you can not bypass any of the monsters you have to fight all of themone good thing youll get to fight a topless woman who has alien tenticles protrouding from her stomach
i guess thats a good enough reason to buy a video game right to me seaman was one of the last games made by sega that really showed that they didnt care about making money only about making innovative games
you cant tell me that they thought this was going to be a huge hit and make the dreamcast a smashing success
a talking fishperson virtual pet game
on the same system that had skies of arcadia shenmue soulcalibur crazy taxi house of the dead and more
this was what sega put a lot of time into
regardless i loved the game because i knew what i was getting into
its a shame that the sequel didnt see the light of day for the dreamcast either it was released for the ps in japan a few years agoif you dont know seaman puts you in the role of a kind of caretaker to an aquarium
leonard nimoy narrates the game at the title screen before you get into taking care of things letting you know whats happened since youve been gone and what you should do next
you start out by placing an egg in the tank setting the oxygen and heat levels and wait
soon the egg hatches and little sporelike creatures pop out swimming around
they dont do that much and eventually most of them eaten by a creature in the tank
the creature is then poisoned and spits them back out but theyve transformed into little fish with human faces
and they talk to you
granted they sound like babies and have limited vocabulary at this stage but the fact remains
after a few days they begin to kill eachother until only  are left and those two will begin to communicate with you the caretaker over the next few weeks having real conversationsi know what youre thinking what the hell just happened
yeah you suddenly go from just looking after fish to basically having virtual therapy with a talking manfish
surprisingly seaman asks a lot of personal questions for you to answer using the microphone like what your relationship status is if youre happy with life if youve ever cheated on your significant other what you want to be etc
hell also go into some nice speeches about life and what he thinks the most important thing ever invented was
believe it or not i got a lot out of talking to seaman then again i was  at the time and enjoyed hearing what he had to say about existence and why he does exist and smaller things like how you cant accurately measure temperature because when you put a thermometer in something youre affecting the temperature
youll probably want to play through the game a few times and just give him different answers to see what he says
like when he asked what state we live in i told him hawaii
he paused asked if it was true and then screamed with joy
sadly he asked me which island and i didnt know what to say so he asked me where we really lived
seaman got me therethats the extent of the gameplay with seaman and though i wouldve gave the game  stars when i first played it looking back now you really only play for about  minutes a day
you have a set number of conversations with seaman before he wants to be left alone and you have to wait until the next day to have a new conversation
for that its almost a waste of time to set the game up if youre only going to play for  minutes but because of how interesting the concept and replies are its worth itvisually seaman looked good at the time it came out
but to be honest all you really see are seaman and the tank hes in
theres also an insect cage but its just as basic as the aquarium
seamans facial expressions werent that varied but how he was animated was good
theres no music despite an official soundtrack being released until the very end when you have to tap along in order to make the creditsclosing music play
seamans voice actor though is the star in the audio department here and he did a fantastic job
you also gotta respect the guy for having to say so much practically filling the entire game disc with dialogue on his own
think about things like how hed have to give a response for every single birth date telling you what celebrities you share the same birthday with and then everything else he had to talk abouti miss the sega that put this game out
but of course given how much money they lost during the dreamcast era its understandable why they dont take anymore chances
but maybe someday we can get a sequel in the us for seaman or even a remake
maybe for the ds
itd be perfect
as it is though seaman remains for the dreamcast and if youre looking to visit the little white box that could i highly recommend picking up seaman as long as you know what youre getting intoim only saying i dont love it because common what does a frog eat
moths
i thought so
har umphsure this game is cool
i mean you get to talk to a fish type human thing
thats cool
this game is way overrated
i loved it the first  weeks when seaman would ask me questions and get to know me
it never realized to me though that he would only ask me about  minutes worth of stuff a day and then say quotwell talk more tomorrowquot
sure what are friends for
lets just put it off for tomorrow
a lot of times theyd not even understand me
then theres the problem of this game lasting about two weeks and then its all over and your seaman is in a new environment and he really has nothing to say to you
it did make me cry when my first seaman died in order to keep his species going
it also made me cry when my last seaman finally got out and he gave me this long speech about our friendship
hes witty and all
think of it like this how would you like it if you got a new best friend in two that you could tell anything and not worry about being abused well not that much at least
then imagine that same friend leaving you right after you having to get used to him
i heard there might be an observation kit coming out
why should i keep waiting money on this
i mean video games dont come cheap
its worth a rent or a borrow from friends for a week or so but afterwards its almost worthlesshere it is the much anticipated interactive manfish from the shores of japan
i bought this game because i am having a child and i am  anticipating this being a pleasant interactive experience for them
by the  time they are old enough to play it though i will probably have to clunk  down for the next version of this title
here is a short review
pros soothing sound effects and gameplay  leonard nimoy as narratorinteractive  microphone  daily gameplayhumourour dialogue with manfish  cons  limited gameplay variation  graphics  somewhat clunky  repeated voice interaction  requiredi would recommend this title to those of you with  enough imagination to make it entertaining
i am sure that the next  version of this game will be amazing as this one seems it might almost bethere are certain things that i like to have in each adventure game i  play
first i want a cast of characters that are unique and interesting  to talk to and secondly i like to feel that i make an impact on the events  around me
and finally i like the setting to be real enough for me to lose  myself in and feel like im really therethe last express does all of  those things
the animation takes some getting used to at first it looks  as though they filmed live actors and then animated over them although at  times the animation is more of a slide show than people actually moving  around but sooner than you think you quickly fall into the mystery of the  gameyou are an american spy who sneaks on board the famous orient  express to meet up with a companiononly to find him dead and an object in  his room stolen
from there you venture out on a cd game of  whodunitone of the appealing things about the game is that whether you  sit in your room or if you wander around things happen
you might be  walking down the hall and see a woman rushing past you in tears but if you  choose to sit in the dining car and evesdrop on peoples conversations you  might find out what made her cry
but whether you are there or not things  will happen
but fear not
if you die or fail the game will rewind the  clock and allow you to try againthe ambiance in this game was  phenominal and the eye for detail was equally as nice
i wish there were  more games like the last expressa gripping and moving piece of business this
the absence of background music the realtime action the many languages and the historical setting combine to give you a feeling of having actually ridden the orient express in the years before the great war
id recommend it for experienced gamers or people with a lot of patience however its not a simple game to play and the puzzles are difficult and rely on your being in the right place at the right time
and its in real time which means a halfhour concert really does take thirty minutes
be preparedfirst of all i payed about  for this game used on ebay
but it was  probably worth it
it is a different kind of game that focuses on character  development rather than puzzle solving typical adventure games or action
there are puzzles to be solved but none are particularly difficult like the  brainstumpers in so many adventure games
the main fun is in learning about  the other passengers on the train
also the graphical style is somewhat  oldfashioned but kind of neat and appropriate to the setting of the  storyive always been attracted to sim games but i inevitably get bored with them  as neat as quotsimcity quot is theres really no point
its like a digital aquarium really get the system stable and thriving and then  watch itquotmajestyquot though solves that problem
sure its a sim a medieval fantasy version of quotsimcityquot by way of quotdungeons amp dragonsquot in addition to creating rogues guilds dwarven settlements blacksmithies and the like quotmajestyquot is based around quotepic questquot scenarios wherein youre challenged to defeat some evil facing the land send your heroes on a quest for some fabled artifact rescue a hostage taken by villains and so onjust as in quotsimcityquot you dont control your wizards warriors rogues elves dwarves gnomes thieves and so on
instead you have to do what any good monarch does in a fantasy game put prices on monsters heads and offer rewards for heroes willing to explore unknown and almost certainly hostile territoryquotmajestyquot is a hoot and a massive timesink youll lose whole nights and weekends to it without realizing it and love every minute of trying to squeeze a bit more service out of heroes whod rather laze about the inn than go study new spells or visit an elven hutofillrepute than go fight the troll heading for the kingdoms marketthe  epic quests included with on the disk are fun and a th is available from on the official web site
it serves as a preview for the forthcoming expansion disk
but while theres a large jump from the beginner to advanced quests and then another more moderate jump from advanced to expert quests they ultimately dont prove too challenging overall
expect to finish most of the quests with a week or two of nightly play less if youve got more time to devote to the game
there is a mode where the game randomizes new quests but its along fairly simple lines and the random quests dont have the same appeal as the premade ones
and once youre done with the quests  well it turns into quotsimcityquot againhopefully more quests will be added to the web site for download or the expansion disk can finally be released
it will add more building types more monsters and a dozen more quests
an excellent game for sim fans who like me want a bit more direction and focus to their gaming experience
while its worth the price  it really is a unique and entertaining game  its not one youre likely to spend playing for months and months to comeafter playing the demo i was a little unsure about my ability to hold interest in the full product mainly due to the fact that i could see that the missions would be too similar
i was wrong
even after beating the  missions the game comes with in single player mode freestyle could be a  game within itself
this is a fun game and the uncanny heros that you  are powerless over makes the game one that never gets old
i cant wait  for the expansion packbeing strategy guide for bellaonlinecom has its good sides and bad sides
on one hand a game like majesty is something i buy immediately because it might be great and on the other hand ive played so many great strategy  games by now that i feel let down when a game isnt fully implemented  properlyyou are  yes  a ruler of some sort although they were  nice to make it genderless
its a buildingplacing game where you locate  each new construction site  be it for a warriors guild a rangers guild  or so on
you then request for that building to either upgrade new weapons  or items or recruit named heroes to join your causethe graphics are  very very nice but ive been spoiled in recent years by some of the  amazing graphics from the various games
its a shame that detailed leaves  on trees and items by the buildings only elicit a quotjeez thats  prettyquot instead of amazed appreciationthe named units is a nice  touch  instead of a random ranger exploring you have teave trailblazer  exploring the eastern marches for you
the home building tells you what  each unit is up to and the units themselves have little thought bubbles  over their heads a la dungeon keeperthe scottishlilt voice chimes in  with important information
quotmore gold your majestyquot is a common  call as your tax collector makes his rounds
your troops defend your town  from killer plants and ratmen while you build it upi appreciate that  units should actively roam and defend and right but really many strategy  games out there do have that ability
in majesty its fun for a while to  set rewards and try to motivate your units but it can get very old and  frustrating very quickly
also the missions are not extremely challenging  making the game itself a quick playthrougha fun play for its simlike  qualities but not a top notch strategy gameits fun and challenging  though you do not exert a lot of direct controll over your subjects but i think its great building your castle and town inviting heroes guardsman and peasants to come live in your cities then watch new subjects being drawn to it and see them save the day and the kingdomi picked up this game over a year ago
played it on an piii  with a soso graphics card
not too bad but not too impressive either
but like everything else its all relativemy friend mike the september  reviewer said it best when he titled his review quotcut it some slackquot
its a game
it cant be  accurate no matter how hard the developers try
heck we pay contractors to make multimillion dollar simulators for us to train in and even those arent perfect but theyre pretty closeas far as an entertaining gamesim you could do a lot worse
on a slightly faster machine with a better graphics card id have to say this game really shines
unfortunately its almost too easy in that the game is so forgiving when it comes to crashesdamage to the helicopters
if only they were that durable in real lifeby now this game is in the dollar bin
ripe for the pickintime and time again the command amp conquer series keeps getting better and better
and firestorm does not disappoint
the only slightly disappointing thing was the units which i didnt think were that great you  hardly ever got to use them except for the juggernaut and its aim was  poor
the missions and the story were both very good especially the  last mission for gdi
it was very tough to get started with missile  launches and units continually attacking you and once you met the  objective the towering and i do mean towering robot you had to fight was  super cool
and you werent done with that mission even after you destroyed  the robot
if you have tiberian sun get this expansion pack you  will not be disappointedwhen i bought firestorm i was expecting a normal expansion pack  few new units maps etc
but once i started playing i realized that there was much more to it than thatthe biggest improvment over tiberian sun is  story
the story is much more interesting and although the in game movies  suck it dosent matter because most of the plot twists are ingame anyways
special units have been created just for one part in the story such as a  huge robot which is a nice touchalthough the music is being sold  as faster paced and more like red alert its pretty much more of the same
graphics also dont change too muchthe new units are pretty cool  but the reaper is the only one that i really liked unfortunatly you can  only use it in multiplayer
the new juggernaut artilery unit is alright but  it cant really aim that well and the nod art
unit is still superior in my  mindall in all firestorm makes tiberian sun a much better game and  if you already have ts then by all means buy firestormthe detail of the battles is incredible
when your archers fire you see the arrows you see them nock a new arrow and you see them draw the bowstring back
and when you put your gunners in ranks of three they fire in rotation
marching troops actually march they dont just glide across the screen
the variety and fluid motion of the camera angles accentuates astounding vistas that the armies fight on
the strategy portion of the game is not overly complicated allowing for a bit of a break after a hectic battle
my only real complaint is that the manual was not well written
itll tell you how to move the camera and the basic commands but you need to pick up the strategy guide to figure out how to really play the gamethe game many historical strategy players have been waiting for
finnaly we can control mounted samurai geishas and ninjas all in beautifully rendered landscapes and decent graphics
great for first timers and veteran  gamers
setting up thousands of troopsyes thousands
literally
can be  difficult but it only adds to the realism
appropriate music adds a nice  atmosphere
weather conditions and unit personalities are just a couple of  all the realism factors youll experience in this fine gamethis game is basically a combination of myth and age of empires series
the graphics are quite impressive and the characters movements are sharpe and fluent
the strategy is a little different to that of the games i just  mentioned because you have such a large amount of troops to control at one  time which to me is what makes this game so much fun
i did try out the  beta version and i am assuming that the final version will have numerous  maps and terrain to wage war on it should be a terrific gamethis game is a must for anyone who likes to be both the warrior and the strategist
this game actually happened by chance since the store i was walking through only had one copy left i decided to check it out
and i loved it from the start
its easy to get into and the tutorial is pretty explanatory showing how to form your armies on the battlefield
but its not just war you have to manage your income to which is manage by rice or koku
then you can move your armis around the map and either negotiate or go to war with other nations
eventually youll go to war with all of the surrounding nations and thats when you get to the battles
the battles are real time and are extremely remarkable
the layouts of the field are great from the mountains where you can position archers from to fire down at your enemies or the forests where you can make a surprise attack
there are only two problems though and thats the control and the morality of your troops
you can have the largest army there is and still you end up falling back because of your generals rank
the control can be a pain sometimes especially if youre positioning your troops in diffeerent areas and they are facing the opposite way of the enemy
but these are only small problems this is worth the purchaseas a resident of japan student of japanese culture language and history  as well as a devout kurasawa fan this was the one game ive been eagerly  anticipating for almost a yearif you scroll through the many reviews  presented here you will find one complaint that everyone seems to agree  on the manual
let me get my one complaint out of the way and agree with  the other reviewers
the manual isnt very helpfulthat being said  you dont need to buy the strategy guide to learn to play
it did take me  a while to master the many facets of the game but after a couple of false  starts and a little patience this became one of my all time favorite  games
it even inspired me to go back and read quotthe art of warquot  and the quotbook of five ringsquot which are excellent books even if  you have no interest in this gamethe realism is your friend and you  must learn to use the weather and terrain to your advantage or you will get  nowhere
also be patient an ongoing theme and choose your battles  wisely
learn the teachings of sun tzu and do not raise an army twice
do  it once and get it rightthe ninja element is one i especially love
i  am a student of taijutsu which is the fighting art of the ninja so i have  a fondness for the original quotmen in blackquot  proper use of ninja  and geisha can be decisive
learn how to raise their kills and take out  crucial generals and diamyo for maximum results
i managed to eleminate  several factions through assassination aloneyour impulse will probably  be to rush if youre used to playing games like age of empires and  starcraft but youre going to have to wait and ensure you have the upper  hand before attacking
this isnt the rts youre used to so dont be  frusterated when you dont conquer the interface in a daythe music and  graphics of the game are excellent and the historical elements give it a  level of class that no other game can come close to
the play takes some  getting used to but as ive said be patient and learn through trial and  error
dont be afraid to start a new game even if youve been working  with the same faction for a whileshogun total war is one of the best strategy games ever
the game is divided into two segments a riskesque map of japan that gives you the strategic picture and a battle simulator that lets you play out the battles you arrange on the strategic map
going far beyond numbers tactical decisions a player makes affect the battle significantly  for example if it begins to rain gunpowder units are useless while if a player seizes the high ground they can attack units still ascending the hill easier
while by todays standards the graphics are not stellar they are still passable and dont detract from gameplay  and those with slower computers can experience an rts game with little to no lagmy one and only beef with the game itself is the diplomacy aspect  it is seriously lacking especially because it lacks any toggle switch
for example if you forge an alliance with someone the only way to break it is for one to attack the other
its almost impossible after the first few turns to be neutral to somebody
also the manual in a word sucks
its uninformative and ive had to go out and buy the strategy guide just so i can learn what some of the basic symbols of the game meanthose two items aside this game is a classic
a must for any rts fanthis is the first game that i can say replaces lords of the realm   it mixes the turnbased overarching strategy of resourcemanagement with the realtime tactical combat
the graphics are amazing with my voodoo and hitachi   monitor and the music in battle is pretty coolthe only reason i didnt give this game  stars and i play all the time is that the alliance system offers nothing to the game
in lords  you could at least ask your ally to help you attack people
in shogun the ally system basically consists of allying yourself with as many parties as possible getting nothing from any of them then attacking thembeing attacked
there is no point to the current system
please please add to this
other than that the game rules
the replayability is great every  weeks i feel like beating it again especially because there are  difficulty settings that can make the game really intenseeverything is great about the game but the only way to learnhow to fight with the armies is to fight with the armies
the manual is limited in info does not explain how to use the commands in any detail and in some cases is just plain wrong
on the other hand the game is very flexible allowing you to pick and select what kind of game you want from picking your clan to deciding if troops will have unlimited ammo
warning real time battles means real time battles
while you sit and think the foes troops are moving into position and getting ready
endsimple elegant addictive
this game will put an end to your social lifei really enjoy this game a lot
i got it today and i have been playing it non stop
why give it  stars instead of  then
well the game is pretty confusing and it is very hard to keep your men doing what you ordered them to do
for instance my army of  archers somehow got up and walked into  the enemies musket shooter men
i was wiped out and lost
dont let this  get you down
it really is a fun realistic and challenging game
its  well worth the moneywow  this is one of the most fun games ive played in a whilethe campaign side of the game is minimal and a bit tedious and some of the ai seems to be cheating
but you forget that once you are launched into battle
the graphics are amazing  fully animated armies of thousands of soldiers that you can control over beautiful terrain
youll need a highspec pc though  i have a fairly hispec dual p  nvidia geforce  system and can get good performance at x i cant wait to take it to some people have complained about the game shipping with a poor manual
according to the shogun website the us edition shipped with an abridged version of the manual
my copy bought in the uk came with a thick user manual and two reference cards  which is just as good as any other game ive seen
if you want the full documentation you can also download it from the total war websitethe manual doesnt discuss tactics in detail and leaves it to you to discover the benefits of the various unit upgrades available
as with any other strategy game youre best off looking in internet forums for this sort of info  if you want to shell out on the strategy guide you can toothe best part of this game is easily the battle sequences
the music graphics and enemy ai produce not only the best wargame that ive ever played but one of my favourite of all games
once you see your samurai swarming over the battlefield to chase some rival scum off the face of the earth any criticisms of the game just seem irrelevantsaying that i do have a wishlist
theres no editor available yet and the campaign game is pretty limited theres not much you can do in the way of diplomacy
the unit types are all very alike too  you get samurai with bows samurai with spears samurai on horses and thats about it
its certainly nowhere near age of empires  in that respectpro fantastic graphics
great ambience when youre in battle mode
lots of variety of tactics terrain and very realisticcon needs a high spec machine
no editor available yet
not much variety in unitsthis game is fun i have to admit but it isnt the greatest stratigy game i think they could have done better on the off the battle feild part it got a little repetitive
but there is a good side to it the graphics
amazing d world land scapes and fight scenes are amazing with  of men fighting to the death
and the different types of people is great that is why i gave it this scoreyes with breathtaking graphics not to mention replay beautiful tracks and superior car physics nfs  is the best car game on the market
still a star had to be deducted because the game is unwilling to recognize some plug and play joysticks on win fails to show certain types of damage such as a shattered windshield and makes winning access to new car models so hard by the time you get to drive todays porsche cars they will have become yesterdaysim rediscovering this beauty again as i just purchased a racing wheel
well over a year old this is still the most fun to play of all the racing sims
at the time it came out it strained older computer systems
now anyone with a recent computer should be able to play it people with highperformance systems may want to reload this gem again and play it with all the settings maxed out  very nice
as many of the other reviewers have attested the physics of the cars are so completely different that its the first time i can say i feel like i really am driving different cars
all the other games claim this but they all felt the same to me
it really is a challenge to master the handling braking and performance issues especially in quotevolutionquot mode where you have to start with the older slower poorly handling porsches and work your way up to the later models by winning race after racethe details have been juiced up so the damage reflects on your vehicles right down to headlights getting knocked out
the headlights quottwinklequot during night driving and the sun gets in your eyes during the day
you can customize the trim colors racing stripes add a racing number and even specify whether you want the top up or down on the convertibles
damage is still unrealistic for obvious reasons  one plow into a retaining wall at mph and game over
yes need for speed fans you can flip your porsches we werent able to in earlier versions
the replay camera angles are great and you can see yourself driving the cars
the sound of the engines in each of the cars are distinctive and unique toothe tracks are great  what ive seen at least
they claim theres a total of  tracks i dont think ive seen half of them yet
not sure how to unlock them or the certain cars they block us from playing
personally i dont want to have to race all the other cars just to unlock one particular model  they get one of the stars knocked off for this annoyance
the computer ai is a little easier now in beginner mode
it has to be cheating in the more advanced modesim not sure of this yet but according to the earacing website multiplayer is going out the door and we may not have a multiplayer option unless we pay to join the feebased motor city online servers grrrr
racings fun but not for  a month in my opinion
if this happens this will be a real disappointment
ea advertises additional downloads off the internet
turns out its just  additional cars
while thats nice especially the 
 it certainly isnt an elaborate expansion of the game that you might infer
it wouldve been nice if they included some additional tracks tooeven if were stuck with singleplayer mode its still a real treat to play
i hope ea considers making a quotferrari unleashedquot or quotlamborghini unleashedquot in the near future
if youre looking for a gift for a racing nut or leadfoot friend  this wont disappoint
hope my review helpedporsche unleashed is still a great experience long after its release
the graphics are superior the car models are excellent the racing modes are fun and reasonably varied and the tracks are well designedthe only downside to the game may be that theres only a handful of tracks included but the ones that are there are large and fun to race around inthe game covers the porsche legacy from the beginning and has you quotlevelupquot as you win races going from the classic boxster to todays monster racing machinesfactory driver mode is challenging and different and the online feature works wellif you like european racing tracks with lots of turns shortcuts and wide open spaces this one is for you
being a porsche fan isnt a requirement the game is still a ton of fun highly recmmendedive been playing the nfs titles since number  and we are now on the th
its hard to play a game in a series without judging it against previous ones
when i first played nfs it had a very different feel to the previous  ones
the graphics engines on  and  were almost identical
 had lots  additions to  it was the introduction of the career mode damage but it  did sometimes feel like an add on pack as it had the same feel  similar  cars same gameplaygraphicsstill after much debate i have found i  enjoyed the th installment the most because of the introduction of the new  career modeso what additions were there to  does it feel like  another add on pack
it plays like a different game entirely
gone are the  cops sob
and the range of cars and bring on the porsches
there are tons  of them and everyone is different
it was a bit boring at first with the  old cars as they drive like a wheelbarrow
but once you get going this is  a hughly addictive gamemy favourite part is still career mode where  you start of in the s with old cars and build your way up to modern day
winning tournements means you get money to buy new cars and so onthe  graphic engine has been totally revamped
cars movement is more realistic  as is collisions
one bad hit will do your car a lot of damage unlike  before
steering will suffer similar to rally championship and you wont  just get big knocks bumping up your damage the same as small knocks
the  graphics are also the best of their kind
you need a good spec machine  nothing less than a pii and although there always seems to be a lack  of tracks in nfs games they are a joy to ride
they have multiple routes  for the first time and the cars ai has been improved
i didnt find myself  always winning and you have the option to buy parts for you car which will  substancially make it quicker
there are the usual modes of play aswell  as a factory driver mode where you have to complete tasks like drive in and  out of cones in a certain time etc
i didnt find myself playing this too  muchi miss the other cars cops and wish there were more tracks loses  a star for this but this doesnt detract from an excellant racing game
i  still played nfs more when i first got it but this game is the bees knees
much different to the other titles and holds the crown of the best racing  graphics to date
you wont be dissopointed unless you want to be a cop
go  for a ridei last reviewed this game in august of  i didnt like it because it was unplayable with a tnt card however i have a different system nowone that i worked very hard to get and can play it to the saving place
you must buy your saves with credits as you would carship insurance
the game is gorgious like traveling in space for real and the music is nice if a little slow but the gameplay is tedious and slow
go to factory alpha pick up a box of space candyor whatever deliver to space station beta get money then get six loads of jupiter woopie cushions and deliver to factory deltaor whatever
it is tedious and it is uninteresting after a while
i stopped playing after an hour of traveling at  kms per hour in a high tech space ship that traveled slower than a bicyclewhy  stars
because it is gorgious and it does feel like your in space or at least in an episode of carl sagans cosmosground control always makes me start humming major tom  the game itself is quite down to earth though
the premise is quite interesting
youre a  year old senior female military person working for the crayven corporation
the order is your enemy and you fight themthats about all you know as you begin the game
you fight them because youre told to by the cold manager enrica hayes who has no brains and couldnt care why you do what you do
when you get your mission briefings from enrica you then get to configure your units with whatever options are available fill your drop ships and land to attackthe game works with individuals grouped together into set units
while a set of  tanks move together a particular tank can get wounded and die
you cant tell a particular tank to go somewhere on its own though
the unit moves together
this makes it easier to manage many missions simply grabbing units and pointing them in directionsthe graphics are great
ground control has the moveanywhere view that dark reign  uses
very intuitive and easy to use
follow along with a unit or get a birdseye view of the great graphical combats
while my athlon often choked on some of the larger scale combats boding poor results for slower machines in general it whisked along at a good clipthe landscape is fully three dimensional and fully rendered
hide in the shadow of a cliff to get an ambush jump on your enemy
sneak along under trees or overhangings to avoid being seen
troops have options for weaponry and healing that can be customized
troops can be carried in apcs to zip from location to location and peel out quickly into whichever formation you specifythe downsides on the game are the stuttering i mentioned before on heavygraphic situations and also the general situation you major sarah parker find yourself in
while its great that the lead player and her boss are both women its very very annoying playing a game in which you watch your friends shoot up hospitals where youre berated by your commander and where no matter how quickly you get to someone the program insists its quottoo latequot and you must watch the person die to further the plot
i have enough frustration in real life without playing a game in which the lead character is drinking after each mission wondering why she even keeps fighting
does that provide any incentive for the player to want to keep playingalso most games of this style allow the player to choose amongst factions and decide which side to play
in this game its very linear
each mission is forced on you and what you do in the mission is preset
while replaying the same mission  times might have them decide to attack from the ne or the se randomly they always attack and then the same exact messages always appear which you cannot click throughif you enjoy strategy combat without building units or structures and have a fast enough machine to handle this ground control might be the perfect game for youi bought this mainly for the packagingbut all you get is a dvd case with game inside
no instruction manual or glorious box art if youre like me you like collecting this stuff
ah well  good game but prepare to do a little research for instruction manual as the learning curve is high and no manual comes with gamemost rpgs you play on the computer are based in fantasy worlds like  dungeons with monsters and elves and such fallout takes place in a dark  and desolate future you are a member of a vault that has managed to  avoid all of the damage caused by the wars and the bombs and the radiation
unfortunately your vault has suffered a problem in its systems and your  people will all die if you cant find a replacement partyou can choose  between playing a male or a female and get to pick your stats
the combat  system is very well done as you get to take time between combat rounds and  decide what you want to do instead of just randomly whacking at something  and hoping you can pound your buttons faster than the computers aione  thing thats interesting is that your actions in the game have  consequences
who you help and who you dont determine what happens in the  future
you can also make friends and have a band of npcs joining you as  you progress alongalthough this wasnt the most spectatular rpg ive  ever played i also had few complaints besides some clunky times with being  able to see where i was or occasions where the npcs had boxed me into a  room and it took some tricky manuvering to get my way outall in all i  think fallout is a good introduction game for those wanting to wet their  feet in computer rpgs and for more seasoned gamers theyll find it a  unique story and something easy to hold interest ini am pritty familar with the fallout games and this one is the best although it has a few problems
the game starts off by you talking to the overseer of vault  who tells you that the water purifying chip is dead and your the lucky bastard who has to get ityay
the story is good although it is a short game i once beat the game in under  min and it dose have its fair share of glitches one of the main giltches is when the screen goes black and you have to wipe it with your mouse and the fmvs get blury at times
for a game made in  it is very big and has alot to offer story and gameplay mostly and it has about  to  different endings along with side quest and lovable characters the thing i love most about this game is the vocie acting
today is the last day on steam were they are selling it for  so get it now
i give fallout a  outa  this is zombiedude sighing offthis game plays a lot like virtua fighter but goes quite a bit further in visuals
doa is the real turning point in the series with great design and framerate
well worth the price
give it a try be forewarned that the graphics are a little quotlazyquot  the collisions are handled fairly poorly so that fabric hands legs etc all overlap and slide into each other pretty much all the time
body parts do not stop when they hit body parts be forewarned that characters costumes and backgrounds are limited  im spoiled by having dozens of characters and arenas the limited variety in doa is frustratingotherwise solid gameand hey do not make the mistake of comparing the lookandfeel of this game to soul caliber ok
this is closer to silly cartoonlike games like marvel vs capcom or mortal kombat gold
it is cartoonish highly stylized
it is not trying to be superrealistic
its a beautiful internally consistent and goodlooking game taking its stylization into consideration
game play is fine
fun
easy enough and with some variety for skillbuildingone great fighting game
doa  is a great game
it has better single  player then most other fighters and awesome multiplayer
the graphics are  some of the best on the dreamcast
the controls are simple and easy to  learn maybe to easy for some
a definate must buy for any fan of fighting  games like soul calbur
but if you are strapped for cash and trying to  decide between soul calibur and dead or alive  i would advise going with  scpiloting a star fighter is fun and this game does an excellent job of throwing you into the action with a minimum of training exercises
the game also defaults to the quoteasyquot but not quotvery easyquot skill level so that us nonveterans can actually play and get through the levels without being pounded mercilessly
as a result after a short learning curve and discovering when to hang back a little from the action and when to charge in you can enjoy this game without the  forcefeedback joystick serious spaceflightsim players probably purchaseon the other hand its such a hoot you might find yourself wanting to invest in some hardwarethe graphics are still wonderful with huge battleships throwing massive particle beams at each other through lightningcharged nebulae and the pacing and mission difficulty curve is quite fair except for one spy mission which is rather harsh
for the easily frustrated you can skip at least some missions if you fail them five timesthe only qualm i have with the game is its adherence to aerial dogfighting physics
and its a minor qualm
but when someone is pouding on your tail with missiles and lasers itd be really nice to do a  and give it back to em
cant do it in an airplane but theres no reason you couldnt in a spaceshipoh yeah and i cant say im impressed with the storyline
yeah its better than the first one and no its not really all that important but i havent found myself particularly involved in it
and your character is basically a pawn in a much larger game and the real stars of the story are remote to you at least at firstanother commendable touch is the way the characters in the game change their reactions to you as you progress
it does give one an impression of building a prestigous career
this draws you in more as time goes onshogo mobile armor division is an fps with a great story driven gameplay
set in the future it is a japanese anime inspired game
you play sanjuro makabe a soldier in the united corporate authority security force and against the terrorist leader gabriel he is in love with two girls both of them sisters and daughters of the general
the story is orginal and a certain situation you will be given an option of what to say
in the level city of hope you will be given an option of what to say if you choose the first option you will get to play many levels in places much different from what you would play if you choose the second option
the game has two different endings
shogos gameplay is very good part of it you play sanjuro on foot and part of it he is riding an mca giant robot they are very well balanced few levels on foot then robot then on foot then robot ect ect they make the game lot of fun and very intresting
there are many types of mcas for you to choose very fast but a weak mca very strong but slow mca ect
shogos gameplay is very good there are lots of great action with lots of villans to fight
the enemy ai is bad baddies do not react if you snip their partner standing nearby
this flaw makes shogo a little linearshogo is powered by the lithtech engine
i played it on the directd video mode and the game runs very well
the graphics are outdated today and the human charecter dont look real but being an anime inspired game makes the graphics quite ok there are loads of well designed and challenging levels
the level designing is fantastic and some of the levels are quite funny in one level you need to jump from roof top to roof top in your mca and in one level you need to search for a pussy cat in a wearhouse so that its owner would open the door which will let you into the next level
shogo has a lot of really cool weapons and there are loads of different weapons for the human and the robot
shogos only flaw is the weak ai besides that it is surely the best giant robot game ever made and a great fpsfinally i had a small problem with the game and almost everyone with geforce based video cards may have that problem in shogo and blood
the main menu will not appear or keep flickering
turn the vsync to always off in the more directd option or go to planetshogocom they have a solution for itall this game needed was a better story and a little more time ont the characters and surrondings
this is a really good game it is really fun to play and it is pretty cool when you kill the people and the robots
they kind of over exagerate on the killing the humans when you kill them the spew out so much blood
like all of the blood in there body goes out through one little cut or bullet holeshogo was one of those first person shooters that ended up being forgotten among the glut of fps games out at the time
this is a shame because shogo was one of the better games out there
engaging story
impressive graphics
smooth game play
this should have been one of the gems of the generationshogo is a game about a pilot of a giant robot mech fighting a rebel group lead by somebody named gabriel who in turn have giant mech robots at their disposal
these arent lumbering machines that move slowly like other mech games
these are robots that can run and move with the fluidity of any fps
considering this game incorporates anime sensibilities in other parts of the game it makes sense
animes like gundam robotech evengelion and many others have robot mecha that move like athletes instead of machinesanime is the name of the game for shogo
the incidental artwork is anime style
the voice work like a dubbed anime
the robots and characters look anime
the story has an anime feel to it
your robot even transforms into a vehicle like some anime mechs
if you are an anime fan you will even find a few easter eggs along the game referencing anime shows
i dont know if this is meant to be a love letter to the genre or if its just a marketing ploy to drum up otaku business
either way if you are into anime this is one of those games geared for youit was one of the rare games that had a true and coherent storyline which a cast of characters that did more than just feed mission details
most fps games back then hardly had a storyline at all and generally just had a setting or introductory story to set the mood
however during the game its all about beating the level and getting a high body count
even the games that did try to put an engaging story often fell into the same trappings of being not much more than a backdrop to the current level im talking to you half life
you wouldnt see true story driven games come to rise until later when games like system shock  and deus ex came out
granted shogos story is a bit cheesy at times but at the same time it gave you some drama and more importantly a reason to be running around shooting things more than just for the sake of shooting thingsgameplay is rather fun
you go between being in a giant mech shooting at giant robots and tanks and being on foot shooting at rebels and such
on foot you have an array of standard fps weapons but with a little extra flair like instead of one pistol you carry two and the submachine gun has a sound suppressor on it
as for the mecha weapons they range in a wide variety of fps styles as well that included melee weapons like swords and such
the mech weapons were designed for cool effect
the laser fired a tight a fast beam
the pulse rifle bright balls of energy
lots of explosions to enjoypart of what made shogo such a good game was the lithtech engine
part of its appeal was how well it scaled to the capabilities of the pc the game was installed
no matter the speed of your computer the same always ran smoothly
another thing i liked about the lithtech engine was the way it handled lighting background textures blood and body physics
back in those days these aspects of a game were rather drab but shogo presented a new level of detail not so common
of course you look at the game now and the graphics seem very dated
however back then even if the graphics werent top notch you got great performance and visual effects from shogo
level design was also pretty creative with very little duplicationthe soundtrack was another feather in shogos cap
while there wasnt a wide variety of songs the ones you got felt just right for the levels with a nice mix of aggressive and atmospheric electronic music
i will say while the music worked great for the game listening to it on its own could have been better
most of the songs have some great hooks but when you include the content of the whole song it gets to be hard to enjoy with your headphones or in the car
remixes would have been niceas much as i enjoyed playing the game back then i do admit there were limitations
the enemy ai wasnt all that smart most of the time
if you were a sniping kind of shooter many parts of the game are like shooting ducks in a barrel
they practically walk up to your sights and ask to be shot at
sometimes the story gets a little too corny for my tastes even if the all the various dialog banter do help flesh out the game
most of all when looking at todays games shogos age definitely shows
it came out just months before half life and that game pretty much changed everything graphicallyshogo is still a fun game to play
the action is tight
the story is engaging enough
the little bits of dialog make it all the more interesting
if you are a s anime fan you may get more out of it than most and i would definitely recommend give it a try
for fps fans it may be a tough sell considering all thats out there
still the game is solid and worth being rememberedin the world of film it often occurs that higherprofile projects steal the limelight from lesserknown albeit more deserving contendersthis seemingly occurs as well in the world of gaming
one such case took place years ago and it involved the game shogoshogo a very polished fps is a game which takes itself much less seriously than others of its kind yet surpasses them in many ways
it integrates a great game engine fun gameplay different game modes and even slight rpg elements into its formula making it a true winnermonoliths game certainly does not lack style
based on anime cartoons both level and character design are greatly hightened by the thematic choice
what we are left with is a game that at no point bores the playershogo seems to really nail the genre it belongs to
while providing a then much needed change of style for an fps it did not lose playability in the process
mortal kombatlike blood and gore are spread all over in typical anime fashion and the maps are divided between slighlty strategic and full blownactionthe use of the locations is quite bright making you backtrack only to find reinforecements have been called in a realistic manner
the gameplay is well balanced and little details such as the speed of the human characters walk are just rightconsider this my vote for a sequelthis was a very fun and promising game to playsome of my friends have been saying quotbest game evericewind dalequotnonot the best gamebut more like quotas fast as diabloas dialougefilled as baldurs gatequotthe only problem was that there were too many dungeonsi would like some outsidepleaseotherwiseheygreat gamethe bioware infinity engine the same game engine that powered old classics such as baldurs gate and planescape torment is still in use today
the latest use of that very engine was icewind dale   this package of the game is completly watered down not including the thick manual that was supposed to come with it
also the dvd style box started by eas medal of honor allied assault makes for a skimpy package
those who have never played any infinity engine games will be completly confused at first for the manual is on the cd
it is much better to read a hard copy of a manual
interplay also does not replace icewind dale manuals
however the money that you spend will go to a full version of icewind dale with no expansion
amazon offers a bundle of icewind dale and its expansion heart of winter
i do believe that it is called icewind dale the collection
heart of winter is not really worth the money and cannot be found anywhere except in the packaged version with the standalone icewind dale or at the interplaystoretake note icewind dale iwd is an extremely difficult game
it is easy to say that it is an action based baldurs gate lacking in story but filled with combat
this combat though is extremely hard
people new to the infinity engine will find even the first ogre boss in the prologue to be difficult
the first real boss a topless snake woman named yxunomei spell
 is even more difficult
many a time one will find himself losing more than half his party to just one monster
even with difficulty setting to very easy it still is not such an easy game
the pace is not as fast as say diablo   people new to add but veterans to games like diablo  will find it strange that an attacking animation is shown but the enemy is not hit
utter confusion
later in the game there are creatures that must be phased before they can die and such
games based off the infinity engine are not click fests such as diablo  but more with strategyicewind dale is a good game despite its punishing difficulty
after a single gaming session one will feel as if he or her has accomplished something
if you are to get the first iwd then get the expansion heart of winter bundled with it
heart of winter offers a lot of features which i think is valuable
item clutter does get a bit off hand if items such as a gem bag are not included
x resolution is also nice
there is also the feature to remove the interfacing with a single key stroke keeping away those who talk bashing the intrusive interfacehowever if you are looking to a newer game then i am sure that icewind dale  will satisfy your needs
it is not necessary to play the first iwd to understand the second
every icewind dale game is extremely difficult
along with baldurs gate  tales of sword coast  and throne of bhaal all infinity engine games are long and difficulta final word to leave you with
if you are afraid of difficult games that are long and can get tedious but yet you want a game made from rpg masters
my final suggestion neverwinter nights
it is no more than  hours for the single player and the difficulty is no where near any of the bg series or iwd series
plus its not based off the infinity engine but a modified d enginemake your decision or buy them all
note if you do buy them all expect to spend more than  hours playing dd crpgsif you like good americanstyle dd rpgs with tons of fast battles then icewind dale based on biowares infinity enginealso used in bg is for you
the overall pace of the game is much faster and less tedious than bg and tales of the swordcoast
the price is great theres a lot to see and do and plenty of monsters to kill
youll definitely use the save function a lot in this game but you wont find yourself getting frustrated as the difficulty seems pretty well balanced outat this priceyou cant go wrong by buying this title if you missed out on it or if baldurs gate ii is a little out of your price range
lots of great gaming for a low pricea band of adventurers arrive at easthaven a town in the icewind dale region of faerun far to the north of most civilised lands on the far side of the spine of the world
the towns mayor asks the adventurers to travel to kuldahar a village of druids in the foothills of the mountains where they have reported strange goingson
the adventurers agree but are cut off in the foothills by an avalanche
proceeding to kuldahar on foot through an area inhabited by hostile creatures the adventurers learn of a threat to all of faerun that is developing in the mountains and the caverns under them and they must defeat this threat before its too lateoriginally released in  icewind dale was the third of the dungeons and dragons games using the infinity engine developed by bioware and black isle now obsidian
these three games were effectively an attempt to corner three distinct types of fantasy planescape torment was the arty literary and philosophical game essentially a video game equivalent to gene wolfe whilst baldurs gate was the more traditional largescale long broadbased and wellcharacterised epic following in the trail of tolkien
icewind dale on the other hand was the much more combatoriented sword and sorcery adventure much more of a romp than the other two
this led it to getting somewhat mixed reviews at the time though viewed in isolation from its forebears its positive aspects become much more apparentstarting off icewind dale has you creating all six characters in the party giving them names and deciding on their races and character classes
this is unlike baldurs gate where you only created the leading character and then picked from a range of preexisting companions and also unlike planescape torment where you had a pregenerated character though you could change his stats
this is the biggest change from the other games since your party is totally usergenerated there is little to none of the party interplay seen elsewhere
there is no possibility of romances or rivalries erupting between partymembers which removes some of the flavour and unpredictability of the earlier games but also makes icewind dale a lot more oldschool and traditional which is not entirely a bad thingonce youve created your party its rpg business as usual
you can explore the opening town solve a few puzzles usually through item quests or combat though you can resolve a few quests through dialogue alone and so on before youre given the main quest
you have to fight your way through the mountains to kuldahar a town built in and around a colossal tree which becomes your base of operations as you range out on various missions for the denizens of the town
these involve a lot of dungeon explorations and assaults on temples and castles held by various enemies so a combatfocused party is a must though the prevalence of traps and sorcerous opponents means you want to bring a thief and at least a couple of magicusers along as wellthe game is wellwritten but compared to the other infinity engine games straightforward indeed somewhat refreshingly so at times
theres a few nice twists but generally what you see is what you get and what you get is a metric ton of combat
you fight dozens of different types of enemies from orcs to powerful enemy wizards and amass vast quantities of loot
you also level up at a rate of knots compared to other ddbased games
generally speaking if more than ten minutes go by without a ferocious combat sequence somethings gone wrong somewhereluckily icewind dale uses a later iteration of the infinity engine with stronger graphics including the heavensent ability to change the graphics resolution to something bearable on a modern pc a friendlier interface and more options for character classes and combat not to mention being able to carry lots more loot
in fact if you ignore the simple fact that the game is d and spritebased there are d options for spell effects but these tend to be hit and miss with modern graphics cards its aged very well indeed
the handpainted environments are gorgeous the sound and music is of a very high quality and the combat is fast and furious though as usual you can hit space to pause the game at any time to issue fresh orders
the pace is only let down by the traditional dd problem of having to rest every couple of fights to replenish spells or having to quicktravel back to kuldahar to unload the frankly ludicrous amounts of loot you amass on your quests at regular intervals
the game also ties in nicely and unexpectedly with the icewind dale trilogy of novels by ra salvatore despite taking place almost a century earlier and fifteen years before drizzt dourden arrives in the area
this tiein is very logical and satisfying compared to the more obvious and cheesy cameos in the baldurs gate seriesthe minuses are for the most part the obvious sideeffects of the positives
almost every situation in the game is solved by you hacking your way through it though there are a few more original and interesting puzzles along the way and overall the game lacks subtlety
the writing and moody blackandwhite cut scenes are great but given you spend a lot of time in combatfocused dungeons some time can go by between plotrelated events happening which occasionally threatens to reduce the game to a hard grind
and as great as the graphics are the harsh snow backdrops and the very large creatures show up some issues with the engine leading to some pixellation
the combat focus of the game also means its pretty unforgiving and total party kills are not uncommon
as with all infinity engine games but moreso here you need to have a finger hovering over the quicksave button at almost all times and remember to save between combats before resting after resting before tackling a complex trap especially the ones which can backfire and blow up your entire party if you fail a roll and at least every five minutes regardless of anything elsethat said the games not quite a brainless hack em up
the story which it kicks in every now and then is intriguing and the writing when it does appear is generally pretty good as youd expect from some of the same team behind planescape torment
these elements give the game a bit more depth than its reputation suggests
in fact if the game does suffer in departments its usually through comparisons to its contemporaries
taken on its own merits and in isolation a rewarding and impressive crpg emergesicewind dale  is a fun furious and enjoyable roleplaying game which has aged excellently and is let down only in comparison to more story and roleplayingfocused rpgs
for those looking into a great dungeonexploring or more actionbased rpg icewind dale more than satisfiesdue to the games age there are a variety of ways of getting it
the good old games edition may be preferable since it has been optimised to run on windows  and vista with no problems and also includes the free expansion trials of the luremaster which needs to be downloaded separately for the other editions
you can also get it as part of a triplepack with the paidfor expansion heart of winter and icewind dale ii uk usa or as a boxed copy with just the expansion uk usastanding alone icewind dale is an enjoyable game
but when compared to bgsoa there is no comparison bg is far and away the best of the two
since im using icewind dale to kill time while i await the expansion for bg its been sort of a disappointment
while creating your party is somewhat fun especially choosing portraits names etc
i really miss the quirky npcs ive found in the baldurs gate games
the artwork in icewind dale is absolutely beautiful and ive also noticed everyone raving about the music
actually the music isnt that noticeable
also i dont like how your characters start out at first level
they die too easily
i have probably poured thousands of gold into resurrection spells
the plot is fairly interesting but no where near as involved as bg bg or planescapetorment
dont let me put you off
icewind dale is a good game entertaining fun and with some really nice itemsthe quests in this game are too linear
there are probally x the battles in this game but usually you can get out of things by giving coin
any game with the bioware infinity engine would get an automatic  i would have given a better rating if the game hadent crashed
although its not as stable as bg or bg it is worth the  dollarsso your bored of the newer rpgs as they seem to be carbon copies of one or another
try this game then
it is very open but not as much as sandbox games
there are quests and subquests
if you do get this i recommend getting the expansion for it heart of winter
it adds more areas
even more there is another expansion set for it online that you download called trials of the loremaster
it is free and available at the sorcerers place
currently im finding some newer rpgs stale and bored and costly since i cannot buy any of the new systems
i decided to go back and play some old games
im still suprised how fun this game is after all this time
now that i am older i also notice some good writing in the storyline of the game
if you want a game where it is just a big adventure with open maps like a sandbox method try this game againalthough by todays standards the graphics are obsolete you cannot say anything bad about a game that is this much fun
note be wary of using it on windows vista
many games that are older have problems with their software on that system
well im back to hunting and hackingslashing
have fun everyoneafetr getting my federal tax refund check i went looking for a promised  deal on the baldurs gatetales of the sword coast pack at my local computer store
needless to say theyd sold out between running the ad sunday and me getting there monday so i shelled out the extra thirty bucks for icewind dale since it was based on the same engine
did i get my moneys worth
you better believe itthe basic premise as about as tissuethin and unnecessary as it usually is in adampdworld games youre new in town the town elder is forming an expedition to help a neighboring town you sign on things go wrong you have to save the day
nothing at all new here
but who cares
the whole idea is to lose yourself in a party of characters who are capable of doing all sorts of things youre not and along the way you get to pummel a bunch of nasty things that will otherwise have you for dinnerback in the days when pool of radiance had just come out im talking ssi gold box here not ruins of myth drannor
 i could never have imagined how great adampd computer gaming would become
not that it wasnt then i still play the gold box games now and then when im feelnig nostalgic
icewind dale is just the next step in the evolution of the wonderful world that is adampd computer gaming
if youre looking for something original and spectacular get yourself a copy of lords of magic but for comfortable and spectacular you need look no further than thisicewind dale is a dungeons and dragons game
if you are not familiar with this type of game icewind dale could be slightly difficult for you
but if you are familiar with baldurs gate and planescape torment you will know what this game is all about
it starts of with a weary group of travelers who must fine a lost caravan in the high peaks of icewind dale in order to move through these lofty mountains to get home
once this somewhat tiny and easy prologue is over the real game begins
icewind dale plays exactly like baldurs gate
you travel from location to location setting off on quests that all eventually lead to the end of your adventure
your characters gain levels as they finish quests and defeat enemies in combat develop new skills collect armor etc
you may have a pary of up to  players or you may only have one
it is fully your choice
you may create your whole entire party from scratch and you may modify it any time during the game
icewind dale is very addicting
i play it for about  hours take a break and play until i am too tired to go on
the combat and character interaction is so in depth that you wnat to play just to move forward and for absolutely no reason at all
the graphics are excellent
the prerendered backgrounds are beautiful ranging from glaciers to snowy passes even to ancient crypts
the battle and characer graphics are very sharp as well
the music is excellently orchestrated with over  different tracks of enthralling and original scores
the gameplay is at first hard to learn if you havent played another black isle rpg but once you get used to it combat is a breexze
the interface is easy to navigate and  has nothing wrong with it at all
now come the cons
first every game comes with its own annoying bugs
in  weeks of playing the computer exited the program twice
what specifically bothered me was that i had to do the full install because whenever i went to the worldmap the program was searching for the disk on the wrong drive
you are going to want to download all the patches avaiable and install them before you get anywhere near this game
another con of this game is that it is far too based on combat
there are just some battles that you will play over and over again up to  times to finish
it isnt that they are hard it is that there are far too many enemies
but many enemies means lots of experiencenow note that the cons arent as bad as they sound
if i had the option i would have given this game a star rating
the bugs happen rarely and the combat is never as difficult as some of the boss battles
i only had trouble with a fight  or  times in the whole game
this is my final statement
buy this game if you like dnd rpgs
and even if you dont it truly doesnt hurt to expand your horizonsthis game isnt a far cry from the first mdk
there are some improvements however such as the gameplay
its easy to move around and use all the functions
and for those with a sick sense of humour this game is quite  funny to play and see what happens
there are tons of new weapons and  gadgets to find
if you liked the first mdk this wouldnt be a bad one to  checkoutmdk is better than the first because you can play with more charectersthis game is funny but hardi got stuck on  levels and had to use a cheat to get to the next levelthe proffesur is the most harddest one but i made itit took me along time to beat this gameif u like thinking games this is for uthe only  thing i dont know in this game is what the hell does mdk stands forif u know please righ me my email is superstashotmailcomoh and if you are stuck then go to  where there is a lot of cheats
thats where i got the cheats fromi hope this was helpful and remember if u know what mdk stands for then right me pleasethanksim not going to say anything new about whats so great about this game
the three players the weapon variety the immense levels
the colors the slap stick humor and the nice story line make this a game that stands out
all of this with an impossibly low system consumption
a very very impressive feat no doubt
and yet i cant help that but notice that this game could have been so much morei never played the original mdk so i had no real idea of what to expect other than what was given on the box
so this is what i was given to expect
the ability to quotchoosequot this is the keyword here between max doc or kurt
in reality the game alternates between the three characters in no seemingly specific order through out the game
it isnt actually till much later in the game that you actually do chose between the three characters
but by then its a tad to late and you simply want the game to be over
this in all honesty is the major killing point for this game
it seems useless to have three characters to play when playing them is not done by choice
yeah yeah i know about all of the good stuff the game has all the stuff i mentioned above but still gamers today want more a whole lot more
how many of you are going to be satisfied playing pong when you know that there is something betterthis game is a cool buy but its missing so many crucial elements
buy only to expect this game to collect dust after a few months
scratch that
go to zshops or auctions the game will be worth it thenas an interesting alternative to the traditional building games like  caesar iii and age of empires ad is easy to learn and play with  little of the complexity of the other advanced games
you begin with a  number of islands on the map and with your flotilla of boats you explore  them learning what each is good at producing
you settle on one creating  hunting lodges tobacco plantations sugar cane chapels and homesjust  as in the caesar iii style of games there are steps to take to create  products
you take tobacco from the farm and turn it into cigars
sugar  cane goes to the distillery and becomes alcohol and the tavern buys it
you can also establish trade routes
an island low in tobacco can ship that  in and send off the stones it is mininghomes develop in size as their  needs are met
quarry stone for more advanced buildings and build your  technology for more interesting options
build up your sheep farm and send  wool to the weaver for more content and well dressed  inhabitantstheres combat too  pirates lurk in the seas and nearby  settlements compete with you for land
you can invade their territory or  try to outmerchant them
you can even multiplay to take on your friends in  high seas adventurewhile this is definitely fun for beginners it  leaves something to be desired for advanced players
i would recommend this  to a family that wishes to play together and for gamers new to strategy  who want to learn at a gentle pace how to manage resources and grow a cityjust so people dont get the wrong idea the realtime strategy battles usually dont occur until a very long time into the game
this leaves the player with more than enough time to colonize various islands build up  your citizenry make money and progress in structures and technologies
for some this is wholly enjoyable but those looking to swashbuckle and  shootemup minutes after the game starts might be a bit miffedthe  colonybuilding portion of the game and really the main portion of the  gameplay is very enjoyable
detailed yet not overwhelming though at  first you might be a little harried it strives to provide a complete  picture of starting and maintaining a thriving colony
your citizens must  eat so you must provide them with food hunters fishermen cattle farms
they need clothes so you must provide those also sheep farms weavers  textile trade
and the citizens will have demands churches taverns  alcohol so ignore those at your own risk
trade is vital or youll run  out of essential building blocks for empirebuilding especially tools
and hopefully your island will produce some vital product that you can sell  for an exorbitant amountit isnt as fastpaced or intense as simcity  or civilization but theres so much to do that youll actually have your  hands full managing it all
no sitting back and watching here
and once  you finally do grasp the multitude of activities in the game then youll  find out how fun and rewarding it can beunreal is a first person shooter with an great single player gameplay and built on an eye candy engine
the story you are a prisoner and you are transported in a spaceship
the ship crashes on a strange unreal planet which looks medieval and futuristic
the inhabittens of the planet the nalis are attacked by the skaarj warriors the skaarj are very advanced in technology than the nalis
you have to battle the skaarj get help from the nalis and escape from the island
the level design is fantastic but quite difficult expecially the boss levels because of weak weapons
levels are very beautifully and very well done the second level when you walk out of the spaceship and take your first look at the strange world is very creatively and very well done
unreal is built on a very beautifull engine and many games use that engine for their games
the main menu and the advanced menu is very good and very easy to use
i played unreal on the directd video mode and it runs very smooth
the graphics are fantastic they look great even today
beautifull sky with birds flying water that ripples and fishes swimming in it
for almost every level you could see new types of water skies and textures
the ai is very good though far from perfect it is much better
on the downside i found the weapons very dull and boring they should have been more powerfull and more creativily done
unreal is one of the most beautifull game i have ever played it is a great game for action game loverswell first let me tell you that i am a major fps gamer
halflife unreal ut all that good stuff
so when i bought unreal i was expecting a lot and i got just a little bit disappointed
but first let me tell you that the game looks great it looks and runs better than halflife has a great engine and for  is impressive as hell
the ai is great
the weapons are just right
and the levels espically second are pretty good
but then again having played modern  fps i was kind of disappointed at the lack of features i take for granite
like a weapons system that goes both ways just not one
having to change items and crap
and the level architexture espically in the third and part of the second which is the best looking level really sucks
i hate the big bulky levers
the lack of any speech
and the second enemies so what i am really saying is that the beginning of the game is kinda slow but it gets better
if you love ut get this game
its greati just rented this game about two days ago and with a little company from one of my friends i was able to beat it quickly and still get amazingly scared
the graphics are decent the cut scenes are amazing for its release date
i dont know if id buy it since i could rent it for five days beat it in one play it over the next day and get my fill out of it before even returning itthe only reason i gave it four stars instead of the five was for the story
i had no idea what the heck happened in silent hill even after i beat it
i rented all three and i have yet to beat them
this one was amazingly scary and worth checking out the second is even more horrifying from what ive seenall in all this game is highly worth it for fans of horror games and in my opinion better than resident evildifferent things scare different people but this one got to me
i think silent hill is by far the scariest video game ever
the creators of this game did an excellent job of setting an extremely creepy mood through disturbing visuals and fearinducing music and sound
some of the sound effects are really terrible and by that i mean scary and effectivethis is not a beautiful game
the graphics are clearly dated and the fog effects arent great
if you are someone who needs excellent graphics to enjoy a game then you are probably better off with re or the soontobereleased silent hill   for those of you who dont care about appearances that much check out this classicthe story is engaging at times but unravels in the end as is common in video games
there are a couple of different endings and the one i got when i completed the game didnt make any sense or resolve any issues
but the game was very fun overall and i liked it a lotoverall not the greatest game but the novelty factor is so high you have to give it a fair shake
ok so being quotthe rockquot or quotstone coldquot is fun for a bit and its great pounding the will to live out of the other wrestling greats but believe me it will start to bore you after awhilewhat will make the replay value of this game skyrocket is the ability to make your own wrestler
this game has one of the better quotcreateaguyofyourownquot features on any playstation game
my wrestler big nasty is  feet tall  lbs wears a samauri mask and a hawaiian shirt
whats not to like about that
the point is wrestling should be something that is kept toungeincheek
if you take the tv shows or this game too seriously youre going to tire of the whole thing way too quickly
but if you take it for what it is  a soap opera for guys  you can have a blast and a good laugh too
by the way big nasty is no
 in my leaguethe bonus reason to own this game is getting a few friends to come over
those of you who enjoy mariokart or james bond on the n know what intense fun it is to move away from predictable computer opponents and match your wits against your palsat the very least pick this up for a long weekend rent
novelty will keep you coming back now and then
 starsi loved this game and i have gotten hours upon hours of fun out of it
with what seems like an endless supply of wrestlers and the ability to create your own superstar this game is a must have for wrestling fans
there are real entrance videos and music with signature moves
i love this gamegreat game even for a first in a series this game had a good number of matches great graphics the improvement in the wrestling moves were amazing the controls were great improved from the button mashing of warzone and attitude
entrances are lackluster but the video background makes up for it
very well done by wwetaking over the wwfwwe videogame license from acclaim developer yukes and thq made giant improvements in the graphics and gameplay of the wwe experience for the original playstation making the game experience look and feel that much more like what a wrestling fan might see of their favorite performers on tvfor being their first try yukes came very close to perfecting this title with the only real weak point to it in my opinion being the really lousy and limited set of options available in the createawrestler feature which consisted of a few unlockables prebuilt to resemble performers who had not otherwise been included and a large number of parts seemingly carried over from the games japanese origins as the toukon retsuden serieson the upside building up your created characters in season mode is quite fun if a little bit frustrating in the early going as you try to improve your over all abilities and statsthat flaw aside the game was a vast improvement in terms of play and presentation over the acclaim titles war zone and attitude which werent half bad themselvessid meiers alpha centauri is for those who loved the original  civilization but who prefer science fiction over historic recreation
i  know  im one of them
alpha centauris diverse selection of factions is  better than civs nations  each has its own goal agenda and beliefs that  you will discover as they fight trade and politick with you
the alien  crossfire expansion includes new factions  including two alien ones  and  new advancements for the game
if theres one problem its that the  different advances avaialble to you are hard to differerntiate once youve  built them into your military unitsthese games are old and it really shows in the graphics and sound quality but in saying that the game play is still current
as with most of the sim games they have a mindless enjoyable quality about them
if you enjoy sim games then youve probably already played one or two of the games in the collection
the great things about these games are their replayability
you can play them again and again with each a game differing as you build your sim city island tower etc
of the collection i really didnt like sim copter or streets of sim city which are more like vehicle simulators than building simulators
i wouldnt even bother installing them  after all if your looking for a vehicle simulator you can certainly find something much better out therei gave these games  stars becouse they are fun for the whole family with  sim copter for the kids and sim tower for the adults this game is great  vaulue  year ago you would have to buy all these games seperate and each  one costing the same price so buy buy buy 
popkornthese games are a bargain but they are old
here are how i rated the gamessim cityit is ok it isnt really that great sim towerthe one game that makes buying this worth while sim islecant play it so sim safarivery babyish not really worth it streets of sim cityits ok all though it really has a low replay value sim copterchoppy graphics but the game itself is pretty good the great thing about everquest is the fact that you can comonicate with others and make partys
eq has a great amount of races and occupations that you can be and many contanents to exploreit also has an original attack system
so why only  stars
first of all this is an expansive game in which you pay a monthly fee
second by now the graphics are very last year
and finally many people call this the most addictive gamme ever i personally get very bord after playing for an hour
do not get me wrong this game is fun
but i just do not think it is worth the priceim not sure what i expected to get out of quoteverquestquot having heard some opinions from people who are much more hardcore gamers than i am but heres what i got out of itquoteverquestquot is not a regular computer game
you dont pop it into your computer go whack a certain number monsters on the head win and then deinstall it
those games are a lot of fun but once youve say killed diablo several times with different character types in quotdiablo iiquot youre not exactly rushing to do it the th time
not by any means
great game quotdiablo iiquot but a different sort of animal altogether
those that see quoteverquestquot as a big online quotquakequot game seem to get very frustrated with many aspects of the game including other players and the feeling is usually mutualthats because instead of quotdiabloquot quoteverquestquot is more akin to a huge themed chat room interwoven with a game
sure you can and do play by yourself sometime but you have to hunt far and wide across the game world of norrath to find a place where you wont be interacting with someone else
for the record you can find it go to the tox forest south of erudin and swim west from the docks
the kerra isle zone is almost always empty and its especially so inside if you choose not to hunt the native cat people but instead do the quests for them
the quiet is a nice change from the sometimes deafening roar that pervades most eq zones
in fact the game is designed to more or less force you to work with other players after getting your character selected from either sex multiple fantasy races and about as many fantasy herovillain careers up a few levels whacking the more mundane monsters and animals you pretty quickly run into a wall where it becomes much harder to go at it alone
jack may have been a giantkiller in the fairy tale but if you want to kill giants in eq youre going to need friends
and thats what makes eq a killer app interaction
you may think you arent interested in making a bunch of online friends but youll soon find yourself laughing with cursing with and adventuring with strangers from around the globe
i have no idea who some of the people i play with are beyond the vaguest details but it doesnt matter
i get to jump into this fantasy world and ive got brave friends who have my back as i have theirs ready and waitinghardcore gamers as i alluded to earlier will quibble about some of eqs technical specifications
first off ive had very few technical problems
i can almost always connect within  seconds have been kicked off line only twice in over six weeks of play and the dreaded quotlagquot where the game continues by the connection between server and home computer cant keep up has rarely been a problem
it occurs but its not very problematic and even the harshest eq critics acknowledge that its getting better all the timetheres also some talk that the graphics especially in the original section of eq the continents of antonica and faydwer and the island of odus arent up to par but i dont get the argument
setting the game at maximum resolution because ive got a late model computer the graphics are gorgeous and i havent even explored the prettier and more graphicsintensive continent of kunark yetfor fantasy fans eq strikes a good balance between the familiar and the new
many players want to play traditional elves and dwarves and those areas of faydwer are packed to the gills particularly the elvish areas of the faydark forest
you can help a sickly unicorn slay dragons play as a hobbitlike halfling and battle fierce orcs
or if you need another tolkeininspired fantasy game like you need a hole in the head you can be an erudite magician from faroff odus eq has included a fantasy race of color the erudites with a lightly africanthemed look to them and has made them the preeminent masters of all sorts of magic good and evil in the world of norrath exploring the deadly continent of kunark and battling the native lizard peoples the iksar there
the iksar are also a playable race for those looking for an extremely distinctive character type
theres more to this game than can be covered in this review  characters can develop skills beyond the ability to kill each other my gnome wizard is an accomplished linguist for instance meaning that ive had to sit down with more than a dozen playercontrolled characters of nongnomish descent and share language lessons  as eq is a rich deep surprisingly immersive gameeverything they say is true eq is addictive
and theres lots of good reasons why
a terrific game and my household has two copies one for me and one for my wifeeverquest the best mmrpg massive multiplayer role playing game on the  market at this time
first this game is addictive if you value anything  in your real life like relationships work school health or your  pets dont buy this game
it is extremely addictive and i say that from  experience
as for the actual game the graphics are wonderful not as good  as say quake  but better then any other online rpg out there
the game  play is good combat can get a little boring and monotonous if you let it
the interface is not very user friendly with a manual that is better  tossed in the garbage then read everquest is not a game for newbies
the  game is good but not perfect it has some serious balance issues  especially in the pvp player vs player department
and you will find your  self using the ignore command often with all the immature kids who play
if  you are looking for a real role playing game dont bother here
very few  people role play in everquest which overall degrades the experience
the  kunark expansion adds a new race iksar and a new continent to explore
the graphics have been improved on the new continent and realy add to the  game
all in all it is a good game and even better if you play it with  real life friendswe all got that one right its yet another highly addictive online game
thats the primer that everybody knows
the question that remains is why since there are many reasons not to be addicted to this gamei bought asherons call amp everquest the same day
i wanted to make a fair review on both of them as well as finding out which one was more fun to play
considering the amount of time we play on one online game we usually cant afford to play  of themwinnergaming experience everquestteam play everquestgraphics asherons callquests asherons callbottom line
well asherons call has a much better environment the graphics are nicer the software is more thought out  but everquest is winning my contest since i couldnt get out of it and still cant
why if ac looks nicer
the people
take  ppl eq vs  ac on average nights and its not even lagging
there is always newcomers and stronger people
the stronger people are always helping out the newbies either in healing ppl or giving them moneyitems
the grouping features are nice and i had fun every nights with new people all the timegoodbye nightsill start off by saying that if you havent yet played thief i then buy it and play it
buy thief ii after that
there are some spoilers in the sequel that you dont want to seeyou can tell that the designers listened closely to the feedback from the players of thief i  they made a lot of great improvements which are what make thief ii worth buying
remember the mosters and zombies from thief i
theyre gone
most of the missions in theif ii are humanoriented
remember those long and tediuos quotneedleinahaystackquot  missions
theyre gone too
the missions in thief ii are quite a bit more interesting they are shorter and they are easier to complete
plus each mission has one major goal that is something other than stealing
its up to you to decide how much you want to pillage
for instance in one mission your goal is to frame someone by planting evidence in his office that mission was a blast
the guards have more of those amusing conversations that you like to listen in on  the guards have me laughing out loud sometimes
garrett makes his little cynical comments more often
the maps are a hundred times better and easier to use no more getting lost
the graphics are slightly better and there are other little improvements as well like new toys for garretsome of the changes for thief ii were not so good
for one thing the designers may have taken out the zombies but they added in these absurd security cameras and patrolling robots
robots
garrett is using a bow and arrow but there are robots patrolling around
its just too silly to ignore
if you think it sounds lame then just wait until you actually see what they look like and sound like
in general the technology improvements for thief ii go so overboard that they take away from the game
the medieval setting was a great part about thief i but its not there in thief iimy biggest complain about thief ii would be the overall storyline
thief i simply had a brilliant storyline that was downright creepy and involving
i dont want to give away too much but thief ii has some plot twists that will have you saying quotcome on give me a breakquot  it totally lacks the overall feeling of gloom and suspense that was there for thief istill i have liked thief ii better than thief i  the flow of the levels must be the reason why
it took me months to complete thief i because i got tired of a lot of the long levels
i am almost done with thief ii in less than a couple weeksive never played a game that i didnt find more intense and involving than thief and thief ii
thief ii has a lot more story and many more tight spots that are difficult to get throughif you enjoy tense atmospheres this game gives you a feeling of being the hunter and the hunted at the same time
this game is extremely enjoyable but falls short of the first because of some of the later levels being a bit too hard
you cant beat it if you enjoy sneaking aroundi had waited eagerly for this game to be released unfortunately my computer at the time was barely the minimal specs and it ran like a slide show on it
only recently i have managed to upgrade my system and it is now quite playable
that being said it tends to require a fairly high end system to play well
a p  with  megs of ram will not handle it all that well even if you turn all the details off this is rather an annoyance since though the graphics are rather good they are not terribly great compared to other fps style games of the time
speaking of graphics one thing that though minor became quite an annoyance for me was the fact that when characters speak their lips do not move
almost any fps game released at the time of thief  had this feature and though minor it was sort of annoying though it can be overlooked with the games many better features
that being said lets take a look at some of the better features of this game
for starters it features the same style of gameplay as the original thief which might be a turnoff for those who are used to the runandgun type shooters in thief you are not a human tank you are just a normal person and a single gaurd is easily capable of killing you
rather the goal is to sneak around them or take them down from behind preferably silently as a death scream tends to alert others in the building
i did not find the plot as engaging as the first game but it is still quite enjoyable
there seems to be more of a focus on human opponents and whatnot in this game and this is a definite improvement imo as i found some of the originals monster filled levels to be annoying in the extreme
some of the objectives can be rather tedious and even repetitive but i still find it a thrill to crawl through the levels trying to steal as much gold equipment or other valuables as one possibly can
also there are some new twists on objectives one being a mission wherein you break into a police station at night to frame one of the officers by stealing something from the evidence vault and leaving it in his quarters and stealing a personal item from his office and dropping it in the evidence vault
to make matters more difficult you can knock out or kill only five gaurds on normal difficulty or two on hard difficulty or none on expert
kill or knock unconcious anymore than that and the mission is failed as they will then realize that someone must have framed him
though it is fun right out of the box you will definitely want to get the latest patch as it fixes many problems be warned those like me whom are limited to k it is a large patch approximately  megs but worth the download
though there are still some minor bugs it fixes the most glaring bugs and the ais stupidity level is far reduced with the patch
its a shame looking glass studios thief s developers went out of business shortly after making this game as ive no doubt there would have been further patches to correct the remaining problems
in any case it is still a very enjoyable game despite the problems and less than stellar graphics that ive mentionedthief  was one of my favorite games of all time
the premise of sneaking through the dark with nothing but your wits and a few paltry weapons guess what you aint the quake marine gets the ol blood pumping like nothing  else
however what were the good folks at looking glass yesit is  looking glass and not ion storm smoking when they decided on system  requirements
requiring a direct x  compatible video card is ludicrous
i dont know anyone who has a system that can run this game
that is  setting yourself up for disappointing sales guysthief   this game could have been genius
instead it just holds its own
i know that the original quotthief the dark projectquot was not running all the latest technology when it was released orignally
in fact the graphics engine was severely lacking as opposed to the other first person perspective games that were available at the same time ala quake   what made it a standout though was the incredible gameplay
the stealth element did a great deal to make the player feel that heshe was in the shoes of garett
thief  is fun but it doesnt offer enough in the way of innovations
in fact i think that the keyboardmouse control scheme in the first thief game were more intuitive
my second major complaint has to do with the enemies
the ai actually seemed to take a dive in this game compared to that of the first
this was not a problem with the human enemy characters but the metalic enemies are just plain dumb and annoying
i hate it when first person games have aliens and robots hunting me
they are much less scary than intelligent human ai
anyway the graphics are better run in higher resolution and with a better color pallet than quotthe dark projectquot but these improvements do not forgive the more mediocre gameplayin summation if you are looking for the best of this series get your hands on a copy of quotthief goldquot  it is quotthief the dark projectquot but it includes a few extra levels
if you have already played the first and loved it give quotthief quot a try but dont expect the sequel to impress you like the firstfor those who enjoy the mindless slaughter started by wolfenstein d enhanced by doom and perfected by quake this is not the game for you
for those seeking a more cerebral experience from a shooter this will be what you have been looking fora worthy followup to one of the most original games ever the metal age finds master thief garrett facing a formidable foe in the form of karas and the mechanists
the mechanists have bought their way into high society by providing high tech servants and security for the citys upper class
in addition karas the mechanist leader has labeled garrett as a threat to the mechanist religion and is working to see that he never draws another breathfirst of all if you had problems getting through the first thief the sequel is going to frustrate you to death
the main thing i found to be problematic was the fact that the mechanists have replaced a great deal of the torches with electric lights
this renders your water arrows nearly useless and makes concealing shadows few and far betweenoverall if you are looking for a thinking mans game with a hefty dose of challenge or if you were hooked on the first thief this is one game you shouldnt missthief ii the metal age by looking glass studios is a first person sneakerhere again you need to sneak arround undetected and solve the missions without killingthere are  very large story driven missionthe best thing about the thief games is that you could change difficultyyou can start the game in the easy difficulty and when you start the second mission it will ask you for the difficulty setting againthief had a great storyline but thief has a very silly story and quite a dissapointing endingthief s graphics are better than the first game and so is the sound recording but the ai needs some tweakingthe villans in thief are not as scary as thief onesome of them are very silly and noisywhat idiot would keep a giant robert which would shoot cannonballs at intruders inside their homesthe noise the robert makes expecially the small ones are very annoyingthey keep on talking nonsence all the timethe female gaurds are very noisy and annoying tooand the main villan in the game karras need a throat surgerythe  missions in thief are very large and very hard to complete but not impossible i have complteted the game in the expert hardest difficultysome of the mission objectives are very hard to solvein one level you cant kill anyonein another you can blackjack just  personsin another you need to sneak in and out of the mansion without killsblackjacks or even without the gaurds seeing youthe gameplay is very good but sometimes frustrating expecially the levels featuring the giant roberts like the quotbankquot and quotsabotagequotthere are not many shadows and the floor is either marble or metal very hard to move with out making soundsome missions are superb quotlife of the partyquot quottrial of bloodquot quotblackmailquot quotambushquot quotshipping and recivingquot quotframedquot ect can be replayed over and over againthief ii is a good sequal to thief but not as good as tdpthough it has some of the best thief missions like life of the partythief the dark project was like a medival horror game with ghosts and scary creaturesbut thief  has went far away from that story to sci frictionstill it is worthy of your money and i would give it  stars the thief games are one of the best out theretomb raider the lost artifact was one of the first tr games i played so of course the plot didnt make much sense to me
but even though it didnt make much sense i still loved playing it
the lost artifact has now that ive played all the other games an interesting plot good graphics and a good assortment of weapons
its a must have of course but i wouldnt recommend buying it unless youve played the other games or at least tr this version of tomb raider has excellent gameplay and takes lara to new and exciting places including the a world war ii relic submarine and the home of the loch ness monster
it is a great addition to the tomb raider series and i strongly recommend it to any tomb raider fanthis game however is only five levels and could actually be described as tomb raider iii gold
though the levels are fun it is frustrating to pay full price for only one third of a game
furthermore the game actually has the same weapons and features as tomb raider iii
i highly recommend it but it is a bit expensive for only a few levelsif you love the tomb raider series i highly recommend this game
however if you are wishing to sample the series i recommend another full version such as the original or tomb raider ii
dont get me wrong it certainly is fun especially when you are face to face with nessiethis game is just a fps  nothing more  i enjoy first person shooters  but this game is only for kiss fans and fans of the comic  i still recamend it  but it wont blow you away like the tom clancy games  or far crybased on todd mcfarlanes comic book series kiss psycho circus the nightmare child is an entertaining if uninspired first person shooter
there are better budget fps available serious sam for instance but the nightmare child will provide for a few hours of gibbingalthough the game engine is an older version of the lithtech engine it does provide for some colorful environments and the muchtouted quothordequot technology does allow for many enemies on screen at the same timegameplay is fairly simply  through four acts the player takes on the roles of four different quotkiss eldersquot the celestial the starbearer the demon the beast king in a standard shoot everything that moves environment
along the way the player picks up various pieces of kiss armor and weaponsstrangely enough the musical soundtrack does not feature any music by kisskiss fan or not the nightmare child is a fairly entertaining if mindless diversionmight and magic viii is a solid addition to this series
yes the engine is very dated but fans of this series will not be too put off by this
the new playable races in this installment are a nice touch although i would  say that with a dragon in your party you have a big advantage
this is  because its basic flame attack uses no spell points and does a lot of  damage
the dungeons in this game are not as huge as mm which in my  opinion is just fine
while mm was a superior game the dungeons did grow  tiresome
overall this was an enjoyable game worth the money it costs and  i would recommend it to any fan of this series as long as they can look  past the dated graphicsthis is my st high heat game and i have had it for only  days and i love  it
this game is great for someone who wants to be a manager and not  really play the game
i dont have a joystick so i havent been able to  play the game
but the gm mode and the minor leagues allow you to do all  of the things that a manager would do like manage rosters and develop  players in the minors
i had triple play  and it was terrible compared  to this gameid read all the reviews of high heat  and was expecting great things
ive not been disappointed
this is the best pc baseball game available
the graphics are good and the game play is great
hitting is a challenge as  it should be and feels good
when you knock the cover off of it you can  feel it
there is a wide range of stats tracked although i have noticed a  couple of errors in my season stats  my  batter has had more abs than  the lead off man which is impossible  
im guessing the stat errors i  see are from returning to a saved game
most likely there has been a patch  for this for a while but i will confess i havent looked as the game is  very sastifying quotas isquot
in spite of any beef i might have about  stat tracking or other very minor unmentioned flaws this game is head and  shoulders above the rest of the baseball games available and i would  recommend it to anybody who likes baseballfirst thing  rune isnt quake nor is it unreal tournament though it does use the unreal graphics engine and there are rd party mods coming out that allow some utlike modes of play
people who buy this game thinking theyre primarily going to be playing dm with their own viking will get quickly bored and be sorely disappointed by the monotony of the handtohand combat alone which is fairly repetitivewhat this game does provide is an interesting sort of cinematic experience
theres melee combat like heretic theres puzzle solving like tomb raider but rune isnt remotely like either game because of its feel
it feels flatout like youre a character in a movie about a young viking ascending from hel to midgard to avenge your fathers death
the puzzles all feel appropriate to the game and cinematic cutscenes flesh out the mood to some degree but what drives this excellent feel is the graphicshuman head and god have done beautiful things with the unreal engine and created underworld environments so hellish you smell the brimstone and icecaverns so cold your breath crystalizes in front of you
i played it to the end and please believe me when i say that the game isnt about combat but the sense of being in a story and in a place and as fantastic as some of these places are thats immensely entertainingafter i purchased a new pc in november  for gaming i was a bit disappointed for a few months
the computer was great and my old favorite games ran better on the new machine but the only new game i could find that i really like was unreal tournamentthen came rune
i tried the demo first and was pleased enough to buy the game
i certainly havent been disappointed with this gamelet me tell you the bad news first because there isnt much
rune has an excess of jumping puzzles
jumping puzzles can be fun and some of these puzzles in rune are engaging but it gets to the point that i say enoughok heres the good news
rune has perhaps the best graphics in any game ive played
in one of the levels the software renders a very convincing reflective floor
and the artwork is great
many of the levels take you into a rich fantasyland full of monsters dwarves huge buildings and steambelching machines
and despite what the critics have alleged rune has plenty of intense combat where your survival is rarely assured and the levels nicely compliment this combatif you like unreal youll probably like rune
if youre not convinced rune is a great game then download the demo
at any rate if you want my opinion rune is one cool game that i know ill be playing for years to comerune is an great third person action adventure game
you play ragnar a viking warrior bought back to life after he along with his father and many other warriors were killed by conrack
the god odin bought ragner back to life to kill conrack who worships the evil god loki and stop his evil plans
i played rune on the directd video mode and it runs very smooth
it is a very beautifull game the most beautifull single player adventure gameplay since unreal
the graphics are fantastic the texures are very detailed and they look real real looking rock textures reflective ice surfaces waters that ripples it is built on the unreal tournament engine
runes gameplay is very good it remindes me of heretic ii
it is a very long game with more than  large levels
the levels are not very hard to get through but very fun
the third person camera for the game is a very good choice and the view is flawless
the weapons are also very good all of them close combat weapons like swords mace axe ect they can be made very powerfull when charged with rune power
you could also pick up a severed limb or head of the enemy you defeated and fight using that as a weapon really cool
and to restore health your charecter eats lizards yuck
 leg of meat ect
the only flaw is that the game is quite linear even the end boss is not hard
besides that rune is a very good action adventure game
if you like rune get heretic ii even though it does not have great graphics compared to new games you will surely like itthe graphics the sound and the melee weaponry combined give this game all the fun and excitement one can hope for
im generally an fps gamer
this game has gotten me into the third person mode although with the turn of the mouse wheel you can be in first person mode
the graphics are outstanding
the sound incredible
if your looking for action look no further
give this game a try youll be glad you didhighly recommendedrune combines beautiful graphics hackandslash gameplay and an authentic narrative that draws on the rich roots of norse mythology
the god odin maintains peace and order in midgard while his nemesis loki the god of chaos seeks the opposite
the world of ragnarok is protected by runestones which also keep loki at bay
a viking conrack attempts to destroy the runestones to hasten the fall of ragnarok and free lokiragnar the appointed guardian of the village wotenkelds runestone has just become a member of the guardians or odinsblade
receiving word that conrack has struck again ragnar hastens on a longboat with his father to engage the enemy only to see his comrades and kin brutally struck down by magic
fortunately for ragnarok ragnar survives and you must guide him in his quest to thwart loki and save the worldrunes  levels contain a multitude of mythical enemies including goblins skeletons dwarves snakes fish crabs vikings and bosses
the encounters scale appropriately starting out small and becoming increasingly more difficult as the adventure progressesas a viking ragnar engages his foes with various weapons including axes swords and maces
there are five different types in each category ranging from the weak viking short sword to the powerful dwarf battle hammer
each weapon is empowered with a supernatural force when used in conjunction with one of the runestones and their powers depend on the number of powerups ragnar has acquired
using the stones drain rune power forcing you to replenish their power by picking up more stones along the waythe combat system is effective yet simple
battles are handled through a keyboardmouse combination with the left mouse button controlling your weapon strike and the right used for defense
theres more to rune than combat of course as ragnar faces a variety of puzzles from findtheswitch and jumping puzzles to manipulating complex machinery
perhaps the biggest challenge he faces is which path to take as there are enough dead ends and confusing passageways to frustrate some gamersrune makes excellent use of lighting effects in the game adding plenty of atmosphere and color to drab surroundings
but for all that the overall effect is still of a dark world even the outside environments
textures are beautifully sculpted in the caverns of hel through icy midgard and the dwarflands
the characters while a bit stereotypical are well detailed and animated and few awkward camera views are evident with cutscenes that help maintain continuitythe biggest drawback to the game however is the lack of staying power
after a slow but promising start and the paced introduction of increasingly difficult foes gameplay eventually bogs down as you slog your way through  levels
one can only explore and hack his or her way through so many tunnels and hallways of seemingly similar construction before tiring of the fight
also the number of different enemies seems disproportionate to the length of the game and the number of skeletons seems disproportionate to the number of enemiesthe simplicity of combat eventually works against continued interest as the long drawn out affair becomes tedious despite the combinations
scores and scores of skeletons roam the world and once the secret to slaying the bony nuisances is discovered its easy
other complaints include a rare but annoying glitch that causes the inventory to disappear and unintentional game killers caused by slaying something or someone you werent supposed to
in terms of length this is a good example of the designers going for length over qualitydespite good graphics and excellent sound rune falls short of its potential due to various flaws glitches and a lack of variation over the long haul
rune is a prime example of not being able to judge a game by its pretty exteriorthis is quite a good game however it might not be something you enjoyit plays kin of like tomb raider without the acrobatics so it is kind of limited and the enemies and puzzles are more tedious than exciting
who cares about jellyfish giant cockroaches and triffid plantsit is interesting however and beautifully displayed  the clouds are magnificent the scenery is great and you will be enveloped in a viking themeit is a bit disappointing to witness the christianification of norse mythology however i dont see why loki has to be made quotevilquot when he was mischieveous and was symbolically another face of odinnevertheless the game is quite good and enjoyable you do take on an air of fearless viking bravado the playing style is more suited to rushing in brandishing a sword than stepping backit is a shame they dont make a new episode with day  to day role playing behaviour things like going on raids joining in a war nonlethal brawling in a tavern and the enemy can be cold winters rival families other countries  if you added ranged weapons and a roleplaying storyline with multiple paths and a bit of empire building and some ai this could be one of the greatest games ever made
the atmosphere is that good  just add some good gaming to itso try it out if you are interested it certainly is fun
mostlyweve all seen the movies
from alien to predator  the average fan can usually recall and say verbatim just about any line from each movie
we each have our favorites toomine is aliens and avp borrows heavily from it and predator to establish its basic premise and its incredibly eerie atomosphereoh the atmosphere is perfecti dont think the designers could have made it any more frightening than it is
this is especially true if youre playing as a colonial marine
of the three species this will be the one youre liable to grab first
and why not
youre a human you understand guns how to shoot em and blow up stuff
the engine is superbthe graphics are outstandingto this day i cannot play this game at night
laugh if you must but between the quotbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepquot of the motion tracker detecting aliens you can hear but cannot see to the very accurate sound and fire pattern of the ma pulse rifleim not joking when i say its like being in the movie quotaliensquotthe predator portion is equally outstanding
every sound has been dutifully rendered into the game from the silver screen so that when you cloak and look in thermal view at some inept human walking down a corridor you really do feel allpowerful especially when you hit them with deadly accuracy with your shoulder cannon
every weapon is powerful and depending on which species youre fighting each will be more important than others at different timesthe alien has to be my least favorite species to play as
for one im not afraid to run around since i become the thing to be feared but then again damage is easily inflicted on you although your speed can help lower that a bit
the only other problem i have with the alien mission portion is basically summarized by pc gamers review of it when it said something like quotto accomplish your mission objectives like it was on a todo list on the alien queens clipboard feels somehow wrongquotmultiplayer is a blast but with only a limited selection of maps to play on and no means to make your own multiplayer levels youll grow weary on it after a while
cooperative missions are my least favoriteseveral marines basically try to hold off huge and endless waves of aliens that respawn regularlyad infinitum
itd be nice to have a scenario where a group of marines would have to go through a maze or complex to accomplish some mission that would have a definite end to it
but it usually ends up being  marines backed up into a corner firing at everything they seeoverall this is a fantastic game one that once you start playing you wont want to stop
except at night when youre all alonethis game has great graphics great gameplay and even stays true to the aliens movie
marines in this gold edition can now have twin pistols john woo style and even a skeeter launchera rocket launcher that shoots a wall rebounding disc this is a must buy for fans of the alien movies
with a sequel to this game labeled aliens vs predator  coming out soon its predecessor is still fun and entertaining for all gamersgameplay  graphics  sound  value  until you get into it
when i first started playing this game was so frustratingly impossible but when you get used to it it stops being impossible and starts being a challenge
this game definitely makes  wonderful use of all the source materiel giving us a wonderful  cinematicfeeling experience
now you can sympathize with what all those  people were feeling in the alien moviesthe alien is probably the  hardest to play as
granted it moves really fast and can walk on walls  but no ranged weapons and no medkit leave you exceptionally vulnerable to  the marines rapid fire weaponrythe marine levels are also extremely  difficult because as soon as an alien gets under your arc of fire youre  good as dead
fortunately you get a full range of fun weaponsbut the  easiest if least fun is the predator
exceptionally strong with  autoaiming vision sniper weapons and autorecharging ammo this guys  levels are at first a lot easier than the other twoeach of the  characters has his own linear campaign but these campaignes have nothing  to do with each other
the multiplayers lots of fun the sounds are  excellent the graphics are highres and run well even with all the  features on on a low end system
plus it takes less than  megs of hd  space and it doesnt require the cd
the music while not awardwinning  materiel is moody and the predator music recognizably borrows materiel  from his movie theme while the marine and alien music is similar to the  aliens action themesthe enemies arent incredibly diverse but theyre  tough and they look cool so that doesnt matter too much
and dont worry  about the difficulty levelthe gold edition comes with the strategy  guide
overall this is a very fun and addictive if very hard game to  add to your collection
recommendedaliens vs predator a game based from two different scifi movies is a great strategicalfirstperson shooter game that combines a great mixture of action terror suspense and gore
the game isnt simply between aliens and predators but also with the added human character to add a different side to the story and adding hopefully more depths and variety to the game
designed for intermediate to professional pc gamers the game isnt for those who are slow and clumsy bad of memory or heart or those not into games like thesehowever looking over the other side the game ai
needs much improvements human counterpart should be even out slightly more and more levels should be added
however for the cost and the date it was made its better than many games made to this present dayjust think about fighting an alien that instead of running straight at you will instead hit and run and use cover of the darkness and walls more
aliens in the movie tend to use team work as well
thats some improvements but i might be being a bit too pickyi havent played this in a few yearsbut a few days ago i deceided to put this in my pc and give it another shotman  i forgot what an awesome game this isaliens vs predatorthe gold edition  is a must have if your a fan of the alienspredator genre
the gameplay is smooth as ever on a pc mind you  and im basically a console gamer so that saying alotthe graphics are  greatthe game looks incredible for a early s pc game especially when your in a straight up firefight and your blowing away aliens left and rightthe body parts fly everywherelet alone the blood everything is detailed the sound is  also top notch  especially hearing the aliens screech its movie quality here folksyou can also play the predatoras well as  the alieninteresting concept  but my favorite is playing as a colonial marinebecause  you get all the toys from the filmsincluding the ass kicking pulse riflenuff said on thatthis game is a great fps shooterthat ranks up there with the real reason why anybody bought an atari jaguarthat awesome aliens vs predator game  if you havent played that game  think of this game as that version on steroidsim still surprised that people are still playing this one online toothis is one of those games  where you will get killed many many tims so get used to it
ok this isnt the kind of game where you can just breeze throughi dont know anybody that ever finished this gameits that hard
but in a good waybasically if you want to drop in  have a great time in a skirmish  blasting  aliensstalking your prey as the predatoror creep around as an alienthis is the game to pick upits not a must have game but look at the priceif you even remotely like firstperson shooters you should buy this game
its great to see such diversity in the species
each has very distinct advantages and disadvantages that make the game more enjoyableanother great deal is multiplayer online
all firstperson shooters are great online and add to the replay value of a gameits a good game but not perfect and the price makes it a must havealiens versus predator is an okay game
not the best
not the worst
if you love aliens like me buy it
if you love scifi buy it
if you love fps buy it
if you just like shooting things buy it
if you arent one of the four above i wouldnt buy itchu chu rocket is a great puzzle game to play with friends or by yourself i personally had a blast playing it with some friendsreally great gameto make this short and sweet this isnt the best game but it really is a fantastic game to play with friends or family and is a great dreamcast gamei also recommend sonic adventure and jet grind radio which are some really fun games toothis game gets a  cause i really enjoyed it
it was fun it didnt try to be hard or easy just pure funlatesfirst off i agree that this game is more strategy than role playing
you go into a battle screen where you advance your armies onto the map liberating towns and pushing back enemy units until you get to the main boss of the map beat him and you win that area
this is definitely just the abstract howeverif you like character customization you will literally fall head over heels for this game
you have units of characters in your total party  each consisting of  characters or  if you have a large monster in that particular unit
you can change their classes train them outside of regular battles level them up reequip them etc
also where you put the character changes what they do in battle
and it also changes the attack and defense of the entire unit
you can change everything about your characters and units that if you love having control of everything you wont be disappointedwhat may turn many away from this game however is the battling
the strategy is almost entirely how you make the formation of the battle unit
you dictate one of four strategies and they fight on their own
you can intervene and change the strategy in the battle but thats it
you can retreat from a battle too and then a little later in the game you can cast quotpedraquot spells on the enemy which are spells you get to use if you have taken a lot of damage in a particular battle
once each character has performed every action the winner is the side which dealt the most damage or of course the surviving side
theres more strategy than it seems however in that you need to push units around the map with each other and stopping in towns to restore each characters hp before they diethe story is a little cliche but it is still a good story
full of corruption deceit and backstabbing within lines
there are alternate paths and multiple endings too and even if there werent youd probably want to play the game again once you beat itthe n has been known for its childrenoriented games
parents beware  this game has some bad language and the scenes are full of all kinds of animated violence
im not a parent nor a young kid but i know there are plenty of parents who watch what their kids playfor rpgstarved n owners this is a great game to buy
its worth every centwhat an awkward name
person of lordly caliber
i dont know why it has that name but ogre battle is a good name
behind the subtitle is a very good game
it does suffer many flaws and may not be for everyone but makes all of that up with its depthyou begin your adventure as magnus a young warrior in the western division
in your party you have a friendrival dio a tactician hugo and the potential love interest leia
this game doesnt focus so much on character development as it does plot or gameplay
there are so many characters that you dont get to know all of them
the ones you get to know the most are those outside of your army
but since character development was not the main focus of the game i will not focus on thatthere is an extensive tutorial to teach you all of the games basics and then some
you start out with premade units consisting of soldiers archers and specialty characters
units are organized into threebythree squares that you can organize however you like
ideally archers go in the back and soldiers in the front
as you progress you can look for neutral characters to join your side
you can use these characters to create new units and the game provides plenty of soldiers to fill in any missing gaps your unit may have
units are fully customizable
since the game puts characters in bad positions in the units its often a good idea to place them in more strategic positions
each character performs a different action whether placed in front in the middle or in the back
these actions can range from the amount of attacks they unleash to changing their attack type from melee to magic
in each unit up to five small characters those that take up one space can be together
if you have one large character such as a dragon you can only have three small characters with it and only one small character with two large characters
this also adds to the strategynow for the actual combat
since this is also a simulated game you have limited control over your characters
this is where some gamers may be turned off
on the main battle field you set your units along certain paths to liberate strongholds and chase down enemy units
its up to you to keep an eye on each unit because fatigue can affect battles and the last thing you want is for an enemy to creep up on your sleeping party
once combat has begun you just sit back and watch
this can be rewarding when your party executes brilliantly but its frustrating when your party behaves stupidlydespite those flaws this is a very fun experience
its a lengthy game that can easily consume hundreds of hours of your life so youll be pretty busy for a month or two  a very memorable timeif you are thinking about buying this game one thing you need to consider above all else
ogre battle series is  strategy and  role playing
with that in mind here is my reviewsince this is a strategy game more than rp i gave it  stars for one reason alone
it is not as challenging as the first ogre battle march of the black queen
do not get me wrong it can be challenging at times and even frustrating at times but the st ob was much harder
example the bosses in this game are far easier
the first ob for the snes still stands out in my mind w bosses like the gemini twins diablo etcanother thing to consider if you are someone who has to have complete control during a fight than it is a good bet you will not enjoy this game
you are basically a general of a battilion giving orders and watching them carry out those orders
the best part of the game is designing your army
you can create a battle unit to emplore all your favorite classes eg
princess which provides extra attack lich for brute dark magic dragoon for sheer strength paladin for his holy attacks black knight for evil attacks etc
combine these characters to make an army you want
and you have plenty of choices i could waste a lot time just spewing all the characters in this game
you can pair up wizards to make spells combine for a different spell eg
earth and fire combine for lava shot and more damage
that is the attraction and the strategy partthe other attraction is the storyline which is better than the st ob
it is not the best storyline across all games but it is also modifable
sometimes a small decision you make costs the life of someone dear
there are  main endings to the game
there can be small differences in those endings depending on the storyline characters you recruit
this is what gives the game a replay value to try different routes in the game and see different endings and different story points and try for other storyline characters in my next game i am going for biske a werewolf bossthere are a lot of nuisances to this game
more than you can imagine
stuff like removing a character from a unit will lower the morale of the unit but you can not see the morale of a unit ie
hidden from you
so read the internet do not buy the prima strategy guide unless you really want it
it has some incorrect information and not enough of the good information
visit ob websites not prima guide
personal websites not business websites
i dont know if i can legally post mine here so i am not going to chance it
also read the manual and hugos report in the game
the game has a nice feature of letting you view past movies and good advice  take advantage of thatit is a great game but mostly for people who love strategy games like romance of the iii kingdoms and even rp gamers
i play all types action racing rpg strategy fighting but i will say this i enjoy strategy and rp games more than fighting got silly after the nd street fighter
someone who loves st person shooters and fighting games above all else may be irritated more than enthralled
then again i probably couldnt count all the hours i have wasted playing bond in the dorm roomsyour decision not mine but i provided my inputs make up your own mindloved this when it was new
bought it again for the memories
doesnt hold up well but being a ninja is always funi waited so long for a sequel of tenchu stealth assassins to come out and when it finally did i didnt hesitate to get it
this game in certain aspects proved to be superior to the first one
the story was much cooler and full of twists and the voice acting was much better too
also the peoples mouths moved when they spoke awesome
the graphics and cutscenes were better too
the people actually performed different actions like walking around and jumping super high in the air and performing other things that were absent in the first game like walking and fighting in the cutscenesi only have a couple of complaints the missions and enemies at times were extremely difficult and getting caught just once or twice could make you a novice in no time at all
in the first game you could get caught  times and still be given a ranking of a ninja
with all the negative things aside id like to focus one more positive getting the chance to play as the bad guy
the new ninja tatsumaru gets amnesia and becomes evil taking on missions for the villain lady kagami and even fighting his old allies azuma shiunsai rikimaru and ayame
this game being a prequel to the first one even shows how rikimaru got that scar he has on his eye tatsumaru slashes it with rikimarus own future sword izayoi when he had his guard down
tenchu  birth of the stealth assassins was a great yet challenging game
i cant wait till part  comes out for the playstation tenchu  birth of the stealth assassin  circa good easy and fun stealth gameplay nicetight controls custom mission mode make your own missionsbad really dated graphics stealth gameplay can be overly simple little replay value with not much to unlockwill it fit your taste the game is a prequel to tenchu stealth assassin but plays the exact same way ancient japanese samurai and swords theme ninja stealth gameplay more fun hack and slash then overly complex think more metal gear then splinter cell three playable characters two male and one femalegame its most assocated too tenchu stealth assassin metal gear solid siphon filteradditional notes even though this is the second tenchu game its the first tenchu game in terms of story the games custom mission mode comes with some built in custom missions from the japanese versionin my opinion this game was quite realistic with the backgrounds the characters and all the nasty killing
you begin in a training area where you learn all the techniques of a ninja
as you continue through each new level some of the bad guys change just like the story
there is a secret character that you can play as but youll need a code to get him tatsumaru
the little number at the bottomright hand side of the screen determines how close to an enemy you are
the higher the number the closer an enemy is
that system is easy to use and very dependable because then youll know where the enemy is instead of searching for them
sometimes it gets too dark and difficult to see but i guess that its supposed to be like that for the background
has some violence pretty neat graphics and coolthis game really wasnt all that bad
from the last it seems easy and short but as you get into it you find out that beating the game is a lot more difficult than you tought at firsti dont know while i liked the game the inability to customize your ships and the frequent crashes sort of ruined it for me
i mean i only paid money for it so overall im not to disappointed by i do wish wing commanderthe graphics sound and even if the flight controls fairly simplistic they work well
this game is great for serious spacesim jockies who want to have some quick fundespite what some other critics said this game is remarkably easy
the only mission that is really tough almost impossible is the very last mission
mission difficulty depends alot on what ship and weapons you pick during the presortie briefing
you can choose some ships with alot of armor and an quotautotargetingquot system which turns alot of missions into a turkeyshoot or you can pick moderately armored and armed fighters for an extra challengeenemy ships quotblows up real goodquot a few solid shots can take down the toughest opponent unlike wing commander prophecy
capitol ships blow up nicely as welllove this gamewould be awesome if they had a remake thoughif youre looking for revolutionary gameplay this is not the game for you however it does have an interesting story as well as good music by bowie with him as a character in the game
it came in on time and works perfectly
very interesting story and a good edition to the dreamcast collectionomikron is big adventure game set in an interesting futuristic society
you begin the game by inhabiting the body of a missing police officer and you must track down what has happened to you and your partneralthough the game has arcade elements and few combat sequences it is primarily a fairly simple rpg type game set in large partially interactive environment
a welcome change in omikron is its adult atmosphere
if you are tired of large headed anime characters with silly soundtracks then the more complex and identifiable characters in omikron will be more appealling
caution this game is not for kids  there are strip clubs sex shops and love scenessome of the cut scenes are long and can not be skipped which is an annoyance which probably generated an unfair amount of criticism
otherwise this is a solid rpgsword of the berserk continues the adventure of gutts
before i say anything i like to note that this is based on one of my favorite animes berserk
this game may not make much of sence unless you read the manga or watch the animethe story is in this is one of the best and it is also one of the best storylines in the berserk series
whats great about sword of the berserk is characters such as zodd and puck are in it which make this game really really cool
the ending credits is a little suprising too
if you loved the anime then youll love the gamethe graphics in sword of the berserk are just amazing
everything is detailed and well made
i especially love the way they made gutts look
and his dragon slayer looks better then ever
the level desighn is great as all the walls and trees ect are all greatly detailed
its one of the best looking dreamcast game out therethe gameplay is pretty good for about  mintues then it gets old but it never looses its touch
it is pretty frustrating later in the game but you will get the hang of it
the boss battles are laughably easy unless you battle zodd in hard mode which is a pain in the ass then that is a different storythe sound in this game is one reason i gave it a star
the sound and music is superb
very great and ranks up with the anime soundtrack
i especially love the forces mix song for this gamethe story in sword of the berserk is one of the best like i said before
you will love it especially if you love berserk such as myself
its just greatnow i have another complaint about this game
its a bit too short
you could beat the game less then  hours if you skip the cutscenes and everything
in other wordsprosgameplaygraphicsmusiccontrolconsway to shortgets frustratinggameplay gets kina boring later onboss battles are too easy except for zoddand that is why i rank one of my favorite animemanga into a video a game a out   still its a great game ruined by easy bosses lengh and other thingsby the way for anyone who has an imported ps there is a new berserk game for ps which is  times better then sword of the berserk which alot of you fans should check outlatessword of the beserk plays basically like final fight and golden axe from the  bit era
of course the game was released in  the times of sonic adventure and tomb raider
so eidos took the best beat em up elements from the aformentioned classics fast paced gameplay with lots of unique enemies to kick the crap out of and has created a storyline that certainly rivals hollywood cinema
the graphics are beautiful and the dark eery levels are challenging and as well as breathtaking
the game has some lengthy cinemas which thankfully are wonderful to watch
my only gripe is that there is no two player mode and the action becomes somewhat repetitive towards the end
its a shame there was no sequel to this game maybe in the futurealthough there are quite a few improvements from sonic  game gear the game also has its cons
whatever you do dont listen to the product information
you cant play player and you certainly cant play as tails
sonic has to rescue tails
i think the plot is very poor but thats probably because tails is my favorite sonic character other then metal sonic and omega and i think its absurd that tails would have to get rescued because eggman took him from his home
the genesis versions plot is much betterit has player battle and cooperation and tails makes a great first impression on sonic by helping him get to the death eggprossonic has a better color palette then in sonic  although he isnt his original cobalt blue hes still a brighter shade of blue other then sonic s faded sky blue shadethe locations are pretty fun and i dont think its a problem that they dont relate to the genesis version
it provides more of a variety and shows that sonic team is creative with sonics exploring groundsthe different activities riding in a mine cart hanggliding make the different locations stand out from the others and make them more unique especially how the activities relate to the locationsthe graphics have improved and they dont have the blurry feel there was in sonic  the scenery relates more to sonic rather than looking poorer than sonic himselfthe bosses are more challenging than sonic s easy to beat bosses ex eggman hovering around pointlessly
theyre also more creative like the bosses in sonic chaosconstails isnt playable so its kind of like an extension to sonic  just with a different plot
mostly its nothing newthe plot is exactly the same as sonic  just this time he saves the animals of westside island instead of south island and tails is thrown in theresome of the zones are fun and challenging while others are just long and hard
it depends mostly on how you look at themthe badniks dont have much of a new design and most of them are kind of boring
they just disappear in a cloud unlike how animalsseeds usually come out
some badniks have a special stragety for defeating them so thats okaythats all the proscons i have
overall i recommend it if you can get it for a price under 
just be warned thoughtails is not playablei used to play this when i was a child back in the daythen i sold my game gear big mistake
and now i have it backit was hard thenand is still hard now
probably the hardest sonic game ever
the main reason  no rings at the boss levels
sonic has only one chance to beat each boss or dies
on level i really hate in this game is scrambled egg zone act   i literally spent at least  times thanks to an abundance of extra lives trying to figure out how to get past that level
navigating the tubes of doom as i call them can be downright frustrating
so is searching for all the chaos emeralds and accessing the crystal egg zone
green hill zone act  is just as frustrating
its all about memorization and mapping out the levels layout in order to succeed
remember act  has no ringsi would only recommend sonic experts to play this game
good luck earning the real ending obtaining all six chaos emeralds
even im not that good
and ive been playing sonic since it first came out in this game is good for a game gear game and probally the best sonic game for the system
in most of the sonic game gear games you can either get the emerald and fight the boss with no ringsor go the normal way and fight the boss with  rings which made the games hard if you wanted to complete them this is a pretty easy game but it is fun
if you like fighting games dont get this
if you like cartoon games even though this has d grafics this game is great for you
i also like the multiplayer games
this is the best d game ever
you might want to bye yoshi story if you like this game
there are all new combos to fight know
all though i dont think this is worth very cute game
i love being able to turn into a refridgerator
favorite partbest kirby game
definitely a game needed for n loversfun times for those who played the snes kirby games and wanted to have friends play as well
could have been more exciting with more attack optionsthis game is one of the funnest games out there but the length and levels are what need improvement
the graphics and sound are slightly above average
what really makes this game fun is that you can now combine  kirby abilities to make one very powerful ability
the boss battles arent as good as some of the other kirby games but they are still fun overall
the level design is usually great but a few levels are boring
i rate this game i play this game with my  yearold cousin and he absolutely loves it he beat the first two levels completely by himself
he loves using kirby to swallow enemies amp mix powers to make cool attacks like power drill flaming arrow snowflakes boulders spikes fireworks etc and now he thinks hes a video game expert
i am  and even i have a lot of fun playing it even though its way too easy for me i would definitely recommend for young children
its perfect as a beginners game its cute cheerful nonviolent and the controls d pad and a  b buttons are easy enough for little kids to master by themselvesim and quotolder gamerquot and i still had a blast with this game
sure i played through it an afternoon and i cant almost get through the entire game without taking a hit but its just plain fun to play
the control dpad
yeah baby
is just a joy and it is fun to experiment with combining all the different powers i just recently discovered the remotecontrol dynamite
sure not all of the powers are needed or even useful but they are fun to fool around with
its also fairly tough to get a perfect  ranking as some of the crystals are tough to find so if you are an oldschool gamer dive right in
this is a great gamekirby is a great game but it was a bit too easy
the graphics are good on this game they are not exactly perfect dark but thats what we dont want we want a game thats okay in graphics and great in gameplay and thats whats delivered through kirby
the levels are plentyfull the appeal is for all ages and it is a game that you will go back to so i recommend making the investmentthis game was ok for me i played it i got all of the crystals in a week but this i think is for little kids like from  its a ok gamekirby  is the game which tells the story of everyones favorite cream puff
this is a classic for anyone below the age of  and a good game to get started with but if you are an older person the game isnt much of a challenge
this game is a classic sidescroller which is a welcome change
the entire point is to find all of the crystal shards but this is not a hard task
you can combine moves from enemys which represent war elements  fire rock ice sharp bomb and shot
this is the most observable change in the fantastic kirby formula
id reccommend this game as a rental for older people but you should definitely buy it if you are a beginner or if you want a game that you can just sit back and relax withok let me tell u now this game is awesome
i played it in a arcade and i got hooked and begged my parents to get me it off the netand trust me when i got it a year ago rite off amazon it was not cheap  bucks
anyway this game is alittle different from the arcade because you dont have a team with two people its just another guy that does a little attack every time u call them insome of u might say thats the best part and ur right but its still a great game get this game if u cansummery  ok there is no tag feature this is still a truly awsome gamealthough tagging was the whole point of the game but heck i love it besides their is cross over mode rightnot my mode of choice but its there right
it is a great game to play with the kids since their is absolutly no blood and they can actualy get away with smashing buttons even though i dont let anyone do it unless they bring thier own controllerno way i spend my own  bucks to get my controllers screwd up
it is a great way to show off your skillzi misspell alot of things for fun that doesnt mean i dont know how to spell cream your friends like corn and beat them like a drum
plus it is a great way to kill time whilst having alot of funim now going to go into a brief discription followed by a score from  to  on each part of the gamegameplay pretty good just a little slow down when more than  characters are on the screen at one time otherwize plays farely well not as good as the dc or arcade versionds but very close
graphics to me almost flawless with good anamation had it not been for variouse cut out frames
better than xmen vs street fighter and marvel super heroes vs street fighter but still nothing special
sound wonderfull
music is cool and voices match perfectly people say that mega man sounds like a girl from sailer moon or tenchi muyo but i think the voice is perfectly matched
overall translation to the psx almost arcade perfected had it not have been for no tagging abbilities bad graphics slowdown and long loading time but please realise that the sony playstation has limited capabilaty due to the mb of ram that it has if it had  or  it might have been able to have tekken tag on ithey it was worth a try rightthe only thing that bugs me is the insane loading time and the slowdown when their are more than  characters on the screen but they are not too noticeable not much to care about at all
all in all having twentytwo characters and having an  out of  arcade perfect translationgetting pretty technical now
haha their are only  things for me to say this game rules and it is fun to play with a fun factor of  out of  marvel vs capcom clash of super heroes is alright if you dont have a dreamcast but if you do dont bother with the psx version and see my dc review for a  rating
if not get the psxversion take my word for it i have the psx version and i love itthis game was a step up from sf
it has more interesting puzzles to solve like disarming bombs on a guarded bridge and i have to say killing the last badguy was a puzzle in itself etc
i managed to beat this game in under  hours though and although this is a sweet game and by all means i would recommend picking up a copy it still has some of problems of sf and a few new ones
i am gettin sick of picking up really cool weapons to lose them repeadly when i change levels
the game is challenging enough without having to constantly have to worry about having to find new gear
they took away the silencer for the mm
you dont seem to get a silencer until quite a ways later in the game
this makes certain areas more frustrating cause you have to use your knife which is kinda cool but making sure your character is facin exactly the right way and is close enough is kind of a pain the cool longdistance taser has been traded in for a handheld
which is just like using the knife you gotta be real close without being seen
you do get the other taser towards the end of the gamestill this is a cool game and its storyline seems more indepth this time this game has  discs
the enemy intelligence has risen substantially
they go for headshots and the snipers are extremely good at their jobs
you can get killed real fast in this one
also by the time you finish this game youll to have wiped out the equivilant of a small nation
the replay value is high and there are secret weapons and gear hidden all over the place
id say pick this one up they are releasing sf next month in ps format so youre going to wanna be up on the story for the next roundthis items comes in mint condition two discs in its original casing and as fun as any old playstation game that takes you back to awesome timesthis game is actually fun to play and the storyline is so great that they should make a movie out of this gamethe game could get really frustrating specially when you play lian xing but once you have played through couple of stages you will get use to the sneking around and killing and i would recommend you to get a stradegy guide it makes the game lot less frustrating after you play through a couple of stages you would not want to put your controller down because you would want to find out what happens next if just they made the game a little less frustrating this would have been better than any action adventure gamesoundthe sound of this game is awesome from the background music to the voice acting its great like when your trying to kill an enemy without letting him see you there is a slow paced music when you missed him and he saw you the music turn into fast pacedgameplaygameply is great the auto targeting really helps but could have more accurategraphicsgraphics are mediacore could have been betterthis game is really great except for the few glitches but if you start getting into the game it is more fun and there is also a multiplayer mode and you could unlock area in multiplayer mode by finding items in one player modeit would be a lot easier for you if you could get the first syphon filter so you would know more about the story and it is lot easier than the second oneif you liked the original syphon filter which i did i recommend buying syphon filter   this game plays exactly like the first one and as a bonus includes a few new weapons and a few more levels than syphon filter contained
the bad thing about syphon filter  is that it lacks any innovation since the first one and syphon filter  also seems to be a little bit easier than part one
still all in all this is a great action packed title that should be playedfront mission three is a turned based battlefield rpg
the graphics are amazing considering there ps and the story is very deep with several twists and betrayals
the online section has some interesting qualities but i found the email system rather useless if you read the text between battles anything you get off the net was just reapplying the same message
though you can get a rather powerful wanzer late in the game through email and web addresses
i enjoyed this game kinda a xenogears meets vandal hearts mix
i would highly reccomend this game to any rpg fan or those who are into giant missle firing robots
thanksim about halfway through meaning ive spent about  hrs so far and i really must hand it to square this is a great game
the cinematic battles the mech upgrades and having money in the game really make this challenging and fun
any game that gives you the freedom to spend money and configure things is on the right track in my bookmy only criticism would be that they are trying to be an rpg
oh and this isnt an rpg in my book
they have some rpg trappings around all around in fact all over the dang place
theres a lot of talking heads talknig and sometimes that seems to eat up your time when really all i want to do is check the shop for new upgrades and then get out to mech killingi with agetec would make something like armored core tactics or something
there should be more turn based combat games that arent in a fantasy settingthis game is great yes it has two count em two great plots with over  missions
it it great game
you go around the battle maps with giant mechs called wanzers
they have different weapons and you can make your own
there is also a huge internet and email system which is very fun
but the game can get some what boring after a while
buy this game but buy final fantasy tatics firstif you hate complicated games  dont have alot of time to play  games dont waste your money and stick with resident evil  but if you can undestand these types of games and have time to play games waste your money and get this game
i dont  have trouble with complicated games like fm ff etc
so i have no complants in that department the only problem  i have is the graphis thair not bad but thair choppy like this one part i have many examples where thair is a railway and it is all jaggiety like a train can ride on a bent up railroad
that is my only complaint
if you like  gundam wing shows like big robotswanzershave lots of patients and lots of time get this gamethis title is the first world release of the great front mission series of games from square before its squareenix mergerif you enjoyed final fantasy tactics this is the next best thing in the genre of turn based scifi strategy from square during the playstations reignthis is a game that is very hard on missions so it is almost impossible to beat
the graphics r bad compared to the rest of the series but they r still good for the ps
the color is also kind of messed up for some reason
this is a very fun game on multiplayer that is the only reason that i played it
it is my favorite one on multiplayer too so i played it all of the time
i would tell more but it has been a long time since i have played itthis is a great game
there are eleven games including two characters that can only be unlocked by completing the story mode in the medium and  hard difficulties
there are many moves including  special moves for each  character
there are a bunch of modes including training to learn moves  battle mode which is a take on the pokemon battle system story mode which  if completed gives you a cutscene with dialogue after beating the hard mode  with a character and versus mode which allows you to link to someone else  to battle them
the only reason that this game is  stars is that it is  very similar to street fighter except there are tights and leotards
all  in all a fun and good game to buyloved the story line and the gamenot that concerned with graphicsi would recommend this to anyone who likes rpgslots of stress busting comedy in story linefinal boss kicked my butt which i was not expectinghad to level up moremight not be appropriate for younger peoplesome mature comedy in the dialoguei bet you get sick of seeing the word frustrating or frustrated in my reviews
im sorry but thats the way most of the games i run into are
the game has silkysmooth graphix and rockyrough animation meaning the characters and areas are beautiful but the the moving sprites seem to use only two frames of animation per task running to an enemy and then whacking it are  different tasks
thankfully the fullmotionvideo cutscenes are done well considering that theyre animestylethe gameplay is great most of the time but you guessed it gets excruciatingly difficult at innapropriate times
try fighting your very first enemy and youll probably see what i meanthe storyline is set approximately  years after the first game give or take a few months and your center of control is a slightlylessannoyingthanalex little brat who goes by the name of hiro
the bluehaired girl in the maroon cloak and baret is lucia an alien sorcoress you have no control over even in battle mode
the pink catlike creature who will try to tear your face off if you call her a cat to her face is ruby a baby dragon with a smartmouth whom youll either learn to love or hate throughout the game
the good news is that ruby is more helpful than nall alexs pet dragon from the first game because ruby actually attacks enemies whereas nall only healed fallen allies randomly
the story itself revolves around hiro trying to help luna who suffered from amnesia find her true self while investigating strange activities by the goddess althenahardcore fans of lunar the silver star story will be happy to know that there will be at least two returning characters three if you count althena herself but alas i cannot tell you who they are or my review may not be approved by the amazon staff
besides why should i spoil the surprisei really wanted to be objective with this game and not constantly compare it to the original
unfortunately playing through lunar  will give you a major sense of deacutejagrave vu which is why i feel its only right to compare and contrast it to the first lunar
ill try to keep this as objective as possible and judge this game on its own merits while still adding in some comments about the first game
on to the reviewgraphics score  lunar  looks good for an older rpg although still datedlooking and the anime cutscenes really make the game feel like a newer rpg despite the ingame use of d character sprites
just to note the graphics in lunar  are on  about the same level as the first lunarmusic score  the music is decent
its not really memorable or anything but it fits the areasscenes fairly well and doesnt grate on the ears
the voice acting during cutscenes is mostly great but a few voices irritate me
in particular the voice of a certain villain really sounds weird to me for some reason
rubys voice is annoying too but thankfully you dont hear her speak muchcharacters score  the characters are likeable enough but they really do remind you of the people from the first lunar
its just that the same personality types seen in the first game seem to pop up again the rude guy who likes to drink and gamble the stuckup member of the magic guild the sweet innocent bluehaired girl the hero who loves adventures the flying pet cat etc
even though they are all a little too familiar they are still likeable characters
i also have to commend lunar  for breaking with rpg stereotypes and actually making ronfar have the healing magic instead of some softspoken female mage and hes got a decent attack to bootproving you can be a healer and a fighter
i also like the fact that jean is a female warrior with strong attack power since i get so sick of the female party members in rpgs always being healers or magic users with weak attacks
the only negative point to the characters is that hiro your main character seems to have lack of personality
overall though the characters are goodstory score  this games storyline will remind you a lot of the first lunars
you started out the first lunar as a boy who loves adventuring and is currently exploring some caves with his flying pet cat that he doesnt have permission to be in
you start off lunar  as a boy who loves adventuring and who is currently exploring some ruins with his flying pet cat that he doesnt have permission to be in
sounds familiar yes
in fact the whole storyline of lunar  while being unique still feels very familiar
part of this is due to the fact that this game is a direct sequel to the first one
it doesnt have the same characters obviously but it is set in the same world but several hundred years in the future
it was interesting to see the changes that took place since the original storyline but while this makes it feel nostalgic it also unfortunately lends itself to a lot of beenthere donethat kind of feelings
aside from all that though the actual story itself isnt the most exciting
i actually forgot why i was journeying to certain places at times
thankfully the characters witty dialogue keeps you entertainedbattle system score  battle system used the usual turnbased style
theres an attack command magicskills command item command etc
range of movement also plays a role since you can move in battle and must physically move to an enemy to land a blow
overall the battle system is good
i only have one complaint and thats lucia
she is the only ai
controlled character and her ai
is incredibly stupid
she never attacks properly never heals when its convenient and occasionally just moves around the battle screen for no reason
in fact many of my battle strategies consist of using lucia as bait for the bosss attacks by placing her in front of the other characters
thats really all shes good forgameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
the gameplay doesnt have any huge problems
the menus are much improved from the first lunar where you had a separate inventory for each character
now all the items are shared via the menu like they should be
there is one step back from the previous game though
in the first lunar enemies appeared onscreen and you could run from them if you tried hard enough
now though you move like molasses in dungeons but run at normal speed in towns
you can dash for a very short amount of time in dungeons but thats it
i can only surmise that this was done so that running from enemies is more challenging but it really is quite annoying especially when you have to back track
oh well other than the thing i mentioned i really dont have any complaintsoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
lunar  is a decent game
its worth having in your collection but how much one would be willing to pay for this game would vary from person to person i imagine
its quite rare and expensive now and i personally dont think its worth more than 
one thing that adds value though is the inclusion of a makingof disc
ive often wished games came with bonusmakingof discs the way that movies do so the inclusion of this disc in lunar  is a nice touch
ultimately if you have the money and are looking for a good older rpg i would recommend you pick up lunar the lunar series was a massive hit on the long deceased sega cd console
perhaps due to scarce to none hit titlesevery sega cd owner had at least a copy of silver star story and eternal blue respectively
and talking about outdated graphicsthe series was revolutionary with introduction of movie cutscenesanime style and cutting edge d graphicslike ff vi on the snes console
the sequel to sss wasnt as massive as its predecessorwhich sold even more than the sega cd console itselfyetit managed to continue the same intriguing storylineeyecandy anime scenes and lighthearted humorthere are reasons why eb is intresting to play as its blockbuster rivalsthe ff series
the storylinealthough the same ol savethyworldfromanevilentityandgatheringcompanionsalongwayit is a refreshing change from complicating and sometimesnonsensical plot twists in rpgs like ff vii
hirocorkinqueer namethe games lead protagonist stumbled upon a princess from a neighboring planetthe blue starwhile investigating a dragon tower
he offered to help luciathe princessto search for a goddess in his world simply because he was smitten by her beauty
the characters in the gamealthough they have their share of dark paststhey were straightforwardand the game designers chose not to waste too much time elaborating in details
furthermorethe dialogue itself is fun to readas it is excellently translated and managed to retain the games animestyle humorminus the voice acting of coursenowin the graphics departmenteb is a more colorful and a little elaborate bit type d game
the game doesnt have the detailed beauty of legend of manasmooth running valkyrie profile or even stunning lightning effects of ff tactics
howeverthe anime scenes are beautifully designedthe characters have smoothslender figuresespecially girlshehe and the d modelseg shipsbuildingsis surprisingly detailed with loads of curvesshapes and smooth textures
soundwiseyoull expect animestyle music if you expect animestyle graphicsbut the sad thing isthe variety of music is too little and often repetitivefinallyeb has its share of flawsdespite the games disc capacityyoull manage to beat the game in hours durationdue to enormous storage of anime scenes
and gamers might be advised to spend some couple of hours levelling up because the enemies and bosses are toughplus spells are only obtainable by levelling upyoull need to be at least level  to gain powerful spells
special items and rare ones are needed to beat the game without much hassleso explore every nook and cranny of every town and dungeons you stumble upon
additionallyyoull encounter mother of all eb flawshours and hours of dungeon crawling
youll be visiting new townschitchatand dungeon crawlingalbeitrepeat
later onafter tedious dungeon crawlingyoull rest for a few minuteseganime scene or an event unveilingand laterto your uttermost frustrationback to dungeon crawling
the repetition might incur migraineshigh blood pressure and even busted consolesdiscs and controllers
otherwiseif youre running out of rpgs and preparing to compromise cookiecutter d graphicshype andbe patientgrap this one and have a nice daypros eye candy fmv scenes excellent translation and lighthearted dialogue cool gaming package cool secretsfind out yourselfconsloads of dungeon crawling repetitive music ingame graphics might not appeal mainstream gamers nudity found in anime scenes in strictly not for under  gamersthe story of eternal blue is pure classic
its the simple story of a brash adventurer who falls for an enigmatic girl with a mission
quite simple but monolithic nonetheless
unlike many current rpgs the simple charm of the love story is not buried under reams of dross
yes an epic adventure unfolds but eternal blue never loses sight of its greatest strengths its characters simple romance and a sense of lighthearted adventure
working designs knows what they are doing their script is witty and proficient underscoring unique personalities and heightening the emotional impact of any given scene
the villains are more interesting this time around the plot hardly ever runs off track and theres a few plot twists youll never expectfor those who didnt experience this wonderful story in the sega cd days you owe it to yourself to play it through
it ranks among the greatest stories ever and in many ways is surpasses the original telling which had too much humor for its own goodthe graphics are very bit so the game lacks graphical titillation
the fmv is gorgeous though
the gameplay likewise is archaic and actually a step down from the sega cd original
the magic system which was one of the greatest merits of the original has been simplified to the point of mindlessness which is ridiculous and dumb
actually the gameplay seems more tiring than i remembered the dungeons being particularly exhausting
the game is a little tougher though which creates a sense of urgency not often associated with many rpgs these dayswhile the gameplay hasnt aged well the story is as timeless as they come and that makes the game worth playingall the extras are a nice treat as well
i personally found the quotmaking of lunar quot cd very interesting and while i have no use for the amulet or the character standees they are nice bonuses
the map is a nifty keepsake and the full soundtrack is great
i dont listen to the soundtrack because i dont really enjoy the lunar music outside the context of the game but i appreciate the gesture and there are still several good tunes included leminas theme is fookin catchy
hopefully other publishers will include soundtracks with their games in the futuregauntlet legends is yet another game for the dreamcast that proves a lot of fun for a while but ends up growing boring after a whiledont get  me wrong because its a highly entertaining game for a while and a  wonderful example of how to do a party game
i played it at a friends  house and even the people who were least into video games who never played  them except for this instance had lots of funalso if youre expecting  anything approaching an rpg this really isnt the game for you
i  personally have a background of mudding on hacknslash circlemuds and so  i found the game format very natural but people who are looking for more  storyline elements and character development are going to be disappointed  as in the end this game is about killing monsters and getting gold
there  are some okay puzzle elements to the game but the system is fairly  limitedone other tangential point to this game is that it has a very  good soundtrack
as the levels get higher the music gets better
in  particular the music for the secret level mausoleum at the end of the  castle treasury level is stellarin short this is game provides for a  lot of fun and can be fun for quite a while if youre looking for a  mindless timewaster which certainly has its place but for actually  wanting challenges and real goals the game ends up falling off a bit too  soon
if you have friends to play with you i highly recommend buying it  but otherwise id try it out firstmost americanmade games that are released for a console system are low budget uninspired trash
midway has been responsible for quite a few horrible games in the past but this is not the case with gauntlet legends
for those unfamiliar with gauntlet its a multiplayer romp through dungeons and caves with a medievil theme
the gameplay is rather simple as you only really have a few attacks for each character
this makes extended one player sessions kind of tedious and boring but its the multiplayer mode which brings out the real fun in this game
in addition to containing everything from the arcade version midway has added a few new levels from the arcade update gauntlet dark legacy
you even have more characters to choose from which is always a welcome feature
the music is nicely composed and fits the mood of the game well
the only obvious flaw with gauntlet legends is the choppy frame rate when the action gets intense
theres also some noticable frame rate problems during the cinemas
even though theres a couple of rough spots gauntlet legends is absolutely one of the best actionroleplaying games to come out in a long timeive only tried it with one game and that doesnt work but it could just be that particular game
at least the dreamcast detects it so it worksworks greatbetter than the ps version thats for sure
the only problem is you cant hack your own codes
interact better get with the st centry
because they are really going down hillthe concept of a game in which the protagonist is a professional killer hired to assassinate targets is to my knowledge a new idea
the missions which followed this concept were very fun
however there are only a few missions like that
many other missions are far too long for a game without a save feature
many missions are just stupid such as the ones in the jungle and when you have to deactivate a nuclear weapon why does every game have you defusing a nuke nowadays
i would have given this game  stars if all the missions were assassinationsthe excellent physics engine and graphics were very impressive
the ai was pretty good as well
the plot of the game was poor at bestone thing to be aware of is that you need a high end computer to run this game without major bugs
i originally installed it on a  mhz system where it frequently crashed
however when i put it on my  ghz it ran smoothly and without errorsthis is most definetely a great game
it nails originality and the graphics are very good for when the game was released
however if fans of hitman  are going to backtrack they will run into some problems
the sequel on ps allowed you to switch between first and trirdperson perpectives this one is all third person
because of that camera problems do arise
second of all hitman  was on  major consoles so it reached out to a different audience
those who prefer console gaming or are used to playing hitman on ps will notice that a keyboard and mouse does not help the controls but actually hurts them
it is a great game but you will probably enjoy it more if you havent been spoiled by hitman first and foremost this is definitely a game you should consider buying as it is one of the most powerful contributions to the trend of taking fpss into the realm of requiring gasp thought on the part of the player
theres less emphasis on the adventureroleplaying aspects that we saw in deus ex and not so much plodding strategy planning as in rainbow sixrogue spear
instead you take the role of a solitary character with the solitary task of infiltrating the compounds of various villians and quotneutralizingquot themwhat this means for gameplay is quick and easy briefings where your primary task is that of gleaning what sort of weaponry and equipment youll need to take with you as opposed to planning insertion points and extraction plansthese are tasks easily done during the middle of the mission itself if you actually feel the need
you get right into the action which is nice
unfortunately short briefings also mean little in the way of helpful intelligence such as estimates and locations of enemy troops and patrols likely sniper positions and suggested approaches
instead you just go into the mission expecting to die several times while you scout around and learn the landscapehere are the pluses good ai great graphics nice variety of weaponry easy command interface and immersive soundthe minuses combat is either incredibly easy or ridiculously difficult not enough weaponry command interface is initially cumbersomethe details like i said the ai is very solid
there was only one mission where i was able to pick off a lot of the enemy as they ran up to keep investigating the ever growing pile of dead bodies
otherwise theyre able to track you down when they realize where youre hiding and easily navigate obstacles to reach and kill you
unfortunately you can also be standing right on top of a huge massacre with a silenced pistol in your hands and the guards will keep running up onebyone to investigate
theyll first stare at the slaughter in a befuddled manner then look at you in confusion then pull their gun and start shootingby which time you could have emptied five full clips of a m into them
there are only a few instances where this flaw can actually work to your advantage and the missions are difficult enough that its a darned good thing but its still a significant flawthe graphics and the sound are equally excellent
theres a lot of detail put into both creating for rich textures and nerverattling environments as you can hear the footsteps of guards rattling on the catwalks while you garrote a sentry praying nobody notices
unfortunately the music can mask necessary auditory alerts such as approaching footsteps and i had to turn it way downthe list of weaponry is expansive enough to satisfy any personal preferences the player might have while mission parameters are varied enough to require the player to experiment with new methods of threat elimination
still it would have been nice for a few more weapons and mods like laser sights and scopes for the assault riflesi guess grenade launchers arent in style of assassins
also some sort of rappelling and climbing mechanisms would have been nice adding a vertical component too many shooters miss out onfinally it should be stressed that this is not a combat game
if youre looking for the next doom youll be sorely disappointed
because combat can explode so quickly its easy to think youre playing halflife but if it does it means you screwed up and youre about to die
the combat is that brutal
you might be able to take two or even three enemies at once but thats if youre lucky and have enough range between you that they dont pop you off with a head shot armor wont protect you then
instead youve got to take them out onebyone playing the role of assassin gradually eliminating sentries and patrols as you move closer to the target moving bodies out of sight before theyre noticed and all of hell descends upon your bald little head
though this sounds like a negative point im actually quite pleased to see the gameplay function in this manner
you are supposed to be an assassin not rambothis is a very solid production of io interactive and eidos
the missions are engrossing and the challenge to the player is a welcome gauntlet to have had laid down
the gameplay is smooth and engrossing with spectacular graphics and sound in which the player is immersed
there are a number of small improvements that would have turned what is already a great game into truly gameoftheyear territory like more complete mission briefings better ai fuller incorporation of disguises etc which is why i didnt feel comfortable giving the game a full stars but its ohsoclose and definitely worth your attentionone of the best stealth oriented games ever created
they incorporate missions in which you can choose stealth or straight violence
filled with real weapons all kinds of ways to kill people
one of the best stress relievers ever
i highly recommend playing this before the sequels so you can appreciate them more
the whole series is amazing
only reason i docked a star on the overall rating was that it was rd person only whereas the sequels all let you choose st or rd
i much rather prefer st for a game of this typethis game is amazing
the graphics are very well done and the animations are very realistic thanks to the actual recordings of the movements
the enemies fall very realisticly when shot at although it could get pretty annoying to have to shoot about  shots until one is deadthe audio is nothing amazing nothing bad about itthe gameplay is very short
the story is overdone
the slow motion button activates alot more fun the enemies fall back farther and it gives it that matrixstyle look to it
throughout this game you have to rely on many stealth tactics in order to survive entering a room blazing with pistols wont get you far in this one
sometimes you have to change clothes and kill silently with knives and such to get past it all
also because of this there are many ways to complete every mission adds to the replayif you want some quick action with stealth involved get this game
although it may be hard to learn it is all worth itthis is a great game
this is a first personrd person strategic type game
basically you are a hitman hired to perform different assasinations using various tools of death ranging from piano wire strangle your victimssniper rifles aks and berettas with silencers
million ways to die choose one
this is not a typical shoot em up try shooting in a room filled with triad mobsters and youll be swiss cheese
you have to use stealth and disguise you can take clothes off of your victims and wear them to sneak in to get close enough to your target to eliminate him and collect your cash
the ai is pretty good if you shoot someone the guards or passerbys will hear the shots and be alarmed if you kill someone in broad day light witnesses will alarm the guards if you leave dead bodies in the street your cover will be blown
unfortunately i am one of the gamers that gets nauseated with first person games but the whole concept graphics plot layout of this game keep me on the computer to the edge of tears and vomit its that addicting
bottom line challenging great graphics and game play sounds are realistic ai is smart
go and grab this title for your pc you wont be dissapointed
warning to youngsters extremely graphic and violent content so let your parents know so they dont trip when they see you cutting peoples throats in the game
gamer is out
game oni played this game after i played hitman silent assassin
i enjoyed the basic style of codename  more than silent assassin because there was more of a reason to do well on missions  money
introduce money and items to purchase to a game and it give much more incentive to do well
graphically this is a little inferior to silent assassin
gameplay is about the same other than the few differences related to the money
im sure there are some differences in how the ai is alerted and how they react and things like that but they seem closely related in terms of gameplay
i only wish there was a room to display all the guns ive purchased like in silent assassinbut the game is great
i makes you think but not too hard
usually the various methods of killing your target are pretty easy to discover
it is normally pretty easy to discover your first disguise at least
at times the interface would not allow me to perform actions i should have been able to do such as poison a dish of food
planting a bomb on a car was also a little tricky though i eventually got it donethe story is a bit odd and had i not played silent assassin first i may have been even more confused
of course i was confused a bit in silent assassin for those same reasons
the stories in all of the hitman games are a little weak
silent assassin seemed to be the best though it still made little sense to mesome of the maps in codename  are really nicely made
specifically the hotel
i also enjoyed the jungle and thought they did a great job of making a single stage map appear to be so open while still restricting you to the required areaall in all this is a well made game that can be slightly frustrating but should allow for a good deal of fungraphics  physics   not much to them but decentgameplay  artifical intelligence  replay potential   you may see if you can do the missions bettermaps  detail   not too many details but enough to make it workstory   at bestinterface  pretty easy but can be quirkytotal  
not too bad for an older gamethe seller was analog and i paid  bucks for the game used
its a classic
it reminds me of the bourne identity movie
the game graphics are decent the sounds are well done the controls are fine and an interesting story unfolds
the latest patch is  also known as sp
it runs fine on my pc with windows xp home sp
its the kind of game that i would replay in the futurevisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsthis game has a simply cool premise that needed some more game design than it got
the only real faw is that the missions are very hard with out more information at hand before you luanch the mission
the map you are given is only a over head view with nothing important marked
you would think an assasin would look over the area before jumping in
as such the only way you will learn is by replaying the missions a lot
with out ingame saves this get old fast the fun goes down the toiletbut the game does offer some good graphics and an interesting story
the guns are well done and the ai is good enough
this is a must have if you like thinking shooters but if you do not have the time or patients
you get to do a lot of cool stuff like car bombs and sneeking around dressed as a enemy
this alone is fun and almost makes up for the lack of information you need to pull it off in a few triesfor years gamers have been crying out for a game which forces you to think rather than shoot first
hitman has attempted to answer the prayer
you play as  a hitman who has noidea who he is
your job is simple kill the targets and get out with little fusssimplewell no it isnt because you never know what to expect
your job takes you to distant places like the rotterdam japan and romania
plus you have to make sure there are no witnesses to the crime
then you have to get out and oh mythis game has many a path through it
sure you can simply shoot anything that moves but wheres the fun in that
the idea of the game is to use stealth
to help you you can change your clothes and blend in with the crowd just make sure you hide the body afterwards because if a guard finds it then your in troubleif you start acting suspicously ie if you steal a key in the view of someone then the guards will be notified ad they will hunt for you
i could go on forever but i think ill move on nowyou have many a weapon at your disposal such as rifles smgs and a laughably lethal minigun which can tear through thetargetslike scissors to paperthe graphic detail is quite graphic
if you shoot someone then a red bullethole appears on them and they start to bleed
same for slash marks etcbut there are some truly dissapointing bits as wellthe ai isnt good
and you can run in most places where there are plenty of armed guards
and sometimes the difficulty is off the roof
that and the fact that there is no midsave option means you get really fustrated if you mess up in the final stretch and have to restart the whole thingthis is a decent game but it lets itself down with silly little mistakes which can ruin the gameplay in places
but that doesnt stop it getting a decent scoregood bitsits differentlots of optionsdetailed gorehard very hardbad bitshard very hardstupid aithe verdict  out of alternitives if you like this sort of thing then get thief gold for the pchappy huntingthe hitman code name  was cloned by a scientist for the purpose of assassinating worldwide terrorists gunrunners and drug lords
mr  works under cover of a mysterious agency that assigns him on missions around the world to takeout the most wanted criminals and is rewarded with large sums of money per hit that can exceed thirty thousand dollars
but this is no takeoff of any james bond movie
 is much too inhuman to thrillride all the ladies and was designed to feel no emotion or desire in an underground laboratorynow some details on game play itself
expenses at times are taken out of your income if you accidentallyor purposelykill unnecessary targets such as police officers or civilians that often stand in your way cant buy all the best guns if you blow all your money on just killing people which includes sniper rifles and an assortment of automatics some of which come with silencer attachments to further improve your performance as a professional killer
the game encourages you to find alternate ways that are not always so obvious to make your hit
encouraging stealth and perfection
hence the games primary challenge
besides if you just open fire on anything that moves in this game like what we see with too many other games youll maybe live  or  seconds after the first shot
stealth is the key
every mission can be beaten without you ever getting shot or spotted i know people dont believe that but believe it or not i can make those columbian levels look as easy as the very first mission
ways to avoid detection include hiding the bodies of the people you kill dressing as the enemy gangs and terrorist groups alike often have certain dresscode and you can take the clothes of any person you kill in this game poisoning waiting for certain patrolmen guarding your main target to separate and taking them out one by one with a silenced pistol
and many other ways depending on the situationthe ai of all moving people in this game is superb
you can literally hide behind any given object dresser tree bookshelf after you have been discovered and the enemies wont know where you are until they see you even when they are in the same room
in most games they just come right to you
if their backs are turned you can sneak up on them to either slit their throat or strangulate them which ive seen in a few other games but not to this astounding degree
if you sniper someone from afar people will gather around the body which could be helpful if the congregated group of people are all people you prefer dead
your unsilenced weapons will be heard if fired and frighten civilians or alert the enemy
people turn their heads to look at you if you walk by
if one yelps too loud in the instant it takes you to pull out your gun and shoot him others will come
the thing is they react
they are not just mindless closeknitted colored pixels on the screen
they react to sound to your presence and to the things you do
in fact the ai is too good
there have been incidents where i was following someone too close and the draw of my weapon was actually heard causing the person i pursued to turn around to see the gun in my hand and to draw a weapon of his own in the second it took me to shoot him smackdead in the faceclose one
amazing how many miles per hour your heart can accelerate in a matter of secondsthis game can be sick challenging exciting and most of all engrossing
you can just kiss all the hours of a whole weekend away playing this beautiful game
the only drawback is that there is no ingame save
it saves automatically after you complete each mission
hitman  is just as good if not better some of the quirks in the ai in hitman  was corrected in hitman  the graphics are ten times better and there is ingame save in silent assassin
hitman  is out this spring
dont neglect this series
buy it now
hitman  is available for pc only
i would have never played it if it were not for playing hitman  on playstation the best game console everdespite mixed reviews i was intent on picking this title up
and i was very pleased with itthe concept is exactly that you are the hitman
your codename is   you start by escaping a mental institution
how did you get there
who is helping you get out
questions that are answered later as you make your way out
afterwards the fun beginsknow this before you play  this is a thinking mans game
it requires intelligent thought and rational planning
dont go running in with your guns blazing
you will need to use covert tacticsthere are many different weapons to pick up and you can change into the uniforms and clothing of most of the people you takeout
many times the success of the mission will depend on dressing up as a member of an organization or a bodyguard to get as close as possible to your target
and remember there is always more than one way to successmany complain of the complexity of missions and having to know everything by playing the level several times
that simply is not true
it is very easy to beat the level on your first time through
you just have to be able to use your brain
its as simple as following instincts
you are given enough information in your premission briefing and the map is clearly marked for you on where you are supposed to go
after that you go and wait for your opportunity
there is always more than one way to complete a mission which adds to the gameplay
complaints about the game moving slow are nothing more but impatience
you must be patient in this game
if you are not in the mood to think and act then you will not enjoy itmissions definitely do get more complex later on but again their is always information available to help you through and once you get the feel for being the hitman it is easy enough
as far as story goes there really isnt much
your first few missions are pretty straightforward you are hitman
go and kill
but soon hitman starts having flashbacks in between missions that evolve the story
overall the concept is very good and the last mission finally brings sense to the story
however as with most games these days the ending leaves alot to be desired
lets hope for a sequel because this game was alot of funthere are quite a few problems i discovered
namely the rd person angle gets quirky
the camera has a habit of going in all directions at times making control very difficult
sometimes you will end up getting stuck on objects in the level requiring either mass button mashing to get yourself out or a restart of the level
there is no midlevel save which is very annoying because if you die you can continue only twice and once you continue the target will most likely be aware of your presence making the rest of the mission difficult
however if you are very skilled you wont die too often
there are also many graphical problems unless you are using a voodoo  or higher
anything less you will experience many graphical problems
i recommend going with a geforce  or possibly a geforce   although the game seems to be optimized for voodoo graphics cards the company went out of business so now nvidia would be the optimal choice with their geforce chipsetsall in all a great game with a great concept
if you are buying a new computer and are looking for a few games to start out with i strongly recommend picking up hitman
if you are patient and willing to put your mind into a game rather than run in with guns blazing then this is the game for youi have grown up with these games i was playing this when i was in fourth grade and had to be watch by my teachers for their belief that i was a psychopath
i got this game for my mac i am running on windows  boot camp
i have to say i was a little saddened
still a great story but the controls are annoying you cant save the game and for some reason i am unable to run in the game very odd might be cuz i am not using a real pc
this game has not stood well against  years of game evolution having said that this is a must play game if you want hitman silent assassin to make more sense and increase enjoymenti like this game it supports eax opengl directxd dfxglide realstic game good gameplay and is not the best out there but defnitley brings back the true spirit of fpsi reccomend this for any fps fani ran it on my p  geforce mbram ghz hdspace directx and sb livedigital v soundcard and winxp home edition
it ran incrediblebuy it fps fans
i reccomend it
ps
sortove a little  voilentgood game as same as duke nukem time to kill
like play game as fun and better than boring
or notthis is a cool game
you drive around on motorbikes taking huge jumps and getting  or  feet of air 
you cant do great tricks no flips or backflips or s or anything like that unfortunately
as you get huge air you might see such things as some very lowflying planes and trains speeding through the track
i think the tricks is where this game fails mostly
it has twelve bikes which is good but only three real life makes which are yamaha ktm and honda
the weirdest thing about this game which i think is probably a cheat is when you push alt  tab  a and then open the game back up the floor is a rainbow colour
this game is quite challenging and takes you a while to beat however you might get bored of it in a few games but this is normal with many computer games
probably the most challenging events are the nationals and supercross and they take a while to beat
i reccomend this to many people and gamers who love racing motorbikes and having huge crashes
if you are looking for something else i reccomend superbike  made by ea sports because that is a fantastic gamethe main thing that stands out about this game is the low learning curve
most pc games these days take a while to learn before you actually start having fun
with this game its a blast upon startup
so its different   which is good
there is also a less than ten page instruction booklet  whewh  easy enough
the controls are simple with as little commands  as possible
even the midair manuevers tricks are a snap to pull off  landing is the hardest part
this puts so much more emphasis on racing  and having fun than most other games offer today
the there are the  graphics  immaculate nuff said
the options are endless you will  spend the first week or so just exploring the different tracksdoing crazy  stunts and making awesome crashes
when you actually start racing the  real fun begins along with addictive frustration
then there is the  online gaming which is also a blast but a broadband connection is almost  essential here
the only thing missing from the game is weather effects
there are levels with snow on the ground but i would like to see falling  snow or rain
also there is no water whatsoever in the game
speeding  through a mudpuddle and kicking up spray would be a nice function or  wiping out and getting your suit all muddy
along the same lines no time  of day function either
i guess nothing can be perfect in todays world  well just have to wait for part 
im not into motocross racing in  general but i like to play fun games and so should you
mm is a great  gaming experiencemillionaire second addition is a good game
i probably would not want to sit around alone playing it but if you have a few people its fun
i ordered this game for my mother because she lives for regis and quotwho  wants to be a millionairequot
she isnt really into computer games so  i thought shed like to try it
she absolutly loves the game
it is a  very simple game to play
when you start the program it just goes right  into the game instead of confusing option pages confusing for the not so  computer literate
the price is right too
im sort of surprised that  regis didnt hit me up for  or  for the game
it would not be worth  that price anyway
i have not run into repeat questions on this version  but i have only played it a few times
one thing that i didnt really like  was the opening speed round
i thought it could have been a little better
however i would suggest this game
its very simple to play even for  people who dont know how to use computers
so lets playquotwho  wants to be a millionairequot i am a game show fan and feel a shortage in the modern world of windows me of game shows
a few are cropping up and i like the who wants to be a millionaire show and decided to get the gameboy color version first
i enjoyed it and decided to get the pc versioni had trouble
it wouldnt run and no live tech support is available on weekends the website helped to identify the problem and downloaded the patch for pentium  systems and it flew
go to the website if you have any problems starting this game
the graphics are superb and regis funny demeanor and voice are there
i didnt mind reading the questions speech takes an awful lot of disk space and theres enough speech anyway
im never good at the fastest finger question and am glad there is a  player option
the questions are just like the show varied with some i know and some i have to look up or ask someone thank goodness for the pause feature
the music look and ambience is almost exactly like the show and is fun whether you win or lose with regis trash talkthe negatives why the timer
if they dont have one in the game they dont need one in the cdrom version
one person took over  minutes on the show on one question
why should we be punished
again thank goodness for the pause feature
there is no way to skip the lengthy introductory credits we know who made the program let us skip to the game like hasbro does for their gameshow cds
if you take too long putting in your name the game will force one in i was talking to someome at that point and the game put a name in
i had to start over watching the annoyingly long intro credits
sometimes reege chatters too much between questions i like him fine but maybe a quotchatterquot setting should be implemented so if youre in a hurry to move the game along you can
the quottrash talkquot is still funthese are very strong negatives but this is a terrific game and the negatives detract only slightly hence the  star rating
it is still a lot of fun once the game is going
lastly i mean no offense by saying this so please dont take this too seriously you know you cant really win the million dollars
its a cdrom game for the computer already
even reege himself says so after you win the virtual million dollars
heres a reminder for people disappointed in not winning real money taxes
this is just for fun and thats exactly what this game is a lot of fungreat game what more can be said
millions of questions that test your knowledge the only difference is that there is no suspense at all because you are playing it and you can play it over and over again
you get your three lifelines one of which is calling your best friend not in real life
regis will call the plumber the butcher and so on to help you with the question at hand and each has their own unique personality
there is not much that can be said about this game you press the key for the letter choice abcd
of the answerwhile this edition does make significant inroads against what ailed the origional millionaire its more evolutionary than revolutionary
ive read other reviews here that talk about massive improvements to the  fundamental graphics and playabilty of the game but im not sure what  theyre talking about
in fact the interface is almost exactly the same  as in the original versionwhich is to say that the fastest finger  portion is a pale imitation of what happens on the actual tv show and the  hot seat graphics are simply replicated
the latter isnt so badthe  big dance makes one sweat bullets just like the tv showbut its highly  disappointing that they didnt try to find a way to better approximate the  fastest finger
truth be told theyve made that part of the game  appropriate for more people than could reasonably be around a computer  keyboardwhat they have significantly altered are the questions
they are massively more appropriate for the dollar amount being wagered  than in the first edition
and there are many many more of them
the  playable life of this game is therefore much greater than the hours  worth of entertainment you could expect to get out of its predecessorif  youve not bought a millionaire game this is definitely where you should  start
if you bought the first one and were disappointed this one will at  least be worth the modest purchase price
personally i think disney  interactive now buena vista interactive owes all who purchased the first  edition a free copy of this second edition but that being unlikely i can  definitely recommend that you put your toe back into the disney oceanthis game was a nice surprise
the cut scene movies they had were very cool and the game play was pretty fast paced
from training you guys to throw fire to flying around in a hotair ballon this game offered alot of different was of reeking havoc
especially your shaman
once powered up the shaman can unleash many spells such as earthquake tornado and volcano eruptions and believe me these are very cool
you can garrison towers to use to your advantage as extra defense while you are attacking
lots of cool features
you have plenty of battles to fight to get to the final confrontation and this is a very challenging game as it seems like every time you turn around you are getting attacked again
and when you get to the final battle well youll just have to see for yourself
very cool
probably closer to   starsok so maybe its not the best game around
but it certainly worth the few dollars it costs these days the intro movie alones pretty cool
become the shaman of your tribe and build magic and war your tribe unto total dominance
hey it kept me ocupied for a hundred hrs or sopopulous is a great game i control all of my people as i wanted there alot of great spell i can destroy the enemythe graphic is pretty good too  also the music is very relaxingpopulous well take a month to finish the  game because you need alots of men to gather together and make them fight  another enemy and also worship the totem pole or what ever its call to  release the spellits cool went i destroy there townmy favorite spell to  destroy the enemy are volcanolightningmetero shower and the flying  dragonthose spell well make it easy too kill themso it fun and is my  favorite gamequotim still playing populous todayquotenddefinatly an improvement to comand amp conquer
its great portrail of the worlds history brings out the beauty of the games wonders
although it coule be much better it does lack in certain qualities but not many or majoy ones
you would think that the follow up  tiberian sun would have tried to follow on red alerts great game play but sadly no
it just came up far behind being way to dark and mystereous
red alerts weapons vehicles people and buildings are just right and not futuristiky which is good
and to top it all off it is just sooooo adictive once you start playing it
you just have to get to the next level thats why it is so good and worth what you will pay for itred alert is a great game and certainly worth buying but you can pick it up in a variety of packages and prices here on amazon and this one is not the most economical
ill explain laternow to the game
yes red alert is now an old game by pc standards
the graphics are still ok but not obviously up to snuff compared to tiberian sun or its sequal red alert  never the less red alert is a blast and might still be the most enjoyable playable game in the whole command and conquer seris including those newer games
anybody familiar with any one cnc game basically knows how to play them all because the concept is the same
you need two resources to function
the most important resource is had by making refineries and sending out harvesters to gather it
in this game it is called ore in tiberian sun it is called tiberian but it all doesnt matter because the entire game is focused on getting as many harvesters at work as possible and protecting them so you have the credits neccesary to build your military
from an offensive perspective of course you want to try and cut off your opponents harvesters and thats at least half the game
the other resource is power which is easily had by building power plants from time to timethe game features two very evenly matched sides in a mostly conventional military battle
the russians and the ukrainians on one side and the allies on the other with germany france and england
the russians and the ukrainians have the bigger more powerful tanks a heavy tank and the mammoth
the allies have tanks that are smaller quicker and cheaper
the russians can make deadly telsa coils for defense which electrocute the enemy while the ally countries can make cheaper better armoured conventional turrets and pill boxes
the russians can make a substantial air attack with fast flying mig bombers and yaks
the allies are limited to helecopters but can make a real navy with destroyers and crusiers while the other side can only make defensive submarines
the sides are balanced and which country you choose to play with will be determined by the map
if the map has lots of water on it you may prefer to be one of the ally countries so you can build a navyoverall the action is constant and the battles can be intense
one of the things that sets this game and all the cnc games apart from other rts games is that these games are much more base camp limited
in this game you have a command center and you build around it
you can make a sevice depot and then make an mcv but you still have to place it down some place and build around it
those who are more used to games like total annililation or age of empires may find this confining
in those games you have mobile units that allow you to build anything anywhere on the map irregardless of how close or far they may be from another structure or unit
here you have to build within the camp and while you can make mcvs and build other camps they are not easy to protect and mcvs are expensive
normally in the course of a game you may have your major camp and one smaller additional one whose purpose is to protect you harvesters as they have to go out further and further for oreoverall red alert is a very fun well balanced game that still has many followers today
go on mplayer or westwood and you will find dozens even hundreds of players
there are dozens of good downloads available online including mega maps and desktop theme packs
i highly recommend the coop maps which allow you and a bud to ally and take on a super charged ai opponent
with coop you can really play as a single team where each player can control the others units and the maps are greatfinally dont buy this game package
you can buy just red alert for  so why pay more for this
also red alert is now available in a couple of nice game packages
you can buy red alert and gettysburg along with another rts game in one package and another package allows you to buy  games including this onecommand  conquer red alert is a game i usually play at my friends house
its a pretty fun video game
if you like strategy games which makes you think you will love this game
its really hard as well
you can choose your country and have an army
you start off with  and you buy things that will keep your base safe because the other country is trying to kill you and destroy your land
you must get lots of soliders and good buildings and planes and lots of other things in order to defeat themdo you like dancing
funky music
cute girl reporters in shiny orange miniskirts
then space channel  is a game for you
the game has a very simple premisedancing aliens have invaded earth
to challenge them foxy space reporter ulala must watch their dance moves and then copy them exactly
sounds easy
well it is if you have got rhythmi have watched some of my friends play this people seem to either get it straight away or completely suck at it
perhaps this should be a game to rent first to see if you have what it takes to hit that beat
the control is incredibly unforgiving about timing  the slightest delay and you get a penalty which with some very complex and syncopated button bashing in the later levels can be very difficult to master
once you get the knack however things start to look very rosy in fact this is the much reported drawback to the game  it is only four levels long
you could thrash it in an afternoon although there are secret levels to visit after you beat the game even harder  the one in the tv quiz game studio is a nightmare
 it is a real shame to see the final credits coming up so rapidly
but it looks real good and ulala is so cute and sexy that you will be sure to come back for more
her moves are slick and highly realistic a credit to the designers
a special mention must be made to the music as the spaceretroaustin powerskitsch soundtrack is absolutley outstanding and is one of the games strongest features
as the credits finish rolling a footnote says quotto everyone who loves music dancing and gamesquotyou get all three with space channel space channel  is wellgrooooooooovy
hahahthe game is pretty much welldancing
but the game is solid
you play the game as ulala a space reporter but a very groovy space reporteri a galaxy
shes got some pretty cool dances and has a grooooovy attitude
you must use your groovy dances and moves to save the planet from an invasion from some sort of aliens called the morolians
the game is fun
as the other reviewer mention the game does get pretty hard even near the beginning of the game
the game has some really good graphics and some cool colorful retro type enviromentlets get to itthe graphics in the game are up to par with other hot dreamcast titles
the graphics were pretty stunning at one point but are still good and not outdated
but not amazing graphics duhh
i would have to give the graphics a star for thatthe sound is great
it has a pretty cool soundtrack with cool funky groovyyeah thats getting annoying dance songs and really awesome beats to get to you in the gamegameplay is really fun with nothing but dance dance dance
but cool dancing of courselike i said before this game is funky
andgroovyeheh
the gameplay shows off some really cool realistic dance moves that will have you dancing on your mind
hell maybe on your feet
theres alot of cool levels to dance too and some cool hidden levels when you replay the whole game againthe creators did a great job with this dc title
from great graphics to groovy dance beats to funky levelsand lots of hard repetitive gameplay i give space channel five for dreamcast out  starslatessegas first jaunt into the quirky realm of dancing games space channel  is quite enjoyable showcasing many of the best features of the dreamcast
however the actual playing experience is not all that deep making the game feel like it was rushed to market
this does not detract from the game too much however because for what it is space channel  is quite fungraphically the combination of prerendered backgrounds and liverendered characters works quite well producing often dazzling visual effects reminiscent of the space station scenes in  as seen by someone on an acid trip
the music definitely has its hook and while apollo smiles voiceacting is a bit wooden at times overall she lends a nice dimension to main character ulala
the control scheme is simple enough perhaps too simple and the difficulty increases at a good pace throughout the games lengthhowever that observation brings up the main flaw of the game at only four levels space channel  is entirely too short
people with instinctive rhythmic skills will probably be able to finish the game in less than an hour and while trying to unlock all  characters does add some longevity to the game the main quest should have been much longer
also glaringly absent is a twoplayer mode which in dancing games seems to be a mandatory feature
combined these two problems really detract from the games replay valuebut overall space channel  is still very pleasing to the eyes and ears and is unique enough in a game genre known for its uniqueness that it merits strong consideration from potential buyers
players with no sense of rhythm or exceptionally poor shortterm memory may find the game too frustrating but everyone else should find something to like about itthis game is very unique in that you use a sexy female to dance with funny little aliens
this game is a lot of fun but it can be very hard to achieve the points necessary to go to the next levelstherefore you should get a cheap gameshark
there are codes for infinite health and for max viewer rating
those codes allow you to make mistakes but still move throughout the levelsas i mentioned that the female star is sexylook im no expert at baseball games so i may not have noticed some of the mistakes sega made but i did notice a couple you cant control the  fielding until the computer catches the ball then you can control the  player throwing it the replays are repetitive and boring but at least  you can turn them off
 throwing the ball to the bases is kind of tough  because instead of pushing buttons that resemble bases like in other  baseball games you have to put the analog in the direction of the base  hold it there and press abesides those problems i liked the game
and it wasent as bad as some people say it is
so rent it to see if you  like it or not
dont let these bad reviews stop you from trying the gamei just got this game yesturday and i must say the graphics are amazing
the roster is even so updated that david justice is on the yankees
the  main problems are the slow down in graphics if too many people are on base  sometimes causing you to get out
the other main problem is that your base  runners run even if your guy hit a pop fly causing a double play for the  comp
no fielding i might add
the comp controls your outfielders but you  throw the ball to your choice base
this is a good game for baseball fans
the season mode is fun but there is no home run derbyboo hoo
if your  not sure you will like this game at least rent it
thanks for your timelet me start by saying that wsk has no fielding
for this we immediately subtract one star
one must wonder what sega was thinking
however besides that the game is actually pretty goodlets start with the graphics
besides awful crowd designs they are awesome
the players are as close to real as you can get and the stadiums are breathtakingthe sound well the playbyplay is horrible but it gets the job donegameplay no fielding
no fielding
no fielding
but other than that it is a very good baseball simulation
this game makes pitchers duels possible something that i have never seen before in a console baseball game
no more inflated  disasters that some call a baseball simulation
scores no longer can be mistaken for football scores
i like the batting system and the pitching systems you just have to get used to them
the baserunning is tough but isnt awful if you know what you are doingin closing this game is worth the  dollars you have to pay for it i got mine used for  bucks and should last you up until you can buy wski had lots of fun with this game
it kept me busy for a few weeks due to a lot of walking around and looking for things in the game
the only disappointment i had with it is the end of the game really isnt the end
there should be a part  but it turns out they only made part  for japan and for the xbox not the dreamcast
so i guess ill never know how the story endsyou play as ryo hazuki a kind of shady young japanese man in  yokozuka japan
you must spent  to  hours a day quotin game timequot searching for clues to find his fathers killerill make a quick pro amp con type of reviewpros you can play old arcade games ranging from quothangonquot darts punchout  amp 
 sparring with the guy in ryos dojo
a daily five dollar allowancethe forklift job is easy and fun
the  man battle minigame is playable upon finishing the game
cons  you dont acually meet ling sha hua the girl who is in the opening sequence who is in china
 ryo is a more offensive fighter than defensive fighter
the snow doesnt stick to the ground
the ingame timer moves at almost an hour per minute
the replay value is low unless you care for the actual weatherbuy the stategy guide for this game if you dont want to miss out on anythingshenmue is simply something that every dreamcast owner has to experience
this is to say that theres no gaurentee heshe will like itthe game is an rpgstyle game with occasional virtual fighterstyle fights along with some dragons lairtype button responses
theres even a few arcade sequences to add flavorthe story is very well presented the main character quotryoquot is on a quest to avenge his fathers death
along the way both exciting and mundane events occupy ryos time from fighting rival biker gangs to helping a young girl with her kitty
the story is rich and by the rd disk it may become your lifea couple words of warning the game is rather short
it can be finished in  to  hours of gameplay
to me this is a plus to others it might be a negative
also the voice acted is for the most part horrible
there are moments where the voice performance can be effective but these moments are few
this is something the player has to get used to or it will drive them crazy
parents note there is a fair amount of violence the fighting sequences and a few  letter words towards the end of the adventure
final note the box for this game says quotthe experience beginsquot
without giving too much away those looking for a complete story might be dissapointedin spite of this shenmue is one of the best gaming experiences ive had all year
like a good book the game lives on beyond the time spent playing it
i recommend every dreamcast owner to give it a shot and see if they can make it past the games shortcomingsi liked the game but having to work and have a life outside of it made it difficult to stay into it
too long of days and time between saves makes it difficult to get into without something coming up
if you have a lot of time get it its a great dealthis game has one thing thats a brilliant idea and a very frustrating flaw at the same time the timemechanism
it really makes the game feel alive but sometimes id wish it wasnt there
why
well get to that later lets start off with the graphics
i dont know why but they really looked quotplaystationishquot to me but in a higher resolution
bad
not at all
what i mean by this is that its got highly detailed graphics and playstationplaystation  very impressive facialanimations
the downside is that the graphics are a bit rough especially when you compare it to something like soul calibur or sonic nevertheless id give it  out of  sound
very uhm japanese
or lets say stereotype japaneseamericangibberish  yes voiceacting is pretty bad and the voiceactors lines dont really help them either
music is ok but sound overall couldve been a lot better now lets get to the most interesting part the gameplay
its very intriguing because of the realtime gameplay but frustrated the hell out of me sometimes as i said before
ill give an example
ryo thats the maincharacter  walks very far to see someone
but you are a minute too late and hell say hes too tired
then you have to go to bed and walk there all over again and it adds up to  minutes in real life
yes its realistic but it isnt fun and isnt that the main purpose of a game
this game really has an interesting idea rather involving gameplay but something that thank god will be ironed out in part  and if they do that then theres  stars from me to collect yet another game that shows the talent that sega has over sony
ps has no games like this rather rehashes of yestergeneration games
ams shenmue represents another new change in d gaming just like the change the legend of zelda ocarina of time had over previous adventure games
it also shows that sega is just as creative in making new kinds of games as nintendoshenmue is the brainchild of yu suzuki who has created the most expensive game ever and a new type of gameplay he calls free
of course it follows a storyline but the world of shenmue is to explore the city of yokosuka to get to where you want and when you need to
its a complete living world
it has days and nights and the city is complete with your everyday usual stuff
not since super mario  have i played a game that gives a new experiencethe reason why i gave this game four stars is because the game is not one game its only the beginning therefore once you beat it youll have to wait and wonder whats going to be in chapter  also the game is too realistic here and there for example to call someone youll have to individually press the digits on the phone pad and as for the day and night feaure the time is always consistant
you cant skip to the next day when you want tothough with these flaws there is no way shenmue can be overlooked
its a new type of game and the majority of gamers wont care about its flaws too much because of all the possible things to do when super mario  debuted no one cared about its flaws like the annoying camera control because as stated it was a new type of game and experience
get a copy and enjoyshenmue is simply a test of patience meaning that if you give it some time you will adjust and start to love it but if you dont then you will miss out on a great game but it aint pefectshenmues graphics are the best ive seen on any console nuff saidthe control is a little frustrating at first but you will get used to itthe sound is goodbad
the music and sound effects are top notch but the voice acting is horrible most of the timethe gameplay consists of walking running talking fighting quick time events finding stuff etc
etc
the gameplay has a slow pace and can be frustrating at times finding this person finding this store finding that store etc
but like i said if you just give the game some time you will like it a lotso overall i liked the game a lot
it has its bad parts and its got its good parts
this is the most realistic game ever made period
and it is definently revolutionary
so what are you waiting for go out and get the gamegraphics  control  sound  gameplay  replay value   frustration medium fun factor shenmue is one of the best graphics games ive ever played on dreamcast
you get to go and fight a group of angels that are mad lol
i think this should be one of the best games for dreamcast except one thing made it so incredibly stuped
duh
the game is way too short
 discs should be alot but they are not
this game is about ryo hazuki from the hazuki dojo in yamanose
his father was murdered by the secret man lan di sama
he is ryos main target for revenge so he tries to kill him
and for people who want to fight him you dont get too
lan di will not fight you until a girl named shenhua jona meets you and you destroy him
there are  shenmues if im correct
this game is great but its too short
and the weather and time are very accuratethe first amazing elements that jump out at you as soon as you play this game is that shenmues awesome graphics and the vastness of the world you play this game in
the technology of shenmue is simply amazing and helps the game span many genres of video games
after playing the game i also thoroughly enjoyed its story and charectors
for the most part this game plays like an rpg but also includes bits that are racing fighting and speed tapping of buttons i really dont know what genre that would be
this combination of genres kinda hurts shenmue because it includes them all but truely masters none of them
finally my biggiest complaint is that although the game is three discs long it is actually quite a short game to beat
i still recommend this game as a must play game for dreamcast ownersshenmue is a very strange and unique game
it was the most expensive game ever made at the time and is praised by many as a  out of  game and the best dreamcast game
i enjoyed playing shenmue a lot but i just dont think its as good as its fans saythe game is about ryu who is on a hunt for the man who killed his father
its an rpg the combat is like an arcade style fighting game and it has investigation part similar to an old school la noire
in the game you have to go around and find clues usually by talking to the right people at the right time then as you make progress at certain times you get in fights with people either thought quick time events or by arcade style fighting
this gives shunmue alot of variety in game play
the open world was very impressive at the time
shenmue is completely unpredictable one minute youre fighting a group of thugs the next minute youre driving a fork lift moving crates
shenmue has a lot of attention to detail the town completely changes depending on the time of day weather or time of year
it has the best graphics ive seen on the dreamcast
there are a lot of extras too you can go play an arcade game collect sonic toys or practice your movesthis all sounds great but shenmue has its fair share of problems that its fans sometime ignore beingthe games story is extremely generic some fans say that it makes up for this by being well told but i disagree
it could have been well told if it actually made you care about the characters
the problem is that the game just drops you in ryu shoes without any backstory and most of the characters dont talk about themselves that often and if they do its not anything important
how can i care about the characters if i dont know them
also parts of the game are too slow
theres a time system but there is no way to skip time
so at some parts someone might tell you to meet them somewhere tomorrow and often theres nothing fun to do till thenthese other complaints may sound like nitpicking but they add up the voice acting is terrible quick time events are overused the fork life segments where funny the first day but where extremely boring all the other daysto summarize i like shenmue its fun unique and unpredictable but the generic story all the long boring segments and the lack of any reason to care about the characters prevent shenmue from being the  out of  its fans say it is
i give it  out of this game is a pretty good game but you better have the patience of job
the game starts off really slow but after you get it going it becomes really good
i would recommend buying the book to get through it
otherwise slitting your wrist while taking a warm bubble bath might be a little more funwhen i played shenmue i felt that the grafic was great honestly even if i consider that the game is about  years ago the grafic is wonderfuli think that shemue explain the scene in chinese very well
as if i can feel the atmosphere directly
for instance when i take a walk in the town of the game for too reality i concentlate to even tree or dogs or catbut i wanted story worked out moreif you play the game somebody can feel the atmosphere in chenesethank you for reading poor englishshenmue is graphics voice music and a totally original gameplay experience
imagine being able to literally pickup manipulate or view almost every inch of your gaming world
you can even pick up pictures off the wall for no reason at all in most cases
or play games at the local arcade real s games like hangon
then go get a job at the harbor driving a forklift for a company and getting paid
then add it the character interaction and motorcycle driving and all the little mini adventures that paint this world full of different genres from racing to fighting to rpg this game has it all
such a compelling storyline driven by the murder of your father by a chinese martial arts guru that wears fine silk clothes with a dragon design
the game is exceptional
it covers  gd roms but the game comes with  the fourth disc is a biography and character info as well as alot of other extra stuff that really is icing on the cake for a great gamecertainly segas dreamcast should have lasted longer than it did
with titles like soul calibur sonic adventure  and crazy taxi among others the system should have been more than a cult hit
enter shenmue while certainly flawed is definitely the most unique playable experience you can get on the system
im sure you already have read tons of opinions on the game ranging from revolutionary to horrendous
it certainly is a revolutionary game but being revolutionary doesnt make it perfect
for as infinite and limitless as the games environment feels the quest is actually pretty linear
youll have to perform tasks in specific order and some of the tasks such as working and moving crates becomes extremely monotonous
otherwise with the dreamcasts best graphics and music and the best story line in video game history shenmue is a must have for sega enthusiasts and those looking for a unique adventure on their television setthere are some onestar reviews of this game
there are many more four and fivestar reviews mainly because the kind of person you need to be to rate shenmue  star doesnt often have the attention span necessary to write an entire amazon reviewthis is where a lot of people are going wrong reviewing this game
they spend a few hours cluelessly wandering around not using the notebook which tells you what youre looking for now not going to the fortune teller in dobuita who gives you clues not using their own mental processes to think about what ryo should be doing and on the basis of this conclude that it sucks
not true
usually the next piece of information can be found in a matter of minutes letting you ever closer to the action sequences  virtua fighter style fights with up to  enemies shenmue was originally planned as a virtua fighter rpg qte reaction tests movie cutscenes that can be amazingly realistic at times minigames like forklift and motorcycle riding arcade games play space harrier all over again
 etc
even mundane things like going shopping feeding a pet cat using vending machines
theres enough to donow the voice acting
the voice acting ranges from fantstic ryo nozomi chen gui zhang to terrible some passersby children
note that most of the important voices are great
its almost a formula the less plotimportant a character the worse their voice
desperate loser goro is a real overactor
but then in rl desperate losers do overact to impresswhy four stars
id like  
but it is rather too easy cant quotgame overquot at all
its also relatively short
but what is there is absolutely beautiful
the final disc in particular made my jaw hit the ground on more than one occasion
my final quotdayquot of game time left a mark
just like the final scenes episode of the final episode of your favourite tv show you could tell quotthis is it
this is ending and soonquot its beautifulif you read this far congratulations
you have the attention span shenmue would like you to have
go buy
nowthis is the first game that would make any aggressive skate pleased
me myself am a aggressive skater and the amount of tricks in this game is pretty decent
the only problem i find with this game is that you cannot control what tricks your skater pulls
another thing i dislike about this game is the sometime annoy gameplay where you might find your self stuck and unable to move
on the other hand the cel shaded graphics are really nice and the soundtrack keeps you from wanting to kill the volume after  minutes
all in all you should get this game if you like skating or something different from the traditional skating gamesif you like good music good fun and a good challenge its hard to go wrong with jet grind radio
its fast paced unique and very hard to put down
the first thing that will grab you is the style of the game
the graphics are very nicely cel shaded and the music will keep you jamming along nodding your head
the music isnt all golden but for the most part its wonderfulthe gameplay is rather simple but very fun
skate around find red arrows spray paint your tag
all the while avoid cops tear gas dogs even missile launching helicopters
its hard and frustrating at times but its oh so worth it
youll keep coming back for more and morethe game stands up to repeat plays and the style never wears thin
the story is entertaining and well told by dj k unlike so many games where the story between levels is the dull part youll be jamming along with dj k all the way through
its quite hard not to be brought into the jet set radio universe
its very well doneif you still have your dreamcast around and you never gave this one a shot try it
you may be quite surprised rirathcomill make this review shortthe graphics are increadable with celshaded models for that cartoon look and has  huge cities with little slowdown at all
fun to play easy to beat but im glad to go though it another  times and has one of the best soundtracks this side of the planet
at  i see no reason why you shouldnt go to the local store and pick up a copy
dont buy this if you plan on doing your homeworkjet grind radio is a wonderful example of how to create a truly fun game
dont get me wrong youll definitely enjoy it
there are two issues however i wish they had corrected for the us version play control and the length of the gamethe play control is tighter than it was but still not totally tight some moves feel next to impossible at times
the length of the game is also called to question although you can go back and play the same levels over and posting your scores on the internet through the game is a welcome additionother than that this game has a lotta class
definitely a rental
if you like it buy it show that sega should continue to innovatethis game is lots of fun i mean whats better than going around town spray painting walls and cars and getting the cops and other people upset with youone thing i found that i was very impressed with was the animation is beutifal to look atone other thing i was afraid there was not gonna be enough characters but alas i was wrong there are plenty of characters you can use to help spraypaint townfirst off i have to say that i loved the music in this game
all types of music in different languages
wownow the game was pretty fun
lots of tricks to perform and a variety of levels to keep it interesting
my complaint is with the difficulty of the later levels
good grief some are near impossiblethat however is minor and doesnt affect the game too muchstory graphics sound fun rather than rehashing a genre that was old  years ago sega has created something entirely new and fresh and they have succededthey took a risk and pulled it offin jet grind you are a hoodlumskaterdancer type who rollerblades around in beutifully animated environmentsm spray painting everything from police chiefs to playground signsyou can also create your own graffitinothing to ellaborate but still cooland that adds to the replay valuathe characters are so beutifully animated in fact youll spend at least  minutes of play time just staring at tab or beat wondering how they could make it look so goodthis game isnt good for any one real reason its just so totally funny  crazy and original that you have to love itcheck it outi wanted this game for at least  years and after just getting it i gotta say the graphics  soundtrack get a perfect  but control wise  camera its a ign wasnt lying big suprise when they said it takes weeks to get used to the controls theyre kinda unresponsove in some areas especially while grinding on walls
as is the camera control it is a pretty frustrating game to me but the music  cel shading almost make up for itits kinda hard to recommend it and kinda easy
im a gamer who needs tight controls in order to get the most graphics arent a huge issue but this game has a certain charm that i love like the japanese symbols and tokyo vibe to it
like worthwhile collectibles and art galleries if youre lucky enough to get the internet working on it im sure its awesomejet grind radio is a really unique game
there has never been a game like this as far as i knowthe graphics are amazing
it goes perfect with the game and its cool looking
you gotta see it to belive itthe gameplay is good and packs a lot of fun but the main problem is the sloppy control
half the time you will be screwing up because of those  controlsthe sound is very good
there are so many songs in the game and the sound effects are sweet
but the cops get annoying thoughoverall this game was great and its worth experiencing at least once
i recommend renting this first and making your decision on buying it or notgraphics  gameplay  control  sound  replay value  gets boring fast frustration high  fun factor while this game may not teach a great moral lesson graphiti is fun
 its still a blast to play
its got a whole lot of style and you can tell that its straight out of japan
i love the music too its strange but in a good way
i just wish it was longerjet grind radio is yet another impressively creative title to come out of sega which is why im so fond of sega and definitely rates as a successthe concept is simple you skate around towns tagging spraypainting certain objects while evading police officers police dogs rockets from helicopters and other baddies
the animation style is really what cements the experience as being something out of the ordinary though
dubbed quotcelshadingquot the end result is something that looks very much like a cartoon
its really beautiful to watch as well as playthe gameplay is fun but has some problems
the first which likely everyone has addressed is camera control
there are  unused buttons on the controller and the developers still decided for some unknown reason to double up controls
its annoying but you learn to live with it
the other issue that bugs me is that youre constantly on the run from police with no real defense other than fleeingone other problem i have is with the menu system
when you boot up youre given the choice of starting a new game playing a tutorial or loading an existing file
however once you have a game in play through creating a new game or loading you have to reboot the system to load another
this is really a patently ridiculous feature and particularly annoying if you like alternating w a friend but keep seperate game filesone other note i should make is that the worlds may seem smaller than they were described by other reviewers at first
i was pretty aggravated and disappointed for a while until i got far enough that i was actually given the opportunity to skate more or less freely without worry of harassment by police etc its a bit into the game but worth noting if you get discouragedall in all jet grind radio is still a fantastic game and definitely a game to get for the dreamcast
there are minor points that really should have been taken care of but other than that a solid effortwhen i first heard about jet set radio in a magazine i was reading i thought that it was totally whack and stupid
its actually pretty koolthere are tons of pros to this game and they definitely outweigh the cons
you get to go around and deface property by tagging it and that in itself is a lot of fun
you can unlock new gangs and even a dog to skate with
you can also do tricks and stuff like that which earn you points
the controls are okay bu there are  buttons that you dont use so if you have a turbo controller dont bother using itof course all games have cons and the main thing i dont like is the fact that the police chase you and you can only run away
also if youre tagging some stuff it may take long enough for that annoying police squadron to find you and shoot you
if there was maybe an afterburner or something that would delay the police for a few seconds that would be goodoverall this is a very good game and i enjoy playing itthis game is all based around the element of fun
the game cannot be taken seriously
this game seems to be a cross between tony hawks and crazy taxi which i think is a good thing as i have like both of those games
this game has a high novelty factor at first but it soons wears out as does your tolerance towards the gaming controls
overall its worth buying if you just wanna have a bit of funi remember my friend who had wario land mario land  an it was aswome
then later i wanted to get the game but they didnt have it funcoland gamestopand wario land didnt come out yet not even a gba i was like  when this happened and im  now an i had a blast when buying a used copy of this game
it has awsome graphics and the only thing wario land  beats this game on is the music but they both have cool music an i may have liked this the most over  but i hate the insanly difficult golf thing
it drives me mad
i beat all wario land games my friend has  an  an i have  an  lol an ya they are all great so even if u only have  warioland game an cant possibly get the others just have fun with itprosperdy visualsfun puzzlesimmortallonger than other warioland games when u get all treasuresturn into different stufffun replaystory easy to understand whether you have the instructions guide or not an story has fun twists you will never guess who the last boss isconshard golf mini game can drive any player crazycollecting all treasures is fun to do again an again bring on the roadplanetripsget this game wether u played a wario land game or not end of storythe price is right and it does a good job while providing a nice amount of memoryi hate sport games and most of the games i play on n did not need a memory pack however i have used my to store some my fighting game and it works great
with memory expansion i really dont see the need but if you are buying a mpack make sure its originalthis is a good product especially games with a lot of explosions and loud vibrations where u acctually feel a sample of the vibration like in first person shooter games where u feel like the forceback of the gunshot which is pretty cool exept the only thing i have to complain is there should be more of a vibration then i would have got  for all my controllers hopefully gamecubes built in analog in the controller will be better and it will save money toogood product if your favorite games support it
the ps rumble feature is better implemented thoughthe n rumble pak is a great accessory when you are able to use it
what i mean is that not all games work with the rumble pak
otherwise when it is working with a game that it works with the result is amazing
you can practicaly feel what is going on and what the character physically feels
buy this but be aware of games it works and doesnt work withhappy gamingin this you run forward and use your lightsaber to kill any bad guys that are in your way
a big problem is the checkpoints are far spread from each other
on level  its a joke youre there for  mins and get before the catapiller boss and you die and have use another  mins of your life
the new moves you get after complete each level are complicated to do you have to push like  buttons to do a new move so i used to use the same basic moves and fluke the new moves but i got this when i was younger so im alot more exsperienced at games now so this might not be as hard if i get back to itthis did keep me hooked for a few months and it feels good to kill those enemies
you get to drive a tank was wellthats right this rpg is good
although overshadowed by the famous final fantasy series its so sad that so many good rpgs are overshadowed by some of squaresofts bad ones it stands on two strong feet
it plays kinda like saga frontier one put not really
there are  characters ashley brad and lilke and you choose which character to play as as you go through the game
however your character will keep changing until all three get together to form one party
the battle system is ok not great
the basic enemies become very easy to kill in one turn making this a relatively easier game
the bosses have been divided up into different hit zones a la vagrant story
if you quotkillquot a subpart of the boss you get extra experience and money than if you just killed it outright
a nice idea
if a boss is giving you trouble you can just kill it quickly or you can lengthen the battle by taking it out piece by piece
when it loses a body part it also loses an attack
players will be reminded of the reactor battle in parasite eve  the boss battles however have a nasty tendency to be fairly easy as well
there are special attacks that the character can do when it gets enough fp and these can be cool or they can be really dumb
its your decision
the nice thing about fp though is that it doesnt go away if you use a simple skill only if you use one of the four character skills and your base starting fp goes up with your level
example at level  when a battle starts you will have  fp
some i never understood why they were there so i never used them
wild arms also has summoned monsters in the form of creatures called mediums that you attach to your character and you can summon them in battle if a certain character was in your party
the music is really cool
there is a nice spanishsounding trumpet during the beginning anime of the game
although i think only music lovers will know what a spanish trumpet sounds like
the only negative about the music is that the tracks are awfully repetitive to the point where it repeats itself ever  seconds
bad parts
game really should be analog not digital
i have a strong belief that rpgs and action games should be analog nowadays and anything less is kinda sad
i would understand if it was made in  or  but this was made in  late  if i remember correctly not only that but the game is in xenogearslike d analog is not an option but a nessecity
other than the control the items should of been described
some are self explanatory gee i wonder what a healing nut does
others you sit and look and go quoti dont know what that doesquot they really should of described the items rather than forcing you to hold the triangle button since it doesnt prompt you on the screen to press it for describtion
there is also a system called searching
towns castles dungoens and whathaveyou are not shown on screen
you have to find them using a little dinky radartype thing
this could make things go on forever if you have to search out a town in a giant desert this does happen too
and now for a random thought
all the bosses have really cool names attached to them
like the garanguatuan little piggy eater grandol
this ones made up but that is what they look like
i just thought that it was funny
why dont other game bosses have funny names
stupid question i knowi dont know how but when these games originally came out i never really noticed them
now im delving back into this older series
i already finished wild arms  and thought it was a decent game so here i am ready to start number 
will it be as good as or even better than the original
lets find outgraphics score  well the graphics are certainly a step up from the original wild arms which were quite primitive for the time
the problem of course is that while these graphics are better they are still quite primitivelooking for the time this was released  which was the same year are final fantasy ix
now it may not be fair to compare this game to a game that no doubt had bajilliontytons of money poured into it
still it does look rather dated for its time and if you dont believe me just look up some screen shots of the game
on the bright side the intro animation for both discs is done in a nice anime style which as we all know is timeless and classic and ages well
too bad we never see those anime cutscenes ever againmusic score  the music is decent
its what id expect from a decent rpg but its not spectacular or anything
the only tracks that really stood out to me were the westernsounding whistley intro music on the startup of both discs
those were awesome bu the rest of the soundtrack is pretty standard fare
i certainly wouldnt run out and buy the soundtrack but nothing grated on my ears and i felt it was good enough to push the games scenes along
no problems herecharacters score  you start off with three main characters ashley brad and lilka
you play a prologue section to introduce each in turn
later three more characters will join the party but it takes a rather long time for them to join
these characters are not too bad they all have decent backstories to them but i did feel that they couldve used a bit more unique personality to them
still they werent the worst characters ive ever experienced
i wont say they are the most memorable characters or the most interesting but they are good enough to carry the game
the only real complaint i have is that a lot of the dialogue feels off somehow as though its been poorly translated or something
there are lots of points of dialogue that had me scratching my head in confusion and this hurt the characterization
now that was the main characters so what about the villains
well these arent the absolute worst villains ever but the game makes the horrible mistake of having villains that only explain their motivations right before they die thus having almost no development yeah im talking about all the cocytus members
as for the main villain you do get to know a bit more about him but he still comes across as a bit shallow
well thats all i am going to say on that to avoid any spoilersstory score  id have to say the story here is actually a bit better than the one in the the first wild arms game
it feels like theres a bit more to it
you start off in typical wild arms fashion by playing a small introductory segment with the three different main characters before they finally meet up for some common objective
these segments serve to introduce the backstory for each main character quite well
so what was that common objective they were meeting up for
well it turns out that they have been recruited by a weird old rich noble guy to be a special fighting force to solve problems in the world
as im sure you can imagine this leads to them saving the whole world in typical rpg fashion
however there are plenty of twists and turns that im not going to give away that keeps things interesting
although its not the greatest rpg story ever conceived of or told im pleased enough with it
on a side note for anyone wondering if this game is a chronological sequel to the first wild arms the answer to your question is i dont know
it does seem to be set in the world of filgaia and has lots of references to the original as though it could chronologically take place  years in the future or something
its rather hard to tell if thats the case or if the developers just wanted to drop in a bunch of references for fun but didnt intend it to be a direct sequel
i just dont know
now there is one last thing to discuss  i dont know exactly why but this games pacing feels really sluggish
even though i was mostly enjoying myself i kept feeling like the game was dragging on and on weird i know
i dont know if the plot just moves too slowly or if theres too much filler but i kept feeling like id been playing  hours already then looked at the ingame clock to see itd only been  hours
i mostly enjoyed myself but the game couldve been trimmed down a bit and not suffered for itbattle system score  if youve played the first wild arms this battle system should seem very familiar to you
if you havent played the first game then you might be initially a bit confused
the battle menu appears as a series of little squares arranged in a cross shape
i find this irritating because id prefer proper words instead of tiny pictures
anyway if you press and hold the triangle button itll tell you what each symbol means
once you get used to that its just your basic menudriven rpg
you have an attack command item command the ability to use special moves etc
one nifty feature is that when youre walking around and get into a random battle if you press the square button or the o button quickly enough you can sometimes avoid the battle altogether
thats pretty cool
the only real difference from the first game and many other rpgs in general is how the magic casting works
in wild arms theres this thing called fp
its built up during battle by getting hit and performing attacks and its used mostly to perform special moves
in wild arms  magic is also treated as a special move requiring the use of fp instead of the traditional mp system that almost every other rpg uses
while this is rather nifty because you cant run out of mp in the middle of a dungeon anymore its also bad because you cant use any magic especially healing magic outside of battle
while this was a bit irritating at first due to my being used to the typical mp system i eventually got used to it and it didnt bother me anymoregameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
i was hoping i wouldnt see this again but unfortunately the stupid dashing system makes a return
basically if you hold the x button your character will dash forward
you cannot control what direction they run in until you either release the button or they crash stupidly into a wall
its really irritating when every other rpg on the planet just lets you run like a normal person
speaking of running theres no analog control for this game despite it coming out late in the playstations lifespan
thats just ridiculous
on top of that irritant theres also the issue of diagonal movement
there are several points in the game where you need to specifically angle your character diagonally often on a tiny narrow path that you can fall off of in order to shoot something
its very difficult to do this with the arrow pad and no proper analog control which is quite irritating
i have realized though that you can move the camera angle to point towards the target at an angle and this makes it infinitely easier to angle yourself properly this feature wasnt present in the original wild arms
its still rather irritating though
oh and while im on the subject of irritating game design lets talk about the search function
you cannot see towns and stuff on the overworld map like a normal game
you have to press the square button every few steps before the town youre looking for will appear
as if that werent annoying enough the towndungeon youre looking for wont even appear unless youve spoken to a specific npc or read a sign or something telling you about that place
i dont know who thought this mechanic was a good idea but they were clearly insane
this is one of the most tedious and pointless game mechanics ive come across in a long time and it shouldnt have been done
sigh well thats all my complaints
to be fair the rest of the gameplay is fine enough but those annoyances really stand out to meoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
id have to say that i really enjoyed myself with this game overall and thats its a bit better than the original wild arms at least in the story
anyway if youre a fan of rpgs and are looking to reach into the ancient backlog of the ps then go ahead and give wild arms  a try youll probably enjoy yourselfwild arms  like most sequels would have the incredibly hard task of following the series dynamite debut back in  while many think that sequels never attain the level of the original thus the theory of diminishing returns wild arms  holds up pretty well overall but doesnt really break any new ground for the seriesgraphically wild arms  pretty much follows in the path of its predecessor in that the game has it high and lows
environments such as towns dungeons and world map are now completely d unlike the first game and are very well done with lots of detail  as one would expect a last generation psx title
unfortunately like the original the graphics in the battle scenes are still behind the times thats somewhat of an understatement
while they are better than first games you can tell that this element of the game probably recieved the least attention from the development team
while theyre not horrible it leaves you wondering what could have beenstorywise wild arms  delivers another interesting and engrosing tale as the original did even though this time it does take a little but longer for things to get rolling but not to the point as in star ocean the nd story
however once the story gets going their is no turning back the story is the main reason i like this game the way i do  it has some great twistscharacter development is strong as well but not as strong as in the first installment
this is probably due to the fact you get  characters  is hidden in this game in contrast to having just three characters in the first game
having more characters means having less time to spend developing each one but is a very welcome change from the first game and is a tradeoff that works in favor of the game
i only wish that they empolyed this in wild arms as for battle system wild arms  ditches magic points in exchange for the force point system
overall this works pretty well but theyre are more than a few occasions where you wish your abilties used mp instead fp
this is especially apparent when fighting the optional foes
due to the fact a character loses all their fp when knocked out their are points youll find you cant defend or cast anything upon revival until you build up more fp
more often than not against the optional foes theyll knock you into subbmission before you can build your fp back up
this isnt as big of problem with fighters as it is with magetype characters who rely on thier fp to cast spellswild arms  is also the hardest out of the three wild arms games
there is no duplication trick like the first game and you cannot buy goat dolls an automatic revive upon knockout item as in wild arms
this and the situaution with the force points system makes the extra boss battles in wild arms  much harder than anything found in wild arms and wild arms  basically there is no easy solutions to some of the optional battles in wa you just gotta use pure skill or dumb luckwhile not an amazing game or sequel wild arms  is well crafted game worthy of any rpg freak or gamers playing hourswhen you look at the instruction manual it seems as though three characters are the only characters you can control through to the end
in a lot of other rpgs characters other than main ones are considered as subcharacters and they usually stay in your party for certain length
but instead socalled subs are as important to the game as the main onesi thought the game captured a lot of human dramas such as love trust friendship and importantce of each individual
i really liked the way each characters personality was revealed and developed throughout the game
this includes finding out about their own identity strengths and weaknesses what friends are for and many othersin terms of gameplay it is reletively easier than the first wa
d rotation enables you to view the map from different angles which helps to find hidden secrets
this concept is very similar to dragon warrior i found puzzles very easy and hardly had any trouble getting through any of them
i think the puzzles from wa are lot harder and clever than wamusic is slightly better than the last one but it still sounds repeatitive especially when you are solving puzzles
animated movies are played each time you load the game which are different depending on which disc you are onpersonal skills are very useful when you are struggling with certain bosses but they are relatively easy to beat
the other new feature is a player can decide whether or not to go into battles with some exceptions
this can be very useful when you want to get through the dungeon or get to certain places more quickly but the downside of it is it can become a bad habbit therefore you may need to spend a quite a lot of time building up your charactersit is very shameful that the game does not support analog controller although it could make things a little bit more difficult at certain spotsthis game has very good storyline and the gameplay is easy to learn
just keep in mind that this was released in  in japan so do not expect great graphicswelcome to th century england where lord palethorn has found part of an ancient book of sorcery which should look kinda familiar and basically manages to repopulate the world with zombies and other critters as he does the quotgo off and rule the worldquot thingsir dan wakes up in a museum with only his own detachable arm as a weapon to start off with he finds a sword pdq and goes off to fight evil finding some interesting characters weapons and puzzles along the waythis game has some cool elements like being to pop your head off stick it on a crawling hand and basically run around like quotthingquot from the adams family
it also has a neat storyline and of course hacking and slashing is always a blastthe play control needed a little help howeverthe camera angles kinda drive you nuts and life is hard to come by
some of the bosses are a little hard to kill and when you go to the next level your little battered lifemeter is really frustrating as you get wasted by everything
sometimes its best to make sure you save between levels them beat the level your on again with fewer accidentsalso if you make too many misjumps which is easy to do every one costs you an entire bar of life the green smoke only provides about  points of recovery then it goes byebye
if you make a lot of mistakes in a certain area youll pay for it latercool game had a lot of fun with it looking forward to midieval iii should they decide to make onesir dan in the future with a lightsaber or something might be kinda cool
 i just hope they make the camera angles friendliergraphics   a bit unclear in places but you can definitely see how much effort when into making these creatures look fabulous and making the towns look realisticsound   the best thing about this game
the sound is thunderous and fabulous it literally takes you into the times of medievilvalue   you wont play this game much if you not really willing to be very strategic but its definitely worth the money for a few weeks entertainmentoverall   medievil  is intelligent entertaining and is put together nicely its very worth playing but only if you have the time to solve all the complex problemspicking up where the first left off once again we join the fight
i havent gotten very far in this game but i can see that it is pretty much like the first
decent graphics and humor surround you and a nice plot line is unfolding
definately worth the bargain price saw the release of medievil on the playstation
it was a fantastic game and top of the platform genre rivalled only by crash bandicoot and possibly wild  it was set in medievil times obviously and although a bit easy was value for money as it is an enjoyable game from start to finish
the only glitches are the already mentioned lifespan of the game and a few camera anglesfastforward two years and the sequel is somewhat dissapointing
gone are the atmospheric medievil levels such as the sleeping village the pirate ship the time zone one and the one in the castle
instead we have a museum an observitory and kew gardens
these levels were nowhere near as good as the ones in the previous game for they had a lot more atmosphere and had a more medievil style about them
there were still a few glimpses of the levels from the first game kensington the sleeping village perhaps
 cathedral spires and wulfrum hall are the highlights of the gameapart from the above there are no major differences
the camera angles are just as good but can be just as bad
the control of the character is exactly the same and there is little change in the graphics
the major letdown is the length
after the challenge of the first game this was even easier to complete
if you have the choice of buying a top class platformer then i strongly recomend medievil  or crash  though these can be a little easy
if your looking for a challenging platformer then buy wild i know ive slated the game quite badly in this review but it is still a lot better than some games ive played
a bgrade platformer verging on the edge of a
a few more levels and this is one of the best games ever but after the superb original this is a little dissapointingif youve played other japanese rpgs then you have a good idea of what youll get from this
i picked this as my introduction to the genre as i wanted to play a regular or average jrpg first to establish a good baseline as a comparison to the games id play later oni had a blast playing it
over  hours most people will take less time  im a grinder of playing time is a spectacular bargain considering that youll pay far less than  for it
the melodramatic story was a particular joythe most annoying part was the addition combat
maybe im totally inept but i was never able to hit a level  combo and usually missed the level s
since the most powerful combos go up to level  that can be a problem
but you can still win the game without doing well in addition combat  there are artifacts in the game that will allow you to hit the additions all the timei could go on but it would all be repeating things from other reviews
the main reason im posting this review is to help out the ps players who experience lockups or freezes that keep them from completing the game
i had that problem as well and was able to fix itfirst off i experienced rare random crashes but was always able to restore from the last save and continue the game without that crash repeating
save oftenthere are  boss fights that will crash the game if you use dragoon mode
at the end of those fights after the experience points roll up the game will just freeze
it will happen every time if you use dragoon mode in these boss fights
btw the game has a lot of boss fights
theyre very entertainingthe solution to the first  fights is not to use dragoon mode
at that point in the game your characters are at least as powerful without dragoon mode anyway
you just use different tactics to win
those  fights are vs lenus  regole at the end of disc  and the boss battle at aglis on disc the rd boss fight is the final one against the big bad
the solution is  dont worry about it
go ahead and use dragoon mode
it doesnt matter if the game locks up because the games over after you win anyway
you still get to see the closing credits and what happens to each character and so on
it might be possible to win the last battle without dragoon mode but that fight is such a struggle it took me over  minutes to win on the first attempt that i wasnt interested in trying it again without using dragoon modesumming up
good game and if crashes on your ps you can work around itquotlegend of dragoonquot is similar to final fantasy games in that the battles are turnbased involve weapons items and spells and players get the option to levil up their characters for stronger attacks and more hp
on  its own it is a fun satisfying and worthwile game
but it definitely doesnt hold a candle to the ff gamesthough the battle system is familiar to any rpg fan it is the graphics that really give this game the edge
boasting quot years in the making with a design team of over quot their efforts were well spent
the battles are challenging enough while the enemies are challenging and diverse
in terms of control it is similar to most of the ff games so it doesnt take long to master battles and manouvering
as the game progresses the characters get stronger allowing them to inflict even more damage
overall this is a challenging and rewarding gamebut sadly this game is tainted by a few minor flaws
the cliched quotunlock the mysteries of the pastquot plot is nothing we havent seen before add to this the paper thin characters that we couldnt care less about
there are some technical flaws that need addressing
first the number is items that can be carried
why is it that you can carry  quotarmedquot items weapons and armor but you can only cary  standard items like healing potions and cure potions which is what you most often need
another flaw is that unlike the free roaming of ff games you are confined to the dotted lines on the world map
so there is little room for exploration
one thing that particularly bugged me about this game is that the plot is so linear meaning that the side quests that we enjoyed with chrono trigger and final fantasy  are not prevelant herebut these are minor flaws considering that the point of the game is to fight until the end to save innocent people from bloodshed
this is not a deeply involved rpg but rather more like an action  game with rpg undertones
not bad at allill admit this game isnt perfect and other rpgs for the ps have better graphics animation characters storyline though this is one great storyline and certainly more emotion i felt very little remorse for any of the charactersgt however this game has one fully unique feature that sets its combat system above any i have ever played the additions
a quick explanation the additions are combos that require precision tapping of the x buton or o button when an enemy counters you this can get extremely hard as theyll likely counter during the hardest part of the combo
each addition is different the paces get harder as you go but my god its rewarding to see a completed addition and watch the enemy fry
ive seen many games that incorporate combos but never an rpg that incorporates them so effectivelyother pros include the animation sequences though they sometimes appear in the most unlikely and random spots in the game whereas others that should have animation do not the voicessounds the looong storyline lots of twists and of course the dragoon transformations
cons include the poor world map you have to move in select lines you do not have free roaming like ff games the cheesiness oh yeah on a scale of  this game ranks an  in cheesiness and no were not talking about cheddar and the other bits i added earlieroverall a fine game a bit in the shadow of other games that came out near this ones release such as ff which lacks in storyline but is far superior in graphicsanimation but it has enough unique qualities to stand alone and it really boils down to the combat sequences with the help of additions and dragoon transformationsthis game has a certain charm that can appeal to younger folks
i do think seasoned rpgers will be disappointed though
customization is pretty weak
story is not bad but theres certainly been better
graphics and cutscenes are beautiful
battle system is kinda fun
leveling up takes foreverfirst disc was yawner for me
almost gave up on the game
nd and rd disc however was worth the waitits not a bad game at all
there was effort here
seasoned rpgers expecting complexed strategies and menus like final fantasy or the chrono series should probably avoid this
i can understand why people like this game
but i can understand others that dontlegend of dragoon is the closest thing you can get to final fantasy without actually having final fantasy
the characters are interesting and the plot is immensely creative
the combat system needs a little work though it relies on well timed button taps and if you dont get them just right you wind up doing virtually no damage and some bosses are just a little too hard even by normal boss standards
this game has countless hours of gameplay though and once you get into it i gaurantee your family will be seeing very little of you for quite a while
have funlegend of dragoon was a good rpg
the battle system consisted of the traditional turnbased battles
each charcter had  to  unique combos that you had to learn
yes had to without the combos fights are pretty futile
the boss fights are very fun to play and watch as your charcters as well as bosses do flashy exagerated moves
that alone makes battles funner than your average rpg
the storyline is pretty original with its share of twists
all is not well however for the game takes a serious downfall in character design
youd find yourself thinking quothavent i seen him in another rpgquot to make matters worse due to the characters wearing obvious colors quotvia  power rangersquot youll know your future party members before they even join
this game kept me occupied for a good while
characters didnt interest me but the combo learning and flashy boss fights saved itlegend of dragoon  is one of those role playing games that definitely gets credit for a story and events straying from typical
these warriors obtain these gems that allow them to transform into armored warriors and slightly change the course of battlethe game features some nice cutscenes nice graphics some interesting characters and an interesting plot only brought down by some uninspired or drab locales a somewhat predictable or cliched set of events and a few annoying voice oversgraphics prerendered backgrounds that are quite lovely
beautiful and action packed fmv sequences that are definitely worth watching
transformations that are eye catching
some of the character models are a little blocky however they animate quite well in and out of battle
they animate with such fluidity fit the game quite wellsound the music wasnt exactly epic but it worked
some of the music was a little monotonous but it was suitingsound effects were quite pleasant
earlier in the game you could hear the rushing of the water
every action had a suiting sound effectthe voices were both good and bad
the voices of the characters fit them perfectly but some of the voice acting didnt quite fit with some of the actions of some of the characters they were good for the most part thoughstory the story was quite enjoyable and unique
the story didnt drag too much and kept its pace
the one thing i can say is that the story itself didnt deviate too muchor at least the events that occurred during the story
everything just falls into place nicely
the fact that the game revolved around warriors able to harness the power of dragoon armor was pretty coolgameplay the gameplay is typical rpg fare
it seems the two ways to determine gameplay lies within how exploration takes place and how battles are played
exploration takes place as most of the rpgs do the battle is turnbased
fighters can time their attacks using x to do a combo attack that can take more damage than just initiating an attackyou can also transform into dragoons during battle which actually add to the strategy of battles
there is a basic attack that requires you to time your button presses which like the character chaincombo attacks can deal more damage the more times you press the attack button at the right timei recommend this game to anyone whos looking to play an rpg that is a little different in terms of characters and abilities
the sailor moonesque element this game has definitely makes it different from a lot of the other rpgs out there
it isnt quite the final fantasy vii that the back of the box or perhaps reviews made it sound to be but it is quite good and worth the tryit seems like the classic games will always have a place on my shelf
i do think this game is good but have never beaten it yetlegend of dragoon was said to be one of the psone rpg game that could be compared with the final fantasy series
this game does have a very good story with twist of plots
the in game movies are really good and with good sound effects and voice over
the environments in the game are also very well done and detailed made which is a huge credit for the game
this game also adopt both types of battle encounters  random and touch base which feels like utilising both ways to attract gamers to play it
the battle system is very final fantasy indeed
turn based menu with different commands
the biggest feature is the addition which requires skillful timing to get the biggest damage on the enemies
nonetheless it will be frustrating if you are in a boss fight and just missed one button that your cant finish the addition
the upside is you can purchase item but at high cost to ask the computer to finish the additions perfectly for you
also the enemies will counter attack you if additions are done manually which adds the difficult in physical attacks
magic attacks are limited to using magical items which lacks flexibility
at the same time you can only hold  items at one time further limits your flexibility as some useful items are reuseable and must be kept to get your through the games that leaves limited space for magical items considering you will need to use a lot of healing items if you characters levels are not high enough
the most annoying part of the game is the snail pace levelling up
since all the experience points are shared by all members in the battle this largely reduces the points each character can get in a single battle
considering at a certain level you need more than  thousand points to level up and every battle just earns you  points
this might be the reason that many people just finish the game with great effort at level  the highest level you can get for your characters is  but it will take you more than  hours to get most of your characters to that level
after level  the character will continue to receive experience points but without levelling up another annoying part is sometimes the character selection screen just pop up without a reason and you will find that your original party was moved and substitute by other characters which will then require you to choose again without a reason
also good items are very difficult to find and some of them cost you a huge fortune to get
the development of the characters are also not as flexible as those in final fantasy for you can only equip them with certain stuff and some of those stuff are really useless
anyway the game does have a good story and some good graphics considering it is a psone game
just need to bear with those pretty annoying characteristics of the gamefirst off id like to say i should not be the judge of this game because ive barely even started it
i should not be the person to tell you whether or whether not you should buy this gamegraphics
youll either love them or hate them i loved them
its a mixture of really good d backgrounds and dd peoplesound
the voice acting there is is pretty good
other than that everything is just averagecontrol
not much to say
easy to pick up and playcinemas
arent too many but are sweat graphics and pretty cooloverall fun
this is a unique fun game with few flawswhat can you say about a vmufirst always buy the real deal not a third party product
ive seen so many other bad reviews about rd party vmu devices that i wouldnt consider getting a nonsega
go buy them now though because hardware will soon be quothardquot to come by
ive still found several of these in retail stores but nowhere online unless you get used
unfortunately it looks like people selling used are asking over twice the normal priceyes it holds  blocks we all know that and we all know that it shows little pretty pixelated icons to represent the game you are playingmaybe im the only one who tried this but if you are playing a two player game and you have your vmu in the nd controller you cant see an icon on it or access it
as soon as i moved the vmu back to the first controller voila the icon and the option to access itpersonally i havent played any little tiny games on it but i have taken my saves with me to other units with ease
if you are going to play games on it just get a game boy
atleast they have colour screens and you can see them anyway
the only downside on this is that i have lost the little cap that goes on the end of it because the controller doesnt have a little place on it to store the cap when you have the vmu installedsothe lesson learned is that if you remove the blue cap dont forget where you put it while you are using the vmu because its good to protect the connectoids when transporting it to and fromso far ive used the same vmu for  games and no issues with saving retrieving or accessing
they should make this in other colours like grape or auberginei really liked this game
i think that i hyped it up too much in my mind after enjoying the first one so much
i still think i like the first one better
i play both still but the first is my favorite
maybe its just the if it aint broke dont fix it kinda thing
i recommend getting it
the new characters are a lot of fun and the new courses are great tooyour proto typical classic psone game
very fun not much else tp say about it
if you like the hot shots series i would recommend itplay baseball in the comfort of your own home
theres no shortage of baseball games for the pc especially with humongous entertainments addition to the backyard sports series
continuing the same tradition found in its other backyard sports games you are the coach and you have the choice of choosing your own players including pros like ivan rodriguez former ranger juan gonzalez and unbeatable randy johnson to name a few
only in this game theyre kids
backyard baseball provides a wealth of options that are adaptable to your skill level and preferencesi brought in a pricey year old consultant to test the product
it took a little time to get set up and going but once we had everything figured out we knew our way around the field of dreams a basic neighborhood field or you can move up to bigger and fancier fields
the game was set on the easy level that allowed her to hit every pitch at which she swung
after she finished her game her team the rangers lost and it was no surprise i changed the level to medium and it was very tough to hit the ball
time passed and the adults got the hang of itlater the dad got hooked on the game  so its great for adults too
not only do you get pro ballers you get regular kids with personality including a clumsy girl and a rock n rollin boy who do their shtick while at bat or on the field
this makes the game more entertaining and a bonus is that you can play other players and get software bug fixes while connected to the internetthe only thing i wish it had was the ability to create team names from scratch instead of limiting the coach to stock names
other than that the game is batting this is a great baseball game i liked it better than triple play baseball and i do own bothit is both cheaper and better than triple play and the other ps baseball gamesso you think what makes this game so speciala lot of thingsfor striking out a batter you get a special which can be used  timesto name just a few elevatorheatercorkscrew and spitballa heater is the same as a fastballbut thrown twice as hardi think most of you know what a spitball isan elevator is my favorite pitchthat i have unlocked yetanyway
after the pitcher releases the baseball it rolls on the ground but when it reaches the plate it goes where you wanted to throw itcorkscrew looks like a slowball until it reaches the plate spins around a few times then goes where you wanted it to goplus you just keep unlocking more when you strike someone outnow to the battingyou have a little white symbol shaped like a bat which you move around you see a baseball which is where the pitcher is going to throw the ballthere are four boxes on the right side of what you hope to do with the ball if you make contactpowerline drive which is defaultgrounder or buntat first it is a little hard making contact but in a short period of time you will be getting hits easilybecause the players are kids not prosthey make mistakes often on easyi mean cpu playersyou can beat out a buntbeat out a grounderturn a single into a doubleturn a doubles into triples into homerunswhich is very excitingthis is what makes the game so greatcool batting and great pitchingalso if you get a double playyou get what is called an undergrounderit is one of the hitting choices with line drivegrounderetcetcthe undergrounder is very cool when you hit the ball it goes underground for a whileduring this time your hitter runs the bases then when they have touched second the ball pops out of the outfield wallin the confusion your player is still runningif the opposing team has great defense you will get a tripleif they have bad defense you will get an inside the park homerunhitting is overall goodnow to defensedefense is ok but could have been betteryou click the ball to get it not very entertainingbut okrunning the bases is fun click to go to next baseclick a small icon in the upper left corner to stealoverall the best baseball game i have ever playeda must buythe only reason i didnt give it five stars is because the defense isnt greatthe arcade version of darkstalkers vampire hungersaviourwas a great dark fighting game with a lot of atmosphere that doesnt translate real well to the playstation
the variety of characters is quite good and the  game play is identical to that of other capcom fighting titles ie
street  fighter
the amount of characters available is what saves this game
it  lacks the classic factor of street fighter but lacks the improvements of  d fighters like mortal kombat
if you can find it cheap it may be worth  the cost but the quality of this game does not demand that you buy it
fighting game fans who want a large selection may enjoy it but if you want  a good d get sf or mk or move on to the ds with something like soul  bladedarkstalkers   circa good good balanced d fighter an old school fighter that really stands out art style or theme wisebad loading times short but still there not much bonuses the games art style or theme is not for everyonewill it fit your taste really off the wall lookingacting fighters based on old hollywood b movie monsters but with anime look and feel surprisingly plays similar to street fighter alphagame its most assocated too samurai showdown  guilty gear originaladditional notes practicality same game on sega saturn and playstion portable darkstalkers franchise has been through a few names the original was called darkstalkers and the second was called night warriors darkstalkers  has all fighters and moves from darkstalkers and night warriorsthis game was good at firstbut after a while it gets boring unlike usual fighting games that i could play hours on end
i dohoweverthink it was clever that they tried to mix horror and put it into a fighting game
all the characters and more are back from the arcade version but the lack of frames compared to the arcade version will disappoint youthe main reason i got this game was because i enjoyed playing marvel vs capcom and it had not yet come out on the playstationmy favorite character was morriganso the main reason i got this game was for morriganok  i played this game when it originally came out and sold it back because my annoying roomate kept bothering me hence hindering my playing time with it
so i stoppedi bought the game from amazon a year ago and have picked it up recently
this game has very innovative character sketches which are among the best ive seen in any game
art is the correct word for it along with a greatcreepy story
these are only details thoughthe first time i played it i didnt fully understand the weapon system which is the integral meat and potatoes in this game
if you dont align separate weapons to specific affinitiesenemy classes you will not get far at all
you will find yourself battling enemy bosses and only blasting single hps of damage due to malalignment of weapons
it is trial and error
it is frustrating
playing it now is rewarding knowing this information
vs is a dungeon crawler no doubt but it is also a quest to find specific creatures that will help create a devious arsenal of weapons that will only progress ashley further in the game
this aspect of the game is a steep learning curve for newbies but it is rewarding when the weapons get strongermy ranking of square games that ive played ffvii
front mission  a must own
vagrant storythis game is not perfect as the famitsu review would lead you to believe
famitsu has only given like  games a perfect score this being one of themthe characters design music story atmosphere and presentation are all top notch and beautiful
the story is sursprisingly mature and the characters are all memorable especially that mystery man sydneyso if all of those things are so good and put together why did this game ultimately fail when it was released
because of its gameplaythe gameplay could have been fun and classic but the makers decided to bog it down with a tremendously confusing tedious and unintuitive menu and weapon systemthe base of this game its weapon system is beyond complicated
each weapon can be either piercing blunt or edged like a edged sword or a blunt hammer
then each weapon has about  affinities such as light water physical undead etc
then throw in the fact that each weapon must be made from seperate parts such as a blade a grip or hilt plus  gems
lost yet
you should bebut thats not all
each weapon has damage points kind of like health for weapons and phantom points which inscrease special attacks
throw in the fact that the longer you fight the more tired or excited your character gets which leads you to miss more often and take more damage as the battle goes onthis game does have an awesome quick menu that can be used with the l button
this menu lets you do anything from find items to use magic with one push of a button
however for some reason there is no weapon quick menu in a game almost totally based around your weapons
to change weapons and you will often you have to make about  clicks through slow menus which can take anywhere from  secs to a minutethis games difficult learning curve has turned away so many players without the patience to learn this games ridiculous systems
after all hitting a boss for  damage when he has  health can be very frustrating and i dont blame themin the end this game is both brilliant and ridiculous
it has been voted one of the greatest games of all time and for good reason
but it also failed on a commercial and gameplay level by not selling enough copies
and thats for a good reason toothis game is about to get a lot of attention more attention than its had in the years since its spring  us release
final fantasy xii looms on the horizon and its the creative vision of yasumi matsuno
vagrant story is another of matsunos brainchildren
once ffxii has been out for a couple of weeks and everybodys beaten it a lot of those people are going to find out about vagrant story for the first time and go scrambling over to ebay to get a copy
this review is for themalmost everything about vagrant story is par excellance
the story the script the characters the graphics the soundtrack the english translation is especially spectacular due to its masterful coloring with olde english which adds so much flavor to the tone and atmosphere
this is one of the ultra rare cases where the english translation is arguably far superior to the original japanese script
unfortunately all of these shining examples of fine craft and video game design as true art is all for naught because of one single fatal flaw the game simply isnt fun to playwhere the game ultimately fails is in the game play
first of all the game is extremely focused
its all dungeon crawling and fighting
there are no towns to explore and shop in no npcs to talk to no minigames
once you enter the dungeon thats it
you will progress through different areas and get a change in scenery from time to time but there is almost no variety in the gameplay
you move from room to room you solve the occasional crate puzzle and you fight enemies
end of storythe battle system in and of itself is fine
its an interesting hybrid cross between standard real time action combat and traditional rpg turn based combat
the problem is at the very heart of the battle system is an abysmally unfun weapon and armor system
there are several eight
classes of enemies in the game beast human dragon undead phantom etc
the enemy classes are paired off into diametric oppositions
eg
using your weapon against a human enemy will make it stronger against humans but weaker against phantoms
sic on top of that there are specific weakness ratings
an enemy might be weak against blunt weapons but almost totally impervious to edged weapons or piercing weapons
and then there are the usual elementals as well fire ice earth and so on
finally each of your weapons has its own wear rating
the lower the rating the more worn out the weapon the less damage it does
you must repair your weapons in workshops which are few and far between in the game
another thing you can do in workshops is disassemble your weapons and reassemble the parts to make new weapons
whether the new weapon will be better or worse than the weapons you sacrificed to make them involves much trial and error
the end effect of all of this is that as you play the game you are literally constantly changing weapons
yet the creators of the game didnt bother to implement any sort of quick menu for weapon switching a la secret of mana
you have no choice but to spend  of your game time opening the main menu opening the weapon menu finding the right weapon opening the accessory menu changing the elemental jewels on the weapon etc
etc
etc
all they had to do was come up with some sort of quick menu for changing weapons as seiken densetsu  did seven years earlier
as it stands vagrant story is a micromanagement nightmare
to call the game tedious is an understatement of epic proportions
there are those who insist that a viable alternative is simply slogging your way through the game using whatever weapons you happen to have whether theyre effective or not
it can be done but it makes the game even less fun
why anyone would want to take on a boss with several thousand hp by doing only  points of damage per hit is beyond meas is always the case no matter how flawed a game may be there will be a small niche group of vocal supporters who insist that its the greatest game ever created and that people who dont like it just dont get it
beware of misguided fanatics
but hey then again you just might end up being part of the  of people who play this game and come away thinking its the bees kneesedit apparently the star ratings arent displayed exactly as they were input
i gave vagrant story   for fun and   overallthis is one of those games square released that seems promising but falls short in one or many of waysthe bulk of the game takes place in a dungeon
you guide ashley through a series of rooms all while battling bats and cavedwelling creatures you come acrossthe battles take place in a real time fashion however fights run on a chain system
when you attack an enemy an exclamation point appears above ashleys head as an indication to press another attack button to continue your onslaught
ashley has a variety of weapons he can equip which changes the way he attacks his oppoenentinstead of hp ashley has an indicator starts out green to indicate full health that determines his health
it is divided by his arms body etc
when the health of a part of his body is depleted it is safe to say that that part of his body no longer functions until his health is restored
while the idea sounds cool he is only character under the players control
the game can be difficultexploration takes place in a dungeon
the player will reach a room where a spell is necessary to get through the door
sometimes the spells are easy to locate and other times the player must backtrack through many rooms to obtain the necessary spellthe graphics were among the best
the game had somewhat of a comic book feel to itthe character nicely animated and bore many details
the detail really brings a certain feel to the game and the dungeon despite being a dungeon actually looks quite nicethis is one of the few games i will say is completed for or less for its story and gratification not fun
there isnt much fun to be had as there is a lot of backtracking and scouting to be done with little or no deviation
the spells do add to the game but not muchprosgraphicsinteresting storyintriguing battle systeminteresting villainchilling atmosphereconstoo much backtrackingentire game takes place in a dungeonhow many bats must i fightwhere do i have to go nexti forgot which way i was goingcame fromif you must try the game out i recommend renting it first
if youre a die hard square fanatic love games with a dark feel or love dungeon crawlers you will like itthe new slim design of the ps is great
it just blends in with all the other av components around my tv
it isnt much larger then the cases that hold playstation gamesthe only thing i dont like about the new design is the topload disc player
the design is better no motorized drawer jams to worry about but the part that opens and closes feels really flimsy
not a good feel for the part that gets the most usecertainly a space saver this a great unit if you have a small area or running out of room on your av rack
top loading is a plus since it eliminates the need for moving parts
also an integrated  ethernet ports and ir for the dvd remote
the minus is the hdd
but only few games are able to run to a hard drive
but all the retail stores have this unit already why is amazoncom releasing this product oct 
as for overheating which was common in the older units will return is only issue im concerned aboutim happy i own a ps
i enjoy playing the games and theyre pretty goodsome of the great things sony did with their systems are worth a mention
at first i owned the  model
then i sold my unit after buying a  model which included the internet adapter and now plays dvds in anamorphic widescreen
my old model did not play them anamorphically
i bought the newer unit because i read an article in a videogame magazine that said there was a graphical improvement in models  and later
i dont remember exactly what the improvements were because i read it a long time ago
these newlyredesigned slim models make transportation easier
the power pack is now externally in the ac wire which means thats where all the weight went but the unit is still smalleralthough i prefer the new unit i have two things which are not really large enough to make complaints but they may interest people who are considering buying the new model or even replacing their old model with the new oneyou probably already know the newlydesigned ps cannot use the hard disk drive that was sold with the final fantasy game a while back
if you bought one of these you should keep your old oneanother feature that changed is the method of ejecting the disc from the player
i think the idea of this new design is pretty good for guys like me that like to keep their console close by when they go places however the disc now ejects differently
before one could eject a disc by pressing a button and a motorized tray ejected out of the face of the unit now it ejects like a portable cd player meaning it has a lid
when you press the button the lid pops upward and the disc must be pulled from a spindle in the topside if its lying flat
at first i thought the redisigned unit would now fit inside a certain spot in my entertainment center but i cannot do this because the disc now ejects out of the top and this means i need room around the top
not a big deal but a factorthats it but if i may be critical of sony for a moment without turning it into a smashing contest sony has always had one single flaw they never amend the accessorycompatibility issue
first in all of sonys ps  ps machines there are only two controller ports which means playstation games rarely have fourplayer modes so unless youre a james bond game fan you probably didnt pay the  for the multitap
this reinforces itself since most people only have two controller ports playstation videogame companies mostly make games that dont utilize the multitap
second although it isnt hard to get an older model of the ps again the hard disc drive doesnt work with this new model
third the first original playstation models had a sony linkcable port but the dual shock model and afterward including the redesigned psone model eliminated the port
this means games you could normally play multiplayer by connecting two playstations with the linkcable you cannot do this anymore
although not many people have the linkcable even fewer people have access to the feature now
perhaps this has nothing to do with the ps but it does help prove sonys history of designing a machine around its peripherals
in other cases the changes were virtually always inarguable improvements to their unit
why doesnt sony make four controller ports
i dont knowfirst off let me start by saying this is not going to be a ps bashing
though we all have our opinions on the three systems the fact is that they are all great systems in their own right
that is to say you wont go wrong no matter which one you chooselet me reiterate this is not a bad system
it has several great games final fantasy x  x grand theft auto series wwe smackdown series and several others
though it must be noted that gamecube and xbox both have great exclusive titles
the graphics are outstanding and they may not even be the best of the three but they are great certainly better than anything we had just a few short years ago
they definitely have more benefits than everybody else free online gaming the eyetoy and more games
as far as controllers go i like gamecubes a bit better but this controller works wonderfully well too and is well laid out
you wont be searching for the buttons like you do on xbox controllers that is my one true complaint with that systemone thing that irks me about the new design is the lack of support for the hard drive
its not a huge issue unless you want to play final fantasy xi or take advantage of hdd capability as with espn nflk
not a big deal but something could have been worked to support iti do like the smaller slimmer design
it certainly helps when you have many systems old and new and are lacking in space to have them all setup at once
you almost have to see it in person to truly appreciate the size reduction this thing has undergone
while the old one is regarded as somewhat of a clunker this thing is small sleek and powerful
i wish they could have found a way to include four controller ports should be an industry standard as opposed to just two
its not a big issue but a bit annoying for those who enjoy playing multiplayer sports gamesanyway playstation s biggest downfall is in the fragility of the system itself and though i have experienced no problems personally i have heard of a few from close friends
disc reading error this is very likely a nonissue with this newer model
malfunctioning disc door this is no longer an issue because the system is now toploading
the power cords tend to wear out faster than average
not a big deal the cords are fairly cheap but it could present a fire hazard
none of these things would be a huge deal except that the ps comes with a measly  day warranty do i hear  year anyone
im not trying to say this system is junk
it does have durability issues more than anything
some of these problems should be lessenedeliminated with the new model
i personally prefer gamecube but only by a small margin
all of you who immaturely spout ps rules gamecube  xbox suck are not only lying to yourselves youre doing a great disservice to the readers who depend on these reviews to make an important decisionthe bottom line is the playstation  is a great system and definitely worth the money but it is not gaming perfection as some make it out to be
try gamecube  xbox as well
all three are extremely funi havent owned a console game since the early atari because i didnt want even more hardware clutter to worry about
so i played pc games for years
the reason i switched to a console was to avoid clogging up my pc with software drivers peripheral hardware irq conflicts and other things that cause the blue screen of death in microsoft windowsthe question was which console to buy playstation  xbox gamecube or pspsony made the answer fairly easy the new ps is portable relatively inexpensive doubles as a cddvd player and most important has thousands of titles available with backward compatability both now and in the upcoming playstation the console is incredibly portable it has a wallwart for power however
the games ive played so far about a dozen have excellent graphics and gameplay
best of all the games workno crashes no fiddling with sound and video cards no blue screen of death
for all of microsofts babbling about plug and play playstation  is the only computer device ive seen that actually does itthe only reasonable competitor in terms of number of games available is xbox
but there are a lot of things going against xbox graphics vs price xbox  graphics are known for being better than ps but you have to be pretty picky to notice the difference
ps games look fantastic and just keep getting better
any difference that exists doesnt justify the price difference
not even close
portability xbox is a big clunker
ps is only slightly larger than the dvd cases the games come in
i can travel with it easily
the future ps is coming out in november  and it will surpass xbox  features in every way including hdtv
and it will play all previous playstation games
no guitar hero guitar hero is currently available only for the ps
and guitar hero is too good a game to miss
bill gates xbox is a microsoft product and microsofts legacy is to be known as the only company to consistently produce products that dont work for a quarter of a century
otherwise i would have been happy to keep my games and computer software all in one machinethe bottom line is that i had my ps playing games within minutes of opening the box have enjoyed them more than any pc game and it has never ever crashedno blue screen of death
if i decide to get a ps later i can still play all my current gamesand they just dropped the price by  in april the only thing i dont like about ps is the need to buy ridiculously expensive relatively gigantic memory cards to save games
mb cards sell for the same price you can buy a mb compact flash or sd card if you shop around
the memory card is expensive huge and unnecessary
if they can fit gb of memory into a tiny iriver mp player sony could have fit somethinganythinginto the playstation  but they wouldnt have sucked their customers dry of cash that way would they
it smells like macintosh when companies use proprietary hardware like that and the ps loses one star because sony resorted to this sleazy tacticotherwise the ps is a fivestar product
aside from the memory card issue i couldnt be happier with itthe ps slim is better than the original in that it operates a little faster its more space efficient and it has the upgrades such as the ir port for remote control access and all that
it seems a little frail if standing on its side with a stand but there are other aftermarket stands for horizontal and verticle that make it more sturdy
i used wireless controllers so i didnt worry about cords pulling the unit off the standif u want a ps u should get this but if ur new to gamming u should first get an xbox i just bought a ps for final fantasy
sony has really over priced there psi traded my xbox for a ps because the ps has far more and better games like the final fantasy series the resident evil series and a great list of rpg i think the ps wins because of the game list but nothing elsethis version of the ps is smaller than the original making it easy to carry and easier to break its true its more fragile and it can break if you are reckless with it
i play resident evil  was the reason i changed my xbox for a ps every day when i have my free time and i have experienced that the ps system overheats quickly after  hour of playing and i was like it cant be i touched my ps and it was very hot that i just needed to take a break from resident evil  or even put my own fan to cool it downhowever the playstation  can play dvds which makes it the only system of this generation that can play dvd without a kit ahem xbox
when i first put my cd into the ps system i noticed that there wasnt a big improvement since psx the magic lens are there and you can clearly see it
which means that if it gets dust or if you accidentally touch it your ps is gonei still dont know why the ps is best selling compared to xbox or gamecube maybe because of what i said about the game list
yes that is
the controller are the same as expected so dont expect any changes here sorrydont worry these are just minimal mistakes
ps is possibly the best console of this generation gulp is enjoyable due to the fact that you get to choose from a wide collection of games
you must buy it you wont be dissapointedwell i have to give it four stars because i havent had it for very long  months and i only have the ps to compare it to
so far however it has worked great
after owning a reliable fully functional ps for the last few years i expect nothing but the same from this gaming consolethe only problem ive had is that it doesnt seem to want to recognize one of my dance dance pads
strange
its not the pad because it still works with my ps
and the other pad works fine
shrug  i dont know what to say about thatyou can use your ps controllers on the ps so you dont have to buy extra stuff to play twoplayer games
the compact design may help it travel more but i dont intend to use it for thative been playing grand theft auto  san andreas mostly but ive rented other games and ive been happy with the way theyve all been running
the graphics are truly amazing
the processing speed blows my mindi dont know however if people shouldnt just wait for the ps to come out next year to me this current generation of games has remained one of the most unique and dynamic eras of all time especially for companies like nintendo with their compact and convient gamecube microsoft with the surrealistic experience with the xbox and the newly released xbox  and as well for sony
sony definitely catapulted their way nearly a decade ago with the successful playstation system
it really became the very first system to really push the limits of the cdrom technology where other systems like sega cd saturn and dreamcast have failed
now what was then still remains as nowthe sony playstation  is a much more powerful video game system that really delivers
this smaller thinner edition of the ps absolutely delivers to where other cdrom systems have fizzled
the video game system doubles up very nicely as a dvd player for all your movie watching need for films of all kinds
the game library remains absolutely endless for so many video gamers of all kinds that you can play here like jax ii the reved up gran turismo  madden  the highly acclaimed reseident evil  and many others
you also can play games on this system with the backwards compatability from the earlier ps pr psx
the control of the system is also as unique and similar to the previous edition but it is very simple to respond and easy to use for all gamersall in all with all the hype for the next generation consoles like the xbox  and the nintendo revolution the playstation  by sony is a absolute delight for all gamers of all kinds
even though i actually dont own a ps ive played it enough from friends and relatives to know that this game system is a really big bundle of fun
i absolutely recommend this video game systemprice bconvience agraphics asound bdvd capability bcontrol a fun  enjoyment bbackwards compatability on ps aoverall b the ps is just greatremake sony doesnt  need to think about a new little slick and slick design they really need to concentrate on making the next gen console ps
even though this is nice but i think its just about enough remakespsgames  there are many exclusives for the ps including jak  tekkn eye toy and moreand the system is backword compatible which is greatgraphics  great graphics
but not perfectwhat i would expect from the ps is revolutionary graphics that you dont get on a good pcthe xbox graphics are a bit better but the system is disgusting
and has less titlescontroller  its as simple as its gonna get
and simplecomfortable plus very good vibration almost anolog vibrationaccesories needed you gotta get a memory card not built in with online and why dont sony nintendo and microsoft sell an extra controller
outside apperanceps nice and pretty compact look at the xboxoutside apperance pstwo great compact thin small and slick designoverall ps overall pstwo  internal hard disk needed
i reccomend to get the ps
not xboxgamebubedreamcastsnes
nescomparing the xbox and the ps ps has the graphics and a good amount of good worth your time games
such titles such as the ace combat and final fantasy series make it a good balance between performance and games but it only has two controller slots and you have to buy the multitap adapter for four controllersi think that was a wrong move by sonythere arent that many multiplayer games that are fun enough to give your opponent that in your face attitude
there are still not enough games to appeal to people with different interests
most of the playstationonly games are quite the same
some concerns are that there have been complaints that the wires may fray and can be a danger and the cd tray might freeze or get jammed
if you treat your ps carefully you shouldnt have a problem
at least it can play dvdslook at amazons average ratingas of  and has been like this for a whilethe xboxavg customer rating   starsthe psavg customer rating   starsthe gamecubeavg customer rating   and a half starskeep in mind that there are hundreds of reviews for each of the three
it looks like the people are more satisfied with the gamecubethe nice thing about the new slimmer ps is that its smaller so its easier to carry around
it also has a builtin network adapter so you wont have to spend extra money on one
the only downfalls are that its more fragile than the original model it cant play bluediscs very well it has a tendency of getting warm way too fast and you cant connect an hdd to it
but thats ok because it has a built in online adapteri use this console when i play ps games and also ps games
sometimes i have to push the power button several times before the power goes off
that can be a little annoying
i prefer the playstation game console
it is so much easier to operate but it doesnt play ps games

en fin estoy muy satisfecho por haber adquirido este equipothe new designed ps is just under in long about in wide and barely over  in thick
its just a little bigger than a vhs tape
it has a top loading systemthe door pops up 
the hole in your game disk clicks into placejust like a portable cd walkmanits much much smaller than the first design
i love the small design
the only negative is no memory card is supplied
the main reason to own a ps is simply  theres just more games than other consoles
i also own an xbox 
which of course is the best of all consoles graphics wise plus its internal harddrive
but you need to buy a dvd remote to play dvds on the xboxthe ps plays dvds  right out of the boxso both consoleshave there little trick to squeeze a little more cash out of your pocket 
if you wanna improve graphics on your ps i strongly suggest you get either an s cable or a component cable
first look at the back your tv if you have a black input thats kinda funky lookingthats an s video input and underneath will be red and white for audio input
if you see any blue input than that means you have also component input which is the best video input for graphics
there mostly on expensive tvs
but most tvs have an s cable input which is better graphics than the supplied rca plugs redwhiteyellow that come with the ps
youll notice a difference in clearer graphics with the  s cable or even better the component cable
sony makes a good s cableabout 
ive tried the monster cables but i had some problems with my cable
id stick to the sony brand scablebut ive heard that madcatz scable at walmart for  is just as goodwith so many good games coming out on the xbox 
its hard for me to say the new ps is a good buy not because of qualitybut because of pricebut  aint bad and i got a memory card for  at circuit city
the ps has tons of games much more than the xbox
maybe wait until theres a good ps bundle but the the new ps design rocksits highly portablei have both systems xboxand ps
i like ps cause it has more games
i like the xbox because it has better quality graphicsalmost computer quality
if i was forced to own just one system
id probably go with ps because theres more games for that consoleand its very small nowand portableit would easily fit in a backpack
but with halo coming out i must keep my xbox which is my personal favourite console system
but the ps controller is the best designed
all in all the new designed ps gets my thumbs up for quality and designget it if you can afford it
all three consoles have there pros and cons
ill leave it up to you to make your choicei have to admit i was rather surprised i liked this game
when my brother gave me his dreamcast this was one of the games he gave me along with it
im not a fan of watching tennis and i cant play worth anything
but the game turned out to be fun
like most of the dreamcast sports games it isnt too difficult for a player like me one who doesnt play all the time and isnt a phenomenal player
the graphics are nice and game play is easy to figure out and really works well
there is a save option and the game turns out to be quite fun
i say yes if you are asking whether or not to pick up this gameyou cannot guess how many places i went to just to buy this game
every place i went to was sold out
it took me several weeks until i finally  located one
now i can understand why this game is so hot
the game is  great
the graphics and the motion of the characters are superb
it gives  you  game modes arcadewhich is just like the coinop arcade version  which i never get to play because theres always someone on it  exhibitionwhich is similar to arcade but you can change the different  settings and world circuitwhich is like a season mode where you start  off ranked  and have to work your way up by challanging other players
you also have to earn money to unlock secret characters clothing new  strings and others
whats cool about the world circuit is that it has  these minitype games similar to what crazy taxi hasthe biggest  disappointment is that it has real tennis players but no superstars such  as agassi amp sampras
they could have at least made a quotcreate a  playerquot mode
overall the game is simple
the buttons are easy to  remember no need to read the instructions
also the overall menu  operation isnt complicated at all
just think of it as pong with  outstanding graphicsremember how golf games were fun even though you didnt play golf
well this is the same way
its simple but when youre into it with friends it is an absolute blast
graphics were top notch for its day as well
if you have friends and a couple controllers do yourself a favor and spend the  cents it costs to buy this online
you wont regret it promisefor a tennis game this one is pretty good
considering i actually like tennis based video games for the most part including the wii sports tennis
this one here is great the graphics are good the game play is good
great for   players
very realistic looking and good graphics for its time
the dreamcast has good graphics anyhow in my honest opinion far as retro systems go 
the colors in this game alone are very vibrant and clear and realistic looking
if your picking up a dreamcast for the first time if your one like myself who goes back collects what you used to have or what you missed back then during your gaming history and curious as to some games to pick up for it
get this one its pretty good far as a sports game goesi am not an avid tennis fan
that being said anyone who owns a dreamcast needs to buy this game
the graphics are stellar it looks like a televised  broadcast
the difficulty is adjustible so that tennis impaired people like  myself can still compete
sure the big names are missing and there are no  female players but thats the only gripe i have
singles tests your ability  to read the other players style and adjust
doubles is great as you not  only have to recognize the opponents tendencies but also your partners as  well
and finally there are many training sessions that not only help you  hone your skills but are just plain fun
in fact i found the bowling pin  training session to be so much fun i play it over and over just for fun
this game has it all
strategy coordination technique practice and  training
its actually quite addictive
i find myself losing a match and  screaming at the tv while adjusting my strategy and when i finally beat  himi yell in victory
yeah my roommates are growing tired of my  yelling and cheering but it is the most fun ive had with the dreamcast in  awhilei give this game  stars because its a great game the best on any system until tennis k in this game you cant do much but what can be done is great this is very realistic tennis gameplay ecsept for the ball speed which is kind of slow and the players are people youve never heard of if your looking for a better game get tennis ki cant say i blame sega for copying gran turismo gran turismo was a hell of a game for playstation so sega decided to take something great and make it better
though sega didnt make it better than gran turismo they came close and the result is the beautiful sega gt
the graphics are mouth watering the control is smooth and the gameplay is tight
the only problem is that there is a very steep learning curve when you want to try the hard class cars like the viper the control is very very sensitive and if you put too much speed into it and crash youll be flipped around backwards
it takes a lot of time to master this game just like gran turismo but in the end youll be satisfied with this gem of a dreamcast gameits about time that the dreamcast had a decent driving game and its more or less a rip of of gran turismo and i dont mean that in a bad way
the graphics are good the game play is excellant i havent been able to stop playing it since i purchased it
you have to get licences the same as in gran turismo so if you have played it you will be familiar with the concept of the game
this is the closest the dreamcat will ever get to a gran turismo and i think its a job well donei just got this game and its pretty good
to get the most out of it it is recommended that you play each of the characters
the only disappointment i found so far is the fact that avery brooks didnt provide the voice of captain sisko and also that colm meaney didnt provide the voice of obrien
what is the deal with that
are the two of them finished with the series and never want to look back on itanyway it is a good game with plenty of action
the artwork is out of this world as well
many previous quotstar trekquot games have been disappointing but this one rates up there with quotelite forcequot and quotarmadaquot
get it
its worth iti love this game because you  have a story similar to indiana jones in a star trek mission
searching for ancients orbs and following a legend
you can play three independent characters and save your progress in mission
you solve puzzles and kill bad boys and creatureswonderfull graphics and medium requeriments for your pci gave  stars to overall rating because you will need to download two patches first a big and after a small patch for a good experience in this gamemuch like the terrific series its derived from deep space nine the fallen is a great game that follows in spirit of the showi wont delve too much into the plot because its so thick with the lore of the ds series and id spend a whole  paragraphs describing it
briefly it involves bajorans and their orbs cardies and the domoinion and a little bit of a new race not much spoken of on any of the latter seriestechnically the graphics are choppy and ugly at times but you dont really care considering the year this was made
aside from that the building and ship designs are true to the st universe as well as the tools weaponary and charactersspeaking of characters only  of the actors of the show lend their talents to the game
avery shimmerman and meaney are absent but their understudies do a great job in their places
the acting overall is very good or as good as the shows performancesthe controls are easy to set up and use as well as the gui
you can save anywhere you like in the game and bypass all videos at any time
all mission information is available to view for reference
i also like the federation layout on the menuits action packed and thrilling
verious shoot outs with all sorts of cunning enemies as well as indigenous creatures on differnt planetsthe puzzles are well designed and pertinent to the plot of the storyyou get to play three different characters cisco kyra  worf in three different games that all parallel chronologicallythe only negatives are the occasional glitches with the video rendering but that can be fixed with a patch and the graphicsits one of the better titles in the otherwise lackluster crop of star trek games
defiantely worth playingfirst off i would like to give this game  and  stars but that is not possible
its a pretty good game but it does have some negative characteristicspros  the level designs were great very pretty
you do get to explore ds itself
you get to run around inside the defiant which was pretty cool
the use of the tricorder in the game was a neat idea
modulating phasers another cool idea
you have the option to play as one of  characters each character has a different series of adventures
people and things quotblows up real goodquot nice damage effects
the game ran fine on my machine i have a dfx card
this is always a plus hahacons avery brooks didnt supply his distinctive voice to the game
too bad
in my opinion some of the levels were too difficult at times
i spent too much time walking around in circles for no good reason
some of the levels turned into quotfind the keyquot adventures
im tired of that little game plot devicei have played star trek elite force and when i saw this game come out i thought it was going to be just another elite forcei was pleasantly surprised that the programmers have taken some care to put in elements in the game that really make it a star trek experience
for example the tricorder
when i play the game i actually spend most of the time using it
when i beam into a new site for the first time it is the first thing i am compelled to use
the tricorder is important because it helps you locate objects you need and allows you to scan for shield modulation frequencies so that you can penetrate enemy shields very important for your survivalbecause of this the game creates an authentic star trek experience that elite force lacks i felt like a starfleet officer doing things a starfleet officer would do
elite force on the otherhand made me feel like a quake player running around in a star trek universethe game is solidly built
nice rendering
projective shadows help add to the mood
good music but missing the original ds theme
no problem just swap their mp with the correct one the biggest thrill was running around ops and the promenade
it really gives you a new perspective on what ds was really like
make sure to look for the fish bowl on the promenade a nice touchthe game is more difficult than i expected even on the first level
i guess authenticity gets in the way sometimes
but fortunately cheats are well documented online so no worries therethe only reason i give it a  out of  is that this is basically a quakeunreal gamei never new that this game even existed until i got it with star trek ds dominion wars i got its jewel case sothe fallen is apuzzling rd person mystery adventure good gameand it uses the glorious unreal tournament engine to pack in all the action to make in this game
it really has good graphicsgreat gameplaygood sounds good music excellent graphics oh and this is the first ut engine game to use projected volumetric shadows but unlike in jkjediknigh it doesnt slow down the framerate
but there are some downs about it
one of the downs is the puzzling almost impossible levelsalthough the ai is normal goodfair enoughi reccomend a shiny new pentium  mhrz with a mb d accelerator video card the memory should not me shared and directly for iti reccomend mb ram that is required for most games these days but for the really high tech ones mb ram is reccomendedi also reccomend a high end good ad directxcompatible or eax high end directx compatible sound cardand i reccomend mb of harddrive space for complete installation
and scifi star trek unreal fan is a must get this gamejust buy itenjoy iti reccomend ityour welcome
psi also reccomend directx of higherthe positives written by the other reviewers are pretty accurate  i agree with them
however there are  things to be aware of  first  i had to download a patch because my pc was scrolling way too fast through the inventory
the patch slowed it somewhat and if you needed an item in the middle it sometimes took several tries to access it
but you still can the items arent lost you just have to be patient  keep trying
the other flaw was the really small screen you had to work with
i prefer using my full screen not a little box
and that made some puzzles harder to do
but other than that i recommend this game it certainly was fun
the ending is actually pretty cool but i wont say more so as not to give it awayif you like puzzle games especially games that have a sense of humour you could do a lot worse than play safecracker
the premise is a simple one  youre in line for a job at crabb  sons safe manufacturer designer of elaborate safes for the welltodo and eccentric
in order to get the job you must break into the crabb headquarters and retrieve bits of the combination of the master safe from safes located throughout the mansions cluttered rooms
when you get the combination you can crack the master safe and retrieve your job contract
you have twelve hoursthe game is played in real time  you really have twelve hours and a convenient clock counts them down for you
i was afraid at first this would be a problem but it didnt turn out that way  i actually finished the game in half the time allowed cracking a few safes every night over the course of a week
none of the safes is particularly challenging to crack once you have all the pieces and several are possible to crack without clues using a combination of inspiration and educated guessing
in fact after cracking a certain safe i was surprised to find almost the entire solution hidden in another part of the house which i thought rather unnecessary
but the variety of safes is quite entertaining
you must do everything from math puzzles to sliding tile puzzles to win a game of poker to crack themthe graphics are quite good
i was amused to see numerous reproductions of famous art masterpieces on the walls with the heads and faces of the game programmers substituted for the real ones
there are several fun spots like the computer that plays second satires of real games
the music was simple enough and somewhat repetitious but provided a nice backgroundtwo things keep me from giving safecracker a fivestar rating
one is that the play areascreen size is very small  only about four by six inches
i would have liked it to have been bigger
however i still had the sense of being immersed in the environment so it was not a major concern
the second is that there are numerous red herrings in this game  hot spots where nothing happens inventory items that are never used and the like
so you can waste a lot of time trying to do something where no action is possibleall in all however i really enjoyed this game
id play another like it in a minutethe back to future game is very cool plus it a hard  find  it reminds me of the movieback to the future was one of my favorite games yes it was challenging but what game isnt i know this got bad reviews most movie games do for the nes because of the graphics what do you expect next gen i could hardly get past the cafe so back to the future is worth iti thought this was a pretty good gamealthoughi was never really much a fan of the second filmthis game sorta plays out like a streets of rage or a final fight kind of gamewhere you walk around beating the living crap out of peopleits simple and funthis game is worth checking outi was questioning the game when i bought the nd copy and it got stuck on level  in the same spot on both copies soon i realize the retro duo for the nes and snes i dont know if its the ninto part of the console or the game itself but i found out through other users as myself strugling to play this on the retro duo concole so dont think its your game cause it may not be i still like the fact that i own a copy its a classic anyway thanksbattletoads  the classic game that also spawned an internet meme  is one of these funky old nes games that seems like it came from a bygone era
with todays fancy consoles like the wii or ps the gameplay was rather simple but could be very challenging
a definite classic oldschool nes gamebattletoads was meant to be the rival franchise to the teenage mutant ninja turtles
unfortunately it never really got off the ground besides  games and a failed cartoon pilot
anyways on to this game it is hard and there is next to no way you can pick it up for your first time and beat the whole game in one sitting
when you first play this game you are given the illusion that its a beat em up game
let me tell you right now that its really a grueling platformer that knows nothing of the word fair
you will lose and if you think using  players will help even out the difficulty well just be ready to be wrongcastlevania is back
the experimental rpg exploration that made up the entirety of simons quest have been removed and good riddance says most of cv fans i imagine
back in full force is the traditional way of moving through levels whipping candles and enemies fighting a boss at the end and rinse and repeat until you complete the game
basically the level design that weve come to admire from the first castlevania returns with a few new interesting features
one is the ability to switch between  different characters
each one makes whatever dilemma you happen to face more bearablebeatablethe music is catchier this time around as well
more energetic rocking and faster paced themes that better suit the frantic gameplay of surviving
the challenge is bigger than ever disappearing bridge anyone
haha
medusa heads contribute to the difficulty more than anything else thanks to the way they move up and down in the air while coming towards you
its really hard avoiding them
even harder than in castlevania symphony of the night but probably not as hard as in sciv where they really make you want to rip your hair outthe only thing preventing this game from being  stars is perhaps the fact that super castlevania iv takes the same formula and makes it slightly better and arguably more challenging despite all the claims that sciv is the easiest game in the series i beg to differ
i just feel super castlevania iv is more challenging has better gameplay richer backgrounds and music thats simply more awesome due to be orchestrated
however this is a must own game too
think of it as super castlevania ivs baby brothera unique castlevania sequel for the nes you can play with more than one character  you can choose which route you want to take   some of the levels were hard  to finish  but more importantly it helps when you have infinite continues  a password to continue your game from where you left offok so im a huge castlevania fan isnt everyone
so naturally after simons quest sloppy game play and design i welcome the backtothedrawingbroad design
story wise draculas curse is a prequel which gives us an ancestor to simon trevor belmont
it has a cool intro and game play is back to the first castlevania but its also one of the hardest
platforming is thought out and the scenery is awesome for an nes title
also you can find characters to swap out with too
like the first castlevania it is hard as sin and sometimes youre force to move quick or youll die and how its design its nearly impossible but can be done
the jumps themselves are stiff like the first game as well
one annoying aspect of the game is the crossroad section screen it seems counterproductive in the long run because in the first crossroad when you go to the gear stage and find grant you backtrack through the stage
why is that
some may argue that it has some elements of simons quest but i say its a flaw in game play and isnt necessary you beat the level so why backtrack through the same annoying enemies
interestingly to note alucard was introduced in this game and when you play sotn another game i got a bone to pick with its mentioned he helped trevor centuries ago
here is the proofanyways overall its a great game and a huge improvement from the other terrible game i got simons quest for free so im not upset about that
just be ready to die over and over and over and over againof the  castlevania titles on the original nes this is the best one
great music fun gameplay and strong graphics
anyone who is a fan of the castlevania series needs to own iti bought this controller because i only have  and i felt i should buy a nd one just in case my friends ever come over plus i wanted specifically this one because i just prefer the classic controller over the other one and the other i have is the one thats like round on both sides and what sucks is my dog got a hold of it and chewed it up probably cause it looks like those cartoon dog bones lol but luckily he didnt chew the wire
and the reason i rated it  stars is because there are light stains on the front of the controller which i was not happy about i tried cleaning them but they wouldnt come off but other than that it works perfectly and im happy with iti got this game in a lot with kirbys dream and rad racer and wasnt sure what to expect
surprisingly this is a solid nes game
you really cant seem to go wrong in buying a capcom game for nintendo and this game was no exception
it does bare resmemblance to mega man both in graphics and gameplay
darkwing duck is equipped  with a gun of unlimited ammo and can use his cape as a shield against enemies
like mega man its a lot of jumping on platforms and you can change your weapons in a sub screen
the graphics are actually really good for nes and will remind you again of mega man
there are  levels with a boss in each one
the bosses arent that tough and you can use unlimited continues to restart any level you die on
this is good but the tradeoff is if you shut the game off you have to start over from the beginning
so youd have to beat the game in one sitting as there are no passwords for later play
it wouldnt be fair to compare this game to megaman or to even call it a knock off of it
on its own its a great game and its actually pretty challenging for a kids game
however seeing how theres only  levels and unlimited continues the serious gamer could probably blow right through this game
either way gameplay and graphics wont let you down on this oneim a fan of darkwing duck plus the game is rare  hard  find  not to mention the cartoon series was pretty cool itselfi liked them both that i had to get it to add to my collection of nes gamesfun dd game but man is this game hard
you have no lives just a health bar  player game doesnt help
the enemies are very difficult its usually  at a time but dont let them surround you or theyll beat the crap out of you
along the way you fight different bosses in some countries once defeated they join you but they are very weak and their moves suck
i didnt really get the storyline but thats me
overall its a fun game but extremely difficulti like this game a lot and still plays it
its better than the original and is a  player game
plus you can fight with  of the bosses neatgraphics could be better but you get to be different characters after you beat the  bosses out of the  different levels and then you can be them and the boss comes included with his own weapon that u can use for limited time  u get to be a  ninja and a kung fu guy and if youre playig with a friend on two player you can decide which one of u which get which well after billy and the other dude with red hair are dead as far as the fighting goes i see some reviews that say the fighting from the other two is better but its hard to say this game has its own unique style of fighting double dragon  has better graphics this game is just more damn fun to play if you are playing it by urself unlike double dragon  and not as good as earlier dd games but still has that retro charmtry it todaythis is definitely a game i would of pumped quarters into at an arcade as a kid
its a fast paced back and forth game where you can really pile on the points
and believe it or not defense is a huge factor in this game
go for the quick steal or block the shot to make up any deficit
this was the first basketball game i remember playing over and over again
play  quarters of basketball
quarters range from mins to a half hour
thats right you could possibly score up to  points in this game
the regular rules of the nba apply here
its a   on  game and you can shoot  pointers and dunk
the only difference in the rules are offensive fouls
if committed the other team gets to shoot free throws
i found this a little annoying because i kept committing them and almost gave up the lead
even though its not nba licensed the game does feature nba knock off teams
seeing how its an arcade style game and the players are nameless and faceless it doesnt bother me that theres only  teams
however in  player mode you cant use the boston frogs
being from boston i wanted to play with my imitation celtics but can only use them in  player mode
also gameplay is limited
playing against the computer is just playing a single game against the boston frogs in  different difficulty settings
thats it
so without friends you could burn out on this pretty quickly
the game also features some awesome cutaway scenes
if you get the dunk right it will cut away to an animation of a guy dunking the ball
other cool features are the opening sequence of the audience walking into the arena and the halftime show
while its not important to gameplay halftime shows are something that got lost in the transition of new basketball games
the dancing cheerleaders and mascots bring back memories of a pretty good bball game considering the time it came out
get this arch rivals and jordan vs bird for your retro gaming basketball kickthe gameplay itself is outstanding
i was very impressed with the second being that it was so much larger than its original and when i played the rd i was greatly impressed
this game being of course based on the nes version and therefore  bit style surpasses some of the newer games on the market today
the storyline is decent not too complicated and the characters do not seem to really interact with their surroundings but the puzzles and the dungeons and overall the entire game will take several hours to complete
however near the end one of the things that turned me off was the constant barage of attacks one after another without letup
that alone can make a person frustrated especially when time is of value
other than that one flaw i loved itnes  dragon warrior iiithree stars  fantastic rpg and very largedragon warrior iii known in japan as dragon quest iii was hugely successful when first released
if you liked the first two titles you will love the third onealthough somewhat primitive by todays standards dragon warrior iii suffers from much of the same problems as other massively influential titles innovative features first introduced here have become so commonplace in subsequent titles and also better handled that playing through the older titles now feels like going backwardsthe sound and graphics are to be expected for an early title
be aware though the graphic tileset is lifted from the original dragon warrior
the dungeons are rather drab and to get your initial weapons require quite a bit of gold
still the experience of the game is very deep and entertainingfor example dragon warrior iii introduces us to the concept of the multiparty
although dragon warrior ii features two extra companions you can take dragon warrior iii takes that one step further with three different party members you can select each one customisable with seven different classes you can choose from
there was now a real element of stragety on who you selected with fighters healers etcall of this is very standard in todays rpgs but back in the late s this was revolutionary
the dragon warrior games really set the template along with final fantasy and phantasy star that rpgs have followed ever sincechronologically the events of dragon warrior iii occur before dragon warrior
dragon warrior and dragon warrior ii are set in the same world
in dragon warrior iii the game is set many years before the first two titles and in a separate world
the main villain of dragon warrior iii is baramos
the hero who the player can make either male or female is summoned by the king to fight baramosafter embarking on the quest eventually the hero and his cast of friends will defeat baramoss
it turns out zoma is the main villain behind baromas and throws the hero and his or her party into the dark world
the dark world is actually alefgard which is where the first two titles are set
then the hero must recover several items from the original dragon warrior in order to create the rainbow bridge so they can go to zomas castle for the final confrontation
dragon warrior iii also used a class system unlike the original dragon warrior title
also the gender does of the character does have some game play effects such as dialogue changes and the fact only certain items are available to either male or female characters who are the hero though these changes are not drasticthere is a famous urban myth that the japan government outlawed the release of dragon quest games during school days because of how they disrupted students academic pursuits although in actually enix made the decision to release dragon quest games on the weekendin  the game magazing famitsu conducted a survey of readers favorite titles of all time
dragon quest iii placed third behind final fantasy x and final fantasy viifor an nes title the game is very large and although grinding is involved and the game is overall difficult for those who love turn based rpgs and dont mind the graphics they will find a deeply rewarding title herei only played this game once or twice when i was a kid
i loved it but dont remember much of it
i bought it for my sister who was a fan of it tooi can never remember how i got most of my old nintendo games when i was a kid but i am glad that duck tales is one of the games i owned as a child
to put it simply this game is a lot of fun
you play as scrooge mcduck and you are trying to become the richest duck in the world if he wasnt already
there are several  or  i cant remember different areas each with its own boss
you are able to take out enemies by doing a pogo bounce on top of them with your cane
it is a simple yet classic way of beating the bad guys
throughout the game you will see characters from the tv show i no longer remember the names including huey dewey and louie scrooges nephews
with three difficulty levels this game can be as easy or as difficult as you want it to be
the game retains its replay value over time and is still a lot of fun to playi think i got this game as a birthday present when i was just a wee laddie of nine years
i remember that i had been wanting the game and when i got it i went bonkers  in a good way
it became one of my favorite games
i played it a lot and i got to know it inside out although that may have been at least partly because of nintendo power magazine
i also beat it i think many times
i had a lot of fun with the game
it was really cool to be able to play the role of the richest duck in the world as he traveled around the world and to the moon
searching for treasures
the ability to use scrooges cane as a pogo stick to hop on and defeat enemies and open boxes to get items make it over spikes and stuff like that or just to generally get around and the ability to use it to whack objects into enemies and to reveal hidden items are awesome
in addition to the treasures which are the main objects that youre going after there are other items that you can get to help you out
the diamonds of course add to your money which you have instead of points ice cream and cake restore lost health and duck dolls give you an extra life
there are also a few other things to get including a couple of items that make your energy meter longer
i think its cool that you dont have to take the stages in any particular order
the snow stage presents a special kind of challenge because you cant pogo in the snow
the game has many hidden areas which is neat
to get to them or to many of them anyway requires you walk across the top of the screen which is something that i think was pioneered by super mario bros
and oddly when you go through a locked door which requires a key the door doesnt actually open or disappear you just walk right through it
the appearances by the other ducktales characters are neat too
huey dewey louie and webby give you advice mrs beakly tosses ice cream cones down at you to help you restore health launchpad can take you out of the stage youre in gyro gearloose appears in bonus scenes and drops diamonds for you to pick up the bonus scenes are something else that is rather reminiscent of smb because theyre up in the clouds
 and gizmo duck gets rid of a barrier on the moon for you
of course there are also enemy characters from the ducktales show most of whom are stage bosses
overall this is a cool and fun game
cant wait for ducktales remastered to come out for psthis is a fun game you play as uncle scrooge and you are suppose to get you stolen money back from the bad guys
you use your walking cane as your weapon  sword pogo stick its fun and very easy to play if you were to conduct a survey and try to find out the top ten hardest nes games you will invariably see festers quest in there
yes its reputation for being notoriously difficult to play is much richly deserved
some have said that it is a straight ripoff from another game made by sunsoft called master blaster
quite frankly i just dont see it
festers quest is in a class of its own for different reasons
i am not going to say that it is a good game to play because it is not
for most part i feel the difficulty of the game is attributed to bad programming
one thing is for sure there are no passwords making it a very arduous and draining game to play because once fester dies he will have to start all over again from square one
he can be hit by anyone and it only takes two hit points to die
the maximum is four if two health bars are found which is nearly not enough
at least the programmers had the decency not to take away my inventory and also force me to go through the bosses all over again thank youbecause if that is going to be the case i guarantee you that festers quest deserves the number one or two spot for being the hardest nes game ever made
two the problem with gun upgrades its impossible to go from level  to  or   and then back to  so what do you do when this happens
you need to downgrade yespurposely downgrade the level of the gun to level  before rebuilding it back up because you wont see a blue gun upgrade ever again in the game until you do this method
it takes a good ten to fifteen minutes of killing off the spawned green balls in areas  to  or green crowns in the spaceship area to pick up the downgrades and upgrades
so it is absolutely imperative that once you have level  gun and level  whip do not ever touch the red ones in the entire game do not even think about going crazy with the whip
most of my time playing festers quest was wasted due to restarts walking from square one to back to where i died i must have done it like dozens times including going from square one to the spaceship about five times and gun downgrade snafu
ok i am going to give some strategies in each area and how to beat it as i beat festers quest without a game genie which took me roughly  hours to accomplish in one sitting with a normal nes controller
yes the game takes a great deal of concentration and energy out of you
thats why it is one of the hardest games in nes historyarea  a word of warning you may notice that fester if he is hit will walk extremely slow
a lot of players is misunderstood after the moment it happens thats how the entire game will be like and then they will proceed to turn off the power
to solve the problem you need to go to menu and select vice grips and then press a in the game to enable it
now fester can move fast
if you have no vice grips from beginning its best to restart it and make sure to never get hit again until you reach the second house where wednesday is in to get them
anyway to start the game off its imperative to build your gun up to level  before going to first boss
the whip an extremely important item to have wont come until area  i just find area  very straightforward
the area boss is pretty easy to defeat if you move around it in circles and setting off the tnts as it goes from left to right and vice versa while avoiding the whips
you will find yourself going through area  all the time so make a habit of going to every house to pick up the tnts vice grips potions and invisibilityarea  make sure to pick up the whip and start upping it to level  now a word of warning do not go crazy with it
just take your time with it and if in doubt use the gun very often
otherwise be prepared to farm for gun downgrades and then upgrades for a good ten to fifteen minutes
of all bosses area  boss is the toughest
so how to beat it when the boss throws the whip on one side get over to there immediately and use the missiles until its gone
for example if you are moving to left side and the boss throws a whip on the opposite of your direction immediately turn around until you are where the whip was previously thrown
then use level  whip and whip the boss
it will take a good twenty or so hits to beat it not an easy task
use your instincts to when to use the invisibility and go to the boss and whip it as fast as you can before giving up to avoid any hits
when you are low in health preferably one hit point left use potionsarea  make a habit of picking up the missiles every time
the knight boss is easier this time
he is just too slow so use the missiles and move around a lot
when you are all out of missiles use the level  whip and invisibility
when you are low in health preferably one hit point left use potionsarea  thankfully the shortest area of the game
the boss is easy as well
just watch his jump before he begins to shoot three bullets in a predictable angular fashion
so just get in between the gaps and use the missiles
make sure to move from left to right and vice versa in a small segment of path
there is no reason to go all the way to one side and also the other side
when you are all out of missiles use the level  whip and invisibility
when you are low in health preferably one hit point left use potionsarea  finally we get nooses arguably the best item of the game but sadly its not allowed in fights with bosses
you may use all nooses as you like prior to fight with next boss but when you have defeated all of the bosses and have to start all over again by walking from square one to spaceship dont ever use any of the nooses
in fact dont ever waste any missile potion one is okay but thats it and invisibility until you get inside the spaceship
once inside it is okay to use potions but nothing else
i demand you to have at least  potions exactly  invisibility and exactly  missiles during the final boss of spaceship area
you must have  nooses inside of spaceship area no exceptions
if you feel that you are in a serious shortage of any wellall i can say is good luck and enjoy your walking all over again
the boss is easy because its the same as before yet with an additional feature
like before find your gaps and use missiles when ready
just keep walking left to right and vice versa
when you are all out of missiles use the level  whip and invisibility
when you are low in health preferably one hit point left use potionsspaceship be absolutely sure to have gun at level  and whip at level  the whip is more important than the gun anyway
if you find yours low in any its fine
just go to the hallway where you see the green crowns and use the gun to farm them all until you are properly geared
a word of advice i do not recommend ever using the nooses on the eyeballs
you can easily kill them with level  whip
just time it perfectly to get them as soon as it lands
dont even think about using the gun on them either because you will get them all mad and they will all come at you mad hopping
the only times you will use the noose are when you see the big monsters with flying arms the wheelie bugs with bright green mass in center and the huge green robots
going from start to finish in spaceship area there is enough of nooses to take care of them all with probably two to three leftover
so its pretty easy actuallyfinal boss probably the easiest of all bosses as soon as the fight begins use the invisibility and start whipping level  is a must at the machine gun box as fast as you can until it dies
every time your invisibility runs out keep using another and use potion as soon as you have one hit point left
move over to the other machine gun box to take it out in the same way as before
when both boxes finally are destroyed walk to the farthest right side
now you are completely  safe from being hit
now time to use all of the missiles
notice that the targets will be on two boxes and the center mass of the organism
switch around the target until its at the center mass and unleash it
you will beat the game when you take your time with the missiles
like i said before its very imperative to have  invisibility and at least  potions to beat this bossthe ending is garbage but the game is garbage anyway
all in all festers quest is not an easy game and after beating it i dont feel like playing it ever again in my lifethis is based on the addams family i like the gun you get you can actually power it up the gun looks more like a space gun you collect other things along the way from different members of the addams family i only one thing i didnt like about it is that you have to go through a maze to get to a boss hat took some trial  error i maped out the areas in  locations you may want to do that so you dont get stuck  when you reached the ufo you wont feel as lost as you figh your way through aliens  beat the final boss its easy to destroy once you take out the  guns  then walk to the right side of the screen firing homing missles at a safe distancethis game had some cool aspects but like so many other nes games was lacking in a few things
one thing that would definitely have helped was a password or save feature because every time you played this game you had to start at the very beginning which could get old after a while and the controls could be rather clunky which was a drawback especially in the later stages of the game so fester could not always escape enemies when it started to get overwhelming at certain points
it would also have helped if fester had a bigger health meter
otherwise this was pretty good for a nes gamethis game is truly amazing for nes even though it is very old and for nes it is still pretty cool
you can be one of many teenager they look like kids though to battle the great jason and look for the missing children
jaosn is very hard to kill that the only reason i gave this a  instead of  he is creepy though you find him in houses
its a big level with many houses if you lucky you will go into the house with jason and fight him  bu he allways comes back of course
i love the music it is actually creepy it sounds like something from a friday the th moviei love it
this is a game that will haunt you for hoursdespite its disreputation for being one of the worst nes games made and also for the fact that it was made by ljn company friday the th is actually and surprisingly a good game
it wasnt more of a beat em up one but rather a very deeply strategic game
i had to change my strategies many times during day one then day two and going back to day one and finally day three and back
i was trying to figure out the best way to approach jason in each day given his increasingly super strength abilities
eventually i beat the game although i found it pretty annoying a lot of times
however it is an ingeniously made game
now i am going to show you how to beat friday the th as painlessly as possible
first of all i forewarn you that the learning curve for this game is somewhat steep but anyone who has played mission impossible on nes will undoubtedly be familiar with the basic idea of friday the th
now i strongly recommend to you to spend a couple of hours navigating through the trails and be familiar with the basic idea of switching around counselors and passing on weapons
this is the most important aspect of the game
you cannot win without mastering this part firstday  i read in a lot of strategy guides that every character ought to be equipped with a dagger
forget thatthats rubbish
what you should do right now make a map exactly what you see on the screen
draw the trails the houses and whatever pertinent
then start killing the zombies and jumping over and over especially through the trees
anytime you see an item revealed use a color code on the map you drew standing for something ie pink for medicine green for dagger brown for key and yellow for a lighter
keep doing this as often as you can throughout the map
now about the forests the bottom part i never went to there and dont find it worth going there because its too easy to get lost in there
however the top forest entering from the bottom is quite important to master
there are goodies on the left side
now to reach the cabin inside of that forest is to go right as you entered from the bottom push up as soon as you see a trail and then push up again to be inside of the cabin
this is a very very important cabin
to get out of the forest is to get out of the cabin go right down as you see a trail go right again and then down again
again i stress the fact that this cabin is the most important of the game
as for the cave you should always use mark because of his awesome jumping ability
go left jump over the two gaps and then push up just before the third gap
now this is another important cabin to be in because killing jasons mother will give you two invaluable items necessary to win the game
okay weve covered the basic elements
time to restart the game clean
despite the strategy guide telling you that you should have mark on the top left cabin around the lake i dont find it all that necessary but you should start with mark first wherever he is
now mark should kill three to four zombies and get a lighter
then find the dagger and the key as you referenced their positions in the map you made
now go to the big cabin on the trail around the lake and which is right between the two big forests
push up and then turn right
there is a message that says go into the woods
now get out of the cabin and go into the forest from the bottom and find the cabin
once in there leave the cabin and come back to it again
once inside there turn left and get the message fire will damage jason the most
now leave the cabin and before the door the machete should appear
pick it up
get out of the woods
find a character not chrissy that you can pass the machete down to
go back to the same house where you got the first message
push up up turn around and up
finally you got the blow torch
go to the same character that you passed the machete down to and switch weapons
mark should go to the cave where he will fight jasons mother
be sure to have mark to collect as many medicine bottles as possible at least six will be good
kill the mother and you receive a blow torch for free
now you have two characters with a torch
switch to chrissy and do the same exact thing all over again get the dagger key lighter woods message and then fire message
if chrissy is able to get the machete sometimes its there and sometimes its not
if she got the machete pass it to a character who doesnt have it
then chrissy will go back to the same cabin on the trail to pick up a blow torch
now you got three characters with a blow torch and one character with a machete
do this one more time with another character
eventually you should have four characters with a blow torch and either one or two with a machete
make sure that you take your time on day one collecting the required items and most important of all do not allow any of the characters to pick up an item she has already possessed
for example if mark has a dagger do not pick up another one reserve that for a different character who doesnt have it yet
ditto for other items
the hardest to find is the key
also make sure that mark has enough medicine potions and the rest should be picked up by chrissy
those two are the most important characters of the game
treat george as the first expendable character and he should possess the worst weapon dagger or rock available
if you are lucky enough to find all machetes and torches then george should have the machete
every bit of damaging hits on jason helps a lot
now when you have equipped every character as possible go and defeat jason while having at least five characters alive for the second day
its not hard to defeat jason on day one with all of the six characters alive
fighting jason in the cabin is like playing mike tysons punch out
all over again
same strategy over and overjason makes a left side and comes to you
you dodge left he pulls back and you throw the weapon at him twice
repeat
sometimes jason does the two hit movement
eventually youll get used to it
sometimes when jason alarm goes off and it turns out to be a counselor it is a very good idea to find the nearest small cabin and push start and switch to the counselor being in the same cabin as jason
then you get out of the cabin asap and you fight jason on the trail and keep following him as much as possible
this strategy should be heavily used the entire game
it is worse when jason alarm goes off and the children are being attacked
you have to go to the cabins in the middle of the lake and take some hits from flying zombies a crow andor occasional floating jason
i hate going to there especially on day threeday two after you have defeated jason on day one start as mark first and switch his weapon with another character who has the machete
with mark go to the cave again and fight jasons mother one more time
defeat her and you will receive an allimportant flashing sweater
this is the most important item needed to finally defeat jason in day three
make sure to switch weapons for mark so he can have the blow torch back
now pretty much after that same strategy as before and go defeat jason
it is not as hard as the other day and it feels like mike tysons punch out
more like facing piston honda twice again
be sure to learn his moves as he will make a rapid double hit movement where you need to make a rapid two dodge movementday three after you have defeated jason on day two this is the last one
what i am going to say is never ever go to any of the cabins and try to take on jason
you will not win period
anybody who says that he can take on jason in there is  pure liar
but one time you will have to use mark to take on jason in the cabin in the middle of the lake
okto start off the day pick mark again and make him to go right in the center of the opening to the lake on the left side
stay there at all times do not move to anywhere
keep killing the zombies to pass the time
jason should come after you or jason will attack a counselor
whenever either happens attack him on trail or go to the nearest small house and switch counselors then leave the cabin asap and start fighting with jason on trail
switch back to mark and go back to the same original position
when jason alarm begins again more likely he will attack the children go to the middle of the lake and take on jason
this time do not dodge anymore
attack him rapidly as you can with the blow torch
hit him hit him hit himas hard as you and as fast as you can
you will win and then get out of the cabin and go to the right side
finally you will take on jason on the trail and defeat him for goodduring the entire time make sure to attend to jason alarm it is okay to sacrifice some children if you dont feel like going to the middle of the lake
but always be sure to attack him whenever one of the counselors is being threatened
its your best time to expose jasons weakness
be sure to always use the character with the most health points as possible to take on jason
whoever has very low health points should be avoided until the next day where everybody is automatically given full health pointsmy strategy is the best and perfectly refined right now although it will take time to accomplish the goals required
the point of the machetes and the blow torches for nearly all of the characters is due to pretty good damage points they inflict on jason
a rock pleasethis is the most worthless weapon in nes history or a dagger on jason is not going to do a damn thing
every blow on jason inflicted by a machete or a blow torch wielded by all of the counselors counts and will save you for good
the flashing sweater will significantly reduce the damage dealt by jason and it is the most important item to have
finally mark should have the most medicine bottles because he is the most important counselor and the only one i havent tested chrissy much but i think she can also do it who can handle jasons worst
whatever you do do not fight jason in the cabin on day three
its suicide plain and simple
only use mark with the flashing sweater in the middle of the lake
other notes about the game for myself i try to stay away from most of the forests and the cave its too much of a maze to navigate through
i never found a pitchfork or an axe
since i beat the game without them i can do without them
forget about lighting up the fireplaces
there is no frigging point to that and its not a torch but a lighter
get the facts straightall in all i am very surprised that ljn finally made a game that was worth playing
the people who dont understand how to play friday the th will find it as one of the worst games ever but the people that actually understood it will appreciate the gameplay a lot and find it a very underrated game
friday the th simply put is a purely strategy game
interestingly i am very surprised that nintendo actually gave a seal of approval for friday the th
the game is a rarity under these circumstances back then because nintendo strived to release appropriately made familytype games
however friday the th was rather a scary game to play
notice the bizarre endings you and your friends are dead
game over
and jason wiped out the kids
game overcool gamei thought jason used a machete
not a throwing axe
o well you dont have munch time to think about it because your about to die
you get killed fastyou dont know challenging until you have palyed friday the th
for one thing time is always against you and the weapons are bad
it really follows no movie story line but still can hold its own and provide many hours of gameplaythe music is basic nes stylegraphics are the same thing but has one of the coolest nes entrences ever i wont spoil itthe controls are very smooth which is nicethe difficulty on am scale from  would be an   i mean this one difficult game as a whole
you will not be able to win on teh first try guarentted
you also have to beat jason all his hp drained x and eaxh time he gets a little faster and a little strongerhowever still buy this because it is fun
you wont regret it your controller might thoughthis is kirby at his purest
nothing but classic kirby gameplay great graphics and sound best on the system and really nice level design
no major flaws worth noting
this is what the basic gameplay of all kirby games is based on
the graphics are amazing for its system
some of the sand hills on level  look almost realistic
i rate this game a very very challenging game
if you want to master this game let alone beat it then you better be ready to dedicate a lot of time to this
its a very fun game and id recommend it for anyone who enjoyed contralifeforce is a great sidescrolling shooter from the nes era
it has some cool level design
its a very challenging game
if you classic shooters then i think you would like itlifeforce for the nintendo nesman this brings back memories even in  this game still is fantastic
it has to be one of the best shooters on the original nintendothis was when they had amazing games on their systems and not the  kiddie tripe that the wii is famous for now  originally known as salmander in japan this  version of the classic dosent miss a beat this not that lame mario was the game that made me want a nes  back in the dayafter  plus years the graphics hold up well this game looks great on my plasma tv  the gameplay is  fast and intense and its still hard the kind of hard that makes you throw your controller at the wallbut keeps you coming back for more
rapid fire is a must with this oneits nice to know that the classics stand the test of time if you have a nes this is one that you need to add to your collectioni just realized that this is a capcom game
i was like whoathat makes sense
it has the mega man feel to it
okay this game imo in my opinion has medium difficulty
i wish i could say easy but it is not
the first level is the easiest
i guess its suppose to parallel the movielittle nemo adventures in slumberlandand has a series of books as well
in fact the intermissions of nemo being yelled at by his mom dont really make sense to me but i am glad that capcom picked it up
you have to collect keys to get through the door at the end of the level
if you do not have enoughthen you just back track trying to find that last key
the first level is straight forward
the second level starts to have hiding spots that you have to search out
so they make use of their large environment
you use candy to give to certain animals so you can jump into their mouths and use that animals abilities
i guess the candy has sedatives in it that after you feed them  they fall asleep and no longer hurt you when you touch them and hop right in
the candy when thrown at an enemy that you cant use will be frozen for several seconds but i found this to make it harder to jump over them
later on in the game you will receive a scepter that is called a morning glory and a beam function
you hold down the shoot button and charge the morning glory
this game takes practice to get use but it is a cute game
i loved playing it back in  and i love playing it nowthanksi was a big fan when they came out back in the day and it has held up welli bought this game because i had played it as a child and it was always way too difficult for me
i thought as an adult id have a better chance of beating it but i was still wrong haha
i very much enjoyed playing this game because it reminded me of how much i loved it when i was a kid
this game is a testament to back when games had an obscene difficulty level while looking like theyre clearly geared towards kidshonestly this was one of my favorite video games to play as a kid
sure time has depleted the usage of the nes but this was one of the greatest roleplaying games of all time
i remember sitting up late on school nights and playing this game
it always involved different kinds of thinking and strategy
the characters in this game each come with their own unique talent and special little niche
this game definately is worth the price
well dont take my advice buy it and try it for youselfthis game originally on pc is definitely ahead of its time
it offers a cast of characters to choose from each with their own strengths and weaknesses
there are also multiple endings to the game depending on which characters you use and what you do
though set entirely in a spooky mansion this game offers aliens dungeons with secret entrances and more
very weird and original starsthe men were all pretty cool
some were even originaltheres heat man bubble man metal man wood man air man crash man flash man and quick mandifficulties are as followsheat man  bubble man  metal man  wood man  air man  crash man flash man  quick man  then you go to wilys castle which is of medium difficulty and interesting to say the leastyou get a chance to beat the pants off of some dragon thing thats annoying to say the least but easyyou fight dr wily twice in a contraption he has concocted and out of it
he is mildly difficult the first time and hardest the second time aroundgraphics  soundmusic  controls  game play  overall difficulty  overall grade  if it wasnt for the underground buzz that mega man received capcom would had most likely not released the  sequel for the nes outside of japan
if anything it set itself up for mega man  to be a success
but not even capcom expected how much of a success it would turn out to be millions of copies were sold across the world and mega man would be quickly recognized as much as nintendos mascot mario
and when mega man  was released the blue bomber returned in the breakout nes sequel that had gamers in a frenzy
i never bought it because i borrowed it from my best friend numerous times and it was worth itmega man  had mega man return to save his world
dr wily was really upset that he lost to mega man before and he vowed to get his revenge
to show he was better than dr light and to crush mega man dr wily invented eight robot masters and challenged mega man to beat them and to fight him again
you picked one of eight stages to play through and beat the robot master to gain its special weapon
in addition to the special weapons you were able to acquire three adapters that helped you cross gaps climb walls or reach platforms out of reach
once you beat all eight stages you were whisked off to dr wilys castle
there you had to play through six more stages filled with more enemies boss characters the same eight robot masters from before and finally dr wily and his new robot contraptions
the game provided passwords so you could save your progress and come back later to finish your gamethe pros capcom responded to those gamers who felt the first game was too hard to beat by offering easy and hard modes
because of that move mega man  was accessible to every gamer and that helped it gain popularity
you had new robot masters new weapons and more stages to play through
everything here was better the graphics music stage layouts enemies and boss characters
the sound effects were mostly the same from the first game but were still good and so were the controls
the new weapon adapters were pretty cool and helped out in certain sections of the game
since the game was longer the password system was a nice addition so that you could play for a bit copy the password and then use it later on to finish the game
mega man  was the first game to introduce energy tanks a health power up that filled up your energy bar when you needed it the only catch was that you could carry up to four at a time
the cons mega man  went down in the franchises history as the easiest game in the series to beat
if you played it through the easy mode it was an absolute but enjoyable walk in the park
but if you played it through the hard mode the game gave you a mild challenge but nowhere near what you saw in mega man
some players wanted more of a challenge besides those two modes but capcom wanted everyone to enjoy the game so thats why it wasnt as hard as the first game
when you use the passwords they saved your progress as far as how many robots you beat
if you used it during one of the stages in dr wilys castle the game always brought you back to the first stage of the castle
also the passwords never let you kept the energy tanks or extra lives you collected you started without any energy tanks and three livesmega man  was and still is regarded as one of the best in the nes series
to this date it stirs the debate as to which nes mega man game reigns supreme and its always been between mega man  and mega man  no matter which game was your favorite this one had a lot of fans and brought a lot of good memories to those gamers who were fortunate enough
if youre a mega man fan you have this game in some form the actual nes cartridge the mega man anniversary collection released for the ps and gamecube consoles or downloaded it to your wii from the virtual console service  points
this was a game that anyone could have enjoyed and millions of gamers can attest to itmegaman  was one of the first nesgames i played through when i was about eightyearold boy
i was so excited and fascinated about this games graffics enemies sounds and challange
many of my classmates liked also to play megaman  lets tell you something about this classic game
doctor willy has built eight evil robots who are protecting willys kingdom
megaman is a cyborg boy who has to destroy these robots and finally beat willy himself
megaman gonna save the world
there are many interesting levels in this game
quickmans stage is full of cutting sawblades
when you are in airmans world you have to be careful because ligning could strike you
heatmans level is very hot and youll burn in lava if you jump over the bricks
ok
you have destroyded all the eight robots
now you will go to willys world
the great skull was very scare when i was a little boy youll meet dragons killing machines crashing creatures flying strangers and so on finally you see eye to eye evil doctor
give him a good reason to kneel down and pay mercy for you
shoot him down
when you have survived robot phase its time to meet alien doctor willy
use bubblegun and you are soon in the winner team
congratulations
you have save the world today
not bad at all
this is your game if you like stage jumping shooting to robots great advanture and absolutely irritating musicthis game is a definite step above the first game but one could say that mm was more of a prototype
mm is missing many of the features that was introduced in megaman   namely the power to gain different weapons from the vanquished robot masters along with the assistance of the robotic dog rushthe pointsscore system has been eliminated which is good since it didnt really serve a function in mm
this game would actually set the tone for the rest of the series  cans of energy the help of rush and the fact that the number of robot masters were upped to  as opposed to the original  the graphics are also a step ahead since mm had fairly simpler graphics  but then comparing mm to the rest of the series is like comparing the first legend of zelda or the first super mario brothers game to the rest of their respective series
megaman  is a solid title and set a good note for the rest of the series and a definite mustplay for any megaman fanmega man  might go down as one of the hardest mega man games ive ever played
dont get me wrong theres several difficult moment in x and x and mega man  isnt exactly a walk through the colorful cherry orchard park either but overall mm might take the cake for the most consistently difficult mega man game ive ever put inside one of my video game consoles
i remember my mother renting this game for me at the video game store uptown back in  and of course i was the foolish one who picked it out assuming itd be loads of fun and well yeah the game is loads of fun but the constant relentless assault from the many enemies you encounter in nearly every single stage is nearly enough to make me wish i hadnt asked for this game so many times during my childhoodthe music is really good though
who knows the music itself may be the biggest reason i used to rent this game so many times back then
skull man in particular has a theme thats really melodic
on the negative the first wily stage has terrible music
this game moreso than all the other mega man games reminds me of that robot movie from the mid s called short circuit
that movie used to excite me like no other
the levels are all packed with several obstacles
you have spikes which weve pretty much grown accustomed to in the mega man series by this point moving block platforms that can be an absolutely nightmare if you dont handle your jumping patterns correctly and when i was a kid surprise surprise missing and falling these particular platforms is how i ended up losing the most livesat least mega man has a sliding move thats really effective when the situation ever gets too intense
quite often you can simply slide beyond the danger and make it to a temporary safe area
thank goodness for this feature
where the difficulty really increases in during the wily stages
trust me you dont even want to know how hard some of these stages are
the one stage with spikes on the block platforms that actually rotate to a different spot my goodness
youre in for more than a rude awakening thats for sure
this is the one mega man game im always reluctant to play due to the high challenge it brings time and time again
it does get easier with practice but lets be honest here if you wake up on the wrong side of the bed and experience an off day your timing will be off too
you cannot have one of those days and expect to blow through a game like this without any trouble
youve been warnedthe boss fights are hard too mainly because if you happen to come unprepared such as say your weapon meter is nearly empty when you arrive to the fight or you simply dont have the right weapon in your possession the bosses will make you pay for that and the regular arm cannon might not be good enough to get the job done either
another benefit is that rush the dog makes an appearance and he helps with some of the harder to reach areas by climbing on top of him and sailing across or up the screenoverall mega mans fourth adventure offers a significantly increased challenge in comparison to the previous three so please please keep this in mind if you so much as dare to play this gameafter the excellent mega man  capcom kept with the gamers demand for more of the blue bomber
in  they released mega man  for the nes
while it was more of the same they kept the game fresh with more variety in the stages and a difficulty level that was tougher than what gamers saw in the previous game
it was worth it and everyone was happy that mega man kept on goingthe story is short and sweet a new scientist dr cossack challenged mega man to defeat his batch of robot masters and then to see him in his castle
of course mega man does what he has to do
no one was surprised to see that dr wily put him up to up since he kidnapped his daughter
in the end you face dr wily in his own castle for the final showdown
the setup was the same like the other mega man games choose one stage out of  stages defeat the robot master and use the weapon to defeat the next robot and so on and so on
youd reach dr cossacks castle comprised of  stages then you had to fight in dr wilys castle for the final  stages beating the eight robot masters again and finally defeating dr wily
a password system was available to use so you can continue your game laterthe pros the only way that gamers would have kept playing mega man was if there was enough variety in the stages and new game play mechanics were introduced
fortunately capcom delivered in these areas
the graphics and music were good
the controls were the same as it always been so no problems there
it was this game where capcom first gave mega man the ability to power up a shot before you release it to make it stronger and do more damage
his trademark slide returned and so did rush his faithful robot dog
a new ally eddie made his first appearance here he brought a random power up to help mega man whenever he was summoned
gamers also welcomed back the tougher difficult level that was absent in mega man  and the cons at this point if you have played any of the previous three games then mega man  is no different
it wont change your mind if you werent a fan of the classic nes seriesmega man  was more of the same but fans of the series werent tired yet
thanks to the new ideas in the stage layouts original robot masters new music and adding a new ability to mega man it was a hit and sold very well
it guaranteed that part five was on its way
if you were a fan of mega man then you bought it for the nes
but in case you missed out it was part of the mega man anniversary collection for the ps and gamecube or you can download this game for the wii from their virtual console service for  points mega man iv is basically the same as the other games except for a few exceptionsthese exceptions arethis time you can charge your bustereddie appears and gives you itemsthere are two fortressesthe levels and bosses are knewif you love mega man i suggest that you get this game nowif youve played previous megaman titles this one is basically lather rinse repeat
not that thats a bad thing
all the features that make up a classic megaman game are here   robot bosses weapons gained from each a rush with a couple of adaptations jet coil submarine along with a couple of other things balloon and wire adapter which must be foundsearched for as opposed to being rewarded after defeating a master and a final confrontation with several different giant robots
my personal favorites are pharaoh man and skull mana couple of new features are introduced here  flip top eddie who appears at certain points in some levels yo give you random energy boosts and the fact that you could turbocharge megamans shots by holding down the fire button
these features definitely add to the gameplaythe bad guy in this one is dr cossack and his castle looks distinctly russian very reminiscent of the gorgeous palace at red square in russia with its minarets and domed roofs but the nearending of this game reveals a surprise twist
okay  to some it isnt much of a surprise but i shant spoil it for youmega man  and  both great games but a tad too easy
now a new enemy dr cossack is present filling wilys shoes as chief villain or is he
cossacks robot leaders are for the most part far superior to wilys
the stages leading to them are far more difficult as well
but you wont be without help on this adventure
your plasma cannon can now be charged to blast shots x as powerful as standard ones
theres also balloon and wire adaptors
the rush jet is back here but it loses the precision control it had in   dr cossacks fortress is no laughing matter either whipping out tough levels with tough bosses and limited restart points
once you defeat the docs machine youll discover an eviler villain has been controlling him
this newer darker villain confronts mega man taunting him with an extremely funny insult
he then leads mega man to a new fortress
whos the real villain here
take a guess and theres about a  chance itll be a right one
not the best mega man for the nes but still worth trying starsthe men were all pretty cool in  but they got even better in there were the following men magnet hard top shadow spark snake gemini and needledifficulties are as followsmagnet man  hard man  top man  shadow man  spark man  snake man  gemini man  needle man  graphics  soundmusic  controls  game play  overall difficulty  overall grade  bonus informationmagnet man is weak to arm cannon shadow blade and spark shock
hell be at your knees if you bestow these weapons upon himhard man cant take magnet missles
and if you can somehow beat him before you meet him lol hes weak to hard knuckles tootop man is terrified of hard knuckles top spin and needle cannonshadow man cant stand the heat if you douse him with a hit of top spin hard knuckles and yawn shadow blade
he is definitely the trickiest to beat otherwisespark man stays away from shadow blade needle cannon and hard knuckle like a fish despises scolding water
give it to him
take no prisoners
snake man will leave you alone if you bust a cap
use your arm cannon hard knuckle needle cannon spark blade and search snakesgemini man hits the streets when he sees snake mans search snakes
if you havent taken him down yet stick with the arm cannon magnet missles hard knuckle and the shadow bladelastly needle man heads for the hills if he sees geminis gemini laser shadows shadow blade or his own needle cannonfrom gamefaqs posted with permissionthis section is the inbetween between the defeat of the eight robot mastersin the game and dr wilys castle
here you revisit four stages in the gamedifferent then they were and segmented into two parts now the stages ofshadow man gemini man needle man and spark man
in each stage there are tworobot masters from the previous mega man game mega man  but they arentliterally there
instead a robot called dark master encompasses the powers ofeach particular robot master from the previous game and uses those powersagainst you with great skill
this game among  others deserve the recognition it happens to garner
some of the guys in  are awesome too such as pharoah man and toad man but they dont compare to the guys in   and part graphics  soundmusic  controls  game play  overall difficulty  overall grade  my first foray into the mm series was with mm  the flagship installment of this series
that sent me on a hunt to find mm  which did not hold a candle to its successor
a friend of mine then beat me to the punch  years ago and bought mm
i was already a huge mm fan after only having played mm but mm only strengthened my allegiancemm follows the same basic premise as the previous two installments beat a robot master and gain his powers to defat the next
the main antagonist is still dr wily when will he give up
mm is much longer than its predecessor as you are forced to defeat a dopplegangerlike robot that takes on the powers of the  robot bosses from mm in the spark man needle man shadow man and needle man stages
this is actually pretty annoying but it was nice to see the old crew again
the  extra levels notwithstanding i thought mm was tougher for some reasonthis game continues the high precedent set by mm outstanding gameplay phenomenal music etc and builds upon it by giving the blue bomber a slide move which works to get you into tight places and as a speedier alternative to the standard running
this game also marks the first appearance of mms dog rush and he proves to be very useful
rush can take on the functionality of a jumping board called rush coil which you are outfitted with from the jump
he also takes on the form of a jet rush jet and a submarine rush submarine
in this installment you are allowed a maximum of  energy tanks which is a bit of overkill for the regular bosses but comes in handy in the final stagesmm continues the tradition and there is no deviation in gameplay other than the new slide move
nothing groundbreaking here but then again if you are considering a mm title you know and love exactly what to expectif you liked megaman  and  you should like this
megaman  is not really much different from megaman  you fight eight robot masters gain their weapons use the assistance of your dog rush and fight dr wily
theres not really much i can say for this installment that i havent said for megaman  since both games are so similar in gameplay and the like
the only real major difference is that you fight a different set of eight bosses so you get a completely different set of weapons though you also fight a docbot that has these eight weapons too
overall its a pretty decent installment to the megaman seriesmegaman
v
megaman will fight no matter where the battle takes place upside down or on a train he will take down wily wherever he causes trouble
meet the blue bombers blue bird beatafter saving the world from dr wilys evil intentions mega man returns home only to find that robotmasters are causing chaos and dr lights been kidnapped
the culprit
mega mans brother proto man
but why has he turned evil
actually you soon find out that its an elaborate plan to frame the horribly underrated older brother of the blue bomber and so here begins my review of mega mans fifth adventure on the nesthe goodthe storyline is actually among the best in the series and it allows a refreshing change to the normal dr wilys at it again lets get him
storyline
proto man actually has a substantial role in the plot and i believe him to be a very underused character capcom make him his own game
beat is also introduced in this game and hes quite useful
this game is the only game that allows him to attack bosses and makes wily at the end seem like a walk in the park
the game is thankfully a bit more difficult than  and  with the evil darkman stages
the graphics are also better and the backgrounds even have parallax to themthe badthis game has a more powerful mega buster but every time you get hit you have to start the charge over again
this wasnt that huge of a deal but i wish they wouldve kept it more like mms mega buster
also the music is mostly mediocre with only a handful of tunes that are really memorableoverallwhile not a bad game i find it hard to rank it above the first four games
it doesnt quite touch the first four in terms of charm and the good old fashioned mega man feel
i really cant explain it and perhaps if it had better music it wouldve been better
the game doesnt connect well with the others at all which is quite a shame
my feelings on this game are very mixed but i still recommend at least playing it through
it is after all essential to your mega man librarymega man  is really amazing but probably not quite at the level of awesomeness that mm   and  provides
mm has plenty of really cool features and mainly focuses on an outer spacetype level design
this is one thing that caught my attention immediately back in the dayi remember  years ago when my mom would rent this game for me
i did poorly back then
i was able to complete exactly one stage and now i cant even remember which stage it was
ah a trip down memory lane when video games meant the absolute world to me
back then i considered mega man games enormously difficult
this was a couple years before the x series came out
i was totally confused and needed help to figure out which stagesbosses i was supposed to battle first
for some reason i had trouble figuring this out and didnt have a nintendo power in my possession to help me
even though i was subscribing back then i never had the issues that would help me through these mega man games
the good news is that the challenge seems more understandable and less intimidating as an adult howeveranyway yeah these levels are really colorful for an nes game
a graphical and backgroundfilled upgrade in comparison to mm but probably only a slight one
one stage even has the jet ski
talk about cool
i didnt think the nes had the ability to use it without the play control slowing down significantly due to the speed and the amount of enemies going by the screen but i was wrong it flows near flawlessly
one things for absolute sure you have to have the correct weapon in your inventory when entering a boss fight
having the right weapon hasnt been this important since the very first mega man game and it was very important in that game
also make sure you dont accidentally enter the fight without enough weapon energy or youll pay in the worst waythe music is really good this time around but probably not quite as memorable as the themes from mm
even though as an adult i find the challenge level more bearable it doesnt change the fact that the game is still rock hard
you will lose plenty of lives so be prepared for that and there is a degree of practice required in pushing your way through these stages successfully by experimenting with the right weapons and avoiding all the dangerous traps of which theres many
this is what the x games lack however
in the mmx games it doesnt really matter how you get through the stages because youll probably survive no matter what due to the generosity of health energy scattered everywhere and enemies normally being less threatening
not so here
i like mm though because it reminds me of a good oldfashioned arcade experience
raw relentless and sometimes aggravating
thats what makes the older mm games so splendidin  capcom released mega man  for the nes and it sold well
at this point it was more of the same for the blue bomber as the concept of defeating robot after robot was starting to wear out its novelty but it was still worth a look to see what robots were featured and what the story would be this time aroundthe city is under attack
robots go on a rampage while dr light ended up being kidnapped by proto man
dr cossack warns mega man and he soon takes off to get dr light only to see that proto man was set up from the get go and dr wily ultimately emerges to challenge mega man go to his castle and fight him in order to save dr light
just like the previous four games you pick a robot masters stage explore it and defeat the robot master to acquire his special weapon
then repeat the process until all eight robot masters are defeated
go through proto mans impostors castle and finally play through dr wilys castle to save dr light
in addition to collecting the special weapons you picked up health and weapons capsules as well as ups
rush returns to help you out your mega buster from mega man  returns but is more powerful now
and for the first time you meet beat a robotic bird that saved you whenever you fell into a pit
the game gave you a password in case you want to stop and continue your game laterthe pros its a mega man game so it plays and sounds good
new robot masters meant new stage layouts and enemies so the ideas were still fresh
the story is also decent and sheds more light on proto man mega mans brother and it was nice to see dr cossack from part four make an appearance
the mega buster was more powerful now and beat proved to be useful so it was an excellent new additionthe cons unfortunately this was where fans started to see capcom run out of ideas
most of the themes here were used in previous games star man crystal man wave man gyro man and stone mans stages in particular
also the difficulty level took a slight dive as it was easy compared to other games in the seriesit was still a good game to play through back then and capcom just gave what mega man fans wanted another excuse to run through another mega man game
this one is hard to track down brand new so either you settle for a used copy pick up mega man anniversary collection for the ps and gamecube or download this title for the wii through the virtual console service for a mere   pointsi have to admit i was extremely skeptical when i put down the money for a mega man  cart
in all honesty i thought it was ludicrous that i was paying more for it than i did for a copy of the  original
nothing in that respect has changed but ill be damned if mega man  didnt pull the rug out from under me despite partaking of previous seemingly uneventful play throughsas the title suggests mega man  is an uneven beast when it comes to difficulty
fun as it still is figuring out the weakness chain it takes next to nothing to get through the initial robot master crew and their levels
this and the overall feel of the game changes dramatically once the player enters the fortress levels
theres an abstract sense of maturity that presides over this portion of the game something that reminds me of the sobering steel and seriousness of a mega man x gameinteresting as this can be the most significant change mega man  brings to the table is the fact the series has finally cleared that oddball hump that started with mega man  and continued with mega man  even after playing through the nes mega man games i still cant explain why these particular titles feel as bizarre as they do
needless to say i was glad to see things were back on track despite the fact mega man  doesnt deviate from the tired and true formulawhile i cant say i was exactly thrilled with the price tag it carries mega man  is a lot better than a quick glance or a halfremembered memory would suggest
as one would expect the game doesnt do anything radical yet there are some covert forces within that are devilishly alluring once theyre discovered
if youre into mega man id definitely suggest digging for themmega man v is not much different from the other four games before it
if you liked the first four and want more i would suggest that you get this game
however the gameplay is has not changed much from the first four and this is the mega man game where the gameplay starts to get oldthere is not much that i can say about this game other than that if you still want to play another mega man game after the st three get this oneusername at capcom cityoncedeadat this point in the series theres not much i can say that i havent said before
 robot masters weapons gained from them the assistance of rush and so on and so forth
personally i liked the weapons star man napalm man and crystal man left behind
one new thing is the mega tank  energy tanks only filled health but the mtank filled the energy for health and all weapons which comes handy in a pinch especially if youre fighting the final bossesproto man is the bad guy here but like mm theres a twist to the ending
if youve played mm then it shouldnt surprise you as the twists are similar just with a different character
overall a fairly enjoyable mega man titlecool concept with  fan made bosses taking place in a world robot championship
mega man gets the very useful diagonal dash and power suit
mega man fans rejoicenear the end of the ness reign capcom rushreleased mega mans th adventure which involved a mysterious actually notso judging by the appearance of the character businessman that steals the national tournaments champions aka
the robotmasters and uses them to take over the world
mega man naturally speeds to the rescue but what may sound like an awesome game turned out to be a mere effort unfortunately
read on to see why mega mans last adventure on nes was not a quotone shot at gloryquotthe goodwe get two new rush adaptors power and jet that kick major arse
youll find that using them is ten times more fun than using the acquired boss weapons
the music is also thankfully better although it doesnt touch the first four get to that in the bad and we get more robotmasters and more wily stages to bash through
some of the robotmasters are quite unique especially tomahawkman and yamatomanthe badthe storyline is too similar to mega man s and this game pulls it off to a lesser extent
the quotmr xquot disguise didnt fool me at all
while the music was definitely better than the th games a lot of it is really odd it just didnt sound like mega man
the graphics were also a letdown from s parallax graphics and even some of the sprites ex
 mega man climbing up looks really funky look rather static
its clear that this is the last nes game released to my knowledge but i think capcom couldve done better
another aspect of the game that really bothered me was the simplicity of the stages and the games insanely easy difficultyoveralli really am mixed about this game
for the longest time i really liked this one over  because it seemed to be more fun
now after judging the two games from todays standpoint i liked  better overall because it was harder the gameplay was a bit smoother not to mention beat was ten times better and the storyline is among the best in the series
this game has great ideas like the rush adaptors the energy equalizer i think thats what its called better music and interesting bosses
so basically if you mashed the two together youd get all the mega man qualities
seriously though i think capcom really rushed this one and it shows and so with strenous decisionmaking id have to say that  is better by a notch
oh man this game comes soooo close
with that said this is still a decent game but i only recommend it to mega man fansmega man  marks the conclusion of the popular series on the nes
by this point many fans were getting tired of the same old formula however im an exception in that regard a winning formula never gets old in my opinion
ive always felt this way
you could release  games in this same exact style and if i like the idea ill continue to playhowever mega man  does have some minor issues
the biggest being the emptiness you occasionally encounter in some of the stages
its more like large sections that feel like filler to dash through which is a shame
it reveals that capcom was indeed running out of ideas by this point and simply putting mm on the market because its mega man and itd sell on the name alone
the bosses arent nearly as threatening as previous games either
about half of them can be completed with little trouble while the more aggressives one can be taken down by dashing around like crazy
not a problem however
easiness is rather encouraging after the struggles i had in say mega man pretty catchy music but nothing that blows me away
the weapons are decent enough but again i can take or leave them
probably the most noticeable sign that capcom was running low on ideas is if youve ever played mega man x theres a blast rhino and volt catfish stage
these two stages have similar enemies and design as a couple from this game
so there you have it a decent game that im being generous with giving it  stars when it probably deserves less and a  is totally out of the question
fun but the x series caught on soon after as gamers anticipated the super nes mega man gamesmuch like mega man  i have fond memories of mega man  while its hard to deny the series was running out of gas by this point  just take a look at some of the robot masters  there were several things that managed to grab my attention
the most important additions in mega man  have to be the rush adapters that grant the player the ability to turn into jet and power mega man
these forms allow the player to reach previously inaccessible areas and help bring back a little of the exploration thats been slightly siphoned out of the games over the yearswelcome as adapters are they can also show one how sloppy the game can be
the first eight stages of the game play like a dream and i have no complaints
its only after the player enters the final two fortresses do we see where how ugly things can get when games challenges are not tackled the right way
things are entertaining and a breeze with the right weaponsform in hand but this slick veneer is quickly peeled away when the player is caught between a rock and a hard place
even with advance knowledge of whats ahead its amazing how easy it is for this to occurstill like the family pet the fails to do its business outside its hard to stay mad at mega man  this especially holds true when one considers the fact the game almost didnt make it out of japan
with the arrival of mega man x capcom decided to forgo publishing the game abroad it was only after nintendo decided to pick it up for the fading nes that we actually got the gameits interesting history and aggravating points aside mega man  is an excellent conclusion to the nes library of mega man titles
while my memories dont exactly gel with currently realities  the game not being the juggernaut i remember  such is the fate of many of the games we grow up with
that said the game is easily a worth while investment for fans and newcomers alikeits a shame capcom didnt feel the need to release this under their own name in the states but may the gods bless nintendo for seeing the light at the end of the tunnel
mega man  ended the bit gamut on as high a note as possible in terms of level design gameplay and special effects including multiple routes in each stage that made for a bit of strategy to be evoked but unfortunately mm was little more than mm with a bit less class and that manic sugarrush feel
i must say i felt a bit empty knowing our favorite mechanical canine was relegated to only being two suits of armor the mega dude can wear though both are very important the bosses werent as inspired as the past few titles save for wind man and knight man of course
all hail that contest
i remember when they had it
 and the weapons scraped the bottom of the inspirational barrel but in the end mega man  was still a fun little jaunt down memory lane as we bid adieu to the nes and prepared for the snes to rock our worldmr x sponsor of the world robot tournament has stolen the eight strongest robots and converted them for his own evil deeds
he then announces he has been controlling dr wily from the day he turned evil
why would mr x be doing this
if you havent been able to guess he is dr wily somethings wrong
three fake bad guy plots in a row
give me a break
what the plot lacks the game makes up for
the rush jet is now a jetpack suit and theres a rush power adaptor to break down walls
if you can find proto man hell give you a special item too
there are fake and real robot masters in half the stages
defeat the four real ones and you get another great item
an nes game has never had music as good as this one
despite shortcomings and predictability this is still a good game worthy of being played through at least oncethis is one of the first games i received for the nintendo when i was a child
i had no idea what metal gear was or what the series would become
i just knew i had a new game and i wanted to play it
this was my first introduction to the character solid snake and his world of infiltration and tactical espionagein metal gear you play as solid snake a rookie to the fox hound branch of the military
you are to infiltrate a jungle fortress called outer heaven and initially rescue fox hound members including one of the top operatives grey fox
while it is always great fun to fight and to shoot the guards it is more effective to be able to sneak around them this will be perfected in later metal gear games
stealth is important
shooting with a weapon not equipped with a silencer is a risky moveas you progress through outer heaven you are sent on further missions and must fight ever more difficult bosses tanks men with machine guns etc
you begin the mission with nothing but your bare hands and a pack of cigarettes
as you continue to play you must acquire various weapons and items and use them to progress through the game
while not as detailed as metal gear solid psx the original metal gear is a game worth playing for fans of the series to get to experience the origins of the story discussed in later games as well as for fans of classic nintendo gamethis game is awesome but its way to hard for all the wrong reasons
every time you die even if you are at a boss you restart the level thats total bs
enemies respawn endlessly to the point where you cant move thats terrible programming
most of the levels are pits so have lame birds and garbage on every ledge is not a challenge its just stupid
over all though the game is awesome and a true nes classicthe original ninja gaiden series what is there really to say
the game was great challenging and for what it was worth the in between scene cinematics were pretty cool for the times when this game came outalthough what it lacked in originality it prevailed in everywhere else from gameplay challenge and extras
i will admit that it took forever to beat sometimes but it was worth it in the endagain very cool game
for those of us that are collecting classic systems and games this is a must getthis is a definite classic and for a nes game the controls and gameplay were fairly smooth for the limited options that nes programmers had
this game is by no means easy and can be very challenging but its also the kind of game where you can learn to deal with the challenge with a reasonable amount of patience and practice so the challenge itself is not frustrating or pointless as it is for games such as athena or hydlide
the storyline is fairly straightforward you are a ninja that has to deal with some bad guys
the levels are nicely varied you have the city you have mountains etc
nowadays its hard to find a working nes or game cartridge but if you have a emulator and love old nes games getting a ninja gaiden rom should be worth your timethis game though extremely fun and innovative is a ripoff of castlevania
just look at the bars at the top of the screen on each and compare the gameplay styles
see the resemblance
the secondary weapons are further proof of the games ripoff nature
between each level there are cinema scenes probably the first ever featured in a game
unfortunately places in the game can be extremely difficult
all nes owners should give this a tryok if you are anything like me you enjoyed this game as kid and granted it is still a good game
however when you really get into the game the levels just seem to fly by realistically if you wanted to beat this game in  minutes you probably could you can take different routes but they dont change the story line or anything
the concept of the game is great and the graphics are top notch for the time
maybe i am expecting a lot from this game when really ought to just accept it for what it is however the story is generic and kind of boring
the game play interesting enough for you to keep playing but not interesting enough to keep you playing like crazy
the game is fun but it was as though the game was just rushed and didnt make sense why did that
at first you fight a boss on every stage then you fight them at least every other stage
capcom tried rescue rangers has many stages not all that long however and fun gameplay however towards the end health and extra lives come by way too often
a fun light and short game with awesome musicthe chip n dale nes game is very cool it reminds me of the show i uset to watch i love itthis was my favorite konami game next to the contra  gradius series
it takes trial  error  patience for sure
when i finished it i felt like i accomplished something
not sure i ever one man solved it like contra  gradius but i got pretty proficient at at least solving itknowing how far video games have come in the past few years it is easy to forget the classics
shadowgate is considered by many to be one of the best and most innovative rpgs of its time and is still a hot item amongst older gamers like me to this dayyou are an adventurer who is on a quest to stop the evil warlock lord who has the power to destroy humanity
so you enter castle shadowgate in order to seek out the warlok lord and end his reign
of coarse nothing come easy
you encounter dangerous beasts ghosts and if you fail death himself
you also have to solve mindbending puzzles which is the main appeal of this game
you have to rely more on your brains and wits rather than your sword
the game is quite difficult the first time through and will definitely keep you busy for a few days at least
but there in lies the big flaw in shadowgate
there is no replay value
once you have beaten the game you know all the secrets and can easily breeze through the second time around
i beat this game in two weeks but the second time i beat it in less than  minutes
but considering the age of this game it is not a huge downer
it is still a fun trip down memory lanein terms of graphics they are great by nes standards
the colors and textures add depth to any given situation while the music also compliments the mood
since this is an oldschool rpg the emphasis is more on story and puzzles rather than action and fightingfor games who want to experience games from their childhood or see where games like final fantasy came from you should check out shadowgateshadowgate is an example of the lack of replayablility that comes with most puzzle games
it is a difficult headscratcher until you finally beat it for the first timeafter that you can run through the whole game in a little over  minutes
still a classic thoughive been on a simpsons retro gaming kick
im trying to get all the games back i rememeber as a kid and the simpsons games were some of my favorites
i have bart vs world bartman meets radioactive man and of course this one
bart vs the space mutants is by far the hardest of the three
i actually had this game on sega as a kid and remember it being harder for sega than nes
the reason being is i played this without a walkthrough i got online
without a walkthrough this game is almost impossible
i remember taking forever to figure out how to beat the first level then when i finnally did i would die right away in the second level
what makes this game tough is its not always clear where to go or what to do
a good example is on the th level theres two invisible platforms you have to jump on to beat the dinosaur
it can be frustrating to try to find something you cant see
however dont let that deter you from this game
like most nes games its all about figuring out patterns and timing
with a walkthrough or game faq this becomes a playable game
its tough but theres only  levels all together
what makes it challenging is theres no continues in the game and two hits on bart will cost you a life
you have to navigate the levels inch by inch and if you die you have to go back and play the previous levels to get back where you left off
with only  levels you would think its a short game but again its challenging so beating a level takes a while
once you beat a level though it becomes easier the next time around
for instance i can blow by the first  levels but keep dying at the end of the th
the th level is the nuclear power plant which is a long level of figuring out combinations to beat the game
ive never been to that level but am close after a week of playing the game again after all these years
i would suggest either of the other two simpsons games before this one
especially bart vs world however if you love the simpsons games definitely add this one to your collection
just make sure you use a game walkthrough when playing this oneyeah the title of the game is a bit cheesy but its a fun game and while nowadays you have awesome d games like the ones made by tony hawk this was a solid nes title with as much fun and graphics as you could have given the limited capability of the nintendo entertainment systemfamicomwith the virtual console making a lot of oldschool games available on the wii system this is one game that all gamers should pick up and play
there are too many words to describe how excellent the entire contra series is
on this particular title i loved hearing all the sound effects and music that are konamibased
you can also hear some of the same sound effects on gradius
most of the levels are platformbased and a couple of levels are topdown
i liked the first level the best because of the soundtrackbe warned  as you progress into the final levels of the game  its no cakewalk
just keep an eye out for enemies front and behind and you should do fine
it takes only one hour to clear this game but if you hunger for more contra why not try its super nes sequel the alien wars
there are also  other versions on game boy and game boy advance respectively
also please dont miss out on operation c the  game boy smashwhen people first think of nintendo mario is obviously the first thing that enters most peoples minds
even being the huge zelda fan that i am mario has still plopped into my head first mario like sonic is for sega is still a pop culture icon that seemingly doesnt age and it all started because of this game
super mario brothersthe goododdly enough this game stands the test of time even with later games not all of them mind you that have seemingly better graphics and color schemes
it has this otherworldly fun factor that somehow exceeds most games kind of like tetris
the music may be old but the soundtrack to this game grabs you by the cojones and forces you to like it
everything about this game in fact inherently grabs you like no other game couldthe badperhaps the only bad thing about it that i can say is probably the fact that ive gone through so many you found the princess
ehhhh
shes in another house go away
scenes that it got annoying for those of you who are going you got the phrase wrong it came from a song
but oh well i suppose it adds to the charm of the gameoveralla classic game
this should never be ignored
in fact i think game developers should test play this game and use it as a template for how games are made
not just as a platform aspect but its blend of fun and difficulty is uncanny
its very saddening to see todays gamers not liking it because it has bad graphics or other such drivel
i dont know what the mentality is but back in the day i guess us old gamers appreciated it more for what it was rather than just a part of the game
sigh  anyways its pretty common to find in game stores so its not like its going to run out or anything its mario and hes here to staythis is the side scrolling adventure of mario and his brother luigi if you have  players through the mushroom kingdom
it is a very basic easy to play yet challenging fun game to play
a is to jump holding b is to run left right and down are to move and duck
you can jump over pits jump on enemies to defeat them and collect three powerups
the super mushroom will just make you bigger to take a second hit of damage
the fireflower lets you shoot a bouncing fireball when you press the b button and the starman makes you invincible to plow through enemiesthe game is broken up into  worlds each with  levels
everything from a jog to the end to swimming castles or a mad dash over a bridge with flying fish
this is a true classic but i guess the only downside is there is a release with duckhunt
you can breeze through the game and have fun while doing it
pick it up and play it to relive the first must have game for the nesif youve played any mario game after this one prepare to die
the skidding physics make landing jumps and even sometimes making jumps difficult
thats not to say this game is bad quite the contrary but be ready to need to shut it off and cool down for a bit along the ride
im no greenhorn to vintage games but i still have trouble passing world two without the warp zonethis is the game that started it all and arguably saved the video game industry
its a classic that is often mimicked but never reproduced and should be in the collection of all nes or vintage games enthusiastscollectorsmine came very dirty
it looks as if someone at one point spilled soda into the open reading end
ive spent a lot of time cleaning it up with qtips and alcohol and still more time needs to be spend to get it back to factorynew reading quality but this point is really just to share the cleaning technique
i use  isopropyl alcohol and qtips to rub away the dirt and grime let the game dry and test until its running smoothlyits no wonder why mario became so popular after this game was released
the level design is fantastic the graphics and sound are great for its time and mario gets a few nice powerups
i dont like all the really old games that much but this game is definitely the greatest game of the s
its still pretty fun to play it today
i rate this game compared to many video games today this game may be very simplistic even boring
but  years ago this was the height of videogame technology
you had it all  a bad guy a princess to save a hero who can gain additional powers and the like
there were even shortcuts one could take so as to not have to traverse all eight worlds
it does get a bit repetitive compared to newer games but its still a classicwho hasnt played this classic
usually its thought of as perfect because everyone had a good time with it and anyone can pick it up and start playing instantly
well time to review it at todays standardsyou play as an anonymous plumber named mario that has set out to rescue some princess thats being held captive by a big lizard
you must make your way through different worlds and each has a castle where youll find out it was all for nothing because instead of a princess being there you encounter some dude with a mushroom head telling you she aint therethe game has actually held up very well throughout the years
the controls feel good and theres even a sense of momentum
my complaint with it is that its too simple
there really isnt a time when you feel overwhelmed or face a challenge where you feel like youre being tested
the only time i really died was when i tried to blow through the level quickstyle and would fall to my deathstill theres no way you can not give this game its props
it introduced a bunch of stuff that became videogame staples scrolling levels collecting  of something for a life hidden stuffsecrets icelavasnowswiming levels taking hallucinogenic drugs to alter your physical state
dope
in fact i hated the swimming levels
swimming levels suck alwaysi remember when we got this when we were small we stayed up all night playing this damn game
classic even the music is memorable
its still dope but super mario bros  is where its at nowsuper mario bros  is rather an odd mix of good and bad
for the good its creatively made and goes into a new different direction in terms of taking out the enemies maintaining the life of the protagonist and trying to win ups through slot machine playing
everybody knows that points are futile in nes games and its rightfully gone in super mario bros  also there is no timer in the game and there is backandforth ability that the original couldnt give
the challenge of the game isnt that too hard so pretty much anyone can beat it with practice
one recommendation is that play with a game genie to beat the game first before doing it without it because the final boss which occurs in world  is pretty difficult to beat
after getting the hang of it and knowing what to do the game becomes progressively easier to beat
so all left to do is to master the slot machines for easy ups
lastly the controls of super mario bros  are throughout excellent
for the bad i found the game boring at times because it got repetitive in certain aspects
why keep going against birdo so many times
cant the makers come up with a different villain each time
for many which becomes a big problem its very hard to know where the mushroom might be unless you have a walkthrough map provided by snesmaster of each level
you really need a meter of  health points in each level you are in and you can get hit this much and still win in each level anyway
probably the worst single aspect of super mario bros  is the weird herky jerky motion that occurs at times
ive lost a plenty of lives due to that its like i am in a motion and then somewhat the screen freezes and moves on a slow snail death pace causing me to lose momentum of what i am doing
if not for that the game is more enjoyable to play
but this one did annoy me a lot at times
finally after beating the game the ending is quite boring to watch
all in all super mario bros  gets a  out of  from me because its nowhere near the classic status of the original and is not even that memorable
just a good game but nothing more than that
one thing ill give the game is that it had really amazing graphicsthis particular run of the super mario series was probably the most hated because it went in a totally different way than all the others and notice how after this was released a year or so later super mario  had gone back to that original gameplay and became the new platform for the mario seriesi admit i liked that this one was different but i didnt like that it wasnt as interesting as it prequel or the continuing sequels after it
no hopping on enemy after enemy no fireballs now we throw things at everything
getting super stars was pretty random
all in all mario was on a different tip with this onebut we still love this game why
because its mario and lets face it weve all been this loyal for how long
me personally i was a teen when the nintendo came out and i still play my original nes yes its still in perfect condition somehow after  years
anyway if youre looking for nostalgia you might want to consider this one or super mario after super mario bros was a success
japan was trying to release super mario bros  lost levels but couldnt be sent to america so instead they used a game called doki doki panic and gave it a mario makeover which means well lets just talk about the story the plot is about mario rescuing a dream from the villan called wartgame wise you get a run button you can pick up vegetables to throw at enemies also you can pick up enemies as well
items you only get the starman you collect  cherries in each level to get them
bowser is not in this game at all
no fire flowers at all
the pow block is in the game from the original mario bros gamefor playable characters u can play as mario luigi peach and toad
luigi can jump extra high toad can pick up stuff faster peach can fly for a limited time and mario is just a normal standered character
there is a boss called birdo who shoots eggs out its mouth and fire ballsfor a game that does not fit into the general super mario canon this game is actually very enjoyable
so what if its different and not what one expected
the game itself regardless of story or characters is entertaining
you get to pick which one out of  characters you want to play each with their own strengths and weaknesses and you can change them every level so you dont have to be stuck with one character
the gameplay itself is solid and clean with some entertaining characters and minichallenge like finding the hidden keys and getting away from phantos before he can attack you or finding caches of gold coins or mushrooms
it might not be the greatest mario title but it certainly is a solid onei have the game on down load section at nintendo wiian also i played the game  times in the past all thought growing up tooanyway a little history of this gameback in the s it original came out as doki doki panic at japanbut unfortunately the us mario  isnt really the real mario  gamethe amerian people edit the game into mario  and which is becausethe real super mario bros  game never got release in usa an was reject because it was almost the same as mario bros  and except a few minor changes like poison mushroom etcan plus the japan super mario bros  was very difficult toooverall if you back to usa mario  where its the game that takes place in subcon an you can use  characters an thorw turnips are bad guys like shy guys bobombs and ninjis etcinstead of bowser koopa the have wart on the gamebut the real mario  did got rerelease in the game called super mario all stars known as the super mario bros lost levelsok if you are a true mario fan like i am then get usa mario  an download the japan super mario  on nintendo wii toojust type super mario lost levelsanyway the japan mario  is very frusteratingdifficult too but if you like the game that almost impossible to beat then get japan oneany way i think the least favorite mario game ever is the st one the original super mario bros  because right now i think the game is way too easymario  isnt a bad game same with mario worldbut mario  is a terrible game because they only have  course in iti dont know too much bout mario sunshine but super mario galaxy turned out to be a big imporvment compare to the last  gamesmario  and mario sunshine
but still compare to d gamesi like the usa mario  because its different an japan one because its hard ok done talkingi wouldnt say that super mario  is an overrated game but the humongous love by the public for it isnt justified as i think
while super mario  went all out and offered so many ways to play as mario the game play is on even level with the last two mario games
however the graphics look faded in super mario  whereas super mario  contains the best graphics of all three
the biggest downfall of super mario  is the ridiculous length that it takes to beat the game
i did every area of each world from one to eight and it took me six hours in one sitting
although i did it on first try i still think anyone can beat it because its not such a hard game to play
thats another positive about super mario  i forewarn you that certain areas in world eight are incredibly tough to beat but still attainable
my problem was that i used up all special items before i got to there
anyone who saved up them for world  especially the super power raccoon one will find them easy to beat no less
i was just stuck with the little mario the entire time
the final boss if reached will be the easiest to beat probably of all three games because of one reason there is always a up in that one
so theoretically that area can be played infinitely until the boss is dead
you dont have to do much with him just jump in and out of the holes until the boss makes a hole for himself to fall through
all in all super mario  is a very easy game to play and beat but nothing to get gaga about
i still think that the first one remains the quintessential nes game and must be upheld as the best game everthis is my type of game that i can enjoy on the nes
because i like to cheat on it and go to the end which that makes me feel better
i like marios costume as a raccoon but i didnt know as a kid that raccoons could fly
what a way to lie to a kid
the last level is the best scene to go to although it seems hard than i thought
i like level  because of the pipes although it gets confusing but its fun
i had never got passed level  yet
darn
i wonder who did
this is my game to keepits not as good as the original super mario bros but definitely a lot better than super mario bros  there are a lot of great powerups and a huge variety of them
however the game is a bit too easy super mario world is more challenging
the level design is cool but it couldnt live up to mario worlds level design
the graphics and sound are the second best on its system
overall its not the all time great its made out to be in fact its not even in my top  mario games
this game does not deserve to be called the best mario game ever and it makes me mad
i rate this game the only thing that could have made this game better was a save feature due to the complexity of the levels and the amount of time it would actually take to go through each and every level of the game
fortunately that was an option in mario allstars for the snes but this nes version is still classic
it stands out as one of the best mario titles out there as well as just being an awesome videogame overall
one of my personal favorite features was the fact that you could save items for later so you could whip out an mushroom or flower if you were faced with an particularly daunting level and i loved the card games
whether or not youre a mario fan this game is awesomeiconic game that improved and continued the smb series
the ability to collect and use items from one level to the next and having a wide range of game play added to its successone was the original but everyone remembers three pbgthis game has tons of levels fun powerups and enemies that debuted in this game are still famous in the series today
dry bones thwomps boos chain chomps and more
the only complaint i have is that you cant save in this huge game
in the original it didnt take a while to complete a world so no saving was okay
but it really hurts it that you have to complete it without turning the system off
this was fixed in super mario allstars and super mario advance   i would give it a  stars if possiblethe super mario  nes game is very cool  n great condition infact its n mint condition it awsomethis game is a oldie but definite goodie
it certainly isnt the greatest game ever but back then it was a solid title
its fun in its simplicity though i enjoyed the skateboarding levels more than the surf
i spent most of the time i played this game on the skateboarding part and its fun
theres cool tricks you can do to rack up the points and all in all this aint a bad nes title at all
forget xbox and all that fancy schmancy junk sometimes you just cant beat the old schoolgreat game
its taking me a while to get used to it again but its just as fun as it was when i was kid
good timesthe original ninja turtles was a lot different from its sequels instead of the arcade action this was a platform sidescrolling adventure which occassionally transitioned to overhead map views and cruising around in the turtle vanthe goodit was fun of course
you got to change your turtle within a mission and select different weapons that you collect along the way
the music was good especially when considering the time period of this game
some might this as a burden but i enjoyed its difficulty
as ive said in my other reviews this game was made back in the day when nes games kicked your  and forced you to defeat it on its own terms
when comparing this to the much easier  and  i enjoyed this much better but i still like the others for their multiplayer ability dont get me wrongthe badwhile this was difficult and i enjoyed it there were some things that do place a detriment to the game
the turtles are uneven in their abilities
leonardo has a long reach but is the weakest of the four why do that to my favorite turtle
mikey is not much better than leo in terms of weapon power
raphael is good for his fast attacks despite his upclose range
donatello pretty much defeats all of them because he is the strongest and has the farthest reach
you could beat this game on him aloneif youre a fan of the old school nes you will no doubt enjoy this game or perhaps just a fan of the ninja turtles in general
its a good platform game that is unique in comparison to the sequels that followed
todays gamers will no doubt turn away from it because of its dated graphics which arent bad especially considering the time period and its more difficult levels
its too hard
well i suggest you try harder
this game doesnt spoonfeed you its a difficult adventure
so strap on some turtle shells and even a game genie if you want it and some weaponry and engage yourself in a classic gamethe topgun nes game is a hard  find game it is a hard game but its a great zodas revenge isnt the most popular game
its the sequel to startropics another game that kinda flew under the radar back in the day
as a kid these were some of my favorite games because they are similar to the legend of zelda
that doesnt mean to much anymore because the industry has multiplied indefinitely but back then we took what we could get
i still have this game and while the story isnt up to par with the first onenot at all actually its still clever and has the quality that nintendo has always deliveredaliens dinosaurs and time travel
what more needs to be said
this classic game is original and offers a bit of a challenge at timesthis is a good way to play games that have to do with flying and moving
its joystick allows u to move in any direction and it feels like an arcade game
i love to use it on mario because it gives u a more of a running and jumping distance
the only thing i have against it is sometimes ur hand loses control on the joystick and the red buttons get stuck allotback in the late s capcom created a series of games that would achieve status as classics including  strider bionic commando commando ghosts n ghouls among many others
one of the games didnt stand out much for the fact that not very many copies were sold but it quickly rose to become a cult classic
it was among the first of its kind and generated sequels and spinoffs that would please many gamers around the world
his name mega manthe goodthe graphics were ahead of their time and this is one of the few instances where an early game reaches the potential of the system
the music was also very well written and many of the tunes stood out including cutman elecman and fireman
this was one of the first games to define the platform genre teenage mutant ninja turtles was around the same time as well
of course its fun
i noticed many mega man gamers tend to dismiss this one because it was raw andor it was too hard
bah
i enjoyed the difficulty level and i like this game over mega mans  anyhow not that they were terrible mind you
the ending was also pretty good considering no dialogue is spokenthe badin this game when youre flashing and you hit spikes you still die
this was changed in later entries
also there is no password system to save your game so youd have to start from scratch every time
oh and did you remember the game boxs cover
weird
still this is mega man in its raw form and should be reviewed lightlyoverallwhat can i say
the mega man series is a great one and this is the one that started the whole thing
i loved the old school feeling this game has and the fact that its among the hardest in the series
this is a hidden gem folks its rare but i highly suggest you hunting down this game for your nesthe original mega man is probably not a classic truth be told
the game unfortunately feels lacking in several areas compared to mm   and   the backgrounds are a little boring and repetitive the gameplay feels slower than what youve come to expect later on and maybe even choppy at times the amount of enemies are few and far between and the music is probably not up to par either
however i believe its completely forgiveable for a debut to have these problems especially since its mega man were talking about here the actionpacked series that satisfied most of our heartpumping explosion cravings in the s and early s
we also need to realize this game was probably a major influence for all the roboticthemed video game series released several years later
i cant say this with absolute certainty only knowing this game was highly praised back in the day allows me to assume it was influential to some extentyes you only have  bosses and stages compared to what would quickly become the standard  but these stages offer a wonderful challenge and gameplay basically the same as mega man   to give an example of the games difficulty these flippable platforms appear early on in one stage that will surely force you to lose in controllerslamming fashion until you figure out how they function
losing is quite alright though this game is part of the rough and tough expect no mercy gaming experience from the mid to late s
this period of gaming is exactly what made the nes so awesome
it wasnt really about completing the game for many of us it was about how far wed be able to progressthis game also uses a points system which seems really odd but again capcom didnt know at the time that a point system wasnt really necessary so i cant fault it only ignore it
great start
please though make sure you enter these stages with the correct weapon or you probably wont survive
why is this you wonder
because the enemies take away a pretty good amount of damage per hit
for those who dont like this game please consider that it could have been a lot worsewhen you talk about capcom the developer and publisher has a long and celebrated history
they got their start during the s making video games for the nes
in  they released several of them in hopes of showing that their games were fun to play
little did they knew that a major franchise was born to humble beginnings mega man almost didnt see the light of day outside of japan
capcom decided at the last minute to release it in the us and it led to one of the worst box art designs in the history of video games
it didnt matter because the few players who got their hands on this game realized that there was something cool about it
word of mouth quickly spread out through the gaming community and mega man had gathered a cult following
oh yesthe blue bombers first adventure left quite an impression on gamers everywherein mega man you control mega man aka rockman in japan a humanlike robot created by dr wright later on capcom changed his name to dr
light
he sought out the games main villain dr wily who reprogrammed dr wrights robots to work for him and wreck havoc in the city of monsteropolis
as mega man you chose from six stages filled with enemies traps pits and a robot master
beat the robot master of each stage to acquire his special power
after you clear all six stages you ran through four more stages filled with more boss characters the chance to fight all six robot masters again and finally you fought against dr wily
you did not have access to passwords or battery backed saves but you were able to pick up extra lives and had unlimited continuesthe pros out of all the games capcom released this one stuck out
it was a one of a kind game involving robots a futuristic setting the ability to gain enemy robots powers and interesting stage layouts that put your shooting jumping and memorization skills to the test
for its time the graphics were pretty sharp and bright
the sound effects and controls were spot on and easy to appreciate
the music was excellent since each robot masters stage got its own theme so it fit the mood perfectly
there was a lot of variety when it came to enemy robots and some were exclusive to certain stages
mega man quickly became known as a hard as nails game to play through so if you beat it you were among an elite group of gamers that managed to pull it offthe cons since it was really hard to beat back then it also proved to be its biggest fault
at the time most games were pretty easy to clear compared to mega man
the game had been too much for some players which led to most people who attempted to beat it to give up completely
it was a bit demanding to beat the game in one setting even though you had unlimited continues and enemies would randomly drop extra lives though not as often
it was also one of the few games where you didnt earn extra lives through points so it didnt help at alldespite the steep learning curve and the fact that it demanded high gaming skills mega man earned its place in video game history and gave birth to one of capcoms most recognized video game characters
they would go on to release five more sequels on the nes a new spin off series for the snes and ps and multiple portable iterations
if you missed your chance to play this diamond in the rough title you can search for a used copy or pick up the mega man anniversary collection for the ps or gamecube consoles
also if you own a wii you can download this game from their virtual console service for us   pointsmega man
part one of a nine game seriesfor the most part nes action platform games were very entertaining but often they lacked variety and ways to reward the player
most games with the exception of rpg and adventure games had you play as a character who is more or less the same at the end as they were when you started
in  capcom stepped in and came up with an interesting idea what if you could defeat a boss and steal their weapon to use for the rest of the game
thus the mega man series was born
heres the lowdown on the first legendary gameproswhile the story isnt exactly incredible this being the first game it is actually pulled off well
two scientists dr light and dr wily created six mining robots which specialized in specific environments
however dr wily became jealous of dr lights praise and so he reprogrammed these six robots to do his own evil bidding
secretly dr light had created two household robots rock and roll
rock decides to have dr light fit him with armor and a plasma gun in order to stop dr wily and the six corrupted mining bots thus turning rock into mega maneven though there are only six bosses they are each very unique and offer a variety of weapons
for instance cutman throws his scissors out in a boomeranglike fashion while gutsman picks up boulders and hurls them
also the bosses are nice and tough
elecman is particularly nastymega mans controls are nice and simple
he may not have a lot of abilities in this game but the jumprunshoot set of controls are all he really needs herepossibly the most difficult entry in the series
yes this game will really test your gaming abilities to the limit as there are no etanks and passwords to be found here
i seem to notice that a lot of people complain about the lack of passwords
please
mega man games are generally pretty short so if you dont have the patience to sit through an entire mega man game then you shouldnt even bother playing them in the first place
i never use passwordsgreat variety of level designs and enemies to fight
the levels arent too terribly long but not brief either
likewise the enemies will definitely keep the player busy enough to make it challenging but not too frustrating except for maybe the final levelsthe graphics are nice for the era and there is very little if any slowdown present
the sprites of mega man and the bosses are all equal size not like later entries in which the bosses dwarf the poor blue guythis might be cheating but i like the pause cheat that you can use to help you with some bosses
i wont tell you how to use it
find out yourselvesthough the sound effects are good its the music that will really catch your attention
most of the tunes are done well my favorites being iceman and elecmans themes in particularthere are no bad tunes to be found hereconseven though this is the first game i thought that the magnet beam generator ability was lacking
whenever youre standing on one and it disappears you not only fall but you dive straight down as fast as a bullet
its the only extra ability besides the boss weapons and it seemed like a good idea but not quite there in its executionthere are no etanks yet
this isnt that big of a deal because this makes the game more challenging but there a few areas the later levels in particular in which youll really wish you had themspikes are the devil in this game
not because they can kill you in one hit but because they can kill you while youre recovering from an attack
it might make traversing levels harder but i find this to be annoying
thankfully capcom fixed this in the next gamethough the main character is in fact mega man by looking at the box cover youd think otherwisewhats up with the point system
you go around collecting little orange and red balls throughout the levels which are supposed to increase your score at the end of each level but the points never earn you lives or anything
thankfully this is the only game to include pointsoverall this is a great game even though there are a few rough spots here and there
besides it laid the official groundwork for the rest of the series and everyone has to at least appreciate that
its not my favorite mm game but it is certainly not bad at all
in fact this was the last of the nes mm games i played
 stars overall
if you want a game which has a great oldschool feel but will not let you down on the challenge factor then the first mm game is the right place to come to
get equipped with bubble lead and go find a copythe first megaman game i ever played was mm and after that i played a couple of later mm games before i finally played the original mega man
i immediately noticed several differences but for a first game this was pretty good
its a bit clunky and simplistic compared to its successors much like final fantasy  or super mario brothers but is still a nice solid game
definitely not the best of the mega man series this lacked in a password feature and replay value is somewhat limited this game still does deserve a try and to be played once if youre a diehard megaman fanwhen capcom released mega man or rockman in japan they could have had little idea that they just launched their biggest franchise nor would it be possible for the buying public to realise this character would go on to become the most prolific game character everhis first game an action platformer from  famously introduced the concept of chosing your own order in which to beat the stages
not only that when you defeat the boss of that level you get hisher powers and can use these powers against other robot masters
while the weaknesses had some logic in them in the first three games as it is based off the game paper rock scissors the further we got along in the mm series the less that analogy really worked seriously why is tomahawk man in mm vi weak too 
while the game itself is pretty linear mm still gave the players a rather remarkable sense of freedom in the s
while the concept has since been beat to death if youre from that generation of players you cant help but appreciate mms rather daring game play
but that doesnt mean its a perfect game
not by a long shotthe game has some of the most notorious cover art in video game history
the cover art has absolutely nothing to do with the game and mega man looks like a forty five year old man holding a gun in some bizarre futuristic placelike most franchise that began in the s castlevania metroid kid icarus ninja gaiden mario the legend of zelda and several others this first game may seem a little bit rough compared to later installments
while arguably smb could be released in todays game market with little or no changes games like metroid the first zelda and this title  would never be released without some significant revisions
metroid has no automap and youre left wondering around this labyrinth maze with little or no direction where to go
zelda has the same issue though instead of a maze its a large overworld and its damn near impossible to find all its secrets without referring to some type of map or game guide which in the s were hard to come by if you didnt have a subscription to nintendo power the essential gaming magazine of the s
metroid is a particular favorite of mine particularly for the lack of automap but for those professional critics who criticize its game play the original legend of zelda is just as unforgiving and obtuse at times
still both are great gamesmega man is the same way
there are undeniably some great parts to the game but its a little rough around the edges by todays standards like most games of that era
overall the games difficulty is rather high especially in the last stages
and like zelda ii the game difficulty also has just some plain cheap shots to it
if it werent for the magnetic beam i would probably never get past the last half of the ice mans stage which involves jumping from platform to platform dodging shots
you can be standing directly on the platform in the dead center get shot and get knocked off or fall through to your instant death
even with mega mans infamous recoil he should be knocked that far back
guts mans roving platforms at the beginning of that stage are also rather notoriousspeaking of the magnetic beam all six nes titles have special items that you must use to further advance in the game
from mmii on you would get said item after defeating a particular robot master
in this game however the item is in plain view in the elec man stage though you must have defeated guts man and use his weapon to throw away the blocks that keep mega man from getting the item
you may or may not pick it up
but heres the trick
you must have it to get past a certain area in the opening stage of dr wilys castle
the game is rather cheap like thatother difficulties include lack of energy tanks as well as no password feature
that means every time you turn on the game you must start all over
now this problem has since been alleviated with the games release on the mega man anniversary collection
but if youre playing on an original nes well good luckback in  most gamers were still going for high scores and so mega man the only game in the entire massive franchise to do so has points and keeps score
anyone who gets a high score on this game i do admire as when you run out of lives you die and given the games difficulty you will end up losing your accumulated score quite often
still theres no high score keeper and you dont get anything for high points
overall this feature feels much more like a relic of its time and very much feels like the high score feature was simply tacked on to an already existing game
the high score serves no real function and capcom wisely disregarded it when they made mega man iithe game also features different graphics for the health powerup and the weapon powerup
these items graphically are the same for mm to mm but in mm they appear totally different
the game also features an exclusive item to the series a powerup called the yashichi
it only appears once in the last stage of the game
capcom used the item in other games in that same era
throughout the series if mega man is hit by an enemy he becomes temporarily invincible to further attacks
from mega man  on this invincibility would even protect mega man if he fell onto spikes
however in the nes version of mega man  that is not the case
while the temporary invincibility is featured in this game it will not prevent mega man from perishing if he falls onto spikes
this aspect of the mega man  play mechanics contributes greatly to the games overall difficultyalso for the six nes games mm is the only one that makes the player fight enemies after reaching the robot masters lair
in the other five installments once mega man reaches the robot masters room mega man goes into a short passageway into the next room to fight that particular levels boss
there are no enemies in these passageways and are only one screen long
however in mm the corridors are longer than one screen and there are enemies to contend with when bartering passage to the robot masters
these corridors might have been leftovers during development during which capcom originally was going to release the game on the famicom disk system
the corridors would have been used as loading tunnels allowing the disk to be accessed and load up the boss fight without any major pauses in the action
in the end capcom switched to cartridges instead but the tunnels stayed anywaymega man  is also the only nes mega man game that makes the player climb up or down once he or she reaches the inner chamber
in elec mans stage the player must climb up a ladder to reach his lair in bomb mans stage the player climbs down a ladder or falls to reach his lairat the end of every nes mega man game the player must fight the games robot masters a second time before going to the final showdown with dr wily
mm is the only game that spreads these fights across two separate levels mega man must fight cut man and elec man on wily stage  and then has to fight bomb man fire man ice man and guts man on wily stage 
mm is also one of the only two games in the classic series the other being mega man  bass that does not allow the player to select the order in which to fight the robot masters a second time
in mega man  through  after defeating each robot master the second time a large energy pellet appears
in mega man  these do not appear making the last stage considerably difficultstarting with mega man  the player is shown a visual representation of dr wilys castle or in mega man   and  dr cossacks castle proto mans castle and mr xs castle respectively with dr wilys castle following each
each stage is a dot on the map and when mega man beats one stage and goes to the next this progress is shown on the map
mega man  however does not have this feature
in the psp remake mega man powered up it can be seen as the player loads one of four final levels and is named castle wily
mega man  is also the only game where the player selects dr wilys stage and he appears like the robot master with the clear points listed next to himthis section in brackets drawn from wikipedia
i wrote these sections in that article however
i can proudly say that i have beaten this game but only once
the last stage on dr wily is absolutely brutal and the last fight with those four bosses back to back extremely hard
without the pause trick i dont know how people do it
and the yellow devil is a nightmare as well
still i beat the game this ones harder that lost levels any dayof all the six nes games this has the most oldschool feel to it
other installments to the series feel much more refined and much more polished
this title though feels like it stands along the ranks of zelda metroid ninja gaiden and mario for that oldschool mid s gaming goodnessdespite its difficulty this is easily one of my favorite nes games
the game has proven to hold up remarkably well despite the rough edges and it is only by tinkering with the game engine slightly by lowering the difficulty and introducting a couple new features that capcom introduced the masterpieces mmii and mmiii
but the foundation for those games was all hereoverall this is the worst of the original mega man trilogy
still a legendary start and rightly sothis is my order of mega man nes titles from best to worst
ii and iii are the best though i give a slight edge to ii because this is the game that really redefined the mega man formula but iii is just as good and probably better
iv and v are about the same as well though neither approach the sublime quality of the first threemega man iimega man iiimega manmega man vmega man ivmega man vithis is an excellent game and if you were looking for a version of tetris that was more challenging than dr mario was for you
this game is sometimes very tricky but its very fun as wellthe object of the game is to match the colors of the pills that are being dropped onto the viruses below and by doing this killing them off one by one
i really dont carw what anyone says but this game rocked
in tetris the challenge was to clear lines that are at the bottom and they build up
in dr mario you had to play the boards as they were giben and in most cases the viruses were all over the place so placing some of the pills in the wrong place could come back to haunt youlike i said the challenge to this game is great and it never got tired
really check out dr mario its worth itim not sure which one i like more this game or yoshis cookie
both have different rules of gameplay but both are also challenging
ive always been a sucker for tetrisstyle games pieces fall down you try to get rid of them for a nes game the controls and graphics were smooth
theres not much i can say that other reviewers havent already said
if you like puzzle games you should enjoy thisgreat puzzle game
cant beleive it still keeps me entertained after  years  good times
great value for its price
great for any mario fan you wont be sorry pdr mario was created for two reasons
first reason was to captialize mario even further and expand him on more than adventure games
second reason was to target a audience younger than ten years old who may find tetris a tedeious andor difficult puzzle game
even to this day at  years old im not that good at tetris so i found dr mario a colorful easy happy and exiciting alternative to take on
since  i had fun with blowing out viruses by simply applying the capsules that matches the color of each virus
unlike tetris its a two player game of which you get to challenge your friends to see who can wipe out the viruses first
i had to buy a copy off amazon because i misplaced the original cartridge that i got when it first came out
there is no cure for this nolastagic fevernot many people probably remember or have even played this one but it was the st of a fabulous series to come
the graphics and music were pretty basic but the gameplay was pretty fun and it was cool that the characters changed their look after you returned the rats tail to the dragon king
it was a slow game to start with but as you played more it got more interesting
they possibly couldve made it a bit better but all in all it was a good gamecompared to the sprawling worlds and storylines of current final fantasy games ff and around that this game is pitifully simple
and lets be honest in these times this game really isnt that impressive
the quest is simple there is no character development and the weaponsarmor system was very clunky
one thing that really bothered me was that you had to have someone drop their weapon or armor before you could pick up something else and equip it and once thrown away these items were irretrievableif you want to try this game best to try the gameboy advance version of this game which comes with a better itemweaponand magic system along with several bonus dungeons and many cool items you never had before
still back then in the s this game was admittedly one of the best of its kind and even today stands as a classicits  sells arent going so well for a small company known as squaresoftwhat are they to do
they decide to release one last game calling it quotfinal fantasyquot thus being their final game if it doesnt sell good and appeal to fans
but this definitiely wasnt the case and thank goodness it wasntquotfinal fantasyquot was the start of the most wellknown rpg series in the world
it sold really well and was successful enough to span many sequels spinoffs and whatnot
released in  in japan it wasnt released in the us until  fans all over the world loved itwell first off final fantasy is a very challenging game at least the first time you play through it
you have to choose the classes for your characters at the beginning fighter thief white mage black mage red mage and black belt
these will be the classes you keep throughout the entire game with the exception of a small upgrade about ths or so through it
your characters never talk so there isnt much character development
what is there though is a game that was just simple and downright fun to play
there was no game that could be mistaken for a movie like the newer ffs although i like every ff in a way
just a simplistic game
go to a town talk to the townspeople buy equipment find out your destination and repeat
at the same time you will go into random battles
you must constantly watch your hp and make sure not to use up too much of your magic or your itemsthis is one of the most challenging ffs out there but challenge is good
the story goes beyond the quotsave the worldquot theme and was one of the first games to have a more complex story than your average rpg back then
its really tough to find nowadays so i would recommend going with quotfinal fantasy originsquot for the ps one
you get ff i and ii for  bucks plus the graphics are upgraded to bit quality story makes more sense theres more character interaction and the music sounds better
although some people will prefer the classic morethis game is a must for any kungfu fan gamer that is
 floors of nonstop bosses and bats little dwarfs coming at cha
the music is the same throughout the levels
i only beat it once so far ill do it again soon when im up for challenegeyou are thomas and you have to save your girl from mr x sounds like every other game out there but kung fu is actually completely uniquethe control has you restricted to short jumps punches and kicks
the whole point of kung fu is to use your basic movement wisely
sure you can bash some punks easily by punching repeatedly but then youll later have to encounter guys that throw knives orbs that dragons would evolve from and winged insects that would fly high or belowas brief as it is only  levels
 kung fu is one heck of a gem
the precise combat makes for a pretty fun gamekung fu is classic i forgot how hard these old school games werei truly enjoyed playing the game again it brought back many memories a little repetitive but you gotta love iti am impressed by the condition this game was init did have a name written on the back but with a little tlc and alcohol wipes it came right offi have this game but ive never played it because i got it when i was really little and about five or six years ago my nintendo broke
 so i really dont know what i should rate it
i dont really know much about the game except what ive heard about it eitherwhat can i say about this game that hasnt been said about it before
game is a classic
if you love zelda youll love this gamethe legend of zelda is worth the buy on the collectors edition for gamecube only these days
the first thing ya might be asking why  stars
well there some  cm
flaws on the collectors edition which im refering to
the grpahics as the results of the backthenvideogames are terrible
me
why this game is splendid
its just you never even know where ganon is hiding in the first part of the gameoverall awesomei am the biggest zelda fan ever since i was  or  years old
so i like this game because its a gold cartridge and the gameplay is undetectable
i like adorable link and he looks more like an ant in the graphics because its nes
in the nintendo  he looks like a giant but better to see him
and i bet you that on nintendo gamecube hes going to look better than an ant graphic which i would love when the graphics are enhanced
as far as the graphics get better to see the backgrounds and other things surrounding in the game thats far too good
this is a keeper and i wouldnt sell it to anyone
its a memory from the pastthis honestly isnt a bad game for the game that kicked off the legend of zelda franchise
it may be simplistic compared to later games like ocarina of time or twilight princess but even now i still like playing it
theres not much i can say here that other reviewers havent said
this is a rocking game and if youre a legend of zelda fan then you seriously need to try this game
it might be around  years old but its a solid classic with features seen even in todays newest loz gamesthis started all of the zelda series and it is still going today
i loved zelda ever since i played this game so now i have played mostly all of them
this game is fun and all but the layout is confusing and from this game up to the snes zelda they r all the same type of layout
that is why i like the newer ones with the first person view
but this is the first one i played and it still makes me happy when i play it
i mean it has a good replay value
it has great music and sound for the nes and i played  this game on the nes the most because it has a save feature which is amazing for back in its day
i wish that mario and other games had save too so it would make it much eaiser
but zelda would almost be impossible to beat if it did not have save on it because it would take so long
mabey thats why it was such a good seller
i love this game but it is very hard when u get far enough into itthe zelda game is a rare  hard to find game i love haven it i play every now n thenyou better have a map handy when playing this game
its quite complicated
but the thing is if youve already played a link to the past this game hasnt much more to offer
perhaps the only thing it has thats not in the snes version is the feature where youre forced to pay for door repairs if you blow up certain cave wallszelda  is basically the prototype for a link to the past
thats why i like the nd zelda better
because its actually a different game from the st and rd zelda
zelda  and  have pretty much the exact same gameplay except  is a massive improvement in terms of characters and graphicsstill its nice to play this game again  years later see the dragon in the first dungeon and say hey i remember that guy
i beat the first quest of the game but i didnt feel like doing another quest all over again
especially when the only difference is in difficulty level and where items are placedthe first  zeldas arent bad for classic games but i think id only classify a link to the past as a mustplay
zelda  is so bland in comparison  finally i finished the second quest
its quite a bit more difficult than the first quest
i didnt realize that although the map of hyrule looks the same the dungeons are completely different in look as well as item placement
throughout the second quest i always seemed short on money and i kept getting my sword stolen by those orange sparkle things
let me emphasize that you really need a map for this second quest because darn near all the dungeons are completely hidden in places you would never guess in a million yearsthis game was long as heck for a game made in   contrary to my earlier remarks i would definitely recommend going through the second quest after youve beaten the first because the dungeons are much more challenging
great replay value
definitely an adventureit took me a long time to give this game a chance
i am a huge zelda fan but this one seemed a little too different
but was i suprised when i started playing
the overworld map is similar to the original zelda game
but u run into random battles like final fantasy and gain exp points to go up in levels
when u run into battles or enter a cave or dungeonit turns to sidescrolling
it is a difficult game considering u have  lives and when u lose them u continue from the center of the world map
kind of like mario games
so this game is actually very fun despite the differences from other games in the series
give it a shot and u may enjoy itnow i am going to review a game that most zelda fans are divided on some hate some like it  that is the adventure of link zelda ii
i am being honest if i want to play zelda this wouldnt be the st game id pop in i would go for the st game or my favorite a link to the past or ocarina of time majoras mask or twilight princess which i finally got around to playing i can say each time i play it i like it more  more
zelda ii was released in january of  in japan  in december of  in the us
so really it was rushed in japan  btw the japanese love hard games the japanese version of super mario brother  is very hard so much so that they took another game  put mario characters in it
i dont know if it wouldve worked out if they had done the same thing for zelda ii so its probably best they didnt
zelda ii is unique cause its a side scroller  it put in more rpg elements
both the original zelda on the nes  a link to the past on snes were both overhead games  were more of an adventure game than an rpg
this game doesnt use rupees you have to to rely on experience points  special skills you get in towns when you talk to the old men or knights or the gear or tool you find in towns
so it does have a novelty of being a full rpg  not just rpg elements
there are your typical easy enemies outside in hyrule  in the st few dungeons  the dungeons arent too bad
the bosses i think are more unique than the original zelda
i might as well get into the story ganon was defeated in the legend of zelda but there are still members of ganons clan that still worship him  they have whats left of ganon  the only attempt to bring ganon back to his pig like glory is they need to kill link  use his blood to revive ganon
link has came back to hyrule cause he needs to attain the triforce of courage hidden in the great palace so evil couldnt get their hands on it
impa tells link a story about when the king of hyrule died  left the kingdom to zelda a wizard tells the kings son that his sister knows where the rd piece of the triforce is at the wizard threatens to put a sleeping spell on her
she wont give the location out so she is put under the spell but the wizard dies right after
so this zelda has been asleep for hundreds of years
impa gives link these  gems to place in  dungeons to get to the great palace
so the remaining followers of ganon see this as their time to strike  believe me you they are p  i  s  sed at you
you start off with moblins  bits  bots going after you but then you have these tektites that are the hardest they have ever been  you have to have the fire spell that shoots fireballs out of your sword to kill them
not only that you have to deal with these axe wielding enemies called darias annoying enemies like megmats  these things called moas that fly all over the screen
bago bago are very annoying  can get in your way  they can knock you off into a pit or whatever  you lose a lifewhich if you lose all  lives then its game over return of ganon you lose all your experience points i dont know if you lose all your tools or not
i can forgive the difficulty cause a lot of nes games were hard so no problem with its difficulty but i cant give the  lives  you start over the pass
another enemy that is bad news is iron knuckles the blue partetamce the wizrobes  even worse in the rd dungeon they look like member of thek  k  k you have these things called ras that fly across the screen theyre in the way
the bubles steal your magic for no good reason  you need magic  you need as much as possible mainly the shield spell life spell  later on the thunder spell
the attacks you learn like the down thrust come in real handy especially for the rebonack boss
i will talk about some fo the magic you get the shield spell lets you take less damage when hit
a jump spell that makes you jump higher
which that spell is also great in boss battles
the life spell does what it says it regains some of your health again great in boss battles
the fairy spell link turns into a fairy no comment here
reflect spell it knocks back attacks such as the wizrobes attacks
the spell spell which turns some enemies into bits  bots
the thunder spell which makes  of the last bosses thunderbird
this game as i said has better bosses than the st game well except for the st  temple the st dungeons boss is horse head  in the nd temple you have helmet head
the rd temple you face rebonack
the th temple you face carock its rememberable  cause the way you defeat it is using the reflect spell  it doesnt take much to beat it
gooma in the th dungeon is was sort of difficult but not impossible
volvagia makes its st appearance as barba in the th dungeon its not as great as the battle in ocarina of time
in the great palace you face thunderbird which you got to learn the pattern to beat it well
then when you get the triforce of courage you face dark link which is an evil version of link
hes not much of a problem if you know the special method
i fell the adventure of link zelda ii is worthy of being in the franchise
shigeru miyamoto must of enjoyed the mental torture this caused back in the day though
this game is all about preference as i said in my zelda nes review youll need some patience but not only patience for zelda ii but a lot of coffee  some kind of tobacco product  i wont fault you if you decide to use a game genie for this game
this game also established stuff like the triforce of power wisdom  courage
the towns was used more in future zelda titles
there isnt much more i can say except i will review my favorite zelda game the legend of zelda a link to the past nexti apologise for borrowing the title from the box of the game itself but i cant think of any other
when i first saw this game in action i already had the first one and was deeply in love with it
understandably this game turned me off instantly
i couldnt bear to see link with sqare bars in his life gauge and with three continues
early the next year  i bought zelda  and beat it in less than a month
then towards the end of that year i decided to try this out again
and so it is worth noting that i had conquered both the first and the third game when i finally bought this
now to the gamein zelda ii the adventure of link a princess called zelda not the one from the original has been put to an eternal sleep by an evil magician long ago
link decides to remain in hyrule after his first adventure and on the day of his th birthday a mark appears on his hand
when he seeks impas help he learns that as the chosen one he himself must undo the quotbinding forcequot and enter the great palace in the valley of death
for what
to win back the triforce of courage of course
only the combined power of the triforces of wisdom power and courage can awaken the princess from her slumber
well thats the story
you can draw your own conclusionsthis game has two types of scenes the quotland mapquot and the quotaction scenequot in the land map a minuscule link moves through various landscapes like roads forests plains and deserts until he bumps into one of two types of enemy symbols
when link runs into these or enters a town or palace the land map quickly changes to the action scene
here is where you can use the sword and magic as well as interact with people and objects
this is basically how zelda ii plays
yes its different but unique
after all it wouldve been a bit lame if nintendo just released a replica of zelda  labelled zelda ii would it notnow to the graphics
the land map graphics are primitive even for nes standards but the action scene graphics where it really counts are quite good
they are much better than zelda  link is not dwarfish anymore and the villages palaces and endbosses are decent even today
musicwise again its quite good
the village theme is lovely
the cave and palace music fit their atmosphere very well
the great palace music is also great
the zelda theme is a little different in this game
anyway its a refreshing change
the sound effects are fair toothe game controls are fluid
but links jumping capacity till you find the quotjumpquot magic is low and his sword is more like a knife and you cant upgrade it
as for gameplay there are no boomerangs bombs rupees and arrows
was that a scream i heard
dont worry things really arent that bad though
link has a life bar and a magic bar which can be increased by finding heart containers and magic jars
rupees are replaced by experience points
once you reach a required level you can upgrade either your life magic ability or strength
all three can be upgraded to level  in the eight or so towns you can learn new magic and sword skills
the game is also quite challenging to boot
enjoy the great palace
ganon makes a cameo each time link dies but he is not a boss in the gamein ending my review i have to say if you still have an nes you should buy this game
zelda fans should definitely give it a try
even if you dont like the other zelda games this may appeal to you
this game was ranked number  in egms top  games of all time list  years ago
just look beyond the surface and you might be surprised with what you findthis game is different from most of the other zelda game  no hearts for life just a meter various magic spells and a different item system than usually seen along with leveling up rpgstyle
overall its a enjoyable game
i really did enjoy this game and enjoyed the different format
of course having a shiny gold game cartridge is cool toozelda ii the adventure of link is the black sheep of the zelda franchise
one of the most controversial games of that era players sent a clear message to nintendo saying the sequel didnt live up to its predecessor
people still bought it but the general consensus was it was not as good as the original legend of zelda
the biggest controversy of this game was it was a d scroller instead of an overhead game like the original was
you navigated in an overhead view
then the battles and actual dungeons are in the side scrolling format
another big factor is this game is hard
very hard
its also the only zelda where you collect lives
if you run out of lives and continue instead of starting back at a particular dungeons beginning you begin at the very start of the game
when were talking about trying to beat the great palace this turns into a nightmare
there is also an unwieldy magic and leveling up system
the magic continued in the zelda series
the leveling did not
but because it was such a radical departure and not wholly successful zelda ii is viewed as a flawed if interesting gamethe zelda name does great damage here because people come in expecting overview
zelda ii tries to be innovative with an uneasy hybrid of sidescrolling and overworld
had it been released as just a fantasy game i think zelda ii would be something of a cult classic
as it stands people constantly judge this game on the zelda name alone instead of giving the game a chance
thats what really hurts zelda iizelda ii is a misunderstood game
the true question which cannot be answered is this what would the public think if this had been released first instead of the legend of zelda
who knows
no one does
people expected the wrong things from this game
people wanted traditional zelda action and this game didnt have that
its a hybrid of overhead and platform gaming
this was one of nintendos biggest missteps in its history
they had misread the audience
all this has forever damaged zelda ii
it will always be viewed from the perspective it is not as good as the other zelda gameswithout zelda ii the structure of this seminal series would be drastically different
in terms of lessons learned this is by far the most important game in the series
what if nintendo hadnt done this game
it is possible they might have tried the hybrid on snes version
nintendo learned from its mistake and never tried this again
in the zelda context that is a good thingzelda is a great series and without this under their belt nintendo might have put out a disappointing zelda game at a much more crucial time in the series evolution
its a great game in and of itself and had it been redesigned in terms of story and not making it zelda it would be considered a classic
but for zelda it doesnt go with the others and nintendo learned what the public wants in a zelda game
in terms of sticking to the formula this is the best thing that ever happened to zelda
if they had not released this game on the nes they might have tried the hybrid experiment on the snes game and instead of getting what is arguably the greatest game on the snes and in the zelda series we would get a game like this
then we wouldnt get a  game for the snes comparable to link to the past
if nintendo had not made this game they would have made this mistake remember its a mistake only in context of the series at a much worst timewhat about super maria brothers 
although zelda ii was viewed as a disappointment i think it had direct influence on smb   smb  is the game zelda ii could have been
smb  successfully combined a type of overview world but then you moved and played the stages
of course the world in zelda ii was much more expansive
the smb series was already a side scroller
it is hailed as one of the greatest nes games ever released
and yet earlier when they tried the same thing with zelda ii it was viewed as a disappointment because zelda was not a side scroller to begin with
nintendo took the hybrid idea into mario of which it was much more suited
mario was not an overview game to begin with
when they did make the hybrid they stuck with the basically formula of side scrolling but they had a little overview tooin this view zelda ii is out of balance
in the series context they should have made more of the action overview instead of all sidescrolling
some main parts of the game should be like that though but then there should be more oldschool zelda overview
as it stands in the series its out of balance
but without it we might not have the hybrid of the overviewside scrolling found in smb  and super mario world which both are great games
independently zelda ii stands proudafter all these years zelda ii still occupies that weird uncle status in the zelda family tree
i personally think that its a great game
it stands as a failure in the context of the series
had it been released without the zelda moniker i think history and players would have been much more receptive to this charming if entirely too difficult game
an interesting note about its title
this is the only zelda game it incorporate the numerical sequence into its official title
its also the only title in the series that does not have the legend of zelda in it
its just zelda ii the adventure of link
it sounds better than the legend of zelda the adventure of link
too long i guess for those daysthis was the ultimate in graphics and sound for the old nintendo
the programmers at nintendo utilized everything that they could get out of the  bit nintendo to create this game
although it has two different scenes action and overview it still maintains the classic zelda feel and look in a way
the game still has the same baxic zelda plot recover the triforce and save the world however it does it in a little bit different way
this is the first game in the series that contains magic spells and the like and it also introduces a little bit of an rpg feel that enslaves your attention as well
if you liked any of the other games in this series go ahead and buy this one and be prepared for something a little bit different but entertaining as well as challengingthe last bit zelda game to made zelda ii is referred to by most zelda fans i know as the hardest zelda game of all time
it is absolutely hard but it makes it that much more rewarding when you beat it
for the time it had decent graphics gameplay is simple if you use a walkthrough and the only side scrolling zelda game on a nintendo console that existsoverall its ok it isnt my favorite zelda but atleast you arent playing the zelda games on the cdizelda ii the adventures of link was a strong contrast to not only the legend of zelda but to all the sequels that were released in the upcoming  years game playwise format wise storyline wise and title wise
gannon was defeated in the previous game so hes nowhere to be seen unless its game over he returns after his minons and guardians feed him blood from a defeated link
a now late teenaged link must awaken princess zelda not the same princess zelda we all know but a decendant from hundreds of years ago from multicentury long slumber due to a wizards evil spell
in order to awaken zelda link must obtain the triforce of courage from the great palace but in order to unlock the palace he must place six crystals on the stone statues of six different palaces that are guarded by six of the lategannons guardians
some of gannons minor minions like stalfos moblins and octoroks return to give link more trouble but link faces some of the most annoying minor enemies in video game history like the multi life sucking dairas those annoying axe weildingthowing mutant alligators and ironknuckles a more stubborn upgrade from darknuts from the previous zelda game who comes in three different formsunlike other zelda titles link does not gain any upgrades on his armor sword and shield according to the instruction manual link still uses his magical sword and shield he upgraded to in the first zelda game but you gain expeirence points in attack strength life and magic a new feature in the zelda game that will revisted in a link to the past and a few other games
you do go into an attack mode as you run into a weak or strong enemy images floating around on the overview but you dont take turns attacking like most traditional role playing games so zelda ii was very innovative for its time
also another first is link can go to different hyrule towns to talk to select people for secrets to progress throughout the game or to learn new magic spells from a town wizard and offensive moves like the upward jump sword thrust and downward stab sword thrust from a local swordsman
due to all these added features mentioned this game acts more of like a role playing game with some minor modfifications
due to the success of the game castlevania ii simons quest emulated its game play to the fullest with little excitement and more mundane objectives
despite of its difficulty it was a fun game and a timeless classic of which many fans would dissmiss
many players complained due to the strong difficulty but thats why there existed a battery genrated saved feature so you can try again
the only disadvantage compared to the first game is that if its game over you go right back from the beginning literally
you dont start from the beginning of the palace unless you loose all your lives at the great palace
i also dont like the fact that you loose all of your expeirence points when you die
another minor complaint i have is that you are only confined by your sword for protection
it wouldve been nice if link had more variety of weapons like a boomerang or arrows because these offensive magic spells are too costly and the game is a bit stingy when it comes to refilling his magic meter full magic bottles are rare
other than that its a pretty good game yet it is probaly condered the last adventure for link due to the fact that all future zelda releases were taken place before the first zelda game
due to the storylines they were all consired prequels
castlevania did the same thing for the third nes installment
get your gold cartridge todayive played harder games than this one but its certainly no cakewalk in any way shape or form
it will definitely test your ability to inflict and dodge attacks
your life preserving strategies will get quite a workout too
youve got to be on the ball if you want to get through this game
even with maxed out stats you cant just plow through the game and take hits
heck even with max strength i wouldnt mess with those knifethrowing eagles
i just ran away from them and still somehow livedtheres no way you can beat this game without a walkthrough
no freaking way
way too many dangerous mazes and unobvious methods to get items
and you need all of the items to get through the game
you cant just pick and choose
you need to have the thunder spell to beat the boss and you need to have all the magic containers to get the spell seethere are really only two places where youd get stuck in this game
unfortunately one of the places is right at the beginning and the other is right at the end
at the beginning death mountain really is death mountain
i cant think of any way to get through it except by building up experience points like crazy and leveling up several times
those red alligator cavemen are monstrousand at the end well just walking along the path from the giant spider to the great palace is a heck of a challenge
dinosaur men throw barrages of rocks at you with the accuracy of snipers and oneeyed ghosts fly around randomly knocking you into lava and zapping away whatever lives you have
thank goodness if you actually make it to the great palace you can continue from therewhat really makes this game so different from the other zelda games is the jumps
in zelda  and  there arent really any jumps and if you miss a jump in zelda  its not really all that big of a deal
start where you left off and try again
but if you miss a jump in zelda  it costs you dearly
miss three of those and youre back at the beginning and believe me there are plenty of enemies around to help you miss those threethe odd thing though is that while the combat system and the required jumpdodging are what makes this game hard as heck they also are what make the game good
after some practice youll be impressed at what youre able to do
especially once you figure out how to get past those boomerang guys
the controls are practically flawless and my only complaint about them is links sword is too short for the upward thrust to be particularly effective
half the time id use that attack id take damage instead of give itquite primitive and definitely not as good as zelda  or  but it has some neat items and spells and its definitely a mans game
play it if you darethis game is a lot different from the original zelda
unlike the first one which was a top view adventure game this game shifts genres to an rpg with side scrolling combat and dungeons
for its time it was quite innovative and in some ways helped lay the foundation for future role playing games
however as a zelda game it just wasnt quite the game that a lot of fans were hoping for
its still a good game though and its a must have for any nes collection
and if youre hardcore youll get the gold cartridge versionmetroid is one of nintendos most popular franchises in the world today
from  it has appeared on almost every nintendo console released to the world and continues to evolve in terms of style art direction storyline and game play
while you can play the very first installment in this great series on the wii via the virtual console service most people who had the nes experienced it right hereyou take control of samus aran a female bounty hunter who travels throughout space to help maintain order between the planets
your mission wass to find and destroy mother brain an evil entity out to take over the world with her army of various aliens
back in  this game blew the doors of what a contemporary game should be
much like super mario bros set the standards for the once popular but now almost nonexistent platform game metroid set the standards for the adventure genre with its branching paths to different worlds various power suits and weapons
without a map to rely on you basically had to use your memory to find your way around the game
as you acquire these suits and weapons you become stronger and can access certain rooms and gain entry to certain areas
some of these are out in the open while others are concealed within the walls themselves so prepare to shoot your weapon everywhere
you eventually get to the last world where mother brain resides and fight it out until shes defeatedjust about everything about the game was and still is solid
the graphics while primitive compared to todays standards was top of the line as it was one of the launch games for the nintendo entertainment system
the sound effects and music captured the mood while youre playing
the controls were responsive and do exactly what you wanted
the story was pretty basic but you got over it quickly
the game was pretty long so there was a password system in place
whenever you die you were given a password that you can use later to continue where you left offthis game was perfect for those who played it in its original cartridge form
it had been rereleased later on with a different box cover then ported to the game boy advance and was included as an unlockable extra in the gamecube title metroid prime
go play this game if you want to relieve good memories or if you havent played it to begin with see how it all started
highly recommendedmetroid
the first metroid game and only one to appear on the nesimagine that it is the year  nintendo had finally managed to break through the market with super mario brothers the previous year and it looked to be an uphill climb in greatness for the system
the nes was becoming a household name and nintendo was sure to release many more classics which would define the system
metroid was one of theseof all the spectacular d platform adventure games to be released throughout the last  years or so such as the masterpieces super metroid castlevania symphony of the night rygar the gba castlevanias clash at demonhead and others all of them owe their design to the popular original metroid
while super mario brothers technically invented the d action platform genre and zelda was a milestone for adventure gaming up until metroid there were no games that merged the two genres together
to put it simply metroid showed us a large sidescrolling environment with no levels so to speak and combined it with items to collect and upgrade your character
for its day this was unheard ofnow i will go through the positives the negatives and the other negatives that i consider to be overblown about metroidthe positiveswell designed game layout
each area that you traverse is filled with lots of pathways secrets enemies and powerups for you to collect
one thing im very impressed with for the game back in its day is that its designed to prevent you from accessing certain areas without the aid of another abilityweapon
it also leaves you to think of ways to bypass some of these obstacles before you have these abilities
very clever nintendovery diverse array of weapons and abilities
for weapons youve got the long beam ice beam and wave beam which isnt a whole lot compared to other games but enough to suit you for this adventure
your abilities range from a hi jump to a morph ball to a protection suit and to a damaging screw jump attack
good enough for exploring the inner sanctums of planet zebesgood range of enemies
while they tend to repeat themselves in different areas of the game they do come in a variety of types
most of them are very challenging some are enough to make you pull your hair out and others can be avoided altogethergreat difficulty
this game is not an easy one and its steep uphill learning curve will be loved and hated by manythe negativesthe icebeam acquiring later on becomes flawed
what i mean is that every weapon you acquire replaces the one before it and because of that once you have your most powerful weapon the wave beam youll be in trouble when you reach the final lair
you need the icebeam again when approaching the end of the game
some may get frustrated with this aspectyou cant duck and shoot
it becomes really annoying early in the game when you dont have the bomb yet and you need to shoot those spikey creatures on the ground and you cantthe bosses are too easy
well mother brain is a bit tough because of all the stuff shooting at you but kraid and ridley are both a bit disappointing because all you have to do is come close to both of them and just let loose with the misslesnow ill address the negatives that people have about the game that i think are just hot airthe graphics are old
people often say this about the game but honestly can you expect anything more from a game that came out in 
it works for the time
though some of the environments can get a little bland in places its not that badno save game feature
again keep in mind that the year is  and the only game that wouldve already had this feature is zelda which may or may not have come out before this game
the passwords can be tedious but they save everythingvery little story
once again  see a common theme here
if you think about it the original zelda really didnt have any bigger of a story to it either but nobody complained there
same thing with super metroid
plus lets not forget how adding an indepth story into the gameplay killed the freedom and pacing of metroid fusionno map feature
while having a map would help the game isnt really all that intricate compared to super metroid so by not having the map the challenge factor bumps up and makes the game feel largeroverall metroid is a flawed masterpiece but a masterpiece nonetheless
if you feel like divulging in a historical yet essential classic of the nes then metroid should fill the gap nicely
this game already comes as a bonus to both metroid prime and zero mission so you might as well save money and play those
while zero mission may be a better rendition of the original game no one can deny the classic sensibilities of this nes shooter
highly recommendedother recommendationsany other sidescrolling metroid title fusion super metroid zero mission metroid any nes mega man gamecastlevania symphony of the night ps and any of its gba contemporaries circle harmony ariarygar nesclash at demonhead nesnote for those who dont know enter the passwordjustin bailey a great game for all hardcore gamers out there
most people would not reconize this game unless you are actually older than the age of lets say   a must have for anyone and everyoneabout the game first there is glass joe a wuss  von kaiser a former boxing instructor from germany piston honda an angry japanese boxer with a bad attitude don flaminco a  spaniard who loves a woman named carmenking hippo a human tub of lard who wears size xxxl shorts and cannot get up once he is knocked down its fun watching him pants himself though ha ha
 glass tiger an eastindian with magic powers and a jewel encrested into his turban bald bull an oddly familiarlooking fighter from turkey soda popinski a softdrink fanatic who loves soda and looks somewhat like bald bull except hes thinner and wears a speedo instead of shorts not attractive whatsoever mr sandman a classic slooking african american with mean uppercuts super macho man a selfabsorbed champion with a thornado punch and finally mr dream a kurtangle lookalike reject who can knock you down with just one uppercut
these r ur competitors and the game is simple to learn but not so easy to beat and once u have its just as hard the next time and the next u can never tire of it unless u just keep losing to mr dream then u just get deppressed and want to quit two words dont quit ur coach didnt have u run all that way for nothin ha ha
besides riding a bike aint easy for the manwhile it wasnt retrogamesus fault i did receive the game broken
it was difficult to get it work
i just wish that they would have provided better packaging rather than the standard orange envelope with bubble rapthis is a nice adventure game with a good story and fairly smooth game control as you play a boy who is searching for his missing uncle
it would be cool to see this game given a face lift for a more current game platformthis old nes game though linear offers a fun and challenging experience to any fans of the zelda type of adventure gameidk one person who doesnt like the nes and i remember at my uncles house a few years ago playing games on it ever since then i wanted it too bad the st time i did the zif socket was bent too much and it couldnt playso if you want one so bad on here bewarealot of people are saying it looks nice  plays great but how many times do you need to finick with it and move the cartridge around to make it workin the olden days pre of video games the only real enjoyable gaming experience was the grab a sack of quarters drive to the nearest arcade and often stand in line while the town nerd dominated donkey kong or pacman just waiting to get your crack at it only to die in mere seconds and see that roll of quarters dwindle faster than your gaming health meter
the nintendo entertainment system changed all of thatsure there were other homebased consoles floating around before the ness debut in  like the colecovision or the atari but they are now remembered more for their nostalgic value than for anything else
the nes was the first system to really get the concept of home gaming by providing at the time the very best of every gaming platform in terms of graphics sound and gameplaythis system produced a ton of games most of them admittedly crap in terms of percentages but some true gems are also in the mix
everyone has there favorites mine being super mario bros batman and punchout
unlike today the games of the nes were surprisingly simple in terms of design but also ultradifficult due to the same reason
instead of picking up a controller and sifting through a plethora of objectives most nes had one simple game strategy you either defeated the leveladversaryboss or you lost as simple or mindnumbingly complicated as thatabout the only knock i have on this system is how cheaply made it is
once your connector pins wear out good luck trying to get anything but a blinking green screen
luckily a sort of niche market on ebay has now developed to replace those troublesome pins and allow you to enjoy your nes for more years to comeoverall i consider this system to flatout just be the most pure fun of perhaps any system ever created
my video game lineage also includes the super nintendo nintendo  nintendo gamecube nintendo wii and xbox  but which system is still in my bedroom ready to rockandroll when i need it
yep you guessed itneswow
imagine your party is wandering around a dungeon at full health
the screen flashesyou anticipate battle and four green dragons appear
the green dragons attack before you get a chanceand your party is wiped outyeahi can just see that evil desinger making this game up with enemies that always seem to be much stronger than the party
with very difficult to obtain items that recover mp you need to carry healing items with you
but heres the kicker
you dont really have enough free slots to carry too manyi might be giving it too many stars just cause i love dragon warrior games this is a very frustrating game
im also an rpg veteran and so it gets a little easier if you know what youre doing but there are always situations in this game that you just cannot control see above green dragon examplethat actually happened 
yeti still love it cause its dragon warrior
if youre a graphics hog this aint for you
but if youre like me and you love dragon warrior pick it up
sometimesits actually funny to see your party get wiped out like that
sometimesdragon warrior i was one of my favorite nes games of alltime
i actually got it for free with nintendo power magazine
dragon warrior ii i had to warm up to at first
i wasnt totally keen on the idea of  characters and up to  enemies attacking you at once
but after many hours of gameplay i can say i do enjoy it very muchmuch like all of the other reviewers are saying the game is ridiculously difficult and frustrating
the cave to rhone is absurdly difficult and the path to hargons castle may be even harder
i cant tell you how many times i died just walking to hargons castle let alone actually making it past the  floors inside then beating hargon and malroth which is also ridiculously difficult
like most rpgs you can expect to put anywhere from  hours of work in on beating this game
like dragon warrior i leveling up is of utmost importance
the funny thing though in the later levels you can level up all you want and its still absurdly difficult
for example most walkthroughs suggest that you can beat the game at level  but i was still dying left and right at level the fact that  enemies can attack you at once prior to you even being able to do anything has caused me a lot of deaths and frustrations
and like dragon warrior i every time you die you lose half of your gold
gold doesnt matter anymore after you get equipped with the best equipment though
i finally beat the game with about  gold after having  at one time thats how many times i died on the road to hargons castle lolanyway this game is indeed a classic
and its also classically harddragon warrior  is a fun game that improves on many aspects of the first game
more party members more spells more enemies in encounters magic items i can go on
although dragon warrior  suffers from one critical issue for he entirety of the game
it is really hard and i mean throw your controller like a game of cod hard
enemies have cheap means of wiping you out with the most unfair attack i have ever seen in an rpg appearing towards the end
if you like a challenge this is for youdragon warrior  expanded on the original dragon warrior in several ways
the world map was four times larger you could enlist the services of two additional warriors the storyline was more complex and the enemies could attack you in larger and more dangerous groupshaving been released during the middle of the ness lifespan one should not expect to find dazzling graphics and masterful soundtracks here
however the graphics are generally easy enough to understand and serve their purpose even though they are tilebased and generally bland especially in the dungeonsmost of which look exactly alike
the music score is decent particularly the dungeon and castle music scores
the dungeon music can actually be a bit frightening especially since the enemies themselves are so deadlydragon warrior  is quite challenging as there are many places to explore
the game starts off quite linear at first but once you rescue the princess of moonbrooke and get the ship the game opens up considerably
theres also a reasonable variety of weapons armor and magic spells available to you to help you defeat the enemieshowever this game has several flaws  difficulty
even to this date dragon warrior  is one of the hardest rpgs in existence
in this game literally almost every battle has the potential to be your last one
the enemies will notoriously gang up on a weakened character
and the enemy groups are also often much stronger than you are
some enemies can drain half of your mp in one attack
other enemies are too strong to be located in some dungeons such as dragon flies in the tower with the water crest
also the dungeons are very very difficult
the cave to rhone is easily among the most dangerous dungeons in any rpg
there are invisible holes snaking passages obscured rooms and corridors that repeat themselves so you would be wise to make a detailed map of the more difficult areas
weak play control
the menu screen was simplified from its original version in dragon warrior  but it is still not so easy to navigate
buying selling and trading items is also quite difficult because you have to remember who has what beforehand
being able to view your item list more easily while you shop would have been nice
also the return spell is a bit of a pain to use since it warps you back to the last place you saved even though that might not be the village or castle you want to return to
not enough space
even though you have three characters who can carry up to eight items a piece you will often find yourself throwing items away or abandoning treasure chests because you simply dont have the room
in addition to the characters regular weapons and armor there are four keys that open four different types of doors
these keys cannot be thrown away so they must sit in your inventory taking valuable space even if you dont use them
you also might want to equip a dragons bane on every warrior to reduce the effectiveness of the enemies spells
so thats another space gone
this lack of space further contributes to the games difficulty because it means you have less room for restorative itemshaving said that this game is reasonably fun to play
the level curve is rather steep so this game should appeal to rpg veterans
the storyline is reasonably engaging and theres even a bit of humor in the dialogues you can have with the townspeople
unfortunately dragon warrior  has not aged well as it was really just a good game for its time
a lot of dws weaknesses have been fixed in later rpgs so the casual rpg player may wish to skip over this one
however you cant really go wrong with playing this game as its actually a pretty good game
just remember that its a bit on the difficult side so be preparedthis is actually a fairly addicting puzzle game
yoshi not the same as yoshis cookie was released back in the ness final days and didnt receive much notice
okay so it got some notice mostly just to compare it to tetris something that seems to happen to many puzzle gamescompared to other puzzle games i think yoshi stands up quite well
its a fine puzzle game
i cant think of anything else to say
okay ill tell you a storyi wanted this game really bad when it was first released
so i went to delaware with my mom and we bought the game at a store called woolworths which is now out of business in fact i think the whole company is out of business
before they went out of business they reduced the price for all their video games and in doing so made many gamers very happy
unfortunately this game was still pretty expensive which made the trip to delaware not as satisfying as we had hoped
but i still bought yoshi that day
sorry for boring youthis is the first yoshi game that ever came out
it is also for the gb to so it got more popular
i thought it would be different but i found out that it was like my tetris game
u match up things that fall and try to get a high score
the graphics r just like other nes games and the sound is enteresting
it is just like dr mario unstead of the pills comeing down its the monsters
it gets tireing after a while but it is funmickey mousecapade is a pretty fair d platformer
you have guide mickey and minnie through five levels to save their mystery friend
who is their mystery friend and why is he or she in danger
well it wouldnt be a mystery if i told you
p minnie follows behind mickey and mimics his every actionthe graphics are pretty nice for a nes game
theyre a little basic in terms of design but they come together to make a nice cartoonesque style which is quite fitting for a mickey mouse game
the music is also pretty fairthe gameplay is just normal d platformer stuff with a small twist
you have to account for what minnie is doing
there are jumps where minnie will cause you to lose a life if you dont account for where she will land
there are parts where mickey almost has to take damage to make sure minnie doesnt fall into a hole or drown in the ocean how sweet
p
its an interesting gameplay feature and one that wasnt explored to its full potential by this gamethe controls are pretty good albeit a little inconsistent
in three levels you cannot fall backwards in the air while jumping
however in the other two levels you have complete control over where mickey and minnie land
but fortunately the levels that you can do this in are the levels in which you need to do it the mostone thing i dont like about this game is that birds will sometimes appear to kidnap minnie
it happens when you think youve found a hidden item
you shoot the item until opens and it turns out to be a bird that could increase the current levels length by as much as an hour
since minnie has been kidnapped you cannot leave the level until you find her
so you have to find the area where a teleporation key will spawn that take you to where minnie is being held
this wouldnt be so bad if you just automatically got minnie after entering the that room but they decided to place four fake minnie mouses in there with her
whats worse is that the position of the real minnie appears to change each time you enter the roomanother thing thats kind of lame is the lack of a real coop mode
i cant say this for sure but it definitely seems like everything is already here for a coop mode except the option to let one player control minnie
you could actually play this game with two people but i wouldnt recommend it
the first and second players control both mickey and minnie at the same time which will invariably cause you to be dragged into a direction that you didnt want to gobut aside from those two little gripes i think that mickey mousecapades is a pretty good game
its hard in a couple of spots but its nonetheless pretty forgiving
there are actually levelselect codes in the manual which will allow players to come back to the levels theyre struggling with
but you dont get to see the ending cutscene unless you beat all five levels in succession so theres reason to play more even after beating all of the levels with level select codesthe game length is quite brief taking perhaps fortyfive minutes if youre pretty good at it
but even so its a worthwhile title to pick up if youre into d platformersfrom the ruins of rome to the futuristic setting of atlantis tomb raider takes the gamer through a variety of wonderful worlds
unlike its sequels it stays in the tombs and out of other settings
i believe that it is one of the best games ever made and it certainly is a classic
however i believe that its sequels though not for saturn in many aspects overshadow itthe scenery in tomb raider is better than most games although it is mostly cubed and flat
the game play and plot are wonderful and the graphics and sounds are acceptable
however the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles
lauras moves are limited and the weapons supply is less than perfect
the bonus levels present in the gold version are a lot of fun to play but they add little to the games ploti would recommend this game to any fan of the tomb raider series and to the average gamer
however i do feel that other versions have better qualities
tomb raider ii offers wonderful ai and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat
tomb raider iii combines the better aspects of the previous two and tomb raider the last revelation offers the best plot and character mobility
if you are looking to stay in the tombs or if you are not into puzzles stick with this game
however dont miss out on the other great qualities the tomb raider series offersthis game is unfortunately the victim of much criticism often seen as nothing more than a lazy genesis port
as i play it i come to the conclusion that had the game been released exclusively for the saturn it could have been much more well received than it was
true the main gameplay is all but the same but all the care that was put into creating the saturn version truly turned it into a good gamefirst of all the control is much better here both the d controller and the model  controller work very well with the game
the visuals are one of the most noticeable differences
the environments are vibrant and stunning and theres many little things that really impress me probably the best example is on the second zone rusty ruin the fog and rain effects on this level are brilliant and really create a mood that just isnt present on the genesis game
the music is another exceptional part of the game however as many people also love the genesis versions music it really comes down to personal preference herethe absolute best thing about this game however that makes this version superior is the special stages
they have the same objective as sonic  special stages however things are much improved everything is in full d and looks great
you also arent purely limited to moving left and right in a half pipe now there are springs platforms and awesome corkscrew tunnels
even when youve got all the chaos emeralds youll be finding yourself looking for tails and knuckles so you can play these levels some morethere is one downside to this version which forces me to give  stars instead of  the loading times
its especially maddening when you complete a special stage first you wait for it load a while then it displays a loading screen and then finally you get back to the gameif youre a saturn owner i highly recommend this one
yes its unfortunate we never got sonic xtreme but i for one am glad sega did at least give us this awesome and many times superior portthe gameplay is about the same between both versions but the graphics are a little better on saturn
the character models are much more sound parts of their bodies dont blink out of existence as often though the charaters do look a bit more bulky
intense game check it outhas content the ps version does not however it looks more mushy and pixelated i would only recommend this for sega saturn collectors as a mantle piece not a full blown game your gonna play but thats an opinion thingthe sega saturn is a strange console
could not perform d as well as the ps or n however it could display awesome d graphicsalbert odyssey is not a graphic powerhouse
is just a reworked game that was originally for the snes so it doesnt look groundbreakingthe battle system is slow it loads the music every time towndungeon graphics are good looking d art battles are also d art loads better than snesgenesisits one of the only translated rpgs on the saturn and  because of that i have enjoyed it a lot
do recommend it for sega saturn owners even if they also have the ps rpgs from that eraalbert odyssey is an oldschool rpg
one of the many games translated by the late working designs company
the game attempts at d with shadowlike leaves rustling from the overhanging trees above
the cloud drifting slowly and the water pulsating on the overhead worldmap
as an additional treat you get to fly a d airship
players have the option of making pike a good guy or a badguy depending on what responses they choose to make
however it does not alter or change the storylineprosd graphics implementedbackground glowflickeror move while in a battle depending where you arecontains a second story after you finish the first story of the game continuing from the firstadd some humor with pikes decisions in roleplay fashionfly an airship freely around the globeconshard bossbattlesthe very last maze in the game can get players lost quicklygame is easier if used by game shark cheatcodesshould have been another release of this gamethe ending left me wanting moreworking designs company is no longer in business who translated this and many other games for the segasaturnsave points are the only way to savewander too far into an area without the right levelbe prepared to face the consequencesthis game is more than decade old but its still good to play
too bad it doesnt seem to be ported to the psp or ds anytime soonthere is no real redeeming value to this game
it is simply a fun game to play
the graphics are good the physics are decent and there is a car to  suit just about anyone
if you like racing games with a psychotic twist  you will love this gamethis is without doubt the most violent and bloody driving game ever made
and i just love
theres nothing like driving through downtown on the  sidewalk and trying to hit as many pedestrians as possible if you think  this sounds sick then wait untill you played the game
it can not cuite be  decribedyou know the drill
insane millionhit combos
aerial raves that look impossible even for superheroes to pull off
the characters
and so on
this particular genre of fighting game has been done and done and done
capcom are the innovators of taking a game and riding its gravy train until  the biscuit wheels turn into soft vanillapastelooking mush
not that  theres anything wrong with that mind but almost any company can do it
the trick is doing it well
and capcom have with an amalgamation of every  single quotvsquot game theyve ever put together packaged into one  single dare i say it buttonmashing frenzy
name a character from a  quotvsquot game and heshe is in there from quotxmen children of  the atomquot on through
all together a whopping roster of  fighters  in all once theyre all unlocked split down the middle with  on  marvels side and  busting heads for capcom
and just to keep it  intriguing theyve included two brandnew characters on each side making  their first capcom appearance ruby heart and amingo for capcom cable and  marrow for marvel all of which are interesting to play and look at  specially when marrow rolls her bones
visually the game is stunning  of course with allnew d looking backgrounds and some new character  animations
many of the supermoves are brilliant and hurt just to watch
gameplay and control are deadon nice and tight as usual and even  beginners will get an occasional win from pure buttonpressing
  characters means that everyone will find a comfortable combo to use as  they each have  different assists as well
the only real flaw in this  one if one can be found is the music
the soundtracks just dont fit the  game at all and when you start listening youll know what i mean
but  all in all a very impressive show from capcom even if its been done  before
beat em up fans will love this one
id recommend it to any  fighter
the only reason it didnt get five stars is because this series  is getting just a little tired and it looks like its running out of ideas
still great fun though
get it tomorrowthis is basically street fighter on steroids
the game moves lightining quick and has tons of mindblowing combos
when was the last time you saw a game that even came close to hit combos
the only real drawback is the sound
lounge music in a fighting game
capcom what were you thinkingi own fiftythree dreamcast games and counting and eleven of them and counting are fighting games
i have endured the best of the best and the worst of the worst in this fabulous yet underrated genreif theres one thing i love more than anything else about fighting games and i am sure most others share my feelings it is the fact that they are filled to the brim with wonderful endearing loveable and unforgettable characters
this of course goes without saying i mean if there were no characters or say a mere handful of  or less the games would get boring fast and they would have nothing to offer the gaming world except a quick action fix
i may not be much of a comic book fan it is one of the many things i pride myself on not being but i still think it is great to see all my favorite marvel characters like war machine and the infamous shuma gorath going toetotoe with the likes of jill valentine and tron bonne
these are just the sorts of scenarios i am sure all of us have dreamed up in our little imaginations at one point or another in our lives
it is always amusing when a major corporation decides to indulge the fantasies of the masses is it noti think though that what really makes the game fun is the ability to buy characters as well as colors for characters and even new fighting fields
it makes you want to play over and over again until you have all fiftysix count them fiftysix fighters
hypercombos are also an incredible asset to the game
it really teaches one to think strategically about battles
after all if one characters combo involves tossing an opponent into the air such as omega red it is not wise to use it in conjunction with a groundbased combo such as tron bonne so you must choose your teams wisely
in my experience i have found the best combination to be iron man war machine and chun li since iron man and war machines combos deliver about fortysome hits each and chun lis combo is good against abyss
so why the  starsi miss the gallery from the playstation version of mvc
i appreciate capcoms desire to preserve the arcade spirit of their works but i think they are really cutting themselves off at the knees
a console version of an arcade game should be thought of as a dvd for a film
i think it was the director of quotidle handsquot who described dvds as being meant for quotthose who had more than a passing interest in the filmquot i am actually surprised capcom did not include an art gallery of some kind or if they did they really went out of their way to hide it
cannonspike and gunbird  both contain wonderful galleries of production art that really shows just how much effort capcom puts into its games not that we need galleries to see thatbut in any case gallery or no this stands as the epitome of fighting games
the best of the best
thank you capcomyes this game has  characters that you can completely controlunlike part  where there were special characters that can only help you but not fight for you
in this part  you can completely control everyonei am rating this game  stars rather than  because there is one very annoying factor in order to unlock the secret fighters you have to play the game for many many hours in order to earn points
you use the points as money to unlock the secret fighterseven though this is the direct sequel to the rare  classic banjokazooie and features much of the same gameplay and similar characters i think that it just feels like a different game
it seems almost as different from banjokazooie as donkey kong  or conkers bad fur day does
the game just emanates a completely different atmosphere
i guess its a combination of very different music different moves and new characters
kudos to rareware on that
people usually like a game that play the same as another game but feels different
i mean its a different game isnt it
who likes a game that plays and feels the sameah well
banjo and kazooies final n adventure takes them to the world beyond the valley in which they live in
its a large world larger than the cavern that gruntilda calls her lair
the levels really arent that much larger than the mammoth world featured in banjokazooie or even donkey kong  but its amazing how rare has fresh ideas even after creating over a dozen massive levels for the two aforementioned games
ah well
the difficulty level of banjotooie seems to be tougher
its sometimes harder to figure out what the heck to do for certain jiggies and there are so much more stuff to find this time around
not only are there jiggies but there are also jinjos cheato pages honeycombs and everybodys favorite notes
the massive amount of extra moves can also get overwhelming
boss fights which were mia in banjokazooie are now here and in every stage
the extra modes of play are a nice change to the typical banjokazooie formula
i havent had a chance to play as kazooie without banjo but i did get to control mumbo
it wasnt really as i had expected but fun nonetheless
the stperson shooter mode was obviously a chance to cash in on the successes of goldeneye and perfect dark but they were actually well done
the stperson shooter level in mayahem temple freaked me out but hey
its all about atmosphererare has always been good at having distinct tastes to their games
i suppose what helps them are their awesome musical staff
although the music in blast corps got on the nerves of some people it definitely added to the feel for it
the somewhatlikevariations of the bond theme in goldeneye gave that game a unique feel
so on and so forth
banjotooie had good music that adds to its different mood but it just didnt feel as excellent as rares fantastic score for banjokazooie
maybe thats a good thing
having the gobis desert tune stuck in your head for hours is not exactly a pleasant experience
as far as sound effects go banjos deep utterance for every jump is just not right
argh
i cant stand it
oh well
its a good game nonethelessim going to give four stars instead of fivei just didnt find the same enjoyment with this game as i did with the original banjo gamebigger isnt always betteras others have pointed out every time i stepped foot in a new world i felt so overwhelmed by the sheer size of it that i almost didnt even want to playby the end of the game i was literally wiped outsome jiggies took forever and a day to find because they were spaced out so farok the goodexcellent graphics and pretty much everything else from the first game is backthe badthis game along with donkey kong  took the whole collect a thon thing a little too fareven with a game guide i had a hard time finding everything youre supposed toit took the enjoyment from the first game and bogged this one with so many fetch quests that by the end of the game i was playing out of what felt like obligation instead of enjoymentand i still never found a way to get banjo kazooie to work with tooie as far as the secrets from the first game are concernedlamedont get me wrongyears later the game is still fun but to play it from start to finish is really more of a labor of love than anythingif you think you can sit down for a few minutes and crank out a level or two forget itsadly this was the last banjo game for nintendo as rare took the leap to microsoftnot a huge deal as rare was once nintendos golden child but then quickly dissolved into nothingnessfinal thoughtsbig bad time consuminga great game but be expected to invest a lot of time if you want to beat itrecommendedthere is no doubt that banjotooie the anticipated sequel to banjokazooie is a great game
but instead of babbling about the strengths of the game you can read other reviews for that id like to explain why in my opinion this didnt live up to the original
for one gruntys rhymes are gone
unforgivable
secondly the overworld which had multiple secrets and nooks and crannys in the original is now a just limited to level entrances and exits although being stunningly beutiful at the same time
and if youre expecting a final boss as brilliant as the last games you will cry right there in front of your tv set in agony
but the unforgivable comes in the form of there being only  jiggies in the game as opposed to bks 
the ending isnt half as good either
dont lose hope though because rumors have been circulating the net about a bkbt secret connection that may unlock more goodies in tooie
but until that secret is revealed i am forced to give this game four stars
by all means buy this game
just dont expect something as exceptional as banjokazooieclassic platforming on the n
if you want more banjo then listen to some blue grass but this may satisfy you in the mean timeits about time strider came back and im glad to see capcom put some effort into this one
the control is deadon and the graphics are great
if you wanna be cheap and use as many continues as you can youll beat it in half an hour
if you limit your continues however youll find that this game is much harder to master
buy itthe game loads slower than useal and most of the fighters use weapans witch if you know street fighter well it takes away the good name from itstreet fighter ex  is a product of arika and capcom
the game overall is pretty good and truly lives up to the street fighter name
doing special and super combo moves is much easier and has no button mashing involved
the graphics are good considering it is a playstation game
the game features a roster of a bit over  characters with some unlockable characters and also extras
i have had this game for a very long time and enjoyed it
i even picked up a copy of ex for other characters
overall if you are a street fighter fan this is a must get otherwise you can always try it b u buy it at the rental placeinnovative
that is the single thing i can say but i wont
lom is one of squaresofts more original games which are usually bad that si somewhat good
you are a hero that goes around completing events while trying to awaken the mana tree
the game the most nonlinear game i have ever seen on the playstation
that gives it its strong points
some people like my brother dont have the time to sit and play though a rpg like final fantasy pick one
he simply has no time
he plays a little and then cant pick up the controller for several months
soon he ends up forgeting the storyline
not with this game
its design allows the player to start and event and finish it and then choose another and finish that
usually you do them one at a time
very rarely does more than one event occur at the same time unless the player causes that to happen
the battles are realtime much like parasite eve   the charge bar has been removed allowing you to whack the enemies to your hearts content without worrying about doing only  damage
the music is very nice as well though it could have been better
the graphics are beautiul and will make you feel like you are playing a painting
the only problem i had started when i had no clue how to start up another event and i couldnt win yet
like some rpgs the second you get the sword of mana artifact you can win the game because you will be strong enough
others force you to do other things to get to the point where you can get to the final place and win
my advice if you like an original game go ahead and get it
if you dont but want to try rent it
this game is a good idea and executing very wellthe orginalquotsecret of manaquot was a two player action rpg
the only similarity between them is the treeon the cover  legend is a romp and roll with a sureal pastelle envirnoment
the map suddenly opens as you progress and progression is obtained through tasks or side quests
not doubt this is not xenogears where you must follow and coherce with every character for over  hrs in a large map
one world reminds me of grandia okay more like squares saga fronteir i played this game back on snes
the game on playstation is just awesome
i read a lot about music selection in rpgs but i dont really care about the music
the graphics are pretty cool
the characters are pretty cool
the only thing i didnt like about this game is at first i didnt understand how to play but after i figured it out it was funi got this game as a birthday present and i was extremely happy that i did
it has a lot of depth to it
starting from character creation you first pick either boy or girl second you choose one of i think its   weapons to start with and then choose the area of the world you want to live in
then you place your house somewhere in that area
already things are interesting
the game world is shaped by the players imagination as you recieve artifacts containing dungeons roads towns towers forests etc
once the artifact is used that place appears
at the characters home there is a garden that grows fruits and vegitables to feed the monsters at your monster ranch where you raise monsters to come with you and help you fight
lastly there are workshops that allow you to create weaponsarmor and musical instruments which give you magical powers
its actually a lot of fun
game play and control are good too
the reason its only  stars is that it has very little to do with the original secret of mana
which is sort of a let down other than that a great gamethis game is awsome
you could give it to your technologyhating wife for an aniversary present and you would be having about  kids
thats how awesome it is
in fact i am listening to the soundtrack right now so lets start there
the music is pure genious
the bouckground is a masterpeice considering that is hand drawn
the difficulty can vary depending on what you set it on
finally the topic everybody argues about
the fun factor
ahem 
a perfect 
s buy this and you will not regret a single moment
whether you are making your own weapons or armour or creating yur own golem machine to fight with you heck while i am at it  raising a monster to fight with you in battle as you use your self made instrument which inflicts damage to enemies by casting a spell there  will always be somebody whishing that you lost that auction on ebay and that they won the game
thank youdont expect secret of mana when you buy this game actually dont expect any challenge when you buy this game
this game is just plain fun and to make it more fun is the fact that it is two player
the graphics are all hand drawn which is just beatiful
and then theres the fact that there is absoulotly no plot
there are many many different plots which range from killing dragons to finding a monkey named diddle from hell
you even get to costomize your own world
this game is fun but a little shortsquaresoft was having quite a time in the year   they released a lot of good fun and classics games
among them were vagrant story chrono cross final fantasy ix and threads of fate to name a few
legend of mana came around and was a well liked game by quite a few who were quite taken with secret of mana years prior
that being said legend of mana was a great game that holds up well today that is mostly troubled by strange problems more so than big onestheres no overall plot to legend of mana
in fact the game in and of itself has a storybook like feel
youll choose a character boy or girl and give him or her a weapon it doesnt matter which
after that youll pick a spot in the world to occupy and start building
the system at work here is a pretty complex but can be quite nice at times
you build on a world map by taking artifacts and placing them
once you do a new area on the map will spring up for you to venture to
legend of mana is very much a dungeon crawler by every respect
by going to new locations or speaking to people in towns youve built from your artifacts youll be able to start missions which are usually stories in and of themselves
each has a beginning and end
usually ending with you defeating a boss and often collecting an artifact
there are a lot of missions
some are as simple as finding the right person and speaking to them
others are more complex having you crawling through dungeons to defeat bosses and to return certain items to other characters
theyre varied in structure
you might get an action heavy story that has you in several battles only to later help someone by simply running about a town and talking to various citizens
there might not be a single battle in this instance
it gives a nice varied pace to legend of manayoull also help out some who may later open up various secrets
for instance after completing one mission i unlocked a workshop that allowed me to create and temper weapons
and to get the best of the best requires a lot of work and grinding to dojust because legend of mana doesnt have an overall plot doesnt mean there arent plot threads within it
many missions you undergo lead to other missions to continue a particular narrative at work
it may seem like niccolo is nothing special from his first mission but stick with him and it becomes quite an interesting story arc
there are many minor characters who have big involved stories
there are three different story arcs in particular that you can view that will get you to the endgame itself
and they are by far the three most involving heartbreaking and well told stories of the lot
the first involves a mysterious girl named pearl and her partner elazul from the dying race of jumi
a jewel thief named sandra steals their jewel which kills them
your role in this quest is to stop her and save the jumi race from dying out entirely
the second involves two dragoons larc and sierra and a lord named drakonis who must be stopped from taking over the world
the last story arc involves escad matilda irwin and deana as their friendshps cripple and war between humans and faeries seems inevitableall three of those arcs are extremely good stories
that being said its a shame that none of these subplots and stories ever come together to form a main storyline
for quite some time the main objective of the game is fairly unclear
and without a walkthrough of some sort youll find it particularly hard to get to the endgame as the path to get there isnt exactly straightforward
and the lack of an overall plot means there are very few hints on how to get there or even what exactly youre searching for to get there
at the very least most of the stories are fairly good in and of themselvesgameplay wise legend of mana is a lot more straightforward than most games
for gamers who were quite impressed with secret of manas action oriented battle system theyll be surprised to know the approach here is a lot different
legend of mana plays more like a beat em up at times than an actual rpg
by that i mean that before battle your characters run around quite normally
when enemies are encountered youll enter battle mode and pull out your weapons
youll have to beat up the baddies before you can press on
the screen will also no longer scroll at that time
your hp is shown in percentages as opposed to a numerical value as in other rpgs
in battle mode youll be able to use abilities and techniques
this may in fact be the most overlooked and important part of legend of mana
the abilities you equip start as things like only being able to jump and crouch but later you get more of them
and these play a role in helping you learn battle techniques
as you battle and deal damage a gauge under you hp gauge fills up
when full you can initiate special attacks
the only way to learn these special techniques however is if you are willing to mix and match your abilities
likewise special techniques are also based on weapons
so a sword will learn a whole different set of special techniques than a dagger
this gives a lot of variety to legend of manas battle systemyoull sometimes run around on your own but on occasion youll be joined by a partner that you can recruit
most partners only stick around for a brief amount of time or until theyre dismissed
its possible to run around all of legend of mana will two partners at all times
its a good thing too because legend of mana supports multiplayer
while you control the main hero your ally will control the other
and if you both have legend of mana data on your memory cards you can import your partners character or jump into his game with yoursthe battles themselves are fine but legend of mana can certainly be repetitive to play after a while
when getting into battles with your enemies there is no way to simply skip them should you be tired of battling
you cant run from battle
they must always be fought til the end
in some instances this will be extremely annoying
especially because enemies respond the moment you leave the area and return
in some dungeons this can make battling feel like a chore
in others it can just feel downright exhausting
at least you always start a battle at full hp
likewise your hp will also regenerate if youre not taking too much damage in battle or you use the crouch ability
that being said legend of mana is not a difficult game at all
if you fall in battle you can start it over right on the spot
if something should go wrong in a battle its fairly easy to recover
you can also get a lot of experience in some areas by constantly running in and out of the same roomson the other hand your ai controlled allies are not smart at all
at least you dont have to babysit them
for two reasons
the first is that if they die in battle after a little while theyll be automatically revived
the second is that most encounters wont last too long for them to be a problem anyway
its impossible for them to deplete their reserves of mp
they also have special attacks of their own
everything they do is independent of you but you neednt restore them to full power ever
they can be fairly good at soaking up damage at least but for the most part theyre not too useful in battlelegend of mana isnt a hard game to get through
depending on how many quest you can do it can be very short around five or six hours or really long but youre not likely to spend much more than  hours
and thats upon choosing do to every quest
there are some things to extend the time but not much
theres a lot of tempering with your weapons and armor but given the nature of how legend of mana is there isnt really such a thing as a sidequest and there arent really any minigames to play through
in the way of extra content legend of mana only offers a new game where youll carry over all your equipment and youll have a chance to increase the difficulty level of the game
aside from that legend of mana isnt a game thats filled with an untold number of secrets or sidequests
there is already a lot in the way of quests as it is
and since not all of them need to be done to complete the game everything within it can be tackled at your leisuregraphically legend of mana may be the best example of what it means for a game to be aesthetically pleasing
a lot of gamers dont seem to realize that graphics are really nothing more than pixels
the aesthetics is what gives the game the visual characteristics you associate with it
legend of mana is not a graphically powerful game but it sure does have a lot of great aesthetic quality
there are few playstation games that have aged as well as legend of mana
the game looks absolutely gorgeous in every way
there are no blocky pixels
everything in it is handrawn and hand crafted with sprites and artistic backgrounds
this makes legend of mana look better than many of its contemporaries of the day
it might not be as powerful as chrono cross final fantasy ix or vagrant story but it most certainly is a lot easier on the eyes fourteen years later than those particular games
the art style is simply an assault on the senses
to put it one way many playstation games had an artists rendition of a character that you saw the way they were supposed to look but given the power of the playstation couldnt exactly make them look like that
since legend of mana utilizes sprites as opposed to polygons every character actually does look like the artist rendition
and this makes the game look extremely good
the artstyle doesnt just stop with character sprites
the scenery spells special techniques and special movies are all illustrated this way
legend of mana is simply gorgeous
complimenting the fantastic art style is a near perfect soundtrack
from a presentation standpoint its hard to find fault with legend of manaall that being said legend of mana is a good game
the gripes i have with it arent big theyre just strange
its hard to criticize the overall plot when the game doesnt present one to us to begin with
likewise with battling theres nothing inherently wrong with the battle system it just happens to get more repetitive than other games
overall legend of mana is a good game but it might not necessarily be the greatest to come out of the mana franchisethis is really a good addon if you have already played rouge spear many times
even if it adds some missions i love the subway station one 
and new weapons it is still the same game as rouge
so if you have still to  finish the missions in the basic game or you simply enjoy playing online  then stick with the basic and dont bother buying this titlethe major  shorfall is in the number  of missions  completely new plus  missions  from the classic rainbow six
the point is that i believe an add on should  give you more in order to be a very good deal
anyway the pack also  includes a few new maps that you can use either in multiplayer or in solo  games while playing in the quotlone wolfquot quotterr
huntquot  etc mode
these are good but again they dont really add a lot to the  gaming experiencethe new weapons that are added are nice to fire but  not really useful in the scenarios themselves
you can have much more from  this point of view by downloading the nato mods from the netmy  suggestion
if you are a r hard core fan like i am and you cant wait  for new missions and maps then buy it instantly
if you are not really  that interested in the game than keep playing rouge spear for a little  more and then if the interest in this title arises again then go ahead  and buy itthis is the sequel to the blockbuster adventurepuzzle game th guest
youre back in the mansion trying to find your friend
not only are there more fiendish puzzles to solve but there are also riddles to unravel as  well
both will either open up more of the house or provide further video  clips pushing the story forward
i loved the fact that i could take a  break from the sometimes insanely hard puzzles and work on the riddles  and still progress in the gamethis is a mature gameno swearing  but lots of disturbing imagery and some risque momentsnothing beyond  pg though
its very similar in style to the first game with some  improvements the sound isnt so faint for starters and the story is  fantastic
and stauf is as eviland slyas everi really liked this game it had just the right mixture of subtle creepiness and intrigue to keep me interested
as its an older game the graphics might not look impressive by todays standards but the store more  than makes up for itthe premise is that stauf a former criminal turned  rich toymaker has invited people to his mansion and offered whomever can  solve his puzzles whatever they desire
its hinted to you that none of  the guests were ever seen from again so not only do you have the mystery of  the mansion itself to solve but you also have the mystery of finding out  what happened to everybody to figure out as wellthe interface is clean  and easy to use
you wander around in a very mystlike first person  perspective and your cursor changes whenever you wave it over something you  can look closer at a movie you can watch or a puzzle to solve its  nice to have this little detail instead of clicking madly on the screen  trying to find the magic pixel that will take you further into the  gamethe music by the fat man is also very well done in fact you can  buy the soundtrack right here on amazon
and adds a lot to the game
overall it has just the right mixture of intrigue as you watch stauf set  the guests against each other and play his little psychological games and  puzzles as you progress your way deeper and deeper into the mansionfor  the price you get a lot
and its worth iteven after buying and playing with the new simcity i must say that unlimited is the best one
i have had every issue since the first one and it is the only computer game i play
as my review of sc states the graphics are not as good as in this version
and it is much less difficult to play than sci love the new disasters in this addon and some of the buildings are quite nice to look at
but this addon is basically just some cosmetic changes for the game
yes there are new scenarios to but nothing that  much different than ones that ive already played
this got boring after a  few hours mind you i overplayed simcity  to begin with a decent game if you are into the simulation games
i bought this a few months ago and have been playing it off and on ever since
i recommend not to play this game endlessly it takes a long time real to build a decent and thriving city
when i first started building cities i would get impeached after about  years
this game like other simulation games takes experience before you become successfuli especially liked the options of choosing real city terrains such as paris or berlin
this is a great feature if you would like to see how paris would look if you built it
what if paris had the taj mahal instead of the eiffle toweryou can also have aliens attack the city which is neat to watch
i recommend turning off the disasters when you first get your city running
limited budget and income makes repairing buildings and roads very hard
i have found that after running a city for about  yearssim time there is enough surplus in the budget to experiment with the disastersit is a little hard to have the same poplutaion as the surrounding simcities
my cities have always had a fraction of the population in comparison to my simcity neighborsand it seems that you cant keep the sims happy
if you have taxes too high they complain so you have to lower them
eventually i had to lower them down to about and they still complained that they are being taxed to high
so you have to lower it to  however you no longer have the population as a source of income
this aspect of the game is a little annoying
if you play this game sparadically which i recommend it is not as annoying as if you decide to play it of several hours many days in a rowas far as building farms and seaports i had a hard time having these features develop in my cities
but after much determination and a quick glance at the official website i have been successful
the only problem i have with the farms is keeping them when my city started to expand
what i mean is after awhile farms started to turn into factories
once this happens there is no turning back to farmlandheres a tip  try to keep the zones you intend to have farms develop as far away from the residential commerical and industrial centers as possibleanother zoning problem that i have encountered is with the airport zoning
i can get it to develop but not to how i want it to look
this type of zoning is expensive so demolising existing buildings that spring up randomly and rezoningdezoning becomes a nuisanceoverall this is a decent game and a good value
i am looking forward to the next simcity and hope that they improved on what is already a good gamethis is a game where there is not much action usually simulation type games are slow paced and this is one of them
it took me many weeks of periodical playing to build a halfway decent city
although when i first got the game i played many hours on end thinking i was going to master this game in a day
no such luckif you are looking for quick results and action this is not the game for you
but if you like taking your time and experimenting i definitely recommend this gamesimcity  unlimited is one of the few games that i really love to play over and over again
it enables the player to build the city of their dreams utilizing famous reallife city landmarks and buildings
you may use these buildings and incorporate them into your dream city
the game can also be upgraded from the maxis downloads page where players can download new building landmarks download player custom built buildings or to simply create their own stylish building to add into their cities
the graphics are great and the buildings are each detailed
you can now zoom in  times as close than before with simcity  cars and people are easily noticeable at such zoom magnifications
the only problems i experienced when playing this game was that even with a killer computer system and over  gig of memory the gameplay seems to lag when you scroll through a large city that you built
i believe this may be true in all maxis games that involves building sims or large populations such as cities and theme parks
nonetheless this game is still considered a favorite among other games i have in my library of gamesgameplay  graphics  sound  value  obviously simcity  is a superb game
nothing really comes close to it except simcity  which beats it
the original simcity  is good enough to stand on its ownsimcity  unlimited doesnt really offer features that attract most gamers however
while the unlimited aspect of creating your own scenarios seems nice dont think that you can just run the application and simply make a scenario
you gotta read the instruction manual for sure
all of it
sure more disasters can be nice but i am the kind of player who turns them off
that is i like to actually build cities not tear them down
if i am unsatisfied i delete them and start over
but hey if you like disasters you got four  more with the unlimited versionalso dont think the gameplay is changing one bit  it isnt
but if you think that new asian and european artwork is cool enough to justify a brand new game separate from the original well you will need more money my friend
i personally do not see a justification for adding some content and adding the word unlimited to the title then selling it for top dollar
this might have been the rare time where i would actually approve of an expension pack version
though i would have passed on it with todays knowledge
and if you were expecting new buildings you get one its a halloween haunted house
tell me where are you going to put that monstrosity
it looks more like an underdeveloped zone in your city and the sound effects are worthless for citybuilding purposesto conclude i recommend that you do not purchase simcity  unlimited if you already own the original simcity   since money in your pocket is limited stick with the original classic  a title worth every penny
if you dont own the original however the unlimited version is a fine substitutionfor those who dont have simcity  already simcity  unlimited is the best way to get into the game
the game is nearly identical to the smash hit of   all the same playability the same city building  challenges etcfor those who already own simcity  there are a  number of new options that could make it worthwhile to upgrade
in fact  when you install unlimited on a computer that already has the original   you get the option to transfer over files like all your old cities
it then even does the uninstall of the old product for you very nice
granted unlimited does chew up a bit more disk space so you should make  sure you have room to spare for the new versionid also suggest you try  to get in while the rebate is going on
it will get you back  on the  price of unlimited
then you wont feel so bad spending money on a game  you basically already have
then do what i did give your old copy of  simcity  to a family member to get them hooked on the game
ltgringtkept me busy for atleast  minutes maybe basicly the same thing as simcity i have to say that simcity unlimited is a true work of art
i went to buy this game and its expensive but its worth every penny
as soon as i got home i tore open the box and launched it in my brand new pentium  processor with cable modem
i was amazed at the graphics used in this game as soon as i saw the cutscene but even more amazed when i saw the graphics while playing the game
you start out with nothing and must build an entire empire full with power water transportation tourist attractions and much more
this game is very fun once you build a small town and continue to make it into a huge city
i never built a big city because i couldnt figure out how to set the taxes right i thought that was the most challenging part of the game
my land values were very high and i still got a little under the city budget
anyway simcity unlimited leaves its previous ancestors in dust because of its strong graphical engine hidden suprises building architect tool where you can create your own buildings from scratch internet option to share your creations with other mayors and most important of all the extordinary gameplay
so why did i give this four stars
because its slow once you get into a huge city
it took me about two minutes to move just one stroke of a key to view the city
even on cable it runs slow
well i got the hang of the speed but after a while this game gets kind of boring so i uninstalled it and sold it for the same price i bought it for but i must say
if you love the previous sim games more than i do then i say buy this because if you dont then youll regret itit is a great game scku but a few minor flaws hinder it anyway i finally found out how to build a prosperous city without for shame cheat codes
but now i dont want to expand anymore or i just dont know where to go with my citythis is technically an old game but all things considered its well worth what youd pay nowbasically the game puts you through  worlds plus
have to say that like a lot of old games im compulsive ive found it both satisfying and madding
im a graphics freak and if theyre going to bother with music im a music freak as well
all things considered they do pretty well in both categories
for myself there were definitely parts i could have done without plus if youre into endings worth all the brain stress you agreed to be put through by playing this game its a let down
if youre into getting trhough and finishing a game this shouldnt be a problemi recently had a hardwaresoftware problem in that i recently upgraded to a  mg video card
game freaked out because of the upgrade
im not convinced that the dumb down needs to be down but i was still able to play it down down done for nowanyway the game makers get high marks for inventiveness and fact game worked upgrade aside
i have my favorite parts and game did kind of run out of ideas in the climax but id sure recommend it if you are as desparate as i am for adventure games that satisfy a need for fun and things that work if you do it right
do wish that adventure game makers did consider more along this line
id sure buy itonly reason i havent given more stars is the uneveness of the plot and the pretty hockey ending
get real guys and ill rate what you do next higherstill id recommend it highly  all things considered and whats out there that i havent bought and reviewed alreadyi loved the music in this game
as far as the game play goes you actually learn a little cultural history while at the same time having fun
the beaurocratic minitar is rather amusing in his lackluster attitude towards visitors to hell
however i found the constant motion of some of the charactors while speaking to be anoyingive only begun this game but wanted to share a tip for anyone else who is having trouble running this in xp
it seems the game cannot handle large memories thus the disk full message even though you have over g left
this worked for meload beyond atlantis onto a thumb drive and run it in compatability mode 
i used a g and it works fine
so far g is more than adequateas for the game i think this one will be great fun
lovely graphics and atmosphere are what i look for first and beyond atlantis seems to have just that
i love the tinkling bells in the background
if it turns out disappointing ill revise my review
but i wanted to post this tip and save someone else  days of frustration
hope this helpsnow if i can only get myst and riven to run  i thoroughly enjoyed beyond atlantis
it was one of those games that had me eager to get back to it night after night
the puzzles were challenging and inventive requiring you to use multiple levels of thought
i really liked how the nature of the puzzles changed with each area you visited
for example many of the mayan puzzles were mathbased where the celtic puzzles were more intuitivethe scenery was beautiful
and the dialog was exceptional
this is the only game ive run across with a celtic setting that has not completely mangled gaelic words and names
i also liked that you were given the option to replay all the dialog so that you could pick up on things you might have missed the first time aroundthis game used mythology especially well particularly in the mayan and celtic settings
being something of a student of celtic myth i was really excited to see how well some of the characters and concepts were integrated herebeyond atlantis ran very smoothly
ive had a problem with some of dreamcatchers other games crashing for no apparent reason but that im happy to say was not an issue with this onethe character animations were not to the level i would have expected however
characters often looked like bad claymation and range of movement was limited
also the music though lovely consisted of short tapeloops that got a little crazymaking with repetition particularly when you had to visit certain areas over and over to solve the puzzlesthough most of the puzzles were of the thinking variety there were a few that just required you to quotmusclequot through either by pixelhunting or by repeating an action or series of actions until you got it right
i found the quotcharging the crystalquot puzzle particularly annoying as well as confusing
it was hard even to know where to begin with that one without resorting to a hint pagestill for humour integrated story beautiful settings and puzzles that will really keep you working at them for days beyond atlantis is hard to beatwas this game very challenging
no
but it was a blast to play
the puzzles were very quotrealquot and by real i mean that you would find an item and you pretty much knew what you were going to do with it
the puzzle got a little harder once you got to the castle but this game only took me about  or  hours to beat
but the graphics and the cut scene were excellent
the music set the tone for every area you went to
it was very eerie and creepy
i would rate this game closer to   stars because it just wasnt a serious challenge but for the price it was well worth iti really enjoy a good adventure game
this one has some of the best graphics i have ever seen to datethe storyline and gameplay are very good
some of the puzzles are easy but the graphics make up for that flawi am eagerly awaiting a sequelthis is the game that will introduce you to dracula  it will get you prepared for what is to come
the graphics are fantastic the story line too
the puzzles are logical
i really enjoyed this game
scared me a bit
nohonestly scared me a bunch
made me buy the second one
adventure gamers get this one and dracula  no regretsmina has returned to transylvania
you as jonathan harker must follow her and save her from dracula
explore a dark forest find your way through a mine and a castle full of traps and unknown chambers
puzzles and riddles will slow you down kind of as you work your way closer to saving your wife and defeating the prince of darknesswell not really
some of the puzzles are very easy while others seem very hard
but if you examine everything and try your best you should be able to save your wife
no time limites and no way to dieno ending either
better go get the next gamedracula resurrection is an uncomplicated fun game easily completed in a single evening
it isnt very challenging but it was a nice break for me after lugging around all those heavy documents in dracula the path of the dragon
navigationintuitive firstperson pointandclick interface with an easily visible cursor
storystory was fine although not scary at all
if you are looking for scary look somewhere else
graphicsgraphics are firstrate especially since this game is almost eleven years old at the time of this review
though i think the developers went a little crazy with the nonplaying characters  the wrinkles bloodshot eyes rotten teeth and rosacea were almost too much to bear
dialogfour stars just because if there has to be dialog at all this is how much you should have  not that much
i think the voice acting was acceptable but you might not notice as you are treated to largerthanlife hairy moles and burst capillaries
soundlow marks for sound because there was no music except in cutscenes and the ambient sounds got a bit repetitive after a while
my sound card got stuck after i opened a creaky door and it kept on creaking until i backed out to the menu
speaking of whichperformancethat one sound loop was the only problem i had and i didnt mark off for it because all it did was wake up my dogs  it didnt crash and make me have to doover
other reviewers from ten years ago said they experienced slow performance but this game worked fine on a  vintage xp laptop
inventory controlmiddling marks for inventory management only because while you can rightclick to open your inventory you cannot rightclick to close it
i would have marked more off for that but i gave extra credit since there were no documents to haul
puzzlesthe puzzles were really too easy and should probably only get three stars but they were just perfect for my current frame of mind
most were of the find an object and carry it around until you see a place where it will fit variety but they suited me just fine
this is undoubtedly a transitory bias as you may remember i am still recovering from the read this illustrated  page book with a magnifying glass type puzzle that was so prevalent in path of the dragoni do recommend this game in spite of its brevity
if you are thinking about a dracula binge this dracula path of the dragon disk came with a surprise extra disk inside containing both dracula  and   an incredible value for only  at the time i purchased itmicroids dracula iiihey not bad
a bit freaky at first though but it makes great sense at the endgreat graphics and entertaining yet tedious puzzles gives this  starsquake iii is not just a fun game but also a fantastic experience
the graphics and sound are first rate
it may take a little while to become accustomed to the controls but with a slight amount of patience its not a problem
it has been suggested that the dc mouse is necessary
unless you plan on winning some ridiculous online tournament dont waste your moneystop thinking and purchase this game immediately
you wont be disappointedwarning if you dont have a keyboard and a mouse you might consider buying them before you purchase this game
its really impossible to play well using the game controller
youll get blown away so fast as you try to aim
aside from the game control the game is amazing
the graphics are outstanding especially on a vga monitor
the game play is fast
there is virtually no lag time on the broadband even with four players
on the k connection there is an occational lag and i have yet to be booted out of the connection
of course playing online is the key to this game
online game play is extremely addictive
there are plenty of levels to chose fromi think  or so
one player game is fun too
but the opponents are tough maybe because i am a beginner
id say this is one of the mustpurchase games for the dreamcastgreat way to start liking halo reach if you only have a dreamcastoutdated now but still funsome of the things in nfl k are better than nfl k
the graphics are great in this game and the field looks more realistic
the commentary was great in nfl k but in this it is game it is not as good
i was not very impressed by the games plays
in nfl k the plays were at least plays that ive heard of
in this game i never heard of most the plays
not only that they got rid of some of my favorite plays such as reverse and the bombwhich were in nfl k
i found myself picking plays because they had cool namesoverall this was a good game i just liked nfl k a little bit betteri started off playing in franchise mode it seemed to be too easy on rookie scoring  with the other team scoring under  i swiched to pro and was taken back a little the game started playing out like it does on tv when you play on pro you have to watch the other teams formation other wise youll end up being sacked all the time throwing interceptions and tackled behind the line this game is very realistic all the other football gameswith the exception of madden were too easy you didnt have to plan out your plays on your next drive you just threw the ball and the reciever always cought it
but here on nflk you have to think
now that ive gotten used to how my teamchicago bears works and plays i can take them to the super bowl with only a couple loses during the season this game isnt for the light heartedunless you plan on playing at rookie all the time
everthing has to be taken into account on your drive towards the endzone players energy what type of defense your up against how good your qb really is
this isnt just a throw catch score gamethe only negatives i have is the inability to create a team in franchise mode saves take up a lot of memory graphics are good but could have been better some times the running back mutaites into a steam roller and runs for an  yard gainoverall an excellent playing expieriencethis game is simply amazing
the graphics are detailed to the max although the sidelines do look a bit goofy
the hits and player reactions are very well done
it has a lot of customization options such as create  players a team plays etc
simply amazing
there is also a franchise mode in which you can coach your team over years and seasons
you can trade players and draft picks and sign college prospects and free agents
by the time you get to your th year good luck on finding a winning season because moss carter manning james brown theyll all be gone and retired 
this game will definitly keep you and your friends playing through a season which is very challenging
there are a couple gripes which keep it from  stars
one you can block a punt every time if you line up on the outside of the left blocker
there are certain plays where you can pull all the dbs away from one side and just have a running back sweep out for open field and touchdowns
also punt returns can be really easy if you just sweep from one side to the other
the multiplayer game i dont play
i have played it and lag is horrible sickening
unplayable
games like x evo give me hope for segas network the online mode moves perfectly with no lag
nfl k could be simply awesome
finally if you got a dreamcast pick up this game
this game will be the love of fans everywhere because there just simply isnt much wrong with itany bball fan knows about the kind of player who has amazing speed and agility reads the defenders mind like a book makes the highlight reel every  minutes and has sweet ballhanding skills but he ends up just keeping the bench cushion warm because he cant play defense which is a darn shame really since nba k has the smoothest offensive game any console nba sim has seen
this year running fast break plays are easier and more active as opposed to the way players stopped midtransition last year
beating players off the dribble with your crossover move makes them look silly and you can almost hear their ankles snapping
with the heightened prevalence of using screens frustrating your defender has never been easier
plus with new motion capture animations littered throughout the game nba k is a few leaps and bounds ahead of last years game in terms of emulating a live nba match
if you take a look at the movies of live  for ps youll be amazed at how its not even close to the look and feel of nba k
live looks awkwardly herkyjerky showing you how much nba k is above and way beyond the competition in the area of capturing the look of the nbawhere nba k runs into a mental block though is how it likes to play defense
when you go up for an open fingerroll layup and even a jam the defender sometimes likes to go through the rim for the block
stealing balls are way too easy and youll find that it happens a lot when you post a player up or do a crossover move
too often do i try to post someone up with my center and find it slapped away
and dont even think of doing juke or spin moves with a slow player because the computer will steal your ball if you dont get past him every single time
because of this some of the worst defenders occasionally end up with  or  steals in their stats
also youll find that most of your point total will come from inside the paint because jumpshots are hard to come by and usually do not go in if there is a defender even remotely in front of youstats are usually pretty inaccurate
when kobe bryant gets a  defensive rating and predrag stojakovich only a  in threepoint shooting youll quickly see how stats are based primarily on hype and very little intricate research was done
thankfully rosters and stats are updateable through the download feature and i hope teams like the dallas mavericks get a little bit of a ratings boostwhen all its said and done and the preaching about defense
defense
is finished nba k is still a great bball game and its still the best bball game yet despite all of its faults
the defense will annoy you but you can play around it and cope with it
i just hope next years rendition gets into a defensive stance and does what gary quotthe glovequot payton does bestok i should have gave this game  stars but i am giving it a chance since i loved nbak
the shooting game is ludicrous
maybe i just do not know how to shoot but i seem to be doing fine in the practice mode with my release
i have players on my team that should be hitting at least  of their jumpers yet they cant hit a dang thing
in nba live i was able to hit a decent amount of jumpers unlike this game
the way the crossovers are implemented i do enjoy unlike live where its just a fancier way of walking and does nothing but
the franchise mode is an excellent addition to the series and i look forward to it for the remainder of
another nice addon was the street ball mode which in my opinion is a bit too easy
if you wanted to steal the ball all you have to do is push them and you wont be fouled
its all good though you would just have to refrain from doing it but it does get a bit tempting to do when playing against a friend
the graphics are better than last years and the sound is excellent also
all in all its a great pick up if youre a hoops fan but if you get frustrated easily its best to stay awayfirst im going to say that sega needs to get on its knees and beg ea sports to make a nba live game for the dreamcast
you cant refute eas qualitynba k however is a worthwhile game
the graphics are stunning especialy to an explaystation owner like me and the gameplay is wonderfully fluid
never before has a fast break looked so fluid so simple
the ai plays smart defense keying on your best players and doubling down in the paint
the street mode while somewhat silly is a fun addition to dunk contests with your friends and it also includes season and franchise modes
its a truly wonderful game but the only thing that keeps it from earning five stars are a few nagging problemsfirst there is a huge jump in the skills needed from level to level
the jump from rookie to pro may be too much for some gamers and the allpro level is just silly in its difficulty
also the crossover is a move that is most valuable on the rookie difficulty setting it becomes nearuseless on any harder levels
the computer gets steals constantly when crossovers are attempted and getting a charging call on the computer is one of the most daunting tasks in gaming ever
sadly the most indepth managementwise part of the game is franchise mode which become quite dissapointing when you learn that you cannot include your created players in it
also the controls are noncusomizable arrgh
and are ordered in an odd manner
switching players is also an exercise with button pumping as switching often leaves you going from one player to another unable to cycle through your entire teamhowever other than these problems nba k is a solid game worthy of any dreamcast owners collectionprosgreat graphicstons of optionsthe announcers can say certain names of created playersconsplay by play and commentator isnt as good as kweak ai computer controlled players spend alot of time out at the three point line when they have the ball even if they have an open drive to the hoop
they wait until there are a few seconds left on the shot clock and then pop it up
verdictits pretty good
for the price id say get it
i havent played k so i cant compare k to it
all i can do is compare it to k
compared to k it falls a little short
thats not to say its a bad game it just has a few short commingsmaybe i just got spoiled with the winning streaks i could amass in nbak
i dont know i just dont enjoy k for the simple fact that it regresses in as many areas as it moves forward
game play may be much more realistic but its not as much fun
the pace is slower unless you bump the game speed to quotfastquot then it seems a bit too fast
the graphics are still topnotch for the players and court but the crowd has gotten much more pixellated
play issues include players who no longer run close enough to the basket to dunk when the ball is passed to them remember in k theyd stand right under the thing
now they run to within a couple feet of the hoop then move back out a couple more meaning you have to have to drive around the ridiculously adept defenders to do anything but take short jumpers
its all but impossible to drive the lane against any but the worst teams
those guys come out of nowhere to block your path
im usually able to blow out the k guys by  even on allstar difficulty
on pro difficulty in k i can barely win against the loser teamswhat i like a lot   illegal defense calls are done correctly
no longer can the center just lurk right under the basket waiting for blocks
drat there went half my strategy  the street courts
they simply rock
the ambient sounds in the background and the crowd make it feel very real internet play
and it really works nicely
i was worried about lag but its a nonissue and the connections seem to be stable swat blocks the old teamsbut why on earth doesnt the s west team include kareem
what i dont like at all  head coaches no longer get their names called during the courtside intro
why for crying out loud on a  gb disc couldnt they include  more little wavs for the announcer instead of quotand introducingthe heaaaaad coachquot
very lame the commentary on star players
living in utah i play the jazz a lot and im already sick of the extended comments by rod about karl malones perfect physiqueugh
it happens every game bad crowd graphics
they add to the atmosphere as usual while playing but you sure dont want to get close with the zoom on a reply a number of players dont seem to have names during the commentary
john starks is one and few rookies get announced as anything but a number the rosters are not completely accurate although this shouldnt be too big an issue if they stick to their promise and have downloadable updatesi wish there was a  star rating because i just cant call it  i like the game and the series very much but this one just rubbed me wrong
maybe it just needs to grow on me its a very good game but there is one thing missing orginalilly
it is the same thing as mario party but with cards and sonic charaticers
the grapics are good i rate grapics how fun it is well it isnt my favorite fun game but it should get a pretty good score gameplay how long it lasts well i would say about  hours with me so i rate gameplay it needs to be longer
sound is fine and overall playing this gamegreat you should get itbasically its mario party  with sonic characters and cardsthis game is unique
i loved it as a kid and its still a quality game but it definitely has some imperfections
id stick to mario party if youre wanting multiplayer
this game is more of a personal experiencethose looking for a party game for theyre dead dreamcast can do no wrong with sonic shuffle no matter what the negative reviews might say
at first i didnt like it when i played sonic shuffle it came with my dreamcast when i bought it in the sonic bundle but it grew on me more and more and the meat and bones of sonic shuffle is that you need three other players to have some real fun with it
similarities to mario party are expected but this isnt quite a ripoff of it although some may beg to differ
the graphics are superb dreamcast quality and are nicely rendered and colorful while the whimsical sound effects and smooth controls add to the overall package
all in all at a cheap price you really cant go wrong with sonic shufflesonic shuffle is segas attempt to enter the quotparty gamequot genre along with nintendos mario party series and sonys crash bash
and its a very worthy entry indeedin terms of game flow sonic shuffle is very similar to mario party though with enough differences to allow it to narrowly escape the quotripoffquot label
each player controls one of the sonic characters
as in mario party players take turns moving their characters around a game board choosing which of many branching paths to take
depending on which space you land on you may gain or lose rings enter into battle with a monster or trigger a minigame in which all players battle for rings
the players race to pick up quotprecioustonesquot which appear in various locations on the game board
when all the precioustones have been collected a final minigame is played and the winner of the game is determined by who has collected the most
so far mario party players have seen all of this beforebut the most critical difference between sonic shuffle and mario party is hinted at by the name of the game
instead of rolling dice to move around the board sonic shuffle players must play cards
each player has a hand full of cards numbered  through  along with the occasional quotspecialquot allowing characters extra movement or special attacks and quoteggmanquot disaster cards
when its your turn to move you must play a card playing a  for example allows you to move  spaces
likewise battles with monsters are settled by card play in order to defeat a monster you must play a card at least as high as the monsters number
importantly you are not required to play a card out of your own hand you can pick a card from another players insteadbut you wont be able to see which card youre choosing and you must play whatever card you pickedthis cardplay mechanic sets up some very interesting decisions
you might be tempted to play your highnumbered cards for movement as soon as you can to race to the precioustone before anyone elsebut if you do you likely wont have a card high enough to defeat the monster that guards the stone
you might be tempted to draw cards from others hands in order to conserve your own but in doing so you run the risk of drawing a lownumbered card that forces you to move to a poor spaceor worse drawing the eggman card which dumps a random calamity on your head
one important note here  if youre going to play multiplayer you should have a vmu for each player
if a players controller has a vmu installed then that players cards will only be shown on the vmu screen preventing other players from seeing them
if you dont have a vmu in your controller you will be at a disadvantage as your cards will be visible to all
movement around the board is complicated by the fact that the characters arent identical
tails amy and knuckles each have special spaces on the board that only they can cross for example tails can fly across some gaps that block other players
sonic has no special spaces but his quotspin dashquot ability allows him to move at double or triple speed if he plays cards with the same number on several turns in a rowthe minigames are very similar to mario partys
in most of these games its every hedgehog or fox or echidna for himself but some games divide the characters into teams of two or pit three characters against one
most of the games require skill but a few are sheer luck for example picking a can from a soda machine avoiding the preshaken can that will explode in your face
these minigames allow the characters to collect rings that can either be saved or spent to purchase forcejewelsspecial gems that allow a character to briefly break the rules of the game for example by playing several cards instead of one when moving or by placing a forcefield around a space so that other characters cant passunfortunately these minigames are where sonic shuffles one major flaw kicks in  load times
games like this work best when the action is kept fast and furious sonic shuffle has to pause for about  seconds while it loads each minigame from the disc and pause again when it returns to the main game board after each minigame
this breaks the flow of the action a problem which mario partys cartridge format allows it to avoida singleplayer story mode makes sonic shuffle a reasonable oneplayer experience but as with mario party the real fun comes when three or four players compete
just make sure that none of your friends take the game too seriously theres a large amount of luck involved
as with mario party a skillful player will win more than his or her share of games but the outcome of any one individual game is anybodys guessin summary sonic shuffle is a great way to kill time with friends if you liked mario party youll like this at least as much
and if you play me remember i get to be tailsthe graphics are great except for the animationbut the ai are hard to beat even on easy modebut overall if you have  controllers and a party of  go for itthroughout all the gbc games this is probably the most unique of the bunch
more importantly this is probably the only one with full voice over
more than once have i completed the game so i geuss you could call it kind of addicting
so here you go my review on perfect darkstory joanna dark the hero from the  smash hit perfect dark for n has returned in the prequal on gbc
saldly the story hasnt got the same flare as its prodecesser
throughout her adventure joanna will encouter many bosses many of which require serious skill to take down
the game also offers many game types such as snipingmy favorite driving and all out action
ill leave it there for nowgraphics not the best on the gbc but they are quite clean still there is hardly no color variation
nothing really specialsound the soundtrack is greatwhat little there is and yes the game does feature voice acting but as unfortunate as it is they are terrible blahgameplay as i mentioned earlier the gameplay is extremly varied and fun easily the best part of the game
the controls are a bit mushy though
the stealth is pretty cool toomy conclusion is that this is a great game and you should try it if you the series you should give it a go but still you might want a more solid adventure and in that case you should try mgsi saw alot of the reviews for this game and i didnt know whether to get it or not so i decided to try it
i am pretty impressed by this game
it is not bad at all
pd reminds me of goldeneye with the objectives and the watch and everything
the game is challenging and requires you to be patient and watchful
the weapons are okay but i dont like how they are hard to fire
i do like how you can get the leftover guns from guards
the rumble feature lets you know you got hit and the training segments kind of sharpen you shooting skills
the graphics are also very good for a game boy
the bottom line is this game is a goldeneye for the gb minus the musichomeworld is the best space sim ive seen
the interface is pretty straight forward the tutorials are very well done the plot is excellent and the playability is awesome
the only reason i gave it  stars   really are the graphics are not quotup to parquot with todays graphics but this was released in  so no big deal
its not that the graphics are bad they are awesome
but compared to todays quake engine its not as good
but you will hardly notice because the game play is excellent
you really feel like you are in space and commanding your own fleet
and i havent even tried the multiplayer game yet which has got to be wild
the game of the year edition comes with the prima guide and the music cd so you basically get the game for free
you cant loselet me get my gripes out of the way first the learning curve
im all for hard games and learning them
i like challenges which is part of the reason i dropped out of college  hours away from graduation
 anyway this game is hard to learn
it has very easy controls very easy to play but to actually be successful expect to find yourself repeating early missions constantly
that can be somewhat frustratingalso both sides have the exact same story with absolutely no deviation whatsoever
this makes the replay value somewhat less because why play the other side once you have finished the game with the otherthat aside this game has broken new grounds for rts games
the use of the d environment is breathtaking
we finally are able to play a space rts in full d unlike the starfleet command games that boasted d play but delivered d onlythe graphics oh the graphics
the better your d card the better they look
the ships look real they look smooth and they are beautiful
more than just eye candy mind youthe multiplayer function is where the game truly excells imo
facing a human opponent in a space battle such as this is what weve all dreamed about or at least those of us who have ever wanted to lead a force like darth vader did in the star wars moviesbottom line this is truly a wonderful game but not perfect
it deserved every award it received and with the game now at a very affordable price even for you poor college students it should be a mustown of course if you have the system to run the gamefirst off i gave up on homeworld about onethird though the campaign
using a small bit of resources building a few units and carrying those forward to the next mission sounds great but its very hard in practice
you cant afford to lose many units and i lost them too frequently
after many reloads ive wimped out
i just cant afford the many hours required to master this gamethat said this game has a lot going for it
theres a good story and soundtrack
on top of the everyunitisprecious strategic aspect is the pseudo d playing field which does add tactical depth to the rts genre although its plagued by a poor camera scheme that locks the camera to any one of your units
the control scheme is also poor and relies on keyboard input too muchthis isnt a bad game in fact theres a lot of depth here
it does require a lot of patiencetime to masterthe gameplay is rock solid except for a few problems with objectives
ive found very few bugs and the interface is really easy to usethe voice acting is superior in this one in my opinion which is an accomplishment since the original was quite good to begin withthe ship variety has suffered theres only two corvette class ships for the somtaaw fleet and theyve made the beast corvettes a bit too weak for the unit caps they setthis game introduces a support unit system which limits the amount of ships you can make
you build support modules so that you can make more ships
this was actually done rather well except it seems like the beast fleet wasnt made with economy in mind
when playing beast what i most want to do is make a gigantic hulking fleet out of all the salvaged ships and some ships i built as well but support units force the player to have to retire big fleets or stop infecting ships which isnt funanother problem is that super capitol ships cannot be captured and beast ships cant be capured at all unless they are of somtaaw design
quite a large portion of my ships in hw were not made by me always fun to have some extra recruits xdtheres a few really good tracks in this game but for the most part the music isnt something youd find yourself wanting to listen to outside of the game
its more ambient sort of elevator music which really is too bad the music in hw was outstandingalso the backgrounds arent as good in this one hw had beautiful backgrounds with all sorts of colors you could look at the beginning of a mission and tell exactly where you were
there was a ton of detail too
sometimes i went back to the old missions to get a better look at those backgrounds some of them were breathtaking sea of lost souls comes to mindin hwc its not bad but just like the music its not very memorablestill a great game though
i had a lot of fun with it its definitely worth a playthere is in computer games as everywhere an attempt to mine existing licenses for extra cash
thats why you get things like clue the movie and lord of the rings the dental floss
the results of this are often tedious and atrocious keeping the wrong elements while discarding the stuff that might be fun
developer deep red has gotten it right with monopoly tycoon by keeping the property names and a few key concepts of monopoly and combining them with business simulation concepts and realtime action as found in roller coaster tycoonfirst thing to keep in mind is that this is not monopolytheboardgame nor even monopolythecomputerizedversionoftheboardgame
its a real time strategy game and time moves rather quickly
it requires far more twitch than say roller coaster tycoon or trevor chans marvellous but far more complex capitalism seriesits also a business simulation you can buy property build hotels and apartments and even the railroads and four utilities gas works and telecoms are added to the board games electric company and water worksbut most of the time youre surveying the people of the city building businesses and adjusting prices when your competitors try to undercut youa few things make this work a good selection of scenarios with different goals pleasant fully d graphics which capture the flair of the board game ai which does a pretty good job of thwarting the obvious plans and brevity brevity brevity
you can play a long game but the scenarios are mostly on the short side and its possible for a game to swivel back and forth between players rather dramaticallythe titular monopoly itself carries over nicely from the board game with it you can build hotels and it allows you take over a competitors businesses
you can do that without a monopoly too but its drastically more expensive
there are downsides the overall coolness of the d presentation is offset by the rather bland building graphics where every store moreorless looks like every other the musical score consists of one shortish albeit good track the vital data you need to get to quickly is spread out in a couple of placesand this seems to stem from the developers desire to make the game a little harderand some things about the mechanics are not entirely clear again perhaps from the same desire to make the game harderbut allinall as a short diversion monopoly tycoon is pretty sweet
its a shame that a sequel is so unlikelythis game is based off the principles of the board game
you want to own the market and get as many monopolies as possible
you can get monopolies with streets rail roads and utilities
there are thirty three city blocks four rail roads and four utilities for your taking
most of the names are new but there are some of the originals in there too
altogether there are forty four businesses to buy and run
what makes this game different than the board game is the amount of detail
you have to pay attention to what the people want prices of goods and stock landlords and profitsjust like the board game there are all the markers racecar wheel barrow dog cannon etc
 they all have detailed personalities too
for example the dog is a snobby lady whose wealth comes from old money and she always carries her dog wherever she goes
the canon is a strategic army commander the wheel barrow is a builder who is a shrewd investor
in the single player you get to place the racecar he is a quick minded individual who does not always think of the consequences of his actions or investments
this demo has a nice tutorial and one single player mission
the full version will have sixteen scenarios and multiplayer mode where you can play scenarios like last man standing get voted for mayor etc
you can network play with up to five people
you can also play online via game spy
the campaign in the demo is a race to sell  items
you play against the computer being all the characters mentioned earlier
there is only one difficulty setting available and that is easythis game isnt about owning properties in this game you build them
there are many businesses to put on them to help you choose its a good idea to take a poll and then build what the people want
the time periods vary from  so some additional businesses will become available later in the game
you need to consider peoples needs and wants for the day and evening entertainment
you have to manage each businesses books prices and profits
if you go in the red for more than  hours your game is over
the chance cards are still in this game and you never know what they will deliver
you can open them anytime just make sure your cash flow is ok before you do soif you do find your in a pinch for cash you auction off properties
you can also demolish businesses for a small fee
if you are low on cash and want to change a business you can refurbish it to something else
you can also sell stores back to the city or a lower cost
its usually a bad idea to buy out opponents stores unless you have a monopoly on that land
the monopoly allows you to buy the stores at less than actual value so you make money instantly with each purchase
if you buy stores on a block where you dont have a monopoly on the other hand youll overpayfrom a christian perspective this game is as clean as the board gamethe game was easy to install it uses your typical install shield
there is a separate applet to configure your video resolution and sound source
the graphics were good definitely d rendered
there were three view modes and the camera movement was very smooth
it has good sound effects and nice background music
for controls you only need the mouse
the interface is easy to use my only complaints is that the text is hard to read
the game is not designed for windows  but it does run well on it
the game is a slow on exiting it makes you wait to read what the full version has to offer
overall a nice remake of monopoly and just like the original its fun for the whole familyi never thought that monopoly could be applied to a game like this
it is really a businesseconomic simulator because you have to take charge of aspects such as cash flow sales supply and demand etc
however a drawback to it is that it does not allow you to play a regular gameyou can only play the scenarios
but it is an excellent game especially if you want to practice businesseconomicsoverall i really enjoy playing grand prix   the game does have a couple of down sides but lets start with the positives
first the driving is very realistic at least it feels real to me 
if you turn off many of the computer assisted options the game becomes almost un playable without a wheel or other analog input device
as would be expected the cars are very sensitive and are easy to spin unless you are very careful on the throttle and steering
if you add rain into the mix the situation becomes even more difficult
it is like driving on ice
also any change to the car damage wear etc can be felt in the handlingif youre in to tuning your car this game also has a lot to offer
you can tune the car at very high levels wing adjustments tire types etc all the way down to subtle suspension changes
after tuning your car you can take it out for a practice session and then look at graphs of how your car performed
with all of the tools this game provides you can put an enormous amount of work into tuning your car
if youre just into driving the game comes with preset car setups for each track that work pretty wellnext on the plus side are the graphics
i was very impressed with the amount of detail in the game
the sky accurately reflects the reported weather conditions and the detail on the cars especially during replay is amazing
as weather conditions change you can see the lighting changes all around you
as clouds pass over the scene will darken
youll even see showers falling on selected areas of the track along with puddles and a quotdry linequot
during heavy rain events the standing water on the track beautifully reflects its surroundingsnow for the downsides
first the replay feature is very limited
specifically it is limited to the last  seconds
even though you can view the last  seconds from any car a variety of angles i expected a much more robust replay system in modern racing gamethe car damage seems to be lacking a bit of realism
while the cars do fly through the air flip and break apart believe ably it seems like you can go through a pretty major accident such as hitting a wall at about  mp without doing any damage
this just doesnt seem believable to me
the most recent patch for the game available on their website addresses this problem but not totallynext there is no verbal communication with the pits
other games offer constant radio contact but this has none
having some pit chatter going on in the background would really add to the gamefinally the instruction manual could use some work
it covers the game pretty well and give you enough information to tune your car but is by no means in depth
it is also lacking an index so quickly looking up what a particular menu item means is impossibleeven given the negatives this game is an absolute joy to play
i highly recommend it to any racing sim enthusiastinitially i really did not like this game
the graphics werent up to the  high standards of todays gaming market and after four years there really  wasnt much to set it above the already great grand prix  it is however  still as addictive as ever
if you can learn to forgive the graphics you  will love it and even if you cant get over the graphics rd party  patches will be realeased making it look and play better
if anything buy  it as an investment as it will be added to greatly and bear in mind the  game has been in production for four years and up until may of this year  the only person who had been doing any work on it was geoff crammond
that  isnt bad going for one personthis is a very addictive little game
the biggest challenge is to learn how to generate money with your airport
and i found that a bit difficult to work out but after that it is fairly easy and you will have an oversized elaborate airport of your very own in no time at all
if you enjoy tycoon games then you will probably like this one
i would have rated it higher but once you figure the economics out it is a bit too easyi bought this at walmart as some other people did too apperantly
it installed just fine and runs great but then again i have a brandnew pc so it should i enjoy that you cant just build build build without having to watch your money
telling some airlines to get lost is a plus too
the graphics are pretty good for a fifteen dollar game
ive read other reviews saying to get the sims or rollercoaster tycoon instead
keep in mind those other games are thirty plus dollars eachi do have a few complaints though
why do they limit you to four stinking runways
my local municipal airport the town has a population of  has more than that
why do shops whose contracts youve regected repeatedly continue to apply
why is the tutorial so bad
if you still dont like this game and want another bargainbasement quottycoonquot i highly recommend railroad tycoon ii gold edidtionmy favorite games are buisness sims strategies and simulation games
airport tycoon was unique and a nice addition of the tycoon genre which was spinning out of control with worthless games
you could handle passengers as well as cargoyou were in charge of creating and managing an airport
you were given freedom not total to design your airport and build certain rooms for expample security and stores
the gates you placed were more like plop against the wall and add a tarmac
the main room with the ticket handling was frustrating
if you didnt have enough ticket booths you were constantly adding more than  in one room and it seemed rediculous
in a real airport you saw the different ticket booths for the airline and the conveyor belt behind the ticket agent
it would of been nice to see poeple come in with luggage and checking it in
the realism while lacking and the gameplay sometimes frustrating airport tycoon had this appeal that kept you playing for a few hours
my favorite was seeing the airplanes being serviced on the tarmac and the planes taxingand taking off
outside of the airport besides deciding what continent and city you choose to put your airport you were also given the options of seeting up parking lots parking garages gas stations as well as hotels
while this was the first airport tycoon i would of liked more refined graphics and realism such as cars actually parking in the lots people being dropped off by taxis you could also put taxi stands along the road and a layout similar to airports today where they have terminals and seperate unloading areas for passengers to get out of cars and taxis and check in their luggage
just like in real life also it would be nice to see actual roads that have signs telling you were to go what terminals arriving and departing flights as well as lifelike baggage claims when passengers come off of the planes and try to retrieve their luggage you know that annoying sound with the red blinking light alerting you the baggage is coming
this would add more employees the ones handling the luggage and putting the luggage into the baggage claim
i always wish that monitors or large signs showing arriving and departing flights with the flight numbers and whether or not the flight is on time delayed or due to weather cancelled
i also like to see live gates with actual gate numbers desks waiting areas and announcements as well as final boarding calls and tickes being checked and watching people go into the thing that is attached at the gate to the plane cant remeber the name of itthis was a nice game decent buisness model little frustrating at times and was looking foward to the sequel hoping their would be improvements
unfortunatley  was terrible and  was a slight improvement over the sequel but wasnt as good as the first one
so it went downhill after the original airport tycoon
at was promising but unfortunately its sequels burried itive been a spiderman fan and a gamer for years
this one brings the two together in a big big way
multiple costumesfor those who enjoy a departure from the red amp blue villans abound and theres plenty of that great spidey humor
from the rooftops of manhattan to the subway tunnels below the action keeps coming
there have been a lot of games out there that have trashed a perfectly good franchise
this one will make you forget them
graphics gameplay and good times
all in a days work for the amazing spidermani waited a long time for a playstation version of spiderman to come out
sega genesis was pretty useless once this system came out so the few spiderman games they had were obsoletethis game was rather good a little short though
the graphics were fairly good and so was the story but it came short of twists and turns
i knew from the very beginning that the villains behind the symbiote invasion scheme were dr octopus and carnage
still its a fairly good game
if youre a spiderman fan you wont be dissapointed in getting this gamewe waited for years
played through hundreds of hours of such stinkers as the nintendo  version of superman  batman the xmen the shudder fantastic four even spiderman nobody seemed to do them any justice
our childhood heroes were being destroyed by an evil even worse than lex luthor magneto or the green goblin and carnage combined bad games
 well except for xmen  for genesis a few years back
that rocked
that is until nowactivision the wizards ltgodsgt behind tony hawks pro skater did this game spiderman and i have to say it is unbelievable
never never has ol webhead been represented so well
johnny cochrahan couldnt represent somebody this good
anything spidey can do in the comic you can now achieve
web swinging
anywhere
in new york city
this is cool
you can literally get lost in the levels this is not usually a good thing but here oh baby it is
the graphics are good as they seem to be pushing the playstation to the max
however the game falls a little short of my expectationsthe controls are tight so controlling spidey is a snap but as in every thirdperson game there is one fatal flaw the  camera
you can literally fall to your death because of this thing
especially in boss fights
it just seems to wanna say quot  you im going over herequot but dont worry this only happens rarely and in the later levels
which brings me to my next complaint
the game is simply too short
 levels even though huge still add up to just  and thats simply too few for a game this good
the fighting interface is inventive allowing you to do like spidey and use the webs as weapons but after a while it becomes the same old punchpunchpunchguyfallsdown thingratings  graphics  theyre scrumdiddleyupmtious sound  come on its even got the old tv
song
control  this is what kills the game
 camera
funocity  its short but its really goodtotal  stars
youll like it
buy it
trust meok first lets go over a small list of current superhero vids that are out there that suck
superman
he looks like some unearthly force in this case the games designers violated him more than lex luthor ever could
iron man
second verse same as the first but take out lex luthor
incredible hulk
barely looked credible to me
maximum carnage was a good game for genesis and snes back in the day if you havent seen it dont fret cuz it kinda sucks compared to now
batman
what batman game hasnt induced the need to blow chunksthe point for those of you not turned off yet is this  throughout the realm of video games there hasnt been a good superherotoconsole translation game
there was a spiderman arcade game but it didnt last too long and it wasnt ported
do you know why
because it stunk
it ended up being deported and im not sure if that game was the inspiration to the somewhat horrid genesis versionsanyway this review is about the psx version and in my humble opinion youll not find a better spiderman or superhero action game on any other system
you can literally do whatever a spiderman can
swing through the city bounce around with his enhanced agility create different web objects stick to walls only thing you cant do is take pics of foes and sell them for cash but thats kinda lame anyway
the control is pretty good as spidey can perform an array of attack moves
the dual shock controller recommended if you dont have one simulates the spider sense by vibrating when an enemy is near and on screen arrows help further the direction
the camera is kinda lopsided at times but youll forget it once youre tangling with scorpion and venom
speaking of the gruesome ones they are well represented in this version
youll run into those guysvenom is difficult to say the least mysterio rhino i had so much fun beating him up even more with spideys comments and doctor octopus
i wont ruin the other surprises for you if you dont know alreadythe sound is excellect as stan quotthe manquot lee does voice overs and spidey himself comes back with those quips that made him famous
good for cheesy laughs
the voice acting is well done as well and youll hear those familiar quotthwipquot and quotthwackquot sounds throughout the gamethe game also has training sessions a kid mode as well as information on all your spiderman related chracters
i just wish venom was playable oh well maybe next time
the game is woefully short i finished it in under a week and there isnt a whole lot of replay value involved thus the  stars
youll want to play it over again tho just to unlock some of spideys alternate costumes the scarlet spider is ok other than the fact that its kinda lame while the black spidey symbiote costume is there and easy to get plus it has unlimited webbingmake no mistake  this game short as it is is very addicting and it makes you feel like youre right in the thick of spideys paper adventures
youll want to get some of the codes to play the game in another way
what way you ask
well i used them and there were times where the game changed making it a bit funnier
added a little bit more replay value but not much
definately check this out only if to satisfy your own curiosity youre a fan of the webbed one andor you like good quality action titlesfinally a video game based on a comic book character that is done correctly
this game has all the wallcrawling action and comedy of the comics
there are only  drawbacks to the game
first is control
moving at mulitple angles especially along walls and the ceiling can be confusing and frustrating
getting through the final scene will take some serious practice
using your webbing can mix you up too
fighting game fans may not have trouble using the dpad and only one button to do  diffent things
the only trick youll really need to master is quotimpact webbingquot to beat the game
the other drawback is the briefness of the game
i beat the game in one day and im just a casual gamer
except for trying to unlock andor find the hidden items there really isnt much replay value
there is also a code to unlock everything anyway quoteel natsquot stan lee in reverse
if you are a spiderman or a super hero fan that would like to see a great translation of a character i recommed you check out this game
rent it first
its easy to get through within a few hours
then decide on whether to buy or notafter i payed crono cross the felling i got is that squaresoft had a game ready to go but wanted to do a crono trigger sequel  and so forced this finished game to be a sequel by putting mentions sometimes senseless mentions to crono trigger characters if crono cross was called the radical dreamers and wasnt a sequel it wold be perfect as a crono trigger fan i got very angry and disapointedsquaresoft makes two types of games
the very bad and the very good
usually there is little gray area
well this game is in the gray area
a nice idea and a good game
it doesnt quite do its predecessor justice but it holds its own
the music is captivating to say the least
the opening song will reel you into the game with its almost sad yet happy sound
the magic system works like materia but on different levels
you equip it like materia however in battle you have to build up the ability to cast that spell and after that you cant use it anymore until the next battle
it is a very interesting idea that is executed well
the battle system could be better though
i am not nor have i ever been a fan of turnbased battles where you choose everyones action then watch the battle round unfold
there is no strategy in it and it can quickly aggravate you because you cant heal that turn and that can end up killing the character in the end because you cant heal immediately
the battles also move much too slowly even for this type of battle system
i got bored playing this game and left it midgame to collect dust for almost a year when i got the nerve to finally finish it
the story is interesting but executed in a less than great manner
the writing whats woth squaresoft games and its writing is not all that good and it can lead to button mashing to get to the more interesting parts
the animations are beautiful simply beautiful
i found myself going back to past saves just to watch them again
the having to get minerals and items to create weapons and armors is bad too
the only reason why it is bad is because it is almost impossible to find enough of these minerals to keep your party of  people if you want fully equipped
that and money isnt exactly the easiest thing to come across either
buy the game if you want to i wont hold it against you
you will either like the game or hate it
or you may be like me and indifferent to it
this is a very difficult game to get a confident feeling with as to whether you will like it or not but in light of the failure of final fantasy vii it is a welcome breeze on a hot humid daychrono cross which is a semi sequel to s chrono trigger cant even come close to its former games plateua
chrono trigger is arguably the greatest rpg ever created
so while chrono cross is not as good it still does a whole heck of a lot of things rightthe gameplay story and battles in this game are all top notchits fun to get a handle over the numerous tough boss battles in this game because of the elemental magics strategic system
black beats white and red beats blue etcits always fun and interesting to see what the next dungeon or boss has to offer
the gameplay is never sluggish and will always keep you on your toesalso when you beat the game you have an option to replay the entire game again with all of your beefed up characters from before
and if things are going slow you can speed them up with a fast forward button on your second play through the game
truly brilliantso why does this game get  out of  if it is so darn goodbecause of its confusingtedious magic system and over abundance of charactersmost of the magics and summons in this game are a joy to watch and to behold their might
but in this game there are no magic points and you must equip every single magic spell you have
that could mean  spells to equip per character
setting up each character late in the game can take upwards of  minutes easily
and each spell can only be cast once per battle unless you buy multiples of that spelland probably the games worst point is its ridiculous amount of characters
chrono trigger had something like  recruitable characters that you can play as each with their own terrific and unforgettable personalitieschrono cross has  recruitable characters of your  characters have the personality of a wood stool
some characters will literally say can i join your party than join and never say anything else ever againhaving  playable characters instead of  spreads each one way too thin and makes them all lose individualityin the end this game is still one of the greatest rpgs ever made for the first playstation
while its few flaws keep it from being a true classic it is still one of the greatest rpg experiences to be had in the past  yearsbasically this game takes place  years after the events of chrono trigger and you can travel between alternate worlds as opposed to time in its predecessor
the graphics are very topnotch and the environments are beautifully detailed with a great soundtrack
i have only one complaint though
the leveling system is quite awkward
instead of simply leveling up you gain stats and i have a hard time telling if my characters are ready to defeat a certain boss because of this but this doesnt mean that i dislike the game in fact this is one of the better rpgs i have played it would just have been nice to be able to level up normally
the character development is quite incredible and unique as opposed to your typical rpgs but it is easy to get lost in this game so always have a walkthrough in handysome masterpiecesclassics seem to be called that because of the massive attentionhype it got
or people call them successes despite the many flawswitness matrix reloaded big money maker but totally lousy sequel
chrono cross got big marks in magazines on initial release yet people now look at it as a far inferior sequel to chrono trigger and just an good game overall but not great
i think its good but way too hyped and dropped the ball syndrome all over the placestory you play as serge another silent protaganist who on an errand for a childhood friend is swept into another dimension one where people talk about him in the past tense and soldiers seem to be after him
like any other game its about finding out about one thing but realizing its far bigger than thatgraphics back when the game came out these were great
today theyre still colorful and vibrant
your home village arni village for example is lush and beautiful that you want it to be actually real since it looks like the perfect vacation spot
battle graphics are great as well but just like in trigger the overworld graphics are poor but thats alrightsoundmusic whenever people mention the music they always mention the opening track as a good tester for the soundtrack
its a great track with the others being as memorable as well
a very lighthearted and bouncy soundtrack
no voice acting though which is ok since the characters speak in accentsdialects at times so you kind of fill it in in your mindgameplay like in chrono trigger enemies are on screen before you fight them so you can avoid them but as always it helps to beef up
fighting is a bit different where like in xenogears you get  actions high medium low
basically you got  stamina to work with and each attack takes away some of itso you can have a combination of lowwhich is  medium and high
any combination that combines to  works but you can defend whichll raise it better for next timeinstead of magic you got colored techs
basically every magic attack has a certain color attached to it and characters have an innate color like their own personal color
so if youre a white innate your enemy is black red is blue and green is yellow
if theres been  colors in a row cast by anyone a summon can be called
its easy enough to follow but one event extremely late in the game requires specific order of them and its ohsoirritatinginstead of chrono triggers  or so characters you have 
to deal with which makes it awful since many of them dont even have backstory they just talk in funny accents and thats it
its very unfortunate since ct had such lovable characters even magus was likable here its basically favorites
shes cute he looks cool etc
in ct i had to debate who to bring here its just whoever looks the bestfor best results play ctthen play it again then play chrono cross
that way if youre disappointed you can just go to chrono trigger againfinally a fun game from squaresoft
aside from front mission  the square games have really left me wanting
call me spoiled but i have seen  all this before but finally they have put the eye candy and gameplay  together to make this a decent one
i wonder why people review something  they havent played
doesnt that defeat the purpose
anyway for those  that want to buy the game i am still playing it
the plot twists are  wonderful and it makes you wonder what would have happened if you had  chosen a different line or character
sighsquare continues to find  a magic system that works
this one is ok much better then drawing  ughboring ff
it seems far to complicated to just simply be  enjoyed though
you get the hang of it but still it takes a bit
but the  story is worth the buy it plays and flows well although at times i scratch  my head and wonder what is going on  chrono trigger was a long time ago
although i dont feel this is the next level of rpgs or ground breaking in  anyway it is still a classic and fun to playfor a ps  game the graphics are outstanding and theres a pretty good challenge to the gameif you liked the chrono trigger youll like this game
on the other hand if you liked chrono trigger dont expect this game to live up to the standard chrono trigger set
the game as a whole falls short of its snes brother but is still worth a playgraphicsbeautifully designed backdrops interesting character designs dazzling spell effects gorgeous fmv sequencesits all here
from the time you watch the introduction fmv you will be mesmerize and would want to become immersed in the world rich with atmosphere color and lifethe characters and worlds are in d
they animate with such fluidity
every character has hisherits own intricate design features and styles that they can call hisherits own
the worlds design has its own charm and beauty
the details are rich and each and every area has its own kind of atmosphere
the lighting and special effects for the spells and tech skills as well as locale effects are eyecatching as well
the atmosphere for one world has its own modification for the other world that make it unique as well though it is in fact the same locale
soundbeautiful tracks that start at the introduction cutscene
they only get better as the game progresses
each song creates a certain atmosphere and perfectly suits its respective locale
from grim to dire from depressing to mystery
there is a track that represents a series of moods that can trigger the player to feel them as wellthe sound effects are implemented very well
the consistency of the ground affects the sound of footsteps
in marshlands or through water a splashing or sloshing noise is present
the weapons sound effects correspond to the weapon itself and the density and and material it consists of a blade sounds like a blade a club sounds like a club a punch sounds like a punchand so forth
to hear the elements is an aural experience as well
gameplaythe gameplay is fairly simple and the learning curve is probably  mins hour
its standard rpg fare in terms of exploration
there are no random encounters on the field map or in the game
while exploring a location you can opt to avoid fights with the enemies on the screen if you can avoid them
one unique feature about this particular rpg is that once you encounter a boss you have the option to run
that does not mean you win by default or anything just gives you the opportunity to fix up or upgrade your party under the circumstance you having trouble thus allowing you to return to fight himherit when you are readythe battle system is a little different from most rpgs as well
your character can equip elements with added or decreased stats
as your player physically attacks hisherits opponent and the hits connect your player is granted the ability to use elements
each character has hisherits unique tech skill that corresponds to their innate color
unlike a lot of other rpgs your character is set to be a particular element ex serges innate color is white
with a total of  elements every element is weak against its opposite color ex black is weak against white and vice versa
as your character grows you are able to equip more elements
some characters learn a new tech skill corresponding to their innate colorthere are combination tech skills as there were in chrono trigger
some are obtained by having certain characters in battle together while others have to be obtained via side quests
reasons for a second goaroundthere is a new game feature just as there was in chrono trigger
the new game feature holds many extras for your second playthroughthere is more than one endingthere are  characters which allows you to tinker with the various characters in the gameprosgreat graphics and musicgreat storygreat replay value plus charactersas many characters as there are you actually learn a little about all of themconsas you may have figured the time travel feature was eliminated herethe main protagonists from chrono trigger do not play a part in the sequelif you played chono trigger then you will need this because it is the sequel
the story was good and the gameplay was also goodif youve ever played the card game uno then you already have a small insight into the game that is chrono cross cc a pseudosequel to the legendary snes game chrono triggercombat the combat in cc reminded me alot of final fantasy both games have really original complicated battle systems that allow for great depth at the price of userfriendliness
unlike ff where magic is drawn the magic in cc revolves around colors and playing them at the right timeslike a crazy game of uno
unfortunately the game doesnt explain the combat system very well
in addition despite the huge cast of characters there are almost no double or triple techssomething that would have encouraged mixing your parties up to try different combinations
even worse the game punishes you for using your characters in battleif a character dies everyone else to include the guys sitting it out on the sidelines gets to gain status upgrades except the dead ones
finally although almost all enemy encounters can be avoided one is whisked away to a combat screen to duke things out
it would have been nice if they had somehow kept the battles on the game screen itselfcharacters this time around it looks like squaresoft went the way of quantity not quality
there are lots of characters you can enlist in your party but most of them arent very well developed or very interesting
sergelynx tries hard to be a magus but doesnt quite cut it
also was squaresoft so short on ideas that they had to give nearly every character some earthly dialect
for this being a fantasy video game there sure are alot of french germans blonde californians scots and others running aboutstory for me the first part of the game was really slow and didnt pick up until after the psychedelic pastelcolor world
after that the game really started to pick up pace as better spells and techs were acquired and more characters joined upon the down side most of the revelations dont occur until almost the very end which seems to indicate to me that the plot was not as developed as it could have been
there are also many times where you will be visiting and revisiting the same areas resulting in a disappointing feeling of deja vu
a little more variety and difference between the parallel worldsmultiverses would have been most welcomesound this is where the game really shines
chrono cross definitely carries the torch forward with its excellent soundtrack even despite the fact that some of the better tracks are only heard once or twice
there are also some great youtube videos of piano covers of some of the songsgraphics for the playstation the graphics are certainly up to par for that era
there are quite a few fmvs and in keeping with the unoish colortheme there are tons of colors used in this game
sometimes i felt that there were too many colors on screen making it sometimes difficult to distinguish between objects and characters
there are often objectssecrets one can interact with but finding them can be a real challenge as they blend in with the environment so welloverall 
as a standalone game chrono cross is actually one of the better rpgs one could have bought for the playstation
as a sequel to chrono trigger it is less satisfying but still draws enough parallels that one can see how the two games are related
in a way chrono cross suffered the same fate as final fantasy  after the deafening shouts of approval for final fantasy  it was inevitable that the sequel would fall short and i feel that this is also what happened to this game
its not that final fantasy  and chrono cross are bad games they just had ungodly expectations to live up to and in the case of chrono cross sometimes even met the challengelike my title says i had alot of fun playing this game
if you really enjoyed chrono trigger and are expecting a sequel you may be dissapointed with chrono cross
i have a really hard time envisioning this as a sequelit just seems so far removed from the original chrono trigger the original cast of chrono triggers appearance is rather cameo
however if you dont think of this game as a sequel then you may enjoy it just as much as i did
well heres a more indepth look at this gamegraphics  obviously this is a playstation  game its going to have ps graphics
i thought the graphics were very nice looking
there really wasnt anywhere in the game that made me exclaim those lazy graphical designers
how dare they
although not as good as other ps games in terms of graphics especially later games for obvious reasons most everything was pleasing to the eye and i have no complaintsmusic  music was pretty good
songs fit the emotional content of scenes pretty well and many are pleasant enough to listen to outside of the game times scar comes to mind
the music may not be that memorable but its still pretty nice to listen tocharacters  they really go for quantity over quality here
there are at least  characters available
obviously this high character volume means that no one particularly gets welldeveloped except serge of course
normally this would bother me but the characters were all so unique and colorful in appearance and attitude that i didnt mind as much
i sort of fell into the collectors mindset in that i had alot of fun just trying to get people to join the party
gotta catch em allstory   the story is very enjoyable until the last  of the game
then it just sort of degenerates into an incomprehensible convoluted mess
i felt like the last part of the plot had been sucked into some kind of demensional void and distorted beyond reason
however as i said earlier the story is very enjoyable and understandable before that point definitely enough to make the game worthy of playingbattle system  nothing really wrong with the battle system
it is basically turnbased
each character has a certain number of slots which increase as you get stronger that magic called elements is assigned to
the system is fairly easy to get used to
my only complaint here is that switching elements from one character to another can be rather tediousgameplay  this is my catchall category
some people like me will enjoy the ability to travel between dimensions to the two worlds although it can be confusing at times
others will find this constant backandforth travel to be rather annoying
i have no complaints with other gameplay elements like the controls or menus
overall everythings pretty goodoverall  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
despite the lack of any real character depth and the somewhat convoluted story towards the end i really enjoyed this game
considering its current price its rather cheap at least for now i recommend picking it upamazon sells the greatest hits version of chrono cross
the picture on this site is fake
i was misleaded by the picture and bought the greatest hits version instead
amazon said they will correct the problem with the picture showed
dont buy directly from amazonall copies that amazon sells are the greatest hits version
this version freezes near the end of disc  i warn all of you not to buy from amazon
theyve acknowledged that many people returned their copies because of thisthis review was written on june  chrono cross blends nice graphics a great sound track an involving plot and likeable characters with deep thoughts time travel and hours of fun rpg experience
chrono cross like its predecessor chrono trigger has multiple endings
it also offers a new game plus mode that allows you to use a previous games data and start over from the beginning in order to eventually see all of the endings
this game is great fun with high replay valuei think that this game is a good sequel to the game chrono trigger
i liked the story and i like the cinematic design of the game
its very entertaing seeing how this is my first rpg that i played thats not final fantasy
i think this game has a great potential and should be checked out by rpg lovers
its a very moving game with some hard bosses but its a game to remember
 starsthe plots a little crazy but the gameplay is really fun
i like having the large cast of characters
this game is really fun but not quite as good as chrono trigger
id love it if they made one more and made the series a trilogyit seems like many people loved chrono cross
i must be in the minority when i say that this game isnt nearly as good as chrono trigger
in any case cc was still a wellmade game but it doesnt have the staying power than ct had and still hascc is simply put a beautiful game
the graphical and artistic craftsmanship is incredible and the music is some of squares best
the diversity of places you visit is incredible
however the story was somewhat lacking and the gameplay while novel ultimately is worse than that used in ct  and perhaps the most obvious flaw as a successor to ct was the character designthe story was incredible halfway through the game  i really wanted to know how everything would end up
but what happened at the end was terrible because everything before it was so good
in addition the characters from ct werent really tied into the story  only lucca had a significant role and even her role was not used as well as it could have been
and if you played ct you know that magus goes looking for his sister  well they dont talk about that at all in the game
that was by far the most disappointing part of ccthe character design also suffered greatly
some people felt that  characters was a great idea but i felt it was superficial
true they all have unique graphical designs and each one has his or her own miniquest but almost all of them give nothing to the story or the world of cc
the story centers around serge and kid which is a good thing so it may have been wise to eliminate maybe  of the  characters as playable people
it would have been better to focus on a few characters like in ct where every character was fully developed and relevant to the storythe gameplay was also new
there are no random battles in this game although at points you dont really have a choice to fight  instead of being random the battles are forced upon you
in any case there are no levels and instead you get slightly stronger with each fight
but this system basically degenerates into you getting a lot stronger after beating a boss and then staying at the same strength after fighting normal people
many people thought that the three levels of attack weak medium strong and the power bar were novel developments but theyre not  look at xenogears the same team designed xenogears and cc
the battle system was pulled off better in xenogears than cc in my opinionso most of my review has been a slam of this game
i dont want to leave you with the impression that this was a bad game  by all means it was good
i recommend that you buy it especially if you like rpgs
but dont necessarily expect this game to have the instant feeling of a classic much like its predecessor chrono triggerthe story is very abrupt it didnt flow quite as well as i thought it should have but it didnt detract too much from the game
its a very innovative battle system and its very fun to fight without random battlesthe best part of the game hands down though is the soundtrack
its incredibly captivating and really gets you into the realm of fantasy
play the game go buy the soundtrack youll think the game was a lot better afterwardsthis in my opinion is the best game that square soft has made to date and possibly one of the best games to have ever been made
the game play is incredible graphics are incredible and the story is awesome
another thing the more times that you play the more different endings you can get
let me break it down in terms of overall gameplaygrqaphics replay value sound gameplay bottom line this is one hell of a game i think it is proably better than any game to date
buy itthis is an amazing rpg
i first played chrono trigger on an emulator when i was  and it absolutely hooked me
after hearing the closing credits theme from chrono cross i knew i had to buy itthe game is wonderful it really is
graphics are great sound is just this side of perfect a few of the songs get a little repetative but theyre still awesome and replay value is very highthe main problem its slow
every battle initiates a load screen which takes a long time
there are a great many cut scenes and conversation scenes which cannot be skipped and you will definitely find yourself looking away and just tapping aor x square whatever it is on those controllersstory line is pretty fantastic though and that helps make up for having to watch so much of it
the battle system is pretty good personally prefer chrono triggers and you are given a nice while to get used to your different battle choices as the game progressesincluding informative battles against two reoccuring minibossesokay some quick ratings out of fivegraphics    great but sometimes very hard to tell if something is a wall decoration or a bridgesound    just amazinggameplay    really good but sometimes just tapping a for ten minutesstory   flawlessreplayability    really optimalized by the fact that you can have completely different experiences with different parties  playable charactersoverall   the load screens if only it werent for the load screenseven though im  now i still own this game today this was my first ever game in the series and its excellent in everyway the soundtracks are amazing and if youve played this then youll know how good this game is anyway if you have a fan of the series but has never even heard about this game i highly suggest you get it for them even though its an older one without wireless capabilites and wont work in a nintendo ds you have to have a gameboy color gameboy advance or gameboy advance sp to play this you wont regret buying itthe recipient is pleased with this game
it has the same feeling as the older version
adds more types of pokemon and the abilitiy to breed themwhen pokemon first came out it became a huge phenomenon like the next furby or tickle me elmo
like many of them a lot of people didnt understand why was it so popular
i still dont but i like playing the games so that must be something
so far there have been  tiers to pokemon
there will be a set of  games followed by a new set and so on
so you had red blue and yellow now we have gold silver and crystal
this is for the silver versionwhich could also be the gold one toostory what little story you can actually come up with
basic plot in one sentence kid from small town wants to be pokemon master and collect gym badges and be the best ever
there might be small plot elements throughout the game but this isnt really something that takes you on a wild ridegraphics its game boy color so its not as impressive
looks more like a colored game boy version
we do get pokemon in color and their details are a little more refined but nothing big graphically and they usually are neversoundmusic sound pretty much comes from sound effects from battle moves and a pokemons cry
music is okay nothing instantly hummable but nothing chalkboardlikegameplay the big draw of the pokemon games are the fact that theres so damn many of them
theres  of the creatures and thats not even before getting into the gba ones which add another  or so
you collect them and train them so if you want all the last one like last tiers mew celebi this time requires either a gameshark or going to a nintendo eventthe other draw or setback depending on your circle of friends is the fact that some pokemon are only available in the version you bought and have to trade with someone who owns the other
so for example in the one i bought silver i have weedle but i want a caterpie but silver doesnt have it gold has it
why do i want a caterpie
it evolves into butterfly to me more useful than weedles final form beedrill
ooh speaking of whichcertain pokemon have evolutions
the most common way to get them is if you level them up to a certain level
another is using a stone
example being if you use a leaf stone on a gloom it turns into a vileplume but using new sun stone turns it into new species bellossom
theres even preevolved forms of favorites from last tier
pokemon mascot pikachu for example is form  his first being sickengly cute pichu
other pokemon evolve when you trade with someone else others need a special item and versatile eevee gets  new formssounds like a lot of stuff already and i havent even mentioned time specific pokemon like nocturnal hoothoot who can only be caught at night
or breeding your pokemon with others to get different forms like pichu
theres so much stuff in the game it takes a more fuller review to hit everythingin a way it wouldnt make sense to recommend this since we have the next tier ruby sapphire and emerald out but its still good game nonetheless regardless of the cuteness factorlove this game and it brings back memories from years past
would be five stars if when it arrived the battery in it wasnt dead
once i replaced the battery it worked like a charm and i love itpersonally i thought that pokeacutemon red and blue were the best games ever created for game boy color but gold and silver were pretty good games too
there were some things i didnt like for example i think some of the new pokeacutemon look too much like ordinary objects with faces pineco
 and i liked the original  pokeacutemon better
some of the old areas in kanto such as the safari zone are now closed off
however this game had a lot of advantages toonow there are two worlds to explore kanto and johtomore trainers allows for more battle experiencethe keeping time idea was very clever
when its nighttime in the real world its nighttime in the pokeacutemon world too
there are certain pokeacutemon you can only catch during the day as well as ones you can only catch at night
it even keeps track of daylight savings time and the day
certain events only happen and certain pokeacutemon only come out on certain days of the weekapricorns
bring them to kurt for new types of pokeacuteballsmore pokeacutemon to catch presents more of a challengenew attacksdark and steel pokeacutemontrade pokeacutemon with all previous versions of the game as well as crystal versionbreed pokeacutemon
carry around eggs to hatch into baby pokeacutemonplay this game pokeacutemon masters if you liked the other ones and want a new one
if youre a new trainer i would recommend playing red and blue first they are the best ones anywayit is a great game fun and time absorbing
and the cartridge was in perfect condition
but yellow was still bettermy was this game great
plus i have enteiraikou and suicune as well
do you want to know how i got them
first you must have  gold version and  silver version
then use  of the versions and get all  badges
go to new bark town after and get the master ball
then make your pokemon hold the master ball and do a link with the pokemon that is holding the master ball
and last look for any of those dogs and catch with the master ball
to get them all i reapeted the instructions i showed you  times
i hope this helps so go buy this game nowto tell the truth im not really a great pokemon fan
ive played pokemon yellow and to be frank it was really boring
you catch pokemon collect badges and battle trainers all around pokemon world
i wasnt really going to buy pokemon sliver but my friend pestered me day and night to get it and eventually i bought itso whats new in this lastest pokemon gamewhen i started the game i was amazed by the improved graphics that it had
the graphics looked fantastic on gameboy color
apart from that there is also an internal time system as you will play the game in real timewhen you begin the game you will be asked to enter in the day and time
this new feature actually makes the game much more interesting than the previous versions as you have to actually play the game at night in the morning and play it on certain days
take for example in the game there is a quotbugcatchingquot competition held every saturday and if you dont play pokemon sliver on saturday you will miss the competiton
with the real time feature you will have to play your game during the day and night to catch different kinds of pokemon
for example if i was at a particular spot during the day i would catch a rattata
however at night at the same spot i would catch a hoothoot
somehow this makes the game rather tedious than fun
there is even a lottery held on a particular day the gameplay is still basically the same boring quot catch pokemon fight and winquot concept
with a new and really improved pokedex and an improved inventory system thanks to the new feature the pokegear helps you to sort your pokemon and items collected more efficently than in the previous versions of the pokemon games red yellow and blue 
new features of pokemon sliver also includes a cell phone and a radioof course there are new pokemon to catch
there are  pokemon to trade and catch
and to get even more new pokemon you even have to breed you pokemon
for example if i have two pikachus of opposite sex and i breed them i should get an egg that will hatch into a new pokemon
and instead of having to fish and walk through grass patches to get your pokemon i would have to use new moves such as quotheadbuttquot to knock wild pokemon out of trees in order to catch them
and of course you have to trade with friends who has pokemon gold to get certain monsters that you do not have in pokemon sliverand vice versapokemon sliver also includes a mystery gift feature that allows you to get a quotgiftquot from your friend
you can also print pokemon stickers too that is if you have the gameboy printerwith an entirely new area to explore new pokemons to catch and of course the real time feature pokemon sliver is one of the best sequels that i have ever played although tedious its storyline keeps you goingthis game is best played on gameboy color
this game supports the infrared device found on gameboy color
other gameboy hardware you may need is a link cable and a printer although the printer is not essientialif you plan to buy pokemon gold the features that ive described above is identical to the features in pokemon goldlet me just state at the outset here that i am a year old engineer who has been playing and loving electronic video games since he stuck a quarter into a galaxian machine in   i first kinda got interested in pokemon after my young kids fell in love with the tv series
after watching umpteen episodes with them i got interested in the different types of pokemon and how they compared to each other
i decided to give the silver version a shot having never played any of the previous red blue or yellow versionsi was hooked immediately
the plot is easy to follow without getting boring and there are plenty of little side quests to make things interesting
you can start out with your choice of totodile my pick cyndaquil or chikorita
the level of difficulty of the game will be determined by your starting choice
the game has two basic goals  acquire all gym badges and defeat the pokemon league while fighting off your rival and team rocket and  collect all  pokemon
most of the pokemon are fairly easy to find and catch some are pretty hard and there are a few that are almost impossible to catch
but they can all be caught with a little time and patience
some are only available by trading with other versions of the game and some are quotbabyquot pokemon that can only be obtained by breeding two adult pokemon together
and of course there are the two quotsuperrarequot pokemon mew and celebi which can realistically only be obtained through a game shark or other similar devicethat leads me to my one and only gripe about the game
if it were possible to obtain all  pokemon no matter how difficult without having to resort to things like the game shark i would have happily given this review  stars
i also have kind of a problem with the fact that you have to have access to more than one version of the game to get all the pokemon
i know nintendo talks about how much fun trading is and all but to me it just seems like a gimmick to sell more copies of the game
i know several kids who have purchased both silver and gold versions becuase of this
not everyone has easy access to trading partnerssince i bought silver i have also played through a copy of pokemon red
if you have only played red blue or yellow let me assure you that silver and gold is a major improvement
the new versions eliminate many of the more irritating deficiencies of the old version with an improved backpack for item storage and a new device that lets you tell instantly where you are without having to carry a town map in the backpack
backpack space will definitely be at a premium so anything that clears up space is a positive featureafter having played through silver and collected all  pokemon yes i actually purchased a game shark i have not played it again
why
because after all the time and trouble i went through to collect all the pokemon i just cant bring myself to erase them all
a great improvement for the next pokemon would be to allow multiple saves on the cartridge
for those who are interested my quotdream teamquot that i used to beat the game were  feraligatr pidgeot magneton kadabra magmar and dragoniteoverall this is an awesome game
if you enjoy rpg games such as final fantasy then you will enjoy this and the other titles in the pokemon series
enjoypokemon gold and silver are great new expansions to the world of pokemon the hit television show trading card game and nintendo game
customers note to look at pokemon crystal as well since there are more features there such as the famous female characteryou no longer play ash but a new character by your name
you journey through johto to become a pokemon master as usual
you also get to go to another continent which is basically the same as where red blue and yellow took place onthis makes a great gift or a great addition to your game boy collection especially if you are a pokemon fanpros a whole new world new character bank daynight effects time and day of the week effects pokemon coming out during daynight more advanced than pokemon red and bluecons pokemon crystal is more worth getting than gold or silver not much has changed graphic wiseexcept colorrecommended guide versus adventure guide for pokemon gold  silverremember destruction derby
it was an unexpected hit and classic for the ps years ago where you got to smash up cars for no reason other than for good ol fun
demolition racer was a game that would come out a few years later for the ps with basically the same premise and was just as fun
now enter demolition racer no exit for the dreamcast an insanely fun for the most part racer that was a nice addition to the dcs overbloated racing library
the premise stays the same smash up other cars as much as you can while trying to keep your car from getting junked
you can either race or enter the demolition league where you can participate in all kinds of other races like chicken last man standing and no exit which has you and a bunch of other cars confined in a small arena where the last car functioning wins
controls are tight and solid the sound effects are half decent along with a soundtrack featuring fear factory and some lesser known bands but the graphics seem a little blocky almost nish and dont take advantage of the dcs graphics horsepower engine
all in all demolition racer no exit is a pretty good game that any dc owner will enjoyi got this game because of the reviews it got its a dreamcast game and its a smashemup
like the product review says the cars arent that notable but are fun to drive
idk why they didnt make the cars more detailed but then again were gonna crash them up the real con for me is that this is only a player game
why
if forsaken and slave zero can be  player why not thisover all this is still a fun game but it does not get my i highly recommended ratingi will be brief this game is fun if you ever played the old arcade game demolition derby remember the game with the wrenches and oil slicks and the undressing hottie anyway this game has a camera angle that lets me relive one of my alltime favorite video games
the amount of things there are to unlock is great including a car soccer game that is fun for two players only
the amount of customization is also sweet
if you like the genre and arent obsessed with accurate racing pyshics you will have a good time with this onethis game is so cool
the graphics are great there are more skaters and you can create your own skater and skateparkplus two player mode is more fun than in tony hawk but something is missing
there was something about tony hawk  that didnt happen in this game
i didnt get very addicted to this game the way i got addicted to the last one
in tony hawk  i would sit down and play it for hours
in this i got bored after about  minutes
maybe its the levels
they dont seem as good as the ones in tony hawk  or maybe it is the carear mode and how it is alot harder in this gameeven so tony hawk  is a must buyi like this game so much but i think tony hawk pro skater  for xbox will be better
must buy
if you a skateboarding fan you should this game or any tony hawk gamesthe game is greatu think  was good  is so much better
you can create skaterspark createand more of a challagebuy itforgive me if i sound too enthusiastic but i love this game
it is just plain fun
what kid or adult
has not dreamed of being able to climb walls like spiderman or shoot web and swing from building to building
you get to do all this and more in this game
it comes complete with  levels of play including kid level
the graphics are very good and interspersed with comic pages
game onfirst when i heard about spiderman  i could not wait to get it
now that i have it i dont think it is perfect
this game is terrible when compared to other games   first the graphics of spiderman was very good except some levels where you cant see spiderman because he is far away from the viewbut the sound is below average for n standards
the music does a good job for fitting the mood but the quality is bad
n has a list of about  games with cdquality sound and a list of  games with surround and dolby surround sound
spiderman on the other hand is very quiet and cannot get much louder
buy this game if you like a red cartridge and action but dont care about sound quality but rent this game if you are used to games like perfect dark
all in all spiderman is a great game but when compared to top n games it is terriblethis was the d spiderman game that redefined how to faithfully translate comic books to the video game medium
you play as peter parkerspiderman framed for a crime you didnt commit
youll webswing through the city crawl through sewers bust up secret labs and take on a host of your most deadly adversaries
while the camera and controls werent perfect this was the first time you really felt like you were playing as spiderman instead of some generic platforming character with spiderman graphics
the wall crawling looks and feels right and there are multiple uses for your webbing
its the game every spiderman game since has built fromthe n port is pretty accurate to the playstation original in terms of raw gameplay but it sacrifices some of the presentation
notably the fmv cutscenes have been replaced with slide shows of stills from the fmv with text dialogue
it still gets the story across pretty well but loses some of the character that comes from voice acting and animation
elsewhere you lose the vocals to the spiderman theme from the start screen and also an extra costume in the unlockables sectionif you only had an n this was still a great purchase
but if you had a playstation that is definitely the better version to geti got this game back in  and i thought it was the best game on the market
and do you know what
i now think only two other games out marvel it spyro year of the dragon and tony hawk   tony hawk  was a game not ment for its time
its like  leagues under the sea it was a book about the future and now we can go  leagues under
tony hawk has preesed the limits for tony hawk more than you notice
when my friend told me that tony hawk  was out for playstation i went to his house and i thought the console would explode
in this game you can grind ollie do lip tricks flip tricks and specials that will blow your mind
the characters are way cool
there are secret characters too such as spiderman officer dick and many others
but if you like these games for the secret characters then deffenetly play thps 
the levels are totaly cool especially the bull ring mexico there if you run over the green poop made by the bull you get  dollars each time
just a hint  the only reason i rate this   stars is the graphics though
other than that everything is  babythis game in every way is twice as good as the first
however if you own the first one you wont spend hours upon hours trying to get a high score anymore
the novelty wears off
still a great edition in your library especially if you never owned the first one but it wont suck up as much timeif you liked the first game youll like this one
i dont feel much changed between  and  but thats not a bad thing at all
fun all aroundthis game may have overdone it
the second to this series finds tony a bit older and wiser
you now have to perform harder tricks to gat paid so you can pay for better stats and better equipment and only after you earn a certain amount then you can proceed to other levels
this becomes bothersome
but if that wasnt enough now you can learn new tricksafter paying for them which you can perform after peak performances and hitting the correct combo buttons
most times after playing you want to take a nap
you almost long for the days when you just skated or died
i believe the next tony hawk game may be set up where tony becomes retired and as a new recruit you have to fight crime with your new batmobile and skateboard
thats of course only if you make enough money to open those levels upif this game didnt have the name quottony hawks pro skaterquot on it i probably would have confused this for another skateboarding game
the game has almost no similarites to the first
instead of tapes you get money with double the objectives and bigger levels
you have a whole bunch of different tricks and you have to buy stats instead of just earn them and you can buy new tricks
this game also has an create a player mode and a skate park editorwhich i am a very big fan of so you can make your own skate parks and play and edit premade parks
the thing about this game is even though its bigger and there are more tricks and its easier to do combos its just not as fun
a big contribution to this is the disappointing soundtrack
the only good songs on it are the first two blood brothers by papa roach and anthrax with public enemy in bring the noise
the punk is all missing
it has been replaced with rap which any skater is plain out against
another thing is that while the beginning parks are bigger they stay the same size through the whole game
the game also asks you to do impossible tasks like grind rails you cant even find and get  points in two minutes in a level where it takes  seconds to get to the halfpipephiladelphia
another thing is some of the graphics
there is a lot of drawin especially on the narrow courses and the characters look welldirty in appearance
its kind of funny to look at them though
but despite of all this the games still fun
i dont know why i should be giving this two stars but knowing that its tony hawks pro skater i get the good ol feeling
buy it i guessim glad to see that there is more of a challenge to this game than the previous
through repetative playing the game could be completed in next to no time
the makers have altered this by making  tapes available on each track
all the same characters from the first are still here so you will still be able to use your favourite
one excellant new feature that has been added is the fact that you can design your own skate park to make it best suit your finely refined skillsi love games where you have to plan where you get to play quotgodquot and where you get to watch the tiny choices play out in grand ways
quotthe simsquot allows you to do all three
ok i dont play fair i use a cheat code to get more money for my sims but my goal is to have fun and more money can equal more fun at least in this game
the choices in clothes and careers are a bit limited they improve that in expansions and you can find things online but its difficult for macs
what i really like is that i can build my own homes and try and make human connections
sometimes the game is a bit boring but you can let the sims live on their own you may not like what they do but ive noticed that if you quottrainquot them long enough they do fine but probably wont improve their jobs or friendships much
there is some glitch that wiped out my upstairs of one home  suddenly my sims cant use their stairs at all so the childrens rooms are useless
if anyone knows what might be wrong please let me know ive add quotlivin largequot and quothot datequot but still cant use that stairsthe main purpose of an expansion is defined as quotadd new and interesting features to the original version which will in turn bring people back to the gamequotwell after i stopped playing pharaoh for a while just due to playing it some much i needed to regain my life back i bought cleopatra with the thought of playing pharaoh again
it worked
cleo adds some really neat buildings i love the zoo plus a lot of hard missions
the new monuments are worth the price of admission with a built tome you can actually see inside
thus the need of the new lamp makers a great expansion for the true pharaoh fana sequel to earth   a must have for all fans of scifi action gamesi havent made it through the game yet although as far as i have played it i did enjoy it
maybe i will be able to finish it maybe not
if i dont i still had fun playing it as long as i did
since i didnt play all the way through though is why i cant give it  stars
if it was a  star game something would have made me want to keep pressing forward until i had gone all the way throughbough this game circa  it is now  and i am still playing this game
too bad video game companies do not still make city builders of this caliber such as pharaoh caesar etc
that was the highlight of gaming for mei had a friend who had this game a few years back  i found it on amazon cheap and i had to get it
i got the game in  days
i still like playing itim an avid starcraft fan looking to stop my starcraft addiction
this game was recommended to me by one of my brothers
the graphics are excellent the playability kind of tough
i like to notion of participating in a battle on a grand scale
game play is tough but if you learn the nuances and join a team and play with them on a regular basis it can be a very fun gameas a major fan of the original tribes i was really excited to pick up tribes  what could be better than an update of one of my favorite games with better graphics and more optionsthat said i had a very difficult time getting into it
although the graphics were definitely better and the levels much more interesting i found the new interface much less intuitive than the original
in addition it crashed fairly regularly and ran pretty slow at times on my machine athlon  and geforce 
after a couple dozen online games i still couldnt get into it so i put it away for a whilerecently i began a game project using the torque engine which stems from the tribes  code base so i decided to start playing it again
i had picked up a geforce  and had a faster internet connection
it looks like the game is now much more stable ive been playing it almost every night for a couple of weeks without a single crash and it runs at acceptable speeds
now that most of the distractions are gone ive finally been able to get into it and i have to say that its now a worthy successortribes  is possibly the best teambased shooter currently available
if youve got a decent system and like other teambased shooters you should definitely check it out especially at its current pricetribes  is a game that can be very addicting and fun if youget over the massive learning curve for multiplayer
i love in thisgame   the downside of this game is that it does not surpass its predecessor
tribes  doent even live up to its hype
there really is no major improvement between tribes  and   and lastly make sure that you have a powerful computer to run this game
i say minimum requirements in my opinion are  mhz and any geforce  chipthis game tribes  if far better than the original
unfortunately you need a powerful pc to run it at decent frameratesif youve played the original than the interface should be quite familiar and easy to get into
what differs is the single player
the original only had training
t is virtually the same thing
there are  campaign maps which are essentially training and the ability to play against bots
the problem with the bots is the fact that they can range from incredibly smart to incredibly stupid
if you like bot matches get quake  or unreal tournamentonlinewise this game is the champion
it is fun but it still boils down to one thing  you need a powerful pc
when the screen is loaded with explosions flying equipment and players your system will be put to the test
slowdown is almost inevitable unless youve got a good mb video cardpros better than the original easy to get into addictivecons high system requirementspitiful single player broadband internet connection almost a musthavethis game has all the works on it
it has  new weapons
new vehicles including ground vehicles
and it has lots of ultimate graphics action
but there is only one thing for dfx users to watch forif your wondering voodoo has just been bought out by a company called nvideo inc and the reason i say this is because of complaints of dfx not working and causing major bugs making the game very difficult to use
your warranties are useless now
but that doesent mean you cant fight for a exchange
just make sure you have a reciept avalible so you can exchange the card for a different onei reccomend hercules by gullimont
so please dont buy the dfx products because of this bought out buisness
i reccoment the hercules because of its major compatibility and way better graphics than a  meg card can do
also you need to have a mhz or higher computor with atleast at the minimum  megs of sd ram
rd is way better but way to expensive
i give this  stars because its not perfect but very entertainingfeatures this game features pretty nice graphics realistic damage and easy controls
there are hundreds of maps to choose from to play in as well as dozens of great weapons
it is an extremely addicting mutliplayer game that sharpens your reflexes aim awareness and much morecomments this game is really fun and addicting
its a great way to spend time with your friends believe it or notkilling each other
if you have k then i suggest that you do not buy this game
only people with dsl lan or higher should play because then you will lag and your gameplay will be spoiled
i admit this game can get tiring frustrating and you may begin to get bored with it but the majority of people are in love with it and continue to play for years to come
for best performance and gameplay you need at least dsl and a very decent fast computer
its a great gamehalflife counterstrike is a very basic but fun loving that can appeal to anyone whos ready to shoot a few people
cs although not the most advanced fps is a great shooter in its own right
the game is about two diffrent sides one counterterrorists the other terrorists
both teams go up against each to other to do various missions
the missions consist of planting bombs getting vips out of trouble and saving hostages
the other way that you can win are killing the opposing force while still having living teamates or having youself live
although there are only a few specified missions and it seems very basic trust me the game will keep you playing for days and dayscs consists of real weapons and variety of them
the great thing about these weapons are that the sounds are actually taken from the weapons giving you a real time feel of each and every weapon
there are a variety of pistols shotguns sub machine guns assualt or sniper rifles and machine guns
of course however your not going to be able to buy all these weapons right from the get go
you must win rounds kill people or attempt to rescue hostages to get money
if you dont you will lose money making it harder to win because now you have less money to spend on guns
dont think that you can only spend that money on guns though try spending it on grenades helmets to protect from from headshots kevlars which are body armor primary ammo your top gun ammo secondary ammo your pistol ammo and other accesories like defuser kits and night visioncs has a basic setup that works
when your put into the game you will start off with a pistol they are diffrent for terrorists and counter terrorists a knife and a radio for radio commands
radio commands can tell your partners everything from if you need backup to the enemy is spotted to get in position and even saying cover me
when you start off the basic amount of money is  to spend on a new pistol grenades and other accesories
in the game you have options to put weapons and such in each with a specific reason
you can hold a primary weapon optional a pistoloptional a knife mandatory a grenade optional and one accesory which is optional kevlars and helmets dont count
the games graphics are semi par
there not excellent but not horrible
there something youd expect from the late s
they do get better depending on how good your graphics card is
the speed of the bame is great
however if you have a slow computer you should stick to training mode until your computer is faster
the great thing about the speed is that if you lag latency is not fast then its your problem not anyone elses
if you dont lag youll be fine
beware though some servers lag and make a whole game lagall in all a great game filled with basic shoot em up fun
it gets even more fun when you have plenty of friends to play with or if you have joined a clan and you play with your clan
my adivce is definitly look into the game if your skeptical about if your not go out there and buy iti dislike action games immensely unless they are multiplayer
i also dislike halflife and the halflife engine aswell
i actually bought halflife the day it came out but was unable to finish it due to the amount of boredom it drove me to
the action games which involve strategy such as tribes or rainbow six are the ones i love
so when i heard a rogue spear type mod was taking the online gaming community by storm i was quite pleased
learning it was based on the halflife engine i was skeptical
upon installing the mod and running it first i hated it
i found it a bit unrealistic despite its premise
however i kept going back to it to get better and better
now i am the leader of my own clan  months later
my conclusion is this game is incredibly addictive
first of all dont buy the retail version of this game
purchase halflife for cheaper and then download the counter strike mod
you can also download team fortress classic and other mods
not only will you get more but you will pay less
the tactical and strategic enjoyment of this game is incredible
quite addictive and a lot of fun
realistic weapons this multiplayer game is actually more fun than rogue spear
the design of the weapons is quite good too
unfortunately this game is really aging as its based on a  year old engine
i am afraid the community will start dimisihing so you are better off getting this peice of gaming goodness quicklyfirst of all dont get me wrong this is one of the best modgames ever
but the mods included on the game can all be downloaded free from the internet
so what do you want to sacrifice
 smackers or some time downloading onlinewell this was my st fps game that i ever played
man was this game addicting
i remembering playing it for  hours a day and i still couldnt stop playing it
there wasnt any real goal to do it was just for fun and to see how many times you can kill or get killed
usually i get killed more often than kill others so my ratio was way off
lolthis game had so many maps but i would only play certain maps because they were the most popular and easiest to move around
dust dust etcthe guns had plenty of selections to choose from but people had their favs as i did to use
i would love to pick the mp or awpthe music was so so
no one really cared for the music as many times i wouldnt listen to it and plug on headphones to listen to my own music
but it was a disadvantage as i loss the audio clues if someone was close to me or what notback then i didnt have a powerful computer
i had a piece of crap actually
lol but later i got a little bit more powerful one for processor but it still ran this game like crap
i remember updating my ram video card and anything i could just to make this game run better
i changed out the costumes for the characters guns and anything i could just to make it smooth
man this game was a hassle to deal with
also if youre on dial up connection forget about it
but today we dont need to worry about that but back then dslcable wasnt that in and it was so expensive too
not like todaythe only reason why i give this  stars instead of  stars was because of the damn hackers
this game had sooo many of them that cheated their way to high kill level
the only way to fight a hacker is you hacked yourself too
i had to get him before he got me
man that was terrible way of playing but i remember it and hated it
so this game was in no way perfect from the start
also so the forever updatesthis game is the best multiplayer tactical fps of all timevery realsitic but dont lisiten to the people who say you cant use a kmodem for performance it runs fine just a little jerkysoi reccomend a pentiummhrz geforced highquality sound cardcable or dslmbramaboutit that isand for pentiummhrz i reccomend geforceor radeoni reccomend this gamewith all the racing games in the world the ones that are usually on the top of fan lists are the ones developed by sega legend yu suzuki
with excellent racing titles like daytona usa under his belt it was only logical that his latest racing simulator would be nothing short of magnificent
with three racing styles and online play things were looking bright
did he succeed
wellon one hand this is one of the finest looking games on the dreamcast even though the revolutionary triple screen arcade view had to be dropped due to tv screen limitations and to a lesser extent hardware limitations
with no popup drawin or slowdown whatsoever the game runs at a smooth  frames per second and never slows down
the downside is you always feel like you are driving slower than the speedometer says
if it says  it only feels like  another bad part is that there is no damage modeling
even if you hit a wall at  mph your car bounces right off looking like it came straight from the showroomon the other hand this is by far the most difficult racing game i have ever played
and i have played a lot of them
unlike most racing games where your car is much faster than the competitions your rivals here go about the same speed so passing is a matter of luck not skill
i guess suzukisan wanted the most realistic competition on the market but this is ridiculousanother letdown is the sound
with daytona the music was so bad it was good
that is not the case here
the songs themselves arent really bad but there are only three of them and theyre short so they repeat often especially during endurance racesand that announcer oh man
that should explain it right therethere are also online races but you dont actually race other people you just race their ghosts from previous runsyou can also pick any view you want as long as its in the one spot behind the wheeloverall this is a decent game
you might want to pick is up if you are a rabid racing fan or just want to drive a ferarri for less than this costs
every one else beware
cds shatter when you break themsome people think that videogames are just entertainment
not me
like some people you know who you are ive been searching for something more than just a good driving game
ive been searching for a driving simulation
and not just any driving simulation
i seek perfection
gran turismo was great so was gran turismo  but they did have flaws
unfortunately the greatest strength of ferrari f is the greatest weakness of gran turismolet me start by saying that ferrari f has great graphics and nice controls
its music is annoying but you can turn it off
the major flaw in the game is that the sense of speed is wrong
you are going  miles per hour and you feel like youre going  for this reason it is nearly impossible to make the sharp turns without flying off the track due to the incredibly realistic physics
and to make matters worse the ai of other cars is completely unforgiving
screw up once and you will lose
not exactly fun
but forget that
i know a lot of people just enjoyed driving around the track by their lonesome
but whythis game features the greatest selection of tracks of any racing sim ever
laguna seca long beach nuremburgring hope i spelled that right and of course the almighty monza
these tracks and many more are represented perfectly
if only the game had a correct sense of speed and was a bit easier it would be the greatest racing sim ever
and if only gran turismo  featured all the tracks in this game it would no flaws at all
as it is this is a great but flawed game and gran turismo will never be the driving simulation until it has the awesome real world track to back it upoh well
perhaps someday someone will make a game with the graphics the controls and the tracks i craveturok  is a good game no doubt but it could have binbetterthe weapons are what got me to give this a  starsthe weapons kick ass
the characters are good tothis one also got me confused in the storyin the beggining was that turok who died int that housecause i keep remebering turok as some old native americanin the first
well anyways the game is good but not awsomethe cut scene have bin inprovedthe story is acctualy pretty decent
the part with the kid turning in to oblivion was pretty cool
the games action is alright
the violence is still top notch like the other if you want a really good sequal to a game try this game outbut if you want a really good sequal try turokseeds of evilnow thats a really good sequalso give this game a try if you wantturok  was the last of the series to be released on n and arrived as the system was fading out
it wasnt groundbreaking like the original and didnt have the massive hype backing it like seeds of evil
however it was still a good shooter that did justice to one of the ns exclusive franchisesim not sure how the story got to this point but theres no dinosaurs now and the series has traded tropical jungles for the urban jungle
level design is solid with good artistic detail
enemies are also very distinctive with slick animations
lots of ambient music and speech during the cutscenes though i was a bit disappointed with the gun noises which sound a little softone thing thats definitely different in terms of gameplay is the numerous checkpoints now which break up massive levels into nice digestable chunks
perfect for someone who wants to play for a bit but doesnt have a hour chunk of time to drop in one sitting
the levels are more linear but it feels like youre actually making progress
framerate dips every so often but is much better than seeds of evil
and theres a fairly decent multiplayer mode in the package to play withthe gameplay isnt as deep as something like goldeneye but its not the mindless fragfest of quake either
if youre still looking for some n shooters to play with turok  is worth checking outi just got my playstation  last week and ive been renting as many games as i could get my hands on
ridge racer v was the best game ive played for the ps so far
i really enjoyed this game and i think im gonna buy it
i gave it only four stars though cuz its not a great game but it is fun
im not really a racing game fan but i liked this game
the announcers actually kind of funny in a stupid sort of way especially when he mispronounces quotcomfortquot the controls arent that bad although ive never played gran turismo so ive got nothing to compare with
i got the hang of it by the second day
sliding around the corners gets annoying sometimes as you have to adjust to each cars individual handling abilities
this game brought me into the racing genre and now i too am awaiting the release of gran turismo  in junethis is one of the first games i got with my system
it has been a lot of fun but you end up running a lot of the same tracks over and over
the graphics are great in one player mode put the frame rate goes down in two player modethat is disappointing
recommended otherwise wait a few months for gt to be releasedthat should be even betteri purchased ridge racer v on the launch day of the playstation  although this is a nice game it is not groundbreaking as was the original ridge racer when it was introduced on the playstation  years agographically ricge racer v blows away any racing game you have ever seen
the levels are well designed but are not a far stretch from the original series
the frame rate is easily  frames per second
the sheer sense of speed is uncanny in this gameas far as gameplay goes i thought this game was unusually hard
i have not won in the grand prix mode yet after several hours of play and i am a more experienced game player in this series of games as i have owned all of the ridge racer games in this series so far
this may appeal to some but after playing this game in two hour stints and not winning i tend to get burnt out
there are many reasons to keep playing though such as unlocking cars and tracks
there are supposed to be  tracks in alli have only seen as far as the music goes its you standard techno fare
some of it works well some of it is so bad that you want to hit the mute button on your tvbottomline ridge racer v is a good game
its pleasing to the eye and the frame rate is very fast
the gameplay is hard and is not for the average gamer
if you are looking for a great racing experience you may be better off waiting for gran turismo  which should arrive in januaryif you are a fan of the ridge racer series you may want to get this others may want to wait for a better gameits good fun racing and a change from some of they hyper real racing environments
a really nice video game in the truest sense of the wordtreat yourselfthis is not a game that promises to change the way you spend your life nor is it the greatest visuals graphics etc
but straight forward entertainment though i have to point out that the graphics are much nicer than many other games
this will not hurt your eyes i promise
have funby now everyone knows the story behind the making of this game
castlevania dracula x was released in  for the super nes
it was basically a censored version of the same game released in  in japan for the pc engine aka turbo graphix 
its still pretty good as far as castlevania games go but because of the many changes konami made it caused quite an uproar and debate
again the story behind this game has been covered by other reviewers so i will just go into the pros and cons of this version of dracula xthe pros compared to the pc engine version the graphics have been updated and look better
in some areas they are more crisp and sharp so it was nice to look at as you scrolled through the stages
the controls are spot on and the sound effects are typical for a castlevania game
there are stages everywhere so there is incentive to see if you can find the right path to see them all
like all castlevania games before it you can write down the password and continue where you left off if you stopped to take a breakthe cons konami made a lot of changes to the game that impacted it in most ways
some were done because of space constraints while others were a case of censorship to keep in tune with nintendos family friendly policy
so that means not all of the stages made it in and the bonus content found on the japanese version was cut as well
the quality of the music took a big hit so it doesnt sound as good when playing it on the pc engineif the japanese version never existed this game would have been met with more of a warm reception and obviously had better reviews
but the overwhelming changes made to it for the usmexicoeurope and south america regions were too much to ignore
its still a good game to play and is hard to track down nowadays
so if you have yet to play this game you could try a couple of options pick up dracula x chronicles for the psp which has this game and symphony of the night in all its glory see if you can get a used copy of this snes title or download this title for the wii from the virtual console service as they have the pc engine version available for  points in short if you like old school castlevania this will most likely appeal to you
if youre looking for a worthy replacement for the one of two actually castlevania games unreleased in america dont look here
that said i feel this game does a very commendable job with mb of memory to work withhooray for misinformation eh
lets clear up a few things first and then get on to detailscastlevania dracula x is spotted by its cover art identical to that on the pcengine thats the japanese pcengine super cdrom system or tg as necs system was known elsewhere but this reuse seems more like a coverup of the fact that konami didnt have a cdrom system to release the true dracula x on in  that said a super nintendo box allows them to fit a larger picture on than the original pcengine games cdrom case allowedso it works out
from here out the title im reviewing will be referred to as dx the japanese version of this game as dxx and the pcengine title as simply pce dxnow this american version is inferior in a couple ways to the japanese super famicom equivalent richter your character dies in a swirl of something odd and bluish in dx snesin dracula xx we actually see blood
im not a big one for gore but nintendos magical bloodtosweat potion has always made me uneasy
the second difference is that of the start animation in dxx two snazzy silver crosses appear behind beautiful red kanji to the accompaniment of double metallic thumps not a bad effect at all while the american title the one youre perhaps thinking about buying has a quite slow and somewhat ugly scaling effect the word dracula appears suddenly and shrinks to normal size while an x is zapped onscreen zorro style to the sound of two slashes
its not as good looking as youd think but its not horrible
the final difference is that of censorship as another reviewer mentioned dxx has an actual cross to throw around just like the japanese pce dx while dracula x for the super nintendo has the infamous boomerang
a small point truly seeing as the boomerang isnt that bad lookingonto the game
this is indeed a hard game and it plays more like the original castlevania than a storybased game like dracula x pcengine was
though your basic premise remains unchangedsave the girlstheres a lot less space to do it and as a result even with the better platform the overall amount of detail suffersif youre looking for a pce dx replacement dont come here
dracula x for the pcengine has background details galorethat single skeleton in a chair that turns to dust when you touch him the bell hunchbacks and money fall out of the hidden staircase right before draculathose are gone here along with the alternate routesinstead we have some levels that are new and thats not always a good thingthe platforms in the very first level may be used to show off some of the original movement glitches pce dx hid quite well and some that borrow from other games
some levels are quite fun indeedthe falling bridge section is easily recognized by fans of super cv  and many spots are taken directly from castlevania bloodlines such as the room with only a staircase leading up to the last part of the castlethis game features one of the best levels in castlevania historyhidden level 
the atlantis shrine from bloodlines sits in the background as water spirits and other monsters appear in a setting much more suited to them than their original placement in pce dx for some reason the water spirits were in a clock tower there
following the theme from bloodlines you must beat rising water levelsthe oftenreviled dracula fight is among the most innovative ive seen but its terribly longa lot of new graphics reside in this cart and as such it is certainly not a weak remix
even those that appeared before are often given new locales the most unchanged fight is that of the werewolf
shaft is gone and draculas second form is differentthough there is less variety overall many of the graphic designs are much more beautiful than the pcengine titles
sound is still greatindeed the music is among the best for the super nintendo though not on the absolute top tier as the samples used dont quite hit notes as smoothly as a game like plok can make themthis is far from the worst cv game ever made
in fact its one of the bestif you have the patience for itthats right
where else are you gonna get this combination of cool snes bit riffs on bassguitar and bizarre monsters
this game also has some of the coolest graphics on an snes game
the graphics and unique music is what really makes this game crunchy guitars roaring and lots of creatures
the story line is ok nothing ground shattering the gameplay is in some ways frustrating
castlevania bloodlines and of course super castlevania  are probably the best castlevania games since they had superior controlsgameplay
although this game is still a great milestone in the castlevania series and is in some ways is one of my favoritesthe game is quite fun
its like a chillout game where you can play and have fun and enjoy the cool music graphics and pretty fireworks   trying to get as many chains of fireworks as possible can be a challenge if you choose to do so
enjoyfantavision for the ps is a puzzle game where you get to create your own fireworks show
you do this by capturing the rockets in midair and then detonating the colored  combinations
you can have up to three combinations such as three orange three blue and three yellows
the more combinations you detonate the higher your score and the better the fireworks explosions
and that is what is all about
the graphics are colorful
the screen will pan through several backdrops such as a cityscapes space stations and other interesting places to put on a fireworks show
the particle effects look cool they really look like actual fireworks in the sky
the music consists of new age pop jazz and light rock which fits into the mood of a show
the sound effects are also good but simplistic
if you know what fireworks sound like then this is what it is in the game as well
the controls are very easy to learn
you use your analog stick to aim then the controller buttons to capture and detonate the fireworks it only takes a few seconds to learn
there is an ingame tutorialwhich clearly explains everything if you dont understand the gameit excels in the novalty part of fireworks into a playable game that is easy to get into
although frantic at times the game play is still fun
it is also one of the most unique puzzle games available for the ps system but it also happens to be one of the shortest puzzle game for the ps or possibly any system
it takes me about  minutes to finish even in the hardest difficulty
once you finish you can replay the fireworks shows you created and view it from multiple camera angles and special effects
you will also unlock a few challange modes but other than that the game has very little replay value
fanatavision is just begging for extra levels
and shame on its creators for making it so short with only nine  levels of gameplay
this fact alone ruins its potential to be one of the best puzzle games to come along since tetrisprosvery unique gameplayexcellent graphicsexcellent sound effectsexcellent musicexcellent controlsexcellent tutorialbeautiful fireworksfun for all agesconssuper short gamevoice acting sucksstrange cutsceneslittle unlockables here is the review this game has fantastic graphics and sound which does get old but still keeps you involved
the gameplay is simple enough but you can continually get better unfortunately button mashers fare just as well too
also the menu layout and control is freaky  plus black and white pictures of  year olds make you go huh
all in all this is a great game that despite its flaws makes for an extraodinary experiencethe critics thrashed it
the people who bought thinking it was tetris hate it
since i tend to like odd items that nobody else likes starship troopers double team lunar phantasy star this was one of those games where i took the reviews quite lightly
in all honesty if i bought the ps when it was released this was one of the games that i would have boughti admit i am horrible with puzzle games
my tetris skills arent the best i cant pass zelda on the gameboy and well you get the idea
in terms of this game it will take me a while to get a hang of it
my girlfriend on the other hand needed  tries to get past level   i have yet to get there
and yes i do know that i am patheticthe graphics are pretty neat
of the games and demos ive seen i havent been disappointed with the pss graphics
the explosions are really cool and when you chain the fireworks into a  or more chain its just awesome
oh did i mention that it looks like it takes place in seattle
in the replay mode we see what could be the space needle and a dome kingdome i thinkthe tutorial yes there is one and it helped me is a bit quiet the instructor has a fairly soft voice
the music is  well typical music fare
its a little better than the elevator music in gran turismo but not that much better
however it does not distract from playing
no there are other things to distract you during play
and its no necessarily the game
cats significant other parents room mates work phones etcits an addicting game though once its over its over
its not like tetris where you could go on and on
its a fun game because what other game allows you to blow up fireworks into neat patterns of your choicewhile the price is a bit steep for a puzzler like this its worth a rent or two
its like paying for gradius 
its really hard to do
fortunately most stores are dropping the price on this game and the used versions should be around   you cant go wrong on those prices seeing how the majority of bit games are closer tothis game may be catered to a younger crowd but its still fun for all ages
dont be too critical and remember video games are about having fun
dont let the others get you down
renting is always a good option if one is undecidedthis game was released about ten or twelve years ago on the super nintendo and gameboy
read another review to see about how they repackaged this game for nintendo a new kind of tetris
should it be called tetris
yes
its good enoughconceptgameplay this game gives a new concept to the tetris
there are many out there now and this may be one of the first innovations
tetris i do not know
the concept uses two crosshair squares which are used to switch block orders
you want to switch block orders in rows orand columnsnot in tetris of three or more to remove blocks and not die similar to tetris andor dr mario
you can should make combos to remove many blocks at onceits complicated
speeds go faster tooanother thing to note is that the blocks go up instead of fall down
there is no bricklaying like tetris
it is all done for you and you must clean up the mess as blocks continue to move up gradually to quicklythere is a tutorial for beginners and people who want to improve
this is a good feature to have
it shows a lot of possible combos and how to begin and very detailed and shows everything exactlythere are few game modes
including multiplayer which is one of the best featuresit is fun to compete with a friend
there is simply stages where you must eliminate all blocks a certain way in a a few turns free playplay for forever and stagesplay for a certain amount of time and it gets more difficuly with time
each level changes once you beat a certain amount of sections
you get to see a new screen and hear a new song
as you progress through levelsthere is also a password system to get back where you left off on the few moves mode or the stage mode
this is a nice feature
however im not sure if there are unlockables yetgood conceptgameplayit is a 
a good alterationgraphics graphics barely matter in a puzzle game like this but there are many colors shapes and characters that are pretty and attractive
making tetris attack good to a solely superficial person
characters are from super mario  yoshis islandthe attractive art of super mario world  carries on in this gamea great but recycled artworkgraphics
truly beautiful like candyland
i love this as a superficial personmusicsounds i really like the music in this game
my friend has said one of the songs sound like sounds like a funeral and happinesswhat the heck
this may be a bad thing but i like it
also one of the songs has a killer bass line
its quite funny
most of the songs have an upbeat feel minus the funeral onethe monkey stagenow for the soundsthe sound of the game all feels right
although some of the sound effects may be annoying to people
i find them to be quite humorousespecially the kid shouting yeah
sound this really depends but the sound mix is all good
i enjoy the soundtrack
but be aware of annoying soundsthis game is also easy to learn but hard to master
it is an essential game and very addictive
id recommend it to many people
the only wrinkle would be the perhaps more play modes
howver it so good the way it islook the header says it all the game came fast was in good visual condition and played any other things you could ask for could not have topped good salepros similar to mark of kri in mechanics a little more violent than its predecessor now includes level bosses and deeper stealth play through the introduction of raus sister tati most levels involve cooperative play with a computer partner playing with a computer partner is better than i expected
there are times when you just want to let your partner do most of the work while you hang back and throw knives or shoot arrows from a distance
or you can take out the horn blowers before your partner runs in to take everyone out hint if you dont want your computer partner to go charging into a fight make sure you are in unarmed stealth mode
this will tell your partner to do the same partner ai seems decent for the most part but sometimes it ignores enemies it should be fighting especially annoying during boss levels tatis ability to stand against a wall and then fade into it adds to the stealth aspects of the game that is quite enjoyable
guards can walk by and cannot see you also tatis ability to throw or attach poison mushroom bombs to surfaces including people and have them detonate when they are near someone makes the stealth aspects a bit more strategic
for example you can plant mushrooms where the guards will appear through a door and deliberately walk into the open just to lure them in
also you can attach a mushroom to a guard and when he walks by his comrades it will detonate killing them all or knocking them all unconscious cutscenes are far more elaborate but animated in a consistent cartoony stylecons story jumps about a bit and can be difficult to followmark of kri was a game i just found
i dont remember why i bought it or how it came into my possession but i enjoyed it for its unique combination of stealth strategy and barbarian action
and the graphics almost disneyesque with blood and decapitations was a real joy to behold
when rise of kasai came out i was really looking forward to itso far theres nothing really wrong with this game
it just doesnt really add a lot to the original
what was fun in the first now just seems like something ive played before
the only major change is the addition of  playable characters with their own minor quirks and the use of teamwork on some stages
but these alone do not seem to be enough to get me into the game
maybe after i play a little more ill change my reviewon the plus side the graphics are still there
the world is colorful the movies like beautifully animated cave paintings
if youve never played mark of kri then its definitely worth checking out
and if you have well its still pretty good
just dont expect to be blown awayquality overlooked title
try it for cheapnot a waste of timei just had to buy this game again
loved the action and the storyline between the characters in this gameclassic ps game only problem is you cant play online anymore but it is still a very fun and twisted gamefun game
you can actually dance to play once you master the game
the only thing i think it needs are more fastdance songs and more innovative dance moves although you can create your own dance chart
otherwise a fun time and the price is right
enjoysly  is the sequel to the critically wellaccepted sly cooper and the thevius raccoonus
the second installment improves on sly s classic design but you can now play as murray and bentley both of which play unique roles in completing missions and the heist at the end of each chapteri wont comment on story or anything but the gameplay is incredible
controls are smooth and you can pull off slys numerous moves with ease
navigating the environments is easy with sly and murray but i cant say the same about bentleysly is able to press the circle button to interact with numerous objects in the environment he can climb things balance on top of things and overall navigate the environment in a style sympathetic to parkour
he uses his surroundings to get where he needs to go
murray can purchase the turnbuckle launch early on in the game first level
this allows him to jump incredibly high which will grant him access to the rooftops of any level in a single leapbut bentley
oh bentley
bentley cant do anything
no high jump no climbing things nothing
comparing navigation with bentley and navigation with sly and murray is like comparing navigating gta ivs liberty city in a car with navigating with a helicopter respectively
bentley is forced to take the long way around things and seems to have only been included for the purpose of frustration in navigationbut the missions regardless of your character are unique and fun
slys recon and retrieval missions bentleys hacking and minicopter missions murrays fighting it all comes together to provide a varied and enjoyable experience when preparing for the heist
no longer is the game relying on sly to do everythingthe graphics are unique and overall the game looks good
shadow and lighting effects stand out despite the overall cartoony look proving that beauty and unique style can exist in perfect harmony
the animations flow beautifully together but the animations in cutscenes are jerky and the facial expressions can be laughable at timesonce you beat the game i really dont find any joy in going back
yes there are treasures and clues to collect but scouring the same environments that youve already played in just leads to overall boredom
since this game isnt exactly new thankfully you will pay a minimal price for this gameoverall this is a great game among the best on the ps
it isnt without its flaws such as lacking navigation some staleness in later levels and lack of replay value but its not hard at all to fall in love with this games hilarious cartoony and overall enjoyable atmospherethe good excellent graphics great new characters and story fun mission variety  a lot of great abilities to purchase sandbox style makes the game feel more openthe bad navigating the hubs is a real pain starts to feel repetitive towards the end camera still needs work no extrassly bentley and murray return in an attempt to obtain the stolen clockwerk parts from the klaww gang
after defeating clockwerk in the first game they were obtained illegally and the gang must get them back to destroy them
along the way carmelita fox is still trying to capture them while a few new faces show up
the game is the same at the core but everything around that has completely changed
this really feels like a whole new gamefor starters you will notice there are no individual levels anymore
the game is more sandbox with various missions you can take on when you want
you can play as all three characters this time around and each one has their own specific missions
each character feels different murray is a huge lumbering hippo who cant use stealth and instead whacks away enemies in just a couple of hits
bentley is equipped with a sleeping dart crossbow and has various gadgets he can use to get around
in fact they all have gadgets and abilities you can purchase with those coins that were useless in the first game
 no longer gives you a life because that whole system is gone
instead you now have a life bar and when you die you restart at the last checkpoint
this games playing a whole lot easier and relieves a lot of the frustrations from the first gameadditionally the interior areas of the game are mission specific so you wont be going back
i honestly preferred the individual levels because navigating these hub worlds can be a pain
getting to certain places requires climbing around certain areas to get to
some areas are a real pain and you have to figure out how to get there
just to get to a main mission this is pretty lame
i dont want to spend  minutes climbing around a confusing level just to start a mission
it doesnt help that enemies respawn all the time when you kill them and they are everywhere
it gets really frustrating when you just want to get to a mission and you have to keep killing the same enemies all the time
thankfully some abilities like smoke screen shock cane and the paraglider help sly get around easier but the other two have to find their way completely via the ground which means long round about ways to get to a mission markerwhen you start a mission you will notice they are varied and pretty fun
bentley has a new hacking minigame that is a dual stick shooter murray punches things a lot and sly has a new pickpocketing ability which he can use to get coins and loot from guards to sell for abilities and to get those keys
a lot of the gauntlet style levels are really fun and require quick reflexes
there are  episodes and the game is just as tough as the last one
boss fights now have meters and dont go down in a few hits anymore
you have to slowly chip away their health to beat them and it requires patience
overall the game feels mostly the same with missions just varying from hacking minigames beat this or that up or pickpocket x amount of keys
it starts to feel old towards the end plus the navigation of hub worlds will just drive you nuts after a whilethere are still clue bottles and vaults to be found but they just have extra abilities in them and really arent worth searching for
the clue bottles will take over an hour to find in each level because the hubs are so difficult to navigate
there are  in each hub but good luck finding them all without throwing the controller
besides this there are no extras in the game like the last one which is disappointing
despite all this i think the large open hubs are what hurt the game the most because of how annoying they are to navigate
the mission variety is really nice but by the end they just repeat themselvesthe graphics are upgraded greatly with better physics better looking textures and higher resolution models
the controls are a little tighter and the camera was fixed a little but it can still get stuck or lost some times
overall sly  is an excellent game but just feels too similar to the last game
with the whole sandbox idea i feel they are hard to navigate and get in the way of the getting around to different missionsthis game was amazing
it was challenging had a cool story line and was even fun to watch others play
what more can you ask from a game
much better than the jumping puzzle game which was sly yeah you could play grand theft auto or you could play jak and daxter
and you could play assassins creed or you could play sly cooper
basically the ideas are the same just one is drenched in blood and the others drenched in cartoon fun
the choice is up to you
when sucker punch created sly cooper and the thievious racoonus as when naughty dog created jak and daxter it was a great platformer but then like jak ii sly cooper and the band of thieves became something more
you can argue about which game came first or which did it better but one thing i know for sure there are no other games like these that combine stealth action sandbox overworlds and fun cartoon gameplay that wont offend the parentals although if you want a cleaner cartoon crazy action shooter without the violence of one of those adult action titles you can go with ratchet and clank the plot this time around is quite similar to the first retrieve the pieces and take on the bosses who have them one at a time
only instead of somewhat frustrating platformer gameplay we have the aforementioned sandbox gameplay and like jak and daxter way more minigames the second time around
for the stealth action you have sly for some technodemolition work you have bentley and for smashing things to smithereens you have murray
the switchups and minigames go a long way to increase the variety of the gameplay and after the extremes of slys two companions make you exercise crazy caution and bust loose when played through any of the overworlds each one a fortress swarming with guardsthe cartoon graphics are pretty much perfect with no drawin or other noticeable glitches
the cutscenes are largely ingame engine and you might wonder why there are any prerecorded ones at all
the music is typical caperfilm type stuff and perfectly appropriate
the controls are about as good as you can get with the dual shock controllerif this game has a flaw its probably the attimes ridiculous difficulty
if it has a shining star its the way that you can often get around that extremely high difficulty by learning all the shortcuts
you will find as you play that very often the key to solving a puzzle is to scope ahead and case the joint rather than running straight into a situation unless youre playing as the murray
and of course the environments at times make those leap from a great height to your seeming death moments possible
it may be a cartoon but its still funmy favorite moments include bentleys quest to save his captured friends the cinematic made me laugh out loud and the leap from the top of the second world with rajaan assassins what
that and chasing neela and running from and dancing with carmelita why does she remind me of catherine zeta jones
if you liked the first game you need to give this one a try
if you love cartoontype games like the jak series and dont mind some forgiving stealth action and a generous dose of humor you need to buy this one prontowell mr slys at it again on the ps
along with his gang the duo face another threat in the form of clockwerk who thanks to the klaww gang might just reassemble himsly and company travel to pragueindia and the canadian wilderness this time to track down the missing parts and stop the menace from returning in this latest installmentthe game is too fun but still in my opinion kind of short
didnt take me too long to beat it hence why i gave the overall game  stars instead of a perfect  however this game is in fact perfect in every aspect
good story gameplay and funthis is a bigger step up from the previous sly cooper game
there is no pattern but since the goal is to retrieve the clockwerk parts there does not need to be
also will the spice shipments and neyla showing up this game also feels like a mystery
health is way better than the first sly cooper game
the field mission are more complex and this game has been the first time i ever experienced those
i will admit there are at least a few objectives im not proud of like the rolling log game or the paragliding on the destroyed blimp but as long as i get my adventure then this is a really good gamesly  is way better than sly  the gameplay along with the graphics are better
although the game gets boring after you play it over and over but a good buy
cant wait for sly cooper thieves in timedark mirror is one of many in the long line of syphon filter games
it carries on the tradition of excellent thirdperson shooting action serving as the foundation for a twisting plot of intrigue and conspiracy
a sensitive incident at a refinery in alaska leads to an investigation by agent gabe logan and his covert team
what they uncover is not what they expected and when things just dont add up they dig deeper slowly adding pieces to the puzzle of a deadly conspiracy
in order to keep up with the story its important to find hidden evidence on each level and read the files in your inventory
they provide essential details to story progress
without them they arent necessary its sometimes difficult to figure out the whos and whys of what is going on
the twists and turns come fast and apart from the occasional unaccounted for gap due to missing intel the story is solid
deception abounds and dark mirror feels more like a mystery than past tactical espionageoriented syphon filter gamesthis time around the missions are presented in smaller pieces with simpler designs
you can sit down and play through one part of a mission in under  minutes
there are checkpoints within these bitesized areas at critical locations so you never have to backtrack far if you die or do something that results in mission failure
the levels themselves are fairly straightforward and linear but it doesnt feel too constrained and there is room for tactical experimentation as well as secrets to findmost of the time you will be moving sneaking shooting aiming and taking cover
stealth has always been a staple of syphon filter and it is well represented in dark mirror
doing things quietly often ensures resistance along your path is lighter
however stealth is not necessary in most cases and there is no severe punishment for attempting it and being caught
you can get a rush of anticipation as you sneak around your quarry or you can get a rush of adrenalin when they spot you and assault you full force
however you want to play it dark mirror will accommodate youwhen you do get into trouble you can now take cover along walls or behind obstacles
this is a new addition to syphon filter gameplay and while it isnt a new gaming concept it has been done properly here
not sticking your neck out needlessly can save your life but with dark mirrors fairly easy difficulty you can usually opt to just stand in the open and fire if youre quick on the trigger
again this allows casual gamers to enjoy the action while allowing more tacticallyminded individuals to be more deeply involved in the battlefieldenemies are unpredictable yet intelligent many times using cover as you would
when they have you outnumbered they take advantage of the situation to put pressure on you and ferret you outthere is a very nice assortment of weapons and devices for gabe and company to use
pistols shotguns assault rifles sniper rifles submachineguns experimental weaponry explosives grenades etc
at any one time you can carry one sidearm one submachinegun one rifle sniper or otherwise the experimental agency rifle you carry at all times a melee weapon and an explosive
the experimental rifle shoots darts of various types explosive poison gas or electric shock
firearms have varying attributes and fire modes so some are better under certain circumstances
generally speaking though most any gun can get the job done for you so its almost never a matter of not having the right tool for the job
with all of these toys at your disposal its a ton of fun for anyone who loves guns
again dark mirror makes itself accessible to casual gamers and hardcore shooter fans alikeyou also have access to a set of hightech goggles that have three different modes night vision infrared and electromagneticarmor and medkits are places around the levels and provide a quick refresh after particularly intense areasthe graphics are neat and clean
while the ps can push out more dazzle than is presented in dark mirror this game succeeds in looking fantastic in its simplicity
if youre used to the highend cg cutscenes of late you may be a little disappointed in the movies dark mirror provides but the ingame action still looks goodthe sound is decent with some good voice acting and a lot of spoken lines during play
i cant help but feel there could be a little more oomph to the guns and some more environmental sounds but again dark mirror succeeds in its simplicity
the music is provided by several composers including the ubiquitous mark snow
nothing terribly rousing here but it keeps pace with the highs and lows of the actiondespite these easy to swallow portions and an emphasis on simplicity there is a lot on the table to enjoy and dark mirror offers about  hours of story playtime
in addition there is a mission mode where you can replay levels and earn ratings in tactical areas such as headshots stealth kills use of rifle darts survivability and knife skills
for your performances you are awarded badges of merit and these patches unlock additional weapons abilities such as increased health and new bonus levels
earning full ratings for each level usually requires you to play through it a few more times each time focusing on a different tactic
due to the quickfire nature of the missions this is quick and fun but can eat up a lot of time in the long run making dark mirror very replayabledark mirror is quite enjoyable
it doesnt shoot itself in the foot by catering to casual or hardcore action gamers
instead it allows for both and does so admirablyon a final note dark mirror was brought over to the ps after being made for the psp
everything was designed for quick portable gaming in mind
this accounts for the short mission structure somewhat easy gameplay its much easier to move and aim with a ps controller and allround simplicity as opposed to more complex games like socom or metal gear solid
fortunately dark mirror is a shining example that satisfying gameplay and quality content dont necessarily imply complexityi liked the custom character feature from omega strain and would have liked to see it here too but despite that this game was enjoyable
there are some glitches in this game such as outofsync lip moving in cut scenes and on the very final level gabes guns as well as his left arm when holing a gun would be invisible
ive beaten the game already but when i tried to play the final level again the game would freezethe multitap is great it hooks into one memory card slot and a controller slot and  lets you have  extra players playing and if you get a second one you can have up to eight
this however means you have to buy extra controllers but the fact that the psone controllers are compatible comes in handy
you may complain that for the other systems there are  controller slots and you dont have to buy anything extra but you cant have up to  players with other systems
its a little expsensive but your still getting a good deal if you own a psget one of theseas all playstation  owners know we have a system that was for some reason built with only  controller ports
why in the lords name would a next generation system have only  controller ports
i personnally feel that sony did it to make more money
less controller portscheaper to make system
less controller portsthe need to spend more money on extra periphials
anyhow if you want to enjoy multiplayer games with your family andor friends than you are agoing to need to buy this item
only buy sony products because they are much more durable and they alaways look better that the third party ones
so buy this and  other dual shock  sony controllers and you will have a blastputting aside the debate as to whether or not the ps should have included more controller ports one needs to accept the fact that it only comes with i like the multitap in that it is made by sony itself and is both reliable and durable
i only give it  stars because the short cord makes it difficult for those of us who prefer to have our ps stored on the second shelf of a cabinet i have to put a small table underneath to keep the weight of the multitap from damaging the input sloti would have preferred either a plug in piece that adheres to the front of the ps perhaps uding both controller ports for support or a much longer cord
as it stands now i may have to buy a controller extension cord to correct this design flaw which is irritating when i already paid for the multitapit works its first party and its reliable
hopefully the ps will take advantage of the wireless revolution and the cord issue will be a thing of the pastrumor has it the ps slated for a  release will have four ports and i sure as hell hope so
for now you just gotta get this thing
why
if you have party games like pacman fever for example and you and a few friends want to play at the same time then the multitap is just the thing
otherwise if you want to play with more than two people just go online and play with thousandsthis item is greatbut why wasnt it made backward compadible playstation  i mean if the dual with the playstation or shock  is compadible why isnt the multi tapthe nd fault is that the cord is so short if your ps is not positioned on the floor it has a danger of falling outto start off this review the multitap functions perfectly unless you mount your ps vertically
just plug it into slot  and you magically have  ports for controllers and memory cards port  is still left open
awesome for mulitplayer games
a must have for parties of more than  peoplenow for the majr problem
remember back to the days of genesis and snes
all multiplayer games were  players max thus the  controller ports
now the ps follows in that legacy but with  player games
just another way for sony to squeeze more money out of ps ownersin conclusion it works perfectly but shouldnt even exist
if you want to payany games with more than just  players you really have no choicei wrote a review for singstar pop that i could have copied and pasted here since both games suffer from the same problems
i routinely read the reviews on amazon before i buy so i knew what i was getting into
the reviews for this game are right on
everything that is wrong and right with the games has been stated in an earlier review so i wont repeat the info but as of my last review i had not played the game in duet mode so i wanted to add my comments about that
the duet mode sucks
it alternates between each person singing a few lines individually and then singing some lines together
overall it is distracting and if you and your duet partner dont have complimentary voices you end up with a painful assault on the ear
also i cannot figure out why they would put songs on this game that are already included in the kr series
this is supposed to be singstar rocks but a more fitting title would be singstar rockssort of
who rocks out to rocket man
or every breath you take
the artist lineup is good but they picked some lame songs
once you sing the few good songs youre ready to go back to your kr games
what they need is a singstar metal
now that might be something
i should mention that is does have a unique feature in that if you have both singstar games you can swap them in and out without resetting the playstation
i cuts down on the impatience of waiting for a new game to load
i love kr and it would be great if you could do this with them as wellshiny ent
are by far my favourite games developers
i like their twisted imagination original gameplay unique characters and dazzling graphics
quotsacrificequot succeeds in all of this
the storyline goes as follows you play a wizard that can choose allegiance between five quarelling gods and then has to rage war against the othe gods during the game you can switch deity just about as much as you want toso basically its a realtime strategy game with a twist
the twist being that youre no longer an overseeing general commanding your troops from a bird perspective but you have now become a wizard whos present on the battlefield
you still get to command your units around but you also get to cast nice little spells and such but you can also get attacked just like your units canthe graphics are stunning
the worlds are huge
the characters are highly imaginative
so whats the let down
the gameplay might be a little confusing
you often feel you loose control of your units and its not always easy to give specific commands to specific units when theyre all tossing and turning around each other
the game is also quite heavy on the requirements
but luckily you can tune the graphics down just about as much as you want so most new pcs should be able to play the game smoothly on a given levelthe truth is i really dont actually like this game but i had to give it  stars because the story graphics and sound are amazing
im not that much of a real time strategy guy i think that is the main reason i did not like this game but i recomend it to ne one who likes those kind of gamesat a time when im sick of just about every type of game out there especially stperson shooters 
ugh comes sacrifice
im not even a fan of the real time strategy genre
more often than not im turned off by losing focus because of haing to keep up with way too many variables
sacrifice is so different and has really changed my mindthe deep inventive gameplay massive control excellent graphics and voicework make this one a real winner
shiny has again come up with a truly original idea
its a real system hog though so be warned
id take the minimum requirements with a grain of salt and make sure you have plenty of ram and a doozy of a graphics card in order to truly enjoy the game
i give it  stars only because it does run a bit funky freezing and other glitches on systems that arent up to spec
be sure to get the most recent patch tooso if you enjoy controlling hordes of flying demons and bloodthirsty ground troops running pell mell all over crazy landscapes and destroying everything in sight then sacrifice is for you
its so much more than that but ill spare you the details
dying over and over and learning from my strategic mistakes has never been this funtired of computer games
this one just might renew your interestok first of all i gave sacrifice only  stars because the multiplayer portion really is not worth it at the time of this writing
maybe after they get patch  up and running it will be worth a second look
with that aside i have to say this is one of the best games i have playedever
i will not bore you with details about the plot or characters you can read other reviews for that
i will just give you a run down on playability system specs graphics etc
i am using an athlon megs ramand a voodoo  agp
with this machine the game plays very smoothly and graphics are some of the best i have seen so far
as far as playing on lower end machines i would have to say you probably would not have as many problems as you may think
you can always quottweakquot settings to your system
i would stay with a pentium  or athlon only
the speed probably would not be as big a factor as your graphic card
the game play kind of like battlezone
you are in rd person view and can control you players and participate in battles
there are some resource management in the form of quotsoulsquot
the more souls you getfrom battling opponents the more troops you can build
this is a very easy to master setup
the learning curve is not steep at all
the  tutorial games are first rate and bring you up to speed slowly
if you like strategy games with great graphics and the ability to go anywhere on the massive game maps this is for you
oh by the way there is a good bit of exploring to do on the huge maps
there are no load times once a map loads that is itthis game has excellent graphics no matter what anyone says
altough it is kind of hard in the begining
the only bad part it is the stupid bat that always tells you obvious tips and just flat out stupid stuff
one cool feature it has is youf can make your own levels for multiplayer
but multiplayer is confusing when trying to get into a game
the short versionout of  graphics  sound  control  fun factor  total what i especially liked about this game is the fact that its not very linear you have a certain freedom of chosing your missions
i also liked the design of each level the terraing is simply amazing with vast fields and great plains
very fun to explore very fun to playthe game is a realtime strategy type of game much like starcraft or warcraft
you basically create troops consisting of various creatures and also buildings which are actually mana fountains that replenish your mana
then you go to battlei hope my review will add something to anyone interested in this game or who is interested in what others have to say about it
 at the end of my review is a way to installplay under xp let me write the review not to compare this to settlers i ii or iii
this will simply be on how i see the game mechanicsthis game seems to play quite smoothly and its graphics for the time it was made are not that bad off
true by todays standards it wont win any awards but it has a novel atmosphere that bodes well with the theme of the gamewhen playing the harder of the two difficulties you will be challenged each mission you play though after you have lost a few times you will understand how the opponent will come after you and how best to set up your starting colony
in this sense the game is a bit onerousadding to the differences are the three races with different style buildings and a few unique features to each which does make it favorable to like one over the other depending on what you enjoy most
yet i do feel all in all they are more or less the sameif i were to rate the music i would say that its catchy and you could find yourself humming it in the mudane world but after a few hours it can be repititious
to offset this there is a nice ingame feature to allow you to play your own music while playing the game
this is quite good and i do wish more games would offer thisnow getting onto how the game operatesthere are some aspects that make this a less then  gameif you build your houses to create free settlers too close to other things then the settlers you have not asigned will be in the way of a lot of things
there is sadly no way to move them aroundsometimes carriers will not grab the closest resource to them but will travel to a further away location
i do not see how the logic of the game tells the carriers where to get there items but i do wish it were better
also in this if you are a bit short on carriers and try to build something it may take a very long time for it to get the resources it needscombat is frustrating because you cannot tell your troops to retreat if they are close to an enemy
they will walk blindly into battle even if hopelessly outmatchedthere are a few other minor things but i will not mention them as they are just personal and not how i see it flawsnow about how fun is this gamewell as some state when they review homeworld the missions are pretty much a one shot deal
once you know how to win a mission and sucseed there isnt much point in replaying it unless you want to show someone how you did certian thingsthe free settler mode is also good when wanting to try out things or just to see how large and susessful you can make a colonythere was an online features for this game but blue bytes doesnt seem to support the web server any longer
you can still lan up i believe
blue byte will still offer limmited support for this game which is also nice
as of august now i really enjoy this game dispite my little quirks with it
if feel it is a good play and should be in anyones collectionthis last part of my review will be how to make this game work with xp
it does install and run under xp home running a gig proccessor or less
my laptop has this hardware and the game works just fine on it
however xp pro with a faster processor the game wont even start
i have found one way to make this work with higher end machinesinstall the game fully as well as any addon disks and install the sivexe patch
you can do a search for itdo a search for windows application compatibility toolkit  and install this too its free
when you run it do new database and fix
name settlers iv  vendor blue byteuse the program and find the smainexe directory and operating system modes pick none
now after next in compatibilty fixes do emulateslowcpu
install this new file and close out the program
but youre not quite done
next use the xp compatibilty wizard and select the settlers iv exe file and select run with windows 
now you can run and play settlers iv
whew
  i know it takes some time but it is well worth itsettlers iv is a bit slow to get into and no where near as fast paced as more popular rtss but i do like how detailed it is in setting up and building your settlements
once you finally get your economy well established which can take the better part of an hour at times then you do go out for conquest and battle
nothing epic but i enjoy it especially considering i work with young people and finding quality erated rts games they can play at my center is a bit challenging
basically if your looking for an intense rts where you dont really have time to stop and think then avoid this game but if you like taking the time to develop a settlement and establish a strong economy before heading out to conquer the map then youll love this gamei was kind of unsure about buying neverwinter nights because of the mixed reviews about the single player campaign
i decided to buy it to tide me over until icewind dale  comes out
i have to say i got a lot of enjoyment out of it
it was better than i expected it to be
it could have been better but it is worth buying
i like a large and increasingly neglected group of gamers have no interest whatsoever in the multiplayer aspect or in the dungeon creation toolset
therefore if you want a review of these parts of the game then youll have to skip to the next one
if you want to learn about the singleplayer campaign read onthe best part of this game is the new engine and the interface
it looks nice and its very slick
the graphics dont deserve the criticism that they are getting
the only shortcomings of the graphics show up if you have the camera zoomed in which will probably be rare since you need it zoomed out to get a wide view
the faces are kind of featureless and blocky but if you zoom out you wont noticethe game is full of candy for the eyes and the ears
the spell effects are great and so are the fighting animations
the battle cries and the taunts are great
the ambient sounds in the city like the moans of plague victims and the sounds of fighting in the distance are great at setting the atmosphere
the music composed by jeremy soule a guy who makes one great roleplaying soundtrack after another is wonderfulthe interface is very easy to learn and its very flexible
this keeps the game play moving along swiftly
a teleportation stone lets you return instantly to town to sell your stuff or get healed
if you are a dd purist you might not like this addition but if you arent then you will probably like the way that it keeps the game flowing
its nice to be able to get back to town and pawn your stuff without trudging out of the dungeonthis campaign however is definitely not the stuff that legends are made of
its pretty uncreative and uninspired
the storyline is a typical move up the food chain and kill the bosses lackeys story with the usual shortfalls
a noname level  character starts off the game having to save the whole city
the big boss deals with you by sending progressively stronger yet dumb henchmen  by  to kill you
duh
this is the weakest dd storyline yetthis problem applies for the magic items too
there arent many interesting items
lots of cookiecutter items repeat themselves frequently like in diablo
in chapter  you might find  pairs of gloves of swordplay
then in chapter  you find  pairs of greater gloves of swordplay
the scenery is also blah and repetitive
there are no memorable areas in this game like kuldahar in icewind dale or athlakta in baldurs gate the biggest flaw of this game is the horrible decision to eliminate the party and replace it with a single dumbai henchman that can only follow simple orders
you can only give your henchman potions in combat
you cant control their moves
you cant give them items that they could use
you cant choose their spells for them
you cant control when they cast spells
this is a huge step backwards not forwards
what were these people thinking
dd is at its best on the computer when you have a diverse party and you can use all of their strengths to your advantage
you wont get that in this game
that is why i eagerly await icewind dale  which is a fullparty rd edition game
perhaps someone this new engine to create a partybased dd game somedaystill despite my complaints i enjoyed this game and i would recommend it for rpg fans
it has a great pace and it is a fun game
if you dont buy it now at least pick it up in the bargain bin somedayif youre into forgotten relamsbaldurs gate rpgs or you are into rpgs in general then you must try this game out
a great combat system with beautiful graphics
you can also create your own adventure with the aurora toolset
however if you dont know how to do script codes for this game real well itll be discouraging trust me i know firsthand
but like i said the game itself is a great gamei normally only play more firstperson type games but didnt take me long to like this one
the graphics were great and the story line was very involving
cant remember how many hours i played it when i first got it but alot
the only negative i had was online play
anyone can host a server ala quake and even on high bandwidth lines it was still laggy
but other then that it was well worth the costthe only thing i liked about this game is the charecter development
theres plenty of classes with many perks skills and spells
gameplay is alright but the storyline isnt super
you can play on online servers with custom mods but theyre too laggy in my opinionnwn was a fine gaming experience
the story was good not great sometimes it seemed contrived as well as the sound graphics and playability
there were some glitches with the pathfinding functions of the game however i often found my character getting stuck on a small obsticle that in other black isle games baldurs gate series and torment in particular your characters would simply walk around it and keep going
while the over all story was decent you had to go a long period of time between parts where the plot progressed
having only henchman has ups and downs
i agree with all the other people who miss the  banter between party members in previous games
that was very fun and it would have been a welcome addition to nwn
there was a bonus to this deficiency however
being able to carry only one henchman with you makes the replay value much better
the games dynamics change drastically
for example i played through and finished as  a paladin
since most of the oponents are undead the battles were relatively easy
i took the rogue henchman through and he was able to handle most of the locks and traps
another time i played through about half way as a rogue and took the cleric henchman with me
it was way harder but very fun
i couldnt just lung into battles
id have to sneak around them lure a few away from the crowd and finish them off before attacking the othersneverwinter nights is a great singleplayer game
neverwinter nights is a great multiplayer game
neverwinter nights is a great allaround game
 the cat ran up the treereally though it is a great game
i have a sort of soupedup computer now  ghz processor  gb ram ati radeon  mb graphics card so the graphics run smoothly no matter how high the settings are
on my older computer though  ghz processor  mb ram cheap intel graphics card it didnt work as well so if your computer isnt great it might not runn so well
overall the gameplay is great it isnt too hackandslash the singleplayer campaign is superb and i think it does a pretty good job of porting the dd rd edition rules though i being too young to have played the original pencilandpaper dd wouldnt really know
still there are a couple minor flaws you should know about when deciding whether or not to buy the game henchman ie
any companion you may have
there a few issues here
the first and most glaring is that you can only have one excluding any people you are leading somewhere as part of a quest and familiars animals or whatever that you summon via magic
still when you play the game you might be glad of this because the pathfinding for henchmen is really inexcusably abysmal
lots of times rounding a corner is enough to make your henchman freeze in hisher tracks and stay where heshe is until you come back and bait himher out by inching along
also you cant control your henchmans inventory although you can in the expansion
this i suppose is only a pain if you are a shady player who likes to take all he can from his henchman and sell it
but it can be troublesome if they have a good weapon that they arent using and that you want
pathing in general
pretty selfexplanatory
the camera is rather awkward which makes it even harder
combine this with henchman pathing and you have a real pain
the instruction manual
this is the biggest baddest problem
like i said i have no clue how the original dd was played when it was in vogue i was an embryo
i dont know what character class is
the term skill modifier is a mystery to me
and what is a saving throw
heres a real gem straight from the manual only rogues may disarm traps with a dc over  or greater
with  or more ranks in set traps a character gains a  synergy bonus on disable trap checks
and theres more standing still provides a  bonus to a listen check
a character with the alertness feat gains a  synergy bonus on listen checks
and also it was only after much ponderings that i realized that the oftenreferred to d meant a sided die rolled twice and d is an sided die rolled once
and why does a greatsword  cost about  times more that a regular greatsword
the list goes on and on
turnbased combat
for turnbased read dumb pointless and frustrating
for no real reason there is a  or  second delay between each combat action
a zombie will swing a fist the character will duck
a huge pause
you will swing your sword
the zombie may or may not duck
why the pause
it conveys no sense of my turn your turn
is it to make all the necessary skill checks saving throws and dice rolls
come on folks
this is a computer
it can do  times that amount of simple math in a millisecondwell anyway
its a great game just these minor details
get itit was hard for me to pin down what i didnt like about this game at first then it hit me i expected something different
im a big fan of the baldurs gate series and by extension icewind dale and torment
neverwinter nights really only has one thing in common with those games theyre based on dd
  after there the similarities pretty much endafter abandoning this game for the far less time consuming warcraft  ive come back to it with a renewed interest
havign given it a second chance i must admit that while its not the game i expected its still a pretty great game and can potentially have one of the biggest impacts on gaming ever
unfortunately i still find a lot of my complaints to be validone of my biggest complaints in the single player game is the lack of henchmen
one of the best things about the black isle games especially baldurs gate  was how your henchmen had minds of their own would fight amongst each other even kill each other
i always thoght this was the feature that made the experience as close to a real rpg as possible
in neverwinter you only get one henchman and theres little communication
since you can only make one player you usually have to find a henchman that can pick locks or heal
ive tried a lot of them with a couple of different characters and they always seem to haev a high mortality rate
i always seem to have to go back to the temple as they seem to die an awful lot
in my opinion they shoudl have limited the henchmen but allowed extra henchmen for characters with a hgih charisma that way the henchmen dont drive the story or steal the show but you at least haev a better tactical dynamicone of my overall complaints is how tiny all the writing inventory items and maps are at a respectable resolution
i find myself squinting at my  monitor until it feels like my eyeballs are going to pop out
elder scrolls  morrowind had this same problem
inventory management can get really tedious
this is a pretty small complaint though
i got over it quicklythe rest of the single player experience warms up slowly but does eventually hook you
i think most peopel give up early and make rash judgements of the game
i know i was pretty disappointed at first that i wasnt playing one of those other games i loved so much
this isnt baldurs gate  however and once i realized that i kind of backed off and started enjoying myself
the single player story really is pretty good and the deeper you get into it the better it gets
it does haev a relatively linear story but you can stray really far from the tracks and there are side quets aplenty hidden around every corner
i like the ability to zoom out for navigation then zoom in for the action so i can watch the fight which are entertaining thanks to some excellent character animation
the sound is also excellent and really adds to the overall tone of the game
of the three recent rpg releases that everyones raving about including morrowind and dungeon seige this is definitely the best single player game out there for hardcore gamers or even dungeon crawlersthe biggest reason to buy this game and what will make it endure beyond the relatively flawed single player experience is one of the most ambitious editors ever made
the community of wannabe game makers out there is respectable and growing bigger every day
ive tooled around with the editor and must say its oen of the easiest ive ever used for a rpg
you can whip up a map in no time opulate it with all manner of critters and npcs and then navigate through it with a charater to see how it works
the scripting is where most people whove never had nay c experience like me will start running into some problems
the scripting process is what keeps the editor from being completely user friendly
if you haev a vision of a cool adventure that isnt a dungeon crawl youre going to have to leqarn scripting
i guess they couldnt come up with a wizard that was versatile enough to handle all the various jobs that scripting coversits the scripting that i think has made most of the player made dungeons on the net fairly mediocre
people like me are still learning the process and perfecting what they want to get done
patient and thorough dungeon builders will find lots of helpful communities and forums on the net even if you cant find a really definitive set of instructions at this writing
the longer this game stays on the market however the better those player made levels get
with patches addons and a very enthusiastic community i think this game is going to blossom into the experience we were promised
if i didnt think that i would have given up on this game a long time agofor those who have read the reviews and hype surrounding nwn over the past monthsyears like myself its very satisfying and safe to say that bioware delivered what it promised and what everyone hoped this game would be  it is an excellent roleplaying game rpg and the dm elements are all topnotchfor everyone else this is an excellent roleplaying game rpg but thats only one aspect of it
its a fantasy  medievel rpg but so much more
this allows you to create an assortments of player types items scenerios worlds etc just like the dungeons and dragons paper and pencil games if youve played those
but the difference is you dont have to imagine what it looks like since its right in front of you
you can either simply play as most people will do or you can be a dungeon master dm and create your own scenerios andor worlds for people to interact and explore
not only that but the dm can interact and manipulate the players and world while its going  in real timethe graphics and gameplay are great and the animation is very fluid
though when you play online with others you will probably experience some lag from time to time
not everyone will like the campaign story shipped with the game about  hours of play which is actually rather easy compared to other games but not the most inventive
for one there is the tediousness of diablo and everquest where you kill and loot kill and loot
but the beautiful thing is that it doesnt matter since you never have to play it
the fan base for this game is huge so players and gamers will be creating hundreds of scenerios that youll easily be able to download  or make your own
though having some programming experience will be a huge benefitoverall this game isnt so much a game as it is an entire world creator and interactive community within a fantasy  medieval backdrop
literally the only limitation to the game will be yours and everyone elses imagination
if you want to experience nwn you need to immerse yourself in the community or hop online with your friends
but if all you want to do is complete a quest you can certainly do that with this but other games will suffice almost as well but again the graphics in this are beautiful
however if youre the type of person where the joy is in the journey not the destination then nwn is definitely for youthe biggest downside to this type of game is time
like everquest it will take time to immerse yourself and get the maximum enjoyment out of this game
so parents if you ever want to see you children again unless youre good at dictating their online game time you may not want to buy this game
but for those who are looking to plunge themselves into a world of fun imagination and nearly unlimited creativity you cant do better than this right nowside note the game has been somewhat buggy and problematic for some people
and while it seems that its been a problem for a lot of people keep in mind that more people are buying this game currently than any other so the percentage probably isnt any or much higher than those problems other computer games experience
bioware will certainly be addressing these issues and to see if your computer will work for this game as it is now check out the bioware website for this game at otherwise you may want to wait a while before buying the game depending on how your system rates with the known issues until they have made the appropriate bug fixesi bought this game on the day it was released with very high expectationsi have found that this game is like a blend of two other games  dungeon siege and arcanum
it has the d perspective of ds with the nonlinear storyline and npc interaction variety of arcanum
this is an excellent combination for a game as it gives both sides of the house thinking adventurers and mindless hackn slashers something to enjoythe tutorial at the beginning of the game is useful for learning to navigate and interact with the game and shows the basics of combat item usage and leveling up
it does not show everything which is nice because it leaves the player in a position to learn some things on hisher ownwhere i feel nwn falls short is in the quality of the graphics
i was very surprised when i started up the game and the graphics were not up to standard with todays d games
more effort went into the actual gameplay and thats where it should be but the graphics lack in detail and richness in some places
this becomes especially apparent when interacting with npcs  they have no discernable facesthis game requires much of your graphics card wanting bit color settings note the game says it requires bit color but it runs fine on my system at lower settings
the higher the color depth the better the game looks to a point
i ran into an issue with the color depth and nwn wanting to crash  new video drivers fixed the issue completelyi tried the aurora toolkit and was rewarded with a null pointer access and an application crash
i had to use the task manager to rid myself of the application and have not tried it since
i suspect that the new video drivers fixed this as welli have not tried the multiplayer capabilities and therefore cannot comment on it with any degree of fairness
my suspicions though suggest that multiplayer is the way to go with this gamethis is a fun game that is guaranteed to eat up hours and hours of your precious free time
while not perfect its very very good and is the most complete rpg to date
in spite of the few negatives i have stated in my experiences with nwn im planning to finish the single player game and look for user campaigns
its worth the timea long time ago neverwinter nights nwn was the official dungeons   dragons game for america online
at least i think it was america online
it was some subscription service
whateveranyway it was a limited game engine of sorts that used the wacky dungeons  dragons rules to allow people to play together online
it was revolutionary in its daywith the arrival of this latest version of neverwinter nights dd gets a steroid boost of immense proportions in the form of a real time d game engine
sort ofnwn is both a module creation tool and an adventure
you can download other adventures or make adventures and host them just like a real dungeon master
its the closest thing to creating your own mud  and you could conceivably make one bigger than most muds with up to  players on simultaneously at one timei have created an adventure but never really hosted it
the time it takes is simply too much  its like all the effort of writing an adventure plus difficulties of design
worse the first version i got of nwn kept crashing my machine
since the patches its considerably better
in fact nwn is made to be patched as opposed to game companies pretending everythings perfect even though they know it isnt on release
you just hit update and nwn updates itselfnwn is made for a wide range of computers so it scales the effects
this is definitely apparent when maleficent and i play  by looking over at her slower computer you can see a world of difference
i have particle effects from waterfalls shadows thrown from a dozen light sources and glittering reflections in polished surfaces
malwell doesntin fact for a long time we couldnt get the game to work at all on her computer which drove us both nuts
it turned out that the only problem was actually the graphics card  it had a particular flaw with the female model type
thats right even though the graphics card had worked in my computer previously because mal was playing a female sorceress who else
 it crashed over and over
it took a lot of work but we finally got nwn to work on both our machinesthe adventure itself is compelling and massive
the box says over  hours of gameplay and theyre not kidding
since mal and i tend to scour everything bare we really did take up the  hours if not more
additionally there was easily room for both of us to play in the universe without feeling claustrophobic
we completed separate quests and then would link back together later
mals meaner than i am so her character was more neutral
i played talien as a paladin youre surprised by this right
theres no satyrs in nwn howeverthat said there is a lot of flexibility
the thirdedition rules are amazingly implemented in the game engine which is a compliment to the developers as well as the creators of the thirdedition rules
the choice of races and classes are balanced well
and nwn goes further  there are rules that enhance the game such as leveldependent items that players cant use until theyre high enough levelthe combat system works exceptionally well and even the trade system works smoothly
characters are more or less likely to be helpful depending on how high or low your pcs charisma stat is
if your character is really stupid he talks funny me am strong
and theres always the nasty and the good choice
maleficent had the opportunity to constantly ask for more cash whereas i tried to always do the right thing
true to form our alignments matched our actionsthe monsters are beautifully rendered in three dimensional form taking the static artwork from the monster manual to new levels
umber hulks never looked so terrifying
and when a dragon gets up on its hind legs and walks over to swat you like a fly its positively nerve wracking
still not all the monsters are to scale  the dragons and giants should have been larger
there are also quite a few monsters missing
but thats okay because theres so much to explore that you dont miss itmal and i beat the game at th level even though there were items for th level characters
i suspect two people playing the game which is meant to be played solo ultimately end up dividing the spoils and thus advance slower
ive spoken to other people who played nwn and felt that the games difficulty plateaued too quickly
i played nwn as a paladin along with mal and as a elven evoker  in both cases i died quite a lot
it may be that fighter types have an easier time of itthere were two major problems in gameplay that cropped up however
like all good and bad
muds nwn has not perfected pet code
by pet code i mean the code that allows a player to control a monster or npc
henchmen are available in the game a requirement for some particularly difficult areas
every other chapter of the adventure henchmen would bug  they wouldnt listen to our commands they would repeat the same phrase over and over they would attack friendlies 
or they would simply not recognize the pc as their employer anymore
given that some npcs are critical to survive this became a big problem when we had to permanently dump the thief in favor of a cleric we didnt need
the problem always fixed itself when we entered a new chapter of the game because the npcs are essentially recreated at higher levels
still its extremely annoyingmuch worse were the quest bugs another feature that often hampers text muds
sure enough many of the quests simply did not work  npcs who were required to finish the quests disappeared or wouldnt recognize the item given to them
unlike the henchmen code problem the quest bugs i was able to manually fix by going into the code with the area creator and tweaking it
so that was a surmountable but still annoying bugthe campaign adventure series itself is surprisingly mature for its type involving plagues bad choices murdered lovers and vengeance
while the end battle is quite climactic it took mal and i several days to figure out how to beat the bad guy the narrative summary is far too brief and without any accolades
its sort of a yay you won bye rather than a true feeling of accomplishmentsince i dont get to play much dd these days this is the closest thing to it
i havent figured out how to play with my friends over the internet yet but we intend to and are planning to buy the expansion adventures all of them
is nwn perfect
no
but it is a fantastic worldbuilding tool that manages to provide a really fun gaming experience that takes me back to the old days around a table with my friendsoki am a true st person shooter game addict
i used to play the dd style games on sega and nintendo in the way back time
this game was my first return to that genre
i have to say i am enjoying this game
i am not blown away by it but i do like it
i have read in some forums that bioware took some of the best things dd had to offer and threw it all out
i cannot comment since i am not into these games that muchi like that this game cost me  and has kept me busy for days on end resolving puzzles while exploring the neverwinter worldi paid  for max payne  and jedi academy yet finished them in  to  hours of pay time
rip off
nwn is a steep learning curve the potions spells charms and rules were utterly confusing to me and still are
i find the in game descriptions of items to be utterly useless
so i am a bit pod about that
the manual does nothing to help you
there should be a wizard to recommend character classes and help newbies pick character based on our game play style
instead you get a menu of precreated characters
you are better off reading a good walkthrough using a trainer program at a cheat site so you can play and learnthen go back and do it for realoverall i am enjoying nwn
i think the graphics are just fine
not breath taking but not bad either
just remember this game is a steep learning curvei am near the end and i canot figure out what somethings do or what some items are good forneverwinter nights is almost a dream come true for all of us dd players
you can create your own adventures or play other peoples premade adventures either solo or with an adventuring party filled with players or npcsmy main complaint is the level limit
twentieth level is the maximum you can reach
there was absolutely no reason for this limitation other than using it for future expansion sales
i understand that even the expansion has the same level limit though
the reason i say there was no reason for it is because on the editor you can raise the monsters levels beyond that so the game engine knows what to do if youre rd or th level
this game would have been so much better if that limitation were not there
for people like myself who have been playing this game for over  years low level characters just arent all that fundespite this serious drawback the game has an amazing array of spells feats skills classes races magical items and monsters included
the monsters are so customizeable that you can give them the stats of a completely different monster in effect changing something like a lizard man into a kua toa something i actually did in the editor
it worked quite wellanother thing which could have added a lot to the game is enabling spellcasters to use hot keys such as f etc to cast favorite spells quickly instead of having to go through a series of mouse clicks during a realtime combatthe editor is so flexible and user friendly that within a few days i was copying my old modules such as vault of the drow and against the giants into it
they work great
i did find out that you are limited to about  creatures per level
go higher than that and the monsters just stand there and let you pound on themso if you enjoy the low level game break out the doritos and have funperhaps the best that can be said about neverwinter nights is that it comes very close to fulfilling all the hype that lead up to its release
it isnt however going to put wizards of the coast out of business
here is whythe aurora toolset is powerful very powerful
probably too powerful as it is difficult to learn and slow to use
im a computer programmer that has also acted as a pen and paper dungeon master yet i still havent quite worked up the urge to delve into all those tutorials and menus
the main problem with building your own modules is that you have to pick and place everything which takes literally forever
also the editor has some odd quirks and limitations and if you use hacks or scripts can screw up the game very easily
you are well advised to backup everything before you do anythingthe single play campaign is very long and quite challenging
the plot is good and the characters have more than one dimension
unfortunately it shares some of the elements of the only other rd edition dd crpg pool of radiance ruins of myth drannor
that is to say there are way too many dumb fed ex quests and the graphics seem squarish and get very repetitive
it is still a good deal better than that game however as combat is actually fun and the npcs do more than just tell you to go somewhere and find somethingas for stability issues if you dont hack there probably wont be too many
however once in a while you might encounter inexplicable and often serious bugs
for example sometimes items vanish or stop working for no apparent reason
ive also seen savegames get corrupted which is bad but not impossibly so since you can export and restart a chapter
its advisable you keep several saves and update them at intervals in case something breaksaside from its flaws nwn has a great look and rd edition feel
the rules arent nearly as faked as they are in pool of radiance though some spells and feats are modified to be workable with the realtime system
that said not all of the rules are implemented but quite a few are
i have to admit i was astonished at how thorough a job bioware did although my opinion might be skewed due to having played through the entire pool of radiance game still cant believe i did that
as is to be expected the spells look fantastic and combat is generally exciting and fun
youll encounter scores of different monsters and they each look unique and well donethe interface is easy to learn especially for veterans of baldurs gate or similar games
as with its d predecessor you can pause the game to issue commands
you do not control a party any longer however and can have at most three followers a henchman familiaranimal companion and summoned creature
the followers artificial intelligence is passing but not too great
perhaps the community or bioware will improve on it with future patches
if theres one thing at all that hasnt changed in the makeover from infinity engine to aurora it has to be the pathfinding
its still horrible and despite the fact that i like nwn in general i cant think of an excuse for this
its as if bioware has been deaf to players comments for the last few years i hope they remedy it somehowdespite its pitfalls neverwinter nights goes a long way to addressing the need for a customizable computer dd experience
it is definitely a revolutionary step up from baldurs gate in terms of this aspect and it has a great deal of potential
i am looking forward to seeing what bioware is going to do with this proprietary engine in the future
for now all those who enjoyed the infinity engine games or wish to try out a dd crpg are heartily encouraged to get a copy of neverwinter nightsthe world is interesting and complex
the character generation system allows for a totally customizable character
you can build the ultimate theif a kicking mage a genius technologist a hulking combat monster a smooth charmer conman or someone who is a mix of any of the above
there are tons of mini quests to keep you interested and the main quest is pretty interesting
it also has a world builder engine to let you make your own sub modules although i personally didnt try thisthere are some draw backs
unlike bg all interaction is by dialog boxes
i missed having my companions characters talk to me and they felt bland and souless compared to minsk and boo etc
you dont have control of your companions progression and that can be a problem if for example you really want your healer to stand in the back and use arrows rather than be up front getting clobbered
he will never develop a bow skill
i dislike the level cap at level   i got to level  and there was still a good bit of the world left to explore
but it felt kind of pointless since i had ceased to improve
when the finale takes place you are not returned to the world to continue your quests so there are still some left uncompleted
lastly i wish they would improve the monsters as you progress
i got awfully sick of fighting ailing wolves by the time i was high level
there are lots of monsters some of them very formidable
but each area tends to have its own types and these never change
since you do a lot of running around near tarant with is low level monsters they get rather dulloverall however its very orignial and well worth playing
one important thing to note
it is fairly important to get a good persuasion skill early in the game
a lot of the npcs wont open up lines of inquiry or quests for you unless you are reasonably persuasivei hope that sierra makes some sort of sequel for this game and addresses the issues from arcanum because they have a potential legendary game on their hands
but this game fails to live up to its potential
arcanum is fun but its disappointing in some areas toothe highlight of this game is its innovative skill point system for character development and enhancement
it is kind of overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it you will really like it
your character can spend skill points in a ton of different attributes and abilities
they basically center around basic world skills like haggling and lockpicking technology skills which allow you to build weapons and potions from junk and magic ie
casting spellsthe technology skills are especially interesting
you buy a gallon of fuel find a rag in the garbage can and if you have the expertise you combine it into a molotov cocktail
or you find a couple of roots and make them into a healing potion
with the technology skills you are basically finding or buying low value items and making them into high value items
the items that you can build increase in usefulness as you allot skill points to them
so at the beginning of the game you can only refine ore but later on you might be able to build a fancy set of plate maili was very happy with the nonlinear plot line and the huge world with its numerous sidequests
this game rivals baldurs gate in those fashions
i also enjoyed the music
it is perfect at setting the th century roleplaying scenebut i found a few things to be very disappointing about this game  the cosmetic aspects of the game like graphics animation and sound effects are very mediocre
this game underacheives badly for one that is so young
normally i dont care all that much but it this case it really detracts from the game
the detail level of the characters and scenery is minimal
every building in almost every city look largely the same
cinematic cutscenes are nonexistent
somewhat dated games like baldurs gate and planescapetorment still have much better cosmetics
if you didnt know better then you would think that arcanum was released five years ago
the inventory system for this game stinks
this is especially annoying for this game because utilization of junk like metal springs and tobacco leaves plays such an integral part so you have to carry tons of stuff with you
even simple tasks like switching weapons with one of your followers are tedious if your inventory is getting full
you cant control the actions of your followers nor can you control how they develop
this was the biggest disappointment to me
half of the games strategy goes out the window here
you cant build up one guy to be a thief type character and build up another guy to be a battle tank
even if you could your followers just rush head on into melee at the beginning of every battle so clever tactics go out the window too
this means that ranged weapons like bows and guns are hardly useful
pretty much ever battle ends up as a melee hackandslash fest
after a while the battles in this game get very repetitivei hope that sierra makes another arcanum with some of these issues addressed
it is a creative game
it just has a few things to work onyes yes yes the graphics arent the greatest and the load times are long and there are bugs even with the patchi was credited with completing certain quests without even hearing of them but this game tells a fine tale showcases a rich world and provides a rich system of gaming to delve intoin case you didnt know this is a world where an old school fantasy world is coming into the industrial age
this is a world of mystic plate armor and revolvers dwarves with shotguns and elven mages summoning demons next to a train
the various quests available illuminate the problems that arise when new ways clash with old
the things you do in the game can range from questing for a magic sword that is the only weapon capable of killing a demon to arguing for the unionization of orc factory workersproblems
interface is awkward
theres no keyboard button to initiate combat
instead youve got to click on a button on screen
usually by the time you do that that angry halfogre with the mystic great sword has already closed the distance
this makes ranged weapons less than desirable since hand to hand weapons are far more potent and its easy to get into melee range in just one turn two if youre really far outalso despite the openness of character development there are some odd omissions
for example while you have the option to create a variety of technological items you dont seem to be able to create magical items
those have to be found or bought
plus i dont see why certain races dont allow you to play as female characters
the manual tries to give explanations for why female dwarves and halfogres arent around but i think thats just a copoutas for an earlier review that talks about not being able to do something about the abuse of women i think i know one of the scenarios thats being talked about but i dont know what the complaint is
this is a game where youre pretty much allowed to slay everything that walks so you are able to cathartically pulverize those awful pixelated charactersi purchased arcanum without having any information other than what was on the box but it sounded like something right up my alley i really love rpgs and this looked like a good onegetting started with arcanum was almost intolerable to me but once i got past the initial troubles trying to read the manual it became really entertaining
the atrocious manual though lacks an index or even a table of contents
its also written in whats supposed to be a clever style of olde tyme but which is actually just infuriating and annoying
i had a devil of a time finding actual helpful information and generally just had to figure things out on my own
once i got the basics down though i enjoyed the game tremendouslycharacters are completely customizable  every skill every nuance is able to be changed and the npcs in the game react differently to characters having different abilities and appearances
its a bit difficult getting started this way because of course you want to become good at something without totally neglecting the other items so its an exercise in patience and strategy
ability points are doled out only one at a time at first and then at certain intervals two at a time
still its frustrating to choose which spell or ability to level up as each affects something elsei chose a magical path rather than a technological one and stuck to it almost exclusively
hence i cant comment on the technological aspects of the game
the magic and spellcasting interfaces were quick intuitive and easy to use something i really appreciate in this sort of game
likewise the combat system is excellent if you prefer realtime combat that mode is available
however if you cant keep up with the computer then you can easily switch to a turnbased combat system which is what i preferred for simplicitys sake
inventories are easily managed especially given the cleanup button that immediately organizes everything into the most compact space and trading with npcs is basically a snap
the graphics are very good and diverse in texture and color and i enjoyed the juxtaposition of technological and magical charaters and cultures
there is a tremendous variety of weapons armors and sundry other items available for use and it definitely pays off to get into every single locked chest you come acrossthe story line is sufficiently complex involving twists turns mysteries and surprises and the number of available quests is outstanding
its a very nonlinear game letting you explore many areas of the world more than once and oftentimes finding different items in places youve already been
you may be joined by any number of other characters who add different skills extra fighting power and more inventory capacity to the party
some people will refuse to join you if your reputation is too good or too evil  each act you perform contributes to your overall disposition and also to how members of your party view you
if you anger your party members they may choose to leave youthe land of arcanum is huge and i greatly enjoyed the ability to teleport around in it thereby saving valuable time and energy
however the folks at sierra came up with an innovative longdistance traveling method thats great too on the world map one is allowed to select waypoints and paths to different main areas and dungeons and shows your progress with a red cross following a path much like the movies of yore
not requiring dull boring firstperson travel across the entire land is very refreshing
there are many many hours of entertaining game play to be had herethe load times for the game are a bit long and there were a few bugs in the system especially in the maps  occasionally labels for buildings would get mixed up between towns resulting in buildings with half their name from one town and half from another town
further there were bugs that disallowed completion of certain quests which is always infuriating
however there were no bugs that i would call absolutely fatal to the game
there were certain quests that were so picky as to what had to happen that i had to look up a walkthrough site to find the answers
even then however i wasnt able to complete them all due to bugs or having clicked on the wrong item or something
further there were times when i stumbled upon an area or a person in the land that i wasnt supposed to bump into until much later  this sometimes caused problems with quests related to that area or personone thing that really honked me off was suddenly being unable to level up any further  i was unaware that once a character attained level  that was it
i was increasing my persuasion skills to finish another quest and suddenly  poof
no more level buhbye
i had used my level points from  levels and still needed about  more to attain the right level to finish the quest but all of that was wasted  not only did i not get to the persuasion level i needed but i had blown those valuable skill points on something i didnt need anymore
argh
still with the skills i had otherwise acquired finishing the game wasnt difficultthe graphics were good but a bit behind the times especially given the long load times
this is definitely a game that can be played again and again because how the story develops will depend entirely upon what sort of character you play how you react to differing npcs and which quests you complete
even the ending cutscene is customized to tell you what happened because of your actionsoverall i give it a thumbsup but perhaps im just easilyamused
i like the genre and a game that gives me hours and hours of enjoyable play is just dandy by me
i truly hope they come out with a sequel that will update the graphics improve upon the manual and be a tiny bit less clunky overallfirst things first i loved arcanum
man it was so nice to have a decent rpg come out that was not centered around hack and slash
not to bash diablo or anything but the repetive hacking can get old and with a background story that does not care what you do leaves me wanting just a little bit more
thats where aracnum comes in
it basically takes the best of fallout and puts it into a richly detailed and unique fantasy world
the beginning of the game was very good and had some nice hooks to draw me in
and then after that it didnt let up and i had to keep playing to figure out more of the cool story complete all the cool quests and see the new areas
i absolutely loved the alternate situations throughout the game
i believe that is one of the biggest things that made the arcanum game stand out from all its predecessors
and another cool thing was that if you beat the game with one character you could replay it with another character and have a brand new experience
the only drawback i had with the game was the level limit
i reached level  way before the end of the game and found myself running from almost every random encounter because i could not reach a higher level and it was getting real boring beating up every monster that came after you
and another drawback i found was the ease with which the end guy could be beaten
i expected a very tough enemy but it only took me two tries to beat him down
the first so i could see what he was all about and the second to counteract all his moves and put the smackdown on him
but those are very minor details and the overall game was a satisfying rpg experience
i hope to see more types of these rpgs in the future and less action oriented rpgs
sorry action fans rpg does stand for role playing game which means playing a role not clicking a mouse button as fast as you can
maybe they should come out with a new genre hack and slash and keep it seperated from rpgthis game is pretty different from any other rpg out there and that makes this game quite a bit of fun
i played this game over  timesgreat replayabilityarcanum was one of my mostanticipated games this year and i bought it as soon as it came out
i wasnt disappointed at all but it didnt blow me away like i thought it wouldthe graphics are fine but a little washed out and grainy
the story is engaging but not as compelling as for example quotfallout quot which was made by the same companythe classfree character creation system  in which any character can learn any skill  was a nice change from dampdbased rpgs like quotbaldurs gatequotthe steampunk world was wellrealized and i especially liked being able to make useful items from junk i found in garbage cans
the game did a great job of making the struggle between magic and technology affect the individual character
that gives arcanum good replay value because it will really be a different game for a technological character than it was for a magical oneoverall arcanum is a good game even if it didnt live up to my stratospheric expectationsi almost stopped playing arcanum before id really begun because the interface was so intricate anduharcane
this is not a game one can simply hop into without reading the manual
after a few frustrating false starts i got the hang of it and the fun began to commencethe range of choice in this game is staggering
you can use a premade charcter or create an entirely new one and fully customize either
the maps are expansive and full of goodies and theres no penalty for simply wandering around and collecting quests that dont particularly drive the main storyline
depending on how you interact with people and what quests you take your characters goodevil alignment can change opening different options and queststhere were a couple issues that caused the game to rate at a  rather than a  overall downloading the patch from the arcanum website seems to have solved some of them most of the problems seemed to be with nonplayer party membersoccasionally someone wandered away from the party into the thick of enemy territory to pick up a random old pair of boots 
or something of the like and i had to dive in and rescue them from the hoarde of baddies theyd just trundled obliviously through
also a couple of times the npcs noticed an enemy behind a wall they all clustered there unresponsive waiting to fight until i picked a lock to open a door or ran around back and killed the enemy myself
frustratingdespite these few annoyances arcanum has infinite replay value and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for an incredibly flexible rpg with an immersive story and intricately crafted worldalthough deffinately hopping on the bandwagon and trying to emulate games like baulders gate and icewind dale who wouldnt want a game that popular
 arcanum is very similar to the long drawn out and what i sometimes find very boring world of rpg games like the two aforementioned
i tend to prefer the hack and slah without much thinking about it diablo  style of playin other words im that friend who tried to kill all of the townspeople when you tried a multiplayer game of icewind dalebut arcanum is somewhat different
i havent figured it out yet but for some reason i happen to like this game rather than spend  on it get frustrated  minutes into the game and end up giving it to my friends girlfriend like i did icewind dalei think it was how the chickens fought back when you attacked them yeah that was hours of amusment for methis is a great nostalgic d fighting game that still have some life in it in my opinion
i prefer street fighter iii nd impact over third strike
im not sure what it is but it just feels like a better game overall
if you are a hardcore d street fighter fan owning this game is a requirement to complete your collectioncalling street fighter iii the third game in the street fighter series is just plain silly
lets face it
between all the alpha games all the vs games and all the quotupgradesquot to street fighter ii weve seen more games in the past decade bearing the name street fighter than weve probably needed to see
the journey to game number three has been on a long hard road
every time anyone hinted at the possibility of an sf it always turned out to be another offshoot of the street fighter line
well capcom has finally graced the world with its quotthirdquot street fighter as well as two upgrades to the game second impact and third strike
the arcade releases of the street fighter iii games have been met with mixed reactions
many people were disappointed that only ryu and ken made it to the third game though akuma was added in second impact and chunli is in third strike and the new characters just didnt seem as interesting as guile dhalsim and the rest of the sf gang
others couldnt get over the slow game speed  after years of playing games like super sf turbo and street fighter alpha many players felt that going back to such a slow speed made the game seem like it was stuck in the mud
the game did add a parry maneuver that when mastered really changed the face of the game
parrying an attack caused the attacker to seize up for a brief moment leaving plenty of room for a counterattack
but even with this bit of innovation many people stayed away from the game entirely or simply didnt feel like learning the styles of the new characters
as a result street fighter iii double impact which contains both the original street fighter  and the second impact upgrade may find a larger audience on the dreamcast
street fighter iii eschews the more cartoony art style  found in say the alpha series  and strives for a slightly more realistic look
since the arcade game ran on capcoms cps hardware all the other recent street fighter games have run on the older cps system there are many more frames of animation to be seen
elena is of course the best example of this as she is constantly moving around in all of her stances
unfortunately elenas fluid animation makes the rest of the characters seem a little stiff by comparison
all in all the game appears to be an excellent port of the arcade version with absolutely no waiting for things to load between rounds or fights
the arcade versions sound has also been well duplicated
controlwise the game plays as you would expect a d capcom fighter to play
so you may not want to use the default dreamcast controller with the game as the l and r buttons are definitely less than optimal
there are a couple different controller choices on the market our favorites being agetecs joystick and the ascii fighter pad ft which is only available in japan
both of these controllers make playing street fighter iii a much better and in the case of the joystick truertothearcade experience
while including both the original sf and second impact is a nice touch second impact is a much more refined game and you wont really be going back to the original game very much at all
also it would have been nice to see this package include third strike and become a trilogy of sorts rather than release third strike on its own
there is definitely a lot to street fighter iii
if youre one of the people who has shunned the game since its release in the arcade you may want to give this collection a chance
since you wont be paying per play to learn the games new characters its easier to just jump into the game and start messing around
you just may be surprised
however you may just want to wait for third strike which is currently available in japan and is releasing here later this yeari bought this game not knowing what to expect
i had a coupon it was about to expire so i purchased this game
i am so glad i did
army men sarges heroes  allows you to play over  different levels of blasting tan grey and blue plastic scum along with defeating zombies robots and spiders
boot camp is still as fun as ever and youll have no problem beating p with cheats such as all weapons and maximum ammo
from playing on top of a dinner table to jumping onto a giant ham in the freezer all the way to defeating general plastro and his partner brigitte bleu while saving your team inside a pinball machine
why only  stars
ill tell you why multiplayer
you can choose from  places in multiplayer which is actually fine
all the weapons and every character is playable in multiplayer
but you know what
its not all that fast
maybe its just me but the more players you start to use the game slows down
its really annoying with the choppy movement
overall i would say its a definite buy
it says intended for the n expansion pack but my game seems to work to the full extenti like this game because this was the first game that taught me how shoot bad guys and not get feared by games similar to gun fighting like missionimpossible or something
it taught me how to strafe and better at gun shooting games
that is why i like golden eye  the guns are cool and stuff but i wish it could be more real
cartoon violence doesnt really have the potential like golden eye  but i like it anyways
i also like the courses and how they design it
even the objectives are funnyrecently ive been looking for rpgs which are in nontypical settings
you know what i mean by typicalthe usual sword and sorcery tromping through dungeons caves and forests fantasytype setting
i love those settings dearly but i was looking for some variety
i played parasite eve many years back and loved its creepy horror vibe and so i set out to find a similar horrorthemed rpg
i dont play typical survival horror games because the older ones usually have those tanklike controls that i despise and most of them are shooter based and i couldnt aim to save my life which is why i play turnbased rpgs
youd be surprised how few horrorthemed rpgs are out there but anyway my research led me to koudelka
i know this is the forerunner for a series called shadow hearts but i havent played any of those yet and i dont know whether or not i would like them although i may give them a try in the future
anyway lets get on with the reviewgraphics score  the graphics look a bit dated by todays standards obviously
they actually look about onpar with parasite eve to me anyway
id consider them to still be pretty good for their time
the cg cutscenes are numerous and all pretty good although i felt that the peoples faces look a bit odd but thats ps graphics for you theremusic score  well this is kind of a mixed bag
on the one hand the music is quite nice on the other hand there isnt much of it
speaking of hands i think i can count all the fulllength songs in the game on my fingers
the opening song that plays during the title screen is quite lovely a sort of haunting female vocalist and there is a battle theme which is really relaxing and not particularly creepy a song that plays after battle and a couple boss themes
but thats about it seriously less than ten i think
the vast majority of the game is silent except for sound effects footsteps creaking doors wind etc
i understand that they were probably going for an atmospheric effect but i feel like it wouldve been so much creepier if they actually had creepy music present
if they wanted to use silence for atmospheric effect i feel it wouldve had more impact if some areas had creepy music but other areas were silent like say the outdoor areas only having the howling wind sound
that way there wouldve been more of a contrast
i feel like this game really suffers from the lack of music
now onto the voice acting
its kind of unusual to see a ps game that has voice acting but its here
unfortunately there are no subtitles sorry hearing impaired people
as for the quality of the voice acting
well its okay
its not exactly awesome but ive heard much worse before  so its okaycharacters score  this is another mixed category
i liked the characters because they all had distinct personalities
however they spend the vast majority of the time bickering with each other which can be very annoying to listen to
there isnt a whole lot by way of character development although james does seem to develop a bit from being a selfrighteous prick to slightly less of a selfrighteous prick
this is probably because the game is very short about  hours
most of the character development is focused on learning the backstories of koudelka the spirit medium james a selfrighteous prick oh and also a bishop and edward treasure hunteradventurer
it does feel rather satisfying once you learn more about these people
by the time you reach the end of the game there is some slight development since they stop bickering as much you never get the sense that they ever like each other but they do come to a sort of understanding with each other
for such a short game the characters are handled pretty well but not spectacularly so this section gets an average score of story score  the story is pretty good
it weaves together several smaller subplots like the backstories of some ghosts into a main storyline about a heart broken man trying to resurrect his dead wife
the storyline isnt sweeping and epic insomuch as its atmospheric and unsettling
thats perfect for this type of game
i only wish the game had been a bit longer so i couldve gotten more detail out of the story and a bit more dramatic buildup
nonetheless its still satisfying
also there are three different endings one occurs if you fail to get a certain item its pretty much a gruesome automatic deaththe really bad ending the good ending happens if you beat the final boss and the bad ending happens if you fail to beat the final boss
i actually prefer the bad ending its the most interesting in my opinion
so overall the storys not badbattle system score  the battle system is turnbased but you can also move during battle on a grid much like chess pieces
the main problem with it is that battle animations are slow which means that battles are slow
thankfully im a patient sort of person
besides this problem is mitigated by the fact that the random encounter rate is pretty low and it is fairly easy to level up
so you wont be spending overlong amounts of time in battle
if the encounter rate were really high or it took forever to level up then this problem would be cripplingly bad
as it is however it doesnt pose much difficultyi actually found battles to be rather relaxing probably due to the relaxing battle musicgameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
i really wish i could use the analog stick
however i dont think its really this games faultmaybe it was made before the analog stick was fully implemented into the ps controller
but anyway movement feels a bit stiff and you constantly have to press x to move up and down stairs
this wouldnt normally be a problem except that some areas have tiny little steps and it takes a moment before you realize why youre just running in place
furthermore if you arent in the perfect alignment the game wont let you go up the steps
those are actually the only things that annoy me and even they arent too badeverything else is fine
on a side note i really enjoyed reading all of the little item descriptions
another thing i liked was the fact that this game requires a little leveling here and there but nothing excessive
there arent any massive grindfests required to finish at least until the final boss and thats only if you want the socalled good ending
i know im a huge fan of rpgs but grinding isnt the fun part so im really pleased with this gameoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
this is one of those strange games where most of its individual parts received the average  score but my final score is higher
i think its because the whole experience is more than the sum of its parts
i really enjoyed playing this game its just a fun likeable game even if it isnt perfect
given that there arent very many horror themed rpgs out there koudelka hits the spot
so yeah im pretty pleased
if youre a fan of rpgs and you feel like fleshing out your gaming collection you should pick koudelka up and give it a tryi think youll like it just as much as i didlets just get straight to the heart of the matter with this game koudelkas most common criticism was the speed of its turn based battle system
admittedly the battle system is unnecessarily slow
however that is buffered by a low encounter rate
for those who have patience for the lethargy they will be rewarded with one of the most unique jrpgs ever developed
primarily koudelkas mature characters and plot are extremely unique and enjoyable no wecansavetheworld teenagers here
that is if you can deal with a heavy dose of the macabre
koudelkas plot contains subject matter that is entirely adult suicide murder child abuse child prostitution for starters and the gore factor can be high at times
these elements are made believable thanks to excellent voice acting and fmv that holds up well for its age
further strengths are creative and diverse enemy variety fantastic atmosphere and a protagonist you will find endearing by the end
my only complaints are the brain dead simple puzzles and weak ost
this games composer is world renowned but he utterly dropped the ball with koudelkas quirky but illfitting soundtrack
well if you are an open minded player with patience give koudelka  a shot
it might not be a masterpiece but its an innovative and completely unique experiment that i doubt well ever see attempted again
koudelka billed itself as a survival horror rpg and it delivered exactly thatim glad i bought koudelka and gave it a try
i am a big fan of final fantasy games and was curious to try an rpg with a horrorsurvival twist to itbecause it is a play station game from around the year  despite having  cds included it is not a long game
i played it through to the end in about  hours of game time
the game takes place in a large haunted monasterycastle in through the game you experience every part of every creepy room secret passageway and dungeon of the monastery
you fight lots of undead and weird monsters some are pretty outthere like animated furnature that attacks you solve a few puzzles and overcome some challenges as you would expect with an rpgone reason koudelka will be a memorable experience to me was just the feeling of trying to survive a jarring creepy scenario while not knowing what was coming next
while it has monsters boss monsters and character levelingup like you would expect it also has some unexpected challenges like weapons breaking on you in the middle of combat and spell effects and combat elements that vary with range and location on a combat grid
you raise proficiency with each individual weapon type but you cant be sure what weapons you will have as the game progresses
i thought it was successful in keeping the player on his toes and a little uncomfortable not knowing what was around the next corner which added to the horror effectthe characters and plot are fantastic
i loved the edginess of the characters who were thrown together in the horror setting and have some basic disagreements but learn to work together to improve their chances of not dying
there were several scenes and a great ending that will always be memorable
each of the three characters was interesting and more complex than you would expect especially for such a short gamethe graphics are a little blocky as you would expect from this era
also the combat is slower than more recent modern rpgs
combat is turnbased and the ps computer i played mine on an old ps not sure if that affects time does some churning between each turnaction so beware the slowness of the combat if that would be a dealbreaker for you
i liked the weapons spells and leveling up
i found the relative challenge of fights varied a bit with my characters somewhat overleveled at points in the middle but a nice challenging uptick in difficulty towards the endif you might be frustrated by a slow turnbased combat system from the year  you might want to avoid this one
but if you want to try an rpg that is creepy because of a great plot setting and characters as opposed to constant gore or cheap shocks you should seek out a copy of koudelka and give it a try
i got a used copy on amazon but it wasnt cheap  i guess the game is harder to find now being out of print for a while
i really like the game overall and plan to try the shadow hearts series next which i believe is a continuation of the theme started with koudelkalets face itthe command and conquer line has earned its place in gaming history and will continue to be apart of that history for a time to come
blending a great deal of strategy with economics
this game is one of the middle level games on the ladder of the great games that have come from the good people at electronic arts as far as cc games go
the game is graphically impressive and is a dream in playability allowing the use of various strategies to achieve one objective
but the game is still a spot linear in achieving these objective
the units in the game however are suppose to earn intelligence with the amount of combat experience they recieve particularly the infantry
i never saw this losing more infantry that any other unit in the game even the armor which i utilized most but this did not really detract from the overall experience
the storyline is still as good as red alert and lays the ground for later command and conquer games to come
so if you can find this game cheapi suggest you pick it upitll give you a decent amount of fun and might make you think a littletiberian sun
wow
wowwell this is  strategy game
ach how can i start the review
this is a good rts
you take the side of a commander fighting for the brotherhood of nod nod or the global defense initiation gdi i think that stands for gdithe two sides are different and graphics are pretty good
ts is a deep game and you have to play it for a long time to find out each sides strengths and weaknessesone thing that needs some repairing is the skirmish ai
its not that smart and itdoesnt need to explore
moneywell im a newbie to good reviews so its byefor now muahahaive always been a fan of the command  conquer line of games
i really like the older red alert series of cc games and being slightly less aggressive than many of my friends i tend to like to built and play my own maps
that said
i like this game
even though they tried to make the terrain more real and changed the engine some i found it fun to play
i still like red alert one best but this game will really pull you in
money well spentjust when i thought there were no good puzzle games for my soontobeantique n i broke down and bought pokemon puzzle league because the box made it look like a decent variation on tetris
i know almost nothing about pokemon and at first i got scared that i would have to learn a bunch of mindless information like names of creatures and spells and tricks and whatnot
and the game has a lot of the pokemon theme various dialogues talk about the trainers and monsters and other confusing stuff that would make perfect sense to a seven year old kidluckily this has nothing to do with the game itself
basically you have a variation of tetris where you need to connect three or more blocks of the same color either across or up and down
you can move a cursor and swap two blocks that are next to each other
and an empty block causes all of the ones above it to quotfallquot into place
pretty simple stuff and theres a practice mode plus a few simple and slow modes but then the pace picks up and the blocks accumulate from underneath eventually making the pile collide with the ceiling ending the gamethere are a few twists to keep the game interesting theres a twoplayer mode where you can add junk to your opponents screen by completing lines
theres also a d mode where the blocks are quotin the roundquot making it very hard to keep track of all of the new blocks while removing old ones
the whole think is thematically linked to a pokemon map with the games in a stadium the practice stuff in a university and so onthe play on this game is excellent with smooth controls and good sound effects
i quickly became addicted to this game trying to push my score just a bit higher with each try but the theme music drives me nuts
the only reason i am not giving this game five stars is that i had to stop playing and get the music out of my head
otherwise this is an excellent puzzle game  one of the funnest implementations of tetris ive ever playedit takes a normal tennis game and adds mini games and mario characters
what a  bang up job  they  nintendo  did on this gamemario tennis is a good game
you get to play tenis with the mario characters
there are a lot to choose from and the game is great to play at parties
while the game has its good things there are some bad things about it
the stadiums could have used a little work by making them more exciting there could have been more levels to choose from on multiplayer the characters to choose from are never ok they are either very good or they stinkthe game is a good game but not without iss many faultsalthough i didnt enjoy this game as much as mario golf mario tennis definitely upholds the level of quality displayed in golf
in this game even more characters are featured
i was quite shocked that they even have quite a few different tennis courts
there are even a few minigames feautured which helps to extend the replay value
the multiplayer mode is quite polished
i really enjoyed playing doubles in multiplayer mode
teamwork is critical in doubles mode
i was also amazed that the characters all had their own attributes and it is suprising that mario golfs characters feature so much variety
the cup mode is fun but this game is all about multiplayer mayhem
a recommended buywhen nintendo stopped making games for their nintendo  many people seemed to balme it on the playstation  ironically there are many video games that were still worth the price
for the good games like mario tennis it does suit that field just fine
the game features  different characters to serve up your life including mario and his brother luigi yoshi bowser and peach princess toadstool for those die hard mario brothers fans
the game also features amazing details of games including skilled ring games and tournaments and hidden courses with zany mario themesalthough many people still dont give sanction to cartridge games anymore unless they are on game boy advance mario tennis is dull for a oneplayer game but a smash for fouri was first exposed to mario tennis at a toy store
my wife and daughter  started playing instantly
i was amazed
at that moment i knew i had to buy  the game once it came out
well after playing for over a week now i must  say this is a very easy to play but hard to put down title
even if your  not interested in tennis as a sport just like mario golf youll enjoy  playing this fun filled tennis game
anyone can pick this game up and play  so invite some friends over and have a party
if youre into overly  complicated controls or realistic gameplay look elsewhere but if your  looking for an enjoyable game and pure mario fun pick up mario tennisaside from the graphcs this game didnt age bad at all
ive also never played this game and its very funi got this well actually my brother got it game for easter
now to my yearold brother of course its the coolest thing
its like having a real pikachu in your own house
i must admit it is very neat
its inexpensive and you can play it for hours
you start off by meeting pikachu and prof oak for you people who dont know pokemon prof oak is you could say the founder of pokemon
and explains stuff
you then continue along and say pikachu
into the microphone and he responds
i yelled idiot eiffel tower and haley barry to pikachu and he didnt respond
once i said pikachu
he perks up
how cool is thatthis game has absolutely no plot
it has even lesser of a plot than dude wheres my car
which is almost impossible
even though im  this game is still entertaining to me
pikachu does respond to your commands  of the time
the vru voicerecognition unit isnt the same as stephen spielbergs artificial intelligence but it makes the grade
of course when youre fishing pikachu does tend to ignore you
i will say pull
and hell release it
once i said youre so cute
because prof oak told me too
and pikachu electrocuted me and had an angry face and his affection level went down substantially
what it very cool is if you say quiz time
while in the house
pikachu will flash  pokemon and you say their names into the microphone
it will actually tell you if its right or wrong
however i think about  of the time it will not recognize the right answer and mark it wrong
sometimes pikachu will press a wrong button not your fault his
and you will suffer
overall gameplays a its bits so you cant expect much
all characters are pretty impressive looking
except when you play quiz time it is in d
the rest is very nice
pikachu cannot talk but he communicates with the tone of his voice and sometimes a little word balloon will pop up but it will be a picture
a flower for i understand a light bulb for i have an idea and a little black lined scribble if he is discouraged
sometimes the game glitches
pikachu will run then all of a sudden he will be in between a tree
it is very strange
overall except for the glitches graphics deserve a the sound is important
pikachus tone will tell you his feelings
most sounds are normal
oddish goes oddish
poliwag goes poli
poli
and charmander goes chaaaar
chaaaar
the music gets highly annoying though like a broken record
when you move a hand goes to the closest item
the weird sfx gets really aggravating
its not even a sound
it sounds like a single maraca shake
its really weird
overall the sound gets an speed is normal
because it is n cartridge it is very fast
unlike the new gamecube which because of mass producing and increased game space with cds that take loading time hyp is very fast
there is no loading time and it takes less than half a second between days where it saves your progress
speed gets a perfect now the one thing i must complain about is the controlling
i cannot stand it
ok if you hold z and talk then release it a bubble is sent to pikachu with your comments which works fine
but when you are trying to move around your screen always shows pikachu
you can be holding up and he will be going left or right
i cannot stand it and if you buy it you will understand my aggravation
the controls get a crummy the replay value is great
you can always play a level again and fishing is highly addicting along with pintildeata party
you will play it over and over
some games like caring for caterpie are not that much fun and will probably only be played for pikachu points
the replay will get a special  because it is so amazingoverall between all the pokemon games on the n hey you pikachu is probably the best in original plot and replaylets reviewgameplay graphics sound speed controls replay value total  giving hey you pikachu
an that game is very childish
however if you are a pokemon fan this is a amazing game
there has been no other game like this to speak to pikachu
the only issues are the game play is really childish and you have to search for the microphone adapter and clip in order to play the game and that can cost more then the game its selfi read this persons reiview and said the only fun thing to do is yell at pikachu
now that laughed my head offi got this game just a few days ago but i know enough about the game to write a reviewthis is basically a pikachu voice simulator where there is no objective
pikachu will respond to  spoken commands
the neat part is you actually use a microphone to communicate with pikachu
although there isnt necessarly an objective but its still as fun nonethelessthe graphics are very detailed and gcn quality
you can see each and every pokeacutemon in such clear detailpersonally i dont think that there is anything in this game that parents would find offensive
yes no violence blood and gore or anything elsethe music is so wonderful to hear that you will wont want to shut the game offalthough this game might seem childish when you feel childish and little heres a great game to help you feel wonderful
so just say hey you pikachuill explain the basics and stuff like that
here it islifespan  to  months of fundurability cartridge last a life time but dont mess with the microphoneendurance can only support  player mode and can only talk to pikachu
no multi player this time guys
this is a solo missionfun can do realistic things
too bad it turns night quicklyoverall  stars and that is it
a little flaws is the reason that it isnt  stars
i give it  starsive put off writing this reveiw to see if it could stand the test of time itself
i replayed it for the first time since  and relized this game is golden
the moment i began my quest as a deku link i was pulled in just like i was  years ago
though one feature the main feature of time bothered me
i felt like i had to rush everything into a quick senario
there is a song you can play to slow down the hours from about a minute each to about  and a half minutes
the gameplay is solid though like it always is and the tranforming was always a joy
there was really no plot to follow you could play the game as you desired it to be
the first time through i didnt follow any story line but i relized thats where the fun is
since it has entertained me since its  released this is a classicthis is truly an amazing game with the great playability that ocarina of time brought to our home and plus a great number of new possibilities by using masksto me the best point in this game link can act completely diferent flying swimming better rolling pretty fast dancing becoming a giant the game has a huge scenario with a beautiful sea snow scenes great castles and big enemies
but when you play weeks and weeks this big and difficult game you expect at least a regular ending with a big party and colorful scenes but shigeru myamoto made the same mistake in ocarina of time
the end of the game leaves you a felling that is something missing
maybe it s a strategy to sell a new zelda but i dont agree with this and i think we deserve a better rewardnot quite as good as ocarina of time but well worth the money
ocarina of time is better mainly because you can freely explore the world
as on majoras mask you have a certain time limit meaning you have go straight through the game
without exploring the mass new world
i do suggest this to anyone who has played and enjoyed the zelda seriesthis is a great zelda game and a must buy for any rpg fan
but where is zelda in this game
its kinda weird with all of the masks but the graphics are the best possible on n
i gave ocarina of time  stars so i had to give this less because it isnt as good
the time thing is interesting you can go back in time and collect the same  rupee then put it in the bank
there arent as many temples to explore like in oot
i beat this game a few months ago and i cant really remember any of the temples
but in oot i will never forget the infamous water temple
definatly buy this to get one last bang out of the dying n
i am upset that i will not have a gamecube to play the new zelda game now that i have crossed over to playstation  guess ill have to go with the final fantasy seriesheard they were pretty goodi have had this game for four years and have just beat it a month ago
this is a very good game but the mood is extremely dark
the moon is going to fall in three days plot actually scared me
other than that it is good fun to fight bosses and test your mind with puzzles in the templesthis is a side story in the zelda series
it is strange and nowhere near as good as ocarina of time but it is oddly amusing
it is a lot of fun to collect the masks and figure out what youre supposed to do with them
get all the masks before you go to the moon to reveal a very cool mask that is useful in the final boss battle
it is also fun to roll around as a goron fly in the air as a deku sprout and play the guitar and swim as a zora
your fairy belleor tatl in the english version can get a bit annoying however even more so than navi was
the time limit is also annoying  you cant take more than an hour to beat each dungeon or you have to start all over
definitely get this game if you like weird stuff or just zelda in general
i must warn you however  princess zelda is not a part of this at all and it doesnt really have much to do with the vague but existent zelda storyline
if you have a choice between this and ocarina of time  get ocarina of timethis sequelofsorts takes up after links last adventure and drops him into a town where he only has  days to save the town from certain doom
in this world an hour goes by in about a minute real time so this gives you barely over an hour real time to do the job
sound stressfulluckily link can use his ocarina to go back in time whenever he wishes in essence resetting that  day countdown
this can be helpful at times and really annoying at other times
reset in time and you lose all cash on you as well as any quest items but somehow the bank still has your money and you still have your masks
you lose your maps you keep your sword
does this make sense
no but its the way the game worksthe first section of the game is perhaps the worst designed and unfortunately this might turn players off before they give the game a chance to shine
it is relatively difficult to get to the ocarina in the first place  meaning you have to play over and over again without any ability to save
you cant leave the town either or do much of anything so the frustration can get high
just work through it or refer to a walkthrough because the game gets much better once you get the ocarinaonce youve got it you can save become link or many other creatures with the neat masks
the characters in the game react to you differently based on what mask you are wearing and you even get different skills based on the maskthere are a wide variety of interesting quests going on
meet one character and they are looking for another character
ask around and arrange to meet someone at a certain time for more information
you start carrying parcels around to various people and in the end youve made a group of people happy
a notebook you carry helps you keep track of who you talked to when and who you still need to help outthe time changes are great
dawn becomes slowly rosy and night descends with gentle dusk
thieves only come out at night characters go around on their business rounds and depending on the time of day or day of the week characters are doing completely different things
start back at day  and you can see it all happen againthe game tries to help out players with the time too
you can slow time down so it goes as slow as molasses or you can jump ahead to the next day if youre finished with your tasks for a day
you can jump back to day  at any time as long as you have the ocarina and owl statues let you save the game exactly where you are just in case you have to do something boring like eat dinneri find once you get past the initial stage of the game that it is greatly challenging and fun
it might be stressful for younger gamers because everything is extremely deadline based
instead of the old zelda where you could wander around and enjoy the journey as much as you wished in this game you have to race from point to point to get your current quest in before the  day cycle begins againif you enjoy timebased challenges and lots of jumpexactlyhereandthenthere kinds of action along with a bit of rp puzzling added in then you will love this newest member of the zelda familyfirstly i truly feel majoras mask   s but decided to round uplegend of zeldamajoras mask is a followup to the smash hit ocarina of time
the control scheme is the same the graphics are better mb expansion required the music is more to the original zelda games and the story is quite original and bizarre at thatthe game pits you in a mirrored world of hyrule called ternmina upon which link discovers that the moon will crash lest he do something to prevent it
then the skull kid whos commanding the moon turns you into a deku scrub sound interesting
the story is quite intriguing and a fresh change from the old captured princess and triforce
you have a three day time period in which to complete a certain task and then restart the day saving the game
some people would arrgue that this three day period isnt long enough
i say its too long
the game has a song that can slow time down when what it really needed was a song that speeded it up
certain tasks must be performed at certain times of the day leaving gaps of sometimes five minutes between each event
lots of times i found myself leaving the room to vacuum or something and then come back
and when you have to do the series of events over and over anju and kafei comes to mind it can be a real painalso the idea of turning into different characters goron zora and deku sprout seems more banjokazooieesque than zelda
but it does add a new twist to the gameplaypeople have said that the four dungeons arent enough
rest assured they along with all the sidequests and mask collecting are enough to keep you goingthis being said all this adds up to a wonderful adventure with lovely eye and ear candy but just isnt as fun as the first one and sometimes not very fun at allthis game will give you a long run for its cost quite a bit if you dont own the expansion but after accomplishing it once unlike other adventure and platforms i didnt have the urge to explore the world of termina againtoo much useless time gaps too little adventurethis is a very good game but it is a little to easyseems i say that a lot
the dungeons are quite challenging and the side quests are fun with the exception of one
anyone who liked oot will love this game and its just as short too
the masks are very cool and the notebook you get is a nice addition
no n gamer should not miss out on this one
short version graphics  sound  control  fun factor  total i just finished defeating quotthe legend of zelda majoras maskquot on the bonus disc for gamecube
it was the second time i had beaten the game the first on my n
and though i will probably be crucified for this i still find it inferior to quotocarina of timequot its n predecessor
realize that i am not calling quotmmquot a bad game
in fact it is still vastly superior to most of the games of its day and it also must be remembered that quotocarinaquot could be arguably considered one of the greatest games ever made
in fact i wanted to give majoras mask  stars for what it does best
like most purists i had my doubts about the three day time system but aside from a little bit of erroneous temporal physics being given a deadline is one of the biggest hooks of the game and its vastly entertaining to solve peoples problems before they even tell you about themand this is undoubtedly the best part of the game the way you interact with the hundreds of different characters whose movements you can often follow for the full three days
in quotmajoraquot youre given opportunities to collect masks heart pieces and other rewards by going out of your way to help the citizens of clock town and the surrounding areas
this is never better illustrated than in the story of anju and kafei a couple of lovers whose wedding plans have been permanently altered by the falling moon  the moon is more of a villain than the skull kidbut for me at least the game loses points in the actual dungeons
the dungeons in ocarina were engaging and though a player could definitely get frustrated parts of the water temple come to mind they were still entertained and managed to get through it to the boss
often the dungeons in quotmajoraquot were so ridiculously tedious that i wanted to turn off my system in anger but due to the erratic save points even this was impossible
remember the mirror puzzle in ikana castle
placing statues outside the stone tower
all the other puzzles that made you want to root for the moonin addition the boss battles are extremely inconsistant
gyorg the boss of the zora temple is the most sweargenerating boss i have encountered in a while yet the final boss can be taken out easily without the loss of more than a couple of heartsshigeru miyamoto is a genius
with quotmajoras maskquot he created another incredible linkzelda title and proved further that the interface works in d
however if given the choice between this and quotocarinaquot ill reach for the predecessor every timei played the legend of zelda ocarina of time in what a year that was
i had so much funthen in gameinformer magazine the new preveiws page said that there was going to be a new game called the legend of zeldamajoras maskit was about link going to a new land where the moon is falling and he has only  days to live and on the third day link has to play the song of time so that he can go back to the first dayi had to have itbut then half a year later when it came outi was very upset because when i played itit was too easy and i beat it in almost a weekwhen i playedocarina of timeit took me almost two yearsbut other then that it was a fun gamevery fun in facti really liked that you can upgrade your swordwhen in ocarina of timethe master sword is what you see what you get
pros to majoras maskthere are lots of masks that you can get and they give powerslike fast runningyou can upgrade your sword twicethere are new songs for link to play on his ocarina and there is a bank so link can have alot of money
consyou have to play the song of timeway to often because the moon is falling for some reason and you have only  days to livefinding more then half of the masks are very hard to findthe game has only four temples and they are all very hard way too shortbut all in all this game is worth around so if you like the other zelda games try this one tooi really enjoyed this game
its similar to ocarina of time in combat and style for those of you who tried it
that is it has action combat where you can use various items techniques and attacks
its easy to learn how to fightthe story follows link or whatever you decide to call him a boy who is looking for a lost friend
he was travelling through the woods when a skullkid a childlike forest dwelling creature with a magical mask and two fairies ambushes him and steals his horse and his ocarina
link follows the skullkid into a cave where he is transformed into a deku scrub a little wooden guy
the skullkid runs away and leaves one of his fairies behind
the fairy in order to reunite with her brother joins link
the two continue through the cave and get to clock town in the land of termina
clock town has a problem however the scarylooking moon is falling on top of it
link has three days to catch the skullkid who is using the mask to bring down the moon or the town is destroyed
its kind of tough to manage your time sometimes especially if youre new to zelda games and you have no help
but youll get used to itthe music is very nice
it matches the area and the situation like music for battle senimental moments or in the desert or at sea
i wouldnt mind having the soundtrack
the sound effects are realistic and the voices are decent
the graphics are good for na feature unique to this game is the use of special masks that give you certain abilities
a few examples are the bomb mask blows up the faerie mask glows when fairies are around and my favorite the bunny mask which makes you run faster and look adorable
there are a good number of masks to collect and you get them through interesting quests
there are three major masks that dont just give you abilities but transform your body
they are the deku scrub mask the zora mask and the goron mask
each form has its own powers and youll need them in certain areasthis is one of my top ten favorite games
it is almost though not quite as good as ocarina of time which is probably the best zelda game ever
there are few if any problems
i definitely recommend itmajoras mask takes pretty much everything founded in ocarina of time and throws it the dumpster
forget well constructed plot lines you will wont know what is going on for half the game
once i did piece together the story though it is quite deep with a very sad message to it
basically a creature named skull kid had been picked on and abandoned his whole life and decides to gets revenge by crashing the moon into clock town using a powerful and dangerous magic mask
i felt bad for him even if he did turn link into a deku
the gameplay is also different from the beloved ocarina of time
you only have  days before skull kid destroys the town and by  days nintendo means  hour
i personally find my myself better at playing it if i know a moon will fall on my head if i dont get things done in time
along with the ominous time limit you also have a ton of masks at your disposal
need to get into a palace filled with deku people
put on the deku mask and you will literary become a deku
want to explode
just put on the dangerous bomb mask press the button and watch as link blows up
the masks a new level to gameplay
majoras mask isnt as serious a game as ocarina of time but with the surprisingly deep and weird plot unique gameplay and creepy outdated cutscenes the clip of link being eaten by a deku gave me nightmares why not give it a trya great game but it doesnt have the zelda magic if you want a good n zelda i would get ocarina of timefirst of all i begged my mom to let me rent this game
she wasent very happy about it but she let me
i was kind od dissipointed yet satisfied
i was somehow shocked at how this game didnt have very bad content
the characters would swear every once in a while but really i dont think it needed a warning on the box
thet even beeped out a lot of words which i really didnt expect them to do for a so called adult game
they call it an adult game but is it really
there arent a lot of adults that would want to play this game
the camera is sometimes a problem and i myself didnt find the plot very deep and i sometimes forgot that he was trying to get home the whole time
multiplayer was great
you just have to understand what to do
at the beginning of the multiplayer game you pick of course they tell you what to do but they dont tell you all of what you have to do so i kept doing the wrong thing until i found out
besides those facts the game is greatps i just wish you could pick more than one level for a multiplayer matchway back when this game came out the hype was unreala mature game for adult gamerson nintendoyupand from the companies then golden child rare to top things offokso besides a dirty drunken foul mouthed squirrel what do we getspot on controlexcellent graphicinteresting moments of game playand of course a dirty drunken foul mouthed squirrelthe game play was what rare did best mainly hop around and collect thingseither you like the platformer collect a thons or you dontgranted by this time the formula was getting a tad stale after mario banjo kazooie and countless other collect a thons by various companiesstillan interesting game that was way ahead of its time in terms of adult contentconker is worth checking out for the sheer vulgar over kill alonerecommendedit took me forever to beat this gamebut boy was it so worth it
near the end of the nintendo s life span fans of that great console realized that the playstation dominated it in almost every way possible
not only did it get some of the best games from some of the worlds best developers they were churning out the hits as fast as they announced them
nintendos quality over quantity policy clearly didnt win over most gamers so fans of the nintendo  learned to be patient and to be humble
still the n was home of some of the best games that didnt get released on sonys console
and you can thank rare for keeping us fans busy with their excellent games
conkers bad fur day released in was rares last game for the nintendo  what started out as a cutesy mario style platform game featuring squirrels bears and flowers turned into the most sinister and foul mouthed platform game that anyone has ever seen
so take away the toilet humor perverted jokes the bleeped out cursing blood gore  suggestive sexual themes and you still have a great game worth playing throughyou control a squirrel named conker who just celebrated his st birthday by hanging out and drinking with his friends
he drinks way too much and sports a major hangover to the point that he cant find his way home
and this is where you come in
you help him sober up and find his way home but then he gets sidetracked and goes on a mission where he explores his world helping people along the way with their errands all the way until he goes toe to toe with the main bad guy who wants to take over his world
i dont want to give too much story away but rare borrowed elements from some popular movies of the time and blended it in here along with hilarious and outrageous moments that happen to conker
your character does not have any special powers or abilities you progress by helping out people you meet and through context sensitive events basically hit a specific button when prompted
the game saves your progress and when you are done with the single player mode or need to take a break from it you can try out one of several multiplayer modes by yourself or with  other players
the pros the graphics music controls and sound effects are top notch here and bring conkers world to life
the story is hilarious and while it makes fun of movies from the late s it still brings a chuckle or two out of you
its a long game so it will keep you busy and sometimes a little challenging
i havent played too much of the multiplayer modes but they are fun and are a good excuse to have your friends play along or against youthe cons the graphics can get a little choppy when the action gets intense but thats what to be expected
surprisingly this game doesnt require the expansion pack like other titles so rare could have taken advantage of it to prevent the choppy graphics or lessen the effect
also sometimes it is hard to figure out where to go next and a few of the puzzles really require you to think and observe your surroundingsthis game was a great example of how good gaming on the nintendo  got and while it arrived near the end of the consoles lifespan it still sold a decent amount of copies
it will be hard to get a copy of this game so it probably is best to get it used since a new copy would cost a lot of money
if you missed out on playing this game back or thought this was too kiddy to play then make the effort to find it
this is not for kids and only for the grown ups
i recommend it to all n fans and to those who never played it beforethis game is higly entertaining hilarious and overall greatthe goodgreat voice actinga healthy amount of south park style humorlove the various movie paradys saving private ryan the matrix aliens draculathe multiplayer mode is what really makes this game shinegraphics are goodthe badthe story has no real directionif it wasnt for the mulitplayer mode it probably wouldnt be as funthe uglynot a game for kidsdont let this cute squirrel fool you and his cool shoes conker is one funny character
first a little background for those of you that dont knowconkers bad fur day was the final product of the late great rareware this was before microsoft bought them and pretty much ruin them
as part of their cuteness and cartoon charm we knew they would come out with something cool
if you play the two banjo titles then you know what im talking about if you dont then i highly recommend playing those games
now this game took a  in content it still has that cartoony charm and cuteness but added parodies of popular movies saving private ryan the matrix and aliens the most notable one
the content is well in a nut shell toilet humor but only for like the first half of the game
also the violence and gore was added as well and also new was good voice acting lip syncing and facial expression this was unheard of at the time and its cool to see the expressions conker makes
however with the toilet humor gore some sexual content and swearing this game got an m rating in which it failed in sells in the us due to that rating but those who were fortunate to play it got a treat and one hell of an adventure
also this game had some polarizing opinions as well some say its the best platformer on the n while others say its a sorry excuse of a game using the toilet humor as a crutch to keep it afloatnow on to game play in terms of the game play its your basic platformer but since it was developed for adults however they made it easier so adults have a good understanding of playing the game which means less buttons to worry about
enter context sensitive basically you stand in a b pad and itll automatically do what needs to be done for the situation how your introduced to the idea is well interesting and funny at the same time
the cut scenes are pretty good for n title and the story is a wacky adventure that happens in a days timenow i gave the game a  star for fun but  stars for overall rating this is game is multiplicative in the beginning
its easy at first then just when youre cruising along you got a zombie stage you turn into a bat then the war
the war stage although short is tough
oh my god i dont how many times ive died because i kept getting killed or didnt know where to go
the zombie stage was tough because you have to aim and shoot their head of course but the tedizs shoots you and you dont recover that quick youll lose all your health within seconds
the final boss isnt very clear on how to beat it but the computer tells you how so that was cool and funnyok so is this game worth your money
well for one its a rareware game so its fun also it has multiplayer which i wont touch on because i dont play it
i will say this this game commands high prices ranging from s to the s
its a highly sought after game and not many copies were many either due to the low sales with the game
its also not for everyone but trust me youll like this game and its charm so give it a shot first via emulator and see for your self before making this purchase but i highly recommend it if you take my word for itconkers bad fur day is the kids game that browsed the adult section and then loaded itself on daddys private stash
bfd has its crosshairs directly aimed at the college audience and it works perfectly for the peeps whove grown up with mario and are now looking for someone less dorky
that is in between frat parties and other immoral activitieslooking past the hype surrounding the first truly adult nintendo game bfd makes you chuckle and drives you to keep playing
i would have liked some deeper action or at least a longer experience but this is still certainly worth the investment
now where did i put that bloody mary mixno
mario  is still the king of the nintendo  crop however this comes close enough to be second or third
first anounched as twelve tales conker  conker was supposed to be about conker trying to save his girlfriend berri from an evil cake andor acorn 
you would romp through a banjokazooi world with banjokazooi style gameplay and final there were many resemblences to banjokazooi
for instence you collected golden acorns to unlock new levels which much resembled the idea of the gold puzzle pieces you collected in you gussed it banjokazooi
however game sites deemed it way too cute so rare went back to the drawing board and came up with conkers bad fur day one year later
now the once cute squirle conker cusses vomits swims in peoples  and  and spoofs every movie he can think of star wars saving private ryan jaws terminater  the matrix and mission impossable to name a few
while most of the game is vugar as heck and is very well deserved of the m rating its also funny as heckanother good thing about the game is the different approch in the gameplay department
instead of the normal gameplay found in most rare games conker now has to do more puzzle solving jumping swimming and even shooting to keep the mature gamers intrest
you honestly are never sure how your going to play the game next
one minute i was herding cheese around the next i was trying to make cows  out as much well  out of their bodies as i possably could
oh and then i was in a warfield being attacked by tediez dont ask and then beingdracula
cbfd is by no means perfect
for thing the main game is too short while the mutiplayer modes are pretty boring
plus theres only so much i can take of a cussing squirle before i get sick of playing this thing
as long as your over  i highly recomend this gameas a rental
but if you find it for price or less then i gusse you cant go wrongmy only complaints are the  used price tag which is very unreasonable considering you can have just as much fun with other platform games on n banjo kazooie and mario  of course
only difference is this game is adult themed which is unique in its own
also it suffers from the same thing most games in this genre do bad camera angles
cant express how frustrating it can be having to wrestle with the camera just to correctly jump to certain ropes ledges etc
although these arent enough to make conkers bad fur day fall apart because it really is a great game
this being my first playthrough it has a hysterical and well thought up story
the difficulty like everyone else has mentioned is well intense this game can make someone rage quit just a heads up
though its just that more satisfying upon completion
i liked the challenge personally and i dont usually play hard gamesthe positives are well known
especially the graphics and voice acting
extremely well done props to former rare
im actually shocked that this title as well as  and killer instinct didnt save their company
anywho off topic
overall this is a pretty fun game and not an easily forgettable experience
despite the price tag there is a way to play this on the computer ill stop there
highly recommend for any genre of gamer
youve got to play this game at least oncesince i am a super huge mario fan i was more than happy when i heard he was finally making a return to the n
i am also a super huge fan of mario rpg for the super nes and i was ready for mario to really make a splash with this game
i am a little disappointed
the game is very nicely done and is very cute but a little too cute
mario isnt as fiesty as he once was
one of my biggest issues with the game is the selection of characters
i didnt like how you could only have mario and another character
and the characters you have to choose from are pretty lame
i would have like to see peachthe whole captured thing is getting old luigi toad and a whole mess of other mario characters
the low amount of damage and hit points also really ticked me offon the bright side the gameplay and graphics were very well done
the flat story book thing was neat but i hope it doesnt make an encore performance
the storylinealthough peach needs to learn some selfdefense is good and you do get to travel to some interesting places
paper mario is a good game
it is unfortunately geared towards younger players and that may turn some old schoolers away
but in the end like any mario game this one is worth a tryafter playing many hardcore rpgs on my computer i had decided to purchase a more lighthearted and simplistic game for my nintendo
one that i could start playing right out of the box without reading a  page manual like many pc games in this genrewhat did i find
a highly addicting game in the form of paper mario
ill admit this is my st yes st ever mario game and so far i really enjoy it
the most noticeable gimmick for this game is its unique take on teh graffics
you see mario his pals and his enemies all look like construction paper d figures and place them in a very rich and colored d environment
you never get tired of viewing this game from this perspective and in my travels around the mythical land in which the game takes place there are many locals to visit
ive heard the game is a mb cartridge which i can believe after just viewing a portion of the gamethe interface is done nicely and many of the controls are self explanatory
what the manual doesnt cover is easily explained onscreen in for lack of a better term some tutorials explaining new button features
some actions are highly depended on your reflexes so certain moves may be hard for those with slow reflexes
there is also a save feature throughout the game which helps the player as are many powerups and hidden items of mario loreokay the story is a tad cliche
bowser is back and kidnapped princess peach along with the star rod
your job as mario is to explore the land level by level thus opening new chapters in this unfolding story until you are strong enough to face bowser
however this is my biggest beef with the gamethe story is a little too in depth too long and too cute
when you first turn on teh gaem you lieterally have to spend  minutes going through a backstory that sets up the game itself
the cutscenes between chapters are nice too look at but can get tedious in all this cute banter between npcs
i found myself just hitting the a button to get past the contstant dialouge that serves no purpose other than drive the story on
oh and when any character talks get used to a constant chirping noise from them
yes all the characters have the same voice and it is just an annoying chirpthe puzzles so far are pretty easy perhaps they will get harder further into the gamei hope so anyway
but the turn based battles are strategy driven
yes you need to know what moves and in what order you should perform them as to save stamina flower points and hit points
and again reflexes help
it is the difference here that you score extra damage against opponents or defend succesfullythe stats screen is very informative
here is the heart of your character
from here you can see all the badges mario wears badges are like special items that do different thingspay attention to them for different combinations make for interesting side effects his health points to the next level coins earned star points earned members in your party yup youll meet characters who will join your partyand they have special abilities too that enhance what mario does in battles and morethere is a bit of good natured humor in the game too
some refernces may be over the head of some children but no harm done if they dont get the inside jokeall in all a very fun game in the rpg genre without all the bllod and gore of its pc counterparts
a good starting point for younger kids but adults alike
im  years old and my whole afternoon was sucked up by this last weekendif mario stars in a game its guaranteed to be great and that is just what this sequel to super mario rpg is
as far as rpgs go paper mario is no final fantasy but that doesnt mean it isnt any good
its true that it isnt very difficult but it isnt that easy either
and it wont take you as long to finish as the final fantasies but it should keep your interest and have you wearing a smile most of the timethe characters that join mario in paper mario are one of the highlights of the game
of course they arent deeply developed each with his or her own story but they are all unique in the various abilities that they use to aid mario
mario can use bombette a girl bobomb to blow up cracked walls sushie the cheep cheep to travel across water goombario a mario fanatic goomba to tell him about people and places and so on
these characters can also help mario during battles but more on that latersame as in super mario rpg mario enters into a battle screen after touching an enemy on the world screen
in this way mario can avoid repetitive battles by simply avoiding enemies
chrono cross is another good example of this battle entry system
also if mario touches an enemy with an attack eg
jumps on it hell enter that battle getting off an extra attack
battles are fun and strategic
just as in super mario rpg attacks can cause greater damage with the accurate timing of button pushes on your controller
if you press the quotaquot button just before mario jumpattacks an enemy hell attack again
thats the fun part
the strategic part which is also fun comes in the two types of attacks that mario can perform jump attacks and hammer attacks
with jumps mario can attack any enemies on the ground or in midair while with the hammer he can only attack a creature that is on the ground and at the front rank of the enemy army
but he wont want to jump on an enemy that has spikes or is enveloped with fire so that is when the hammer comes in handy
marios companions can also help in battles with their own unique attacks though only one character is allowed to participate at a time
bombette for instance can explode to cause a large amount of damage on the front ground enemy while goombario can use a headbutt to cause minimal damage on any enemy
later in the game marios companions will learn various other attacksat the end of battles mario will usually recieve quotstar pointsquot experience points
once he collects  of these points he will go up a level
it is at this time that you are allowed to customize mario a bit
you can choose to increase his quotheart pointsquot hit points quotflower pointsquot magic points or quotbadge pointsquot  quotbadge pointsquot are used to equip badges which give mario special attacks or other powers such as the ability to jumpattack spiked enemies
equipping badges is simple it is similar to the way you equip quotsupport abilitiesquot in final fantasy ix
say mario has  quotbadge pointsquot and the badges quotpower jumpquot makes mario jumpattack an enemy and cause more damage and quothp plusquot gives mario an extra  quotheart pointsquot
since the first badge takes  bp and the latter takes  mario can of course only equip one or the other
but dont worry any time you wish you can remove a badge and get back its bp so that you can customize mario differently with different badges
wait
thats identical to final fantasy ix
in paper mario mario will eventually get quotstar powerquot which he can use to summon the star spirits
these spirits will perform powerful magic that will aid mario such as restoring both his hp and fp at the same time or damaging all enemies with shooting stars
but the quotstar powerquot will have to recharge after each summoning and that can take time
that is why mario is allowed to quotfocusquot which simply fills up his quotstar powerquot gauge more quickly think skies of arcadias quotspirit pointquot systempaper mario is better than i had expected and i truly give it   stars
the only bad parts of the game are some boring activities such as delivering letters
all you do is go to one person deliver a letter get another letter to deliver go to another person deliver a letter get yet another letter to deliverthis wouldnt be so bad if you got some great item in return but it just isnt worth it for the occasional lame gift you receive
not all the activities are that bad though there is a quiz game that asks you various questions about the world of paper mario such as quothow many windows were on that housequot or quotwhat color pants was that character wearingquot  still paper marios games arent as fun as the ones found in super mario rpg
but if you put that aside paper marios fun interactive battles and its unique characters should keep you happyi picked up this game from a used game store awhile since i never got a chance to play it back in the day and i thought it was gona be stupid back then too but i was wrong and like it it kinda reminds me of super mario rpg and the mario and luigi series for gba and dsanything with the name mario on it tends to have the golden touch
just look at mario  one of the classics on the n and still an incredibly playable game
super smash brothers was another mario game that was amazingly funmario paper is more like an rpgarcade combination
it lets mario take on other characters to join his team and rotate between them to choose his current companion
he picks up different weapons and items each altering his combat techniqueslike final fantasy and other rpg games it also gives you some degree of customization over mario as he gains level in combat
you can increase his magic flower power or his constition heart power
you can collect badges as you go each giving you different strengths
you can manage which badge combinations you activate giving you interesting pairings of powergameplay is much like any other n rpg
you go from town to town killing bad guys as you go and talking to every friendly person that you meet
people give you clues about where to go and what to doon the downside for a rpg its extremely linear  you cant go through x door until you talk to y person and get your hands on z object
you have to do things in a certain order even if logically that wouldnt be truealso the peach character bugs me a lot
she could try to resist when shes captured but instead she sits and whines that someone has to come rescue her
no thought about doing anything for herself fighting is both good and bad
the first fight is exceptionally annoying because you get thrown into it with only one ability
even if you do that the best that you can you still get beaten and look like youve quotdiedquot
this will probably be really frustrating to first time players especially younger onesin general though it works reasonably well
its turn based so slower players wont feel rushed in making their choices
its pretty straightforward  the options are all laid out right in front of you
you have to learn which things work on which characters and the complexity builds slowly as you godefinitely a game well play through at this house and one id buy for my gaming friends but its a shame they didnt put just a bit more effort into playertesting it before releasing ita much better rpg than some of the others that have been on the nintendo  coughthqcough
although it is written in a childrens story format it has enough extras and a good story line to keep you entertained for hours no matter what age you may bei realize that this was at one time going to be a sequel to super mario rpg and i know that a lot of ppl like to trash this game because of nintendo decided to call it something completely different but its best to think of it as a completely new game since a lot of new elements are introduced in this game badges star pieces etc as well as new characters
the difference between the sequel relationship of these two games and chrono cross and chrono trigger is that this game does not bother with making a connection to the previous super mario rpg game since the game is called paper mario after all and not super mario rpg  also the game contains no previous characters from the first mario rpg
chrono cross on the other hand made a halfbaked attempt to connect to the previous chrono trigger game one third of the way thru it probably would of been better if they would of made an entirely different game out of it like nintendo did in this situationits funny how things work out
i was one of the lucky few to acquire a sony ps on time and yet all of my latest game purchases are for the dying nintendo  paper mario is the latest in the n line up and one of nintendos better iterations staring mario and his gang
naturally im disappointed in the absence of all of the characters
but that is a minor complaint since very few of the characters in the mario world have a part big enough to justify playing themmarios flattened appearance in a d world takes an open mind to appreciate
initially i really didnt like the game since it seemed a bit haphazard
when i saw the first commercials on television i was expecting the characters to appear and behave much like the um jammy lammy for the psx characters
where characters would fold and bend much like real pieces of paper
paper mario kind of falls flat here literally the characters are more like pieces of cardboard inflexible with the same image on both sides
the games battles occur on a sort of stage complete with hanging props in the background look for the guy wires i sincerely wish the rest of the game occurred on a sort of stage as well in a more obvious manner
kind of disappointing reallygetting past the quotfakedquot paper the game is actually kind of fun
the storyline is the usual quotsave the princessquot kind of thing that nintendo used since day one
but the actual game play is sufficient enough to keep a player amused for around thirtysix hours
after that its another few hours to squeeze every last secret out of the game
the addition of the quothelperquot characters and their families play a crucial part in adding the extra time to the game
i spent a lot of time running around doing useless errands for various characters for who knows what kind of useless thing
i never once traded anything for the star pieces i collected i never had the need to
once a player has discovered everything there is to know about the game the games replay value diminishes rapidly
its a safe bet that were going to see this game on the amazoncom marketplacethe games lack of appeal to older players and the late appearance on a dying game may be what kills this title
this is a better title for the younger players since the controls and camera work will not frustrate all but the absolute worst players
or for players who insist on owning every game that mario ever appears in
i know this is a weird thing to say but the  price tag as of this writing is worth the admission despite the less than forty hours of game play
nintendo is heading in the right direction with the paper look of mario
this sort of game will bring nintendo back to ground zero after the disappointment of mario  and the other games involving mario and lack thereof of luigi
are you listening nintendo
how about more games like this with the smooth camera work and responsive controlsi consider myself an experienced gamer so its not to be taken lightly when i say that  dalmations is a surprisingly decent game
sure its easy but its meant for the kiddies not for the hardcore gamer
the graphics get the job done without too much popup although its there and the voice acting is solid
if you need to get a game for a beginning gamer try this one outnot the best of the series but it is a great game i will recommend this to all my friends there are some really difficult puzzles in here and that is what i like about these gamesbut still it is not a bad game
i just finished it and am left not excited yet i still enjoyed chronicles throughout regardless
upon assumption lara is dead or either hopelessly lost her closest friends gather together and tell a few stories about her past adventures which you will play through one even includes when she is young yet again like in the beginning of last revelation when she traveled with von croy
and yet again she is with no weapons which can make that level definitely one of the harder onesnonetheless the entire game itself is not too hard
it isnt as difficult as tomb raider  or  thats for sure
the ending gets difficult on the last level but nothing more strenous than we had to face in the last few tomb raiders i think
i got through all the levels with hardly breaking a sweat
the entire game i think is just average difficulty for tomb raider fans whom have played both  and  already
if youre new to tomb raider then it might be hard though i would say if youre new to the series build up from either tr  or  then go on either to  or  at least beat one of them before attempting this
basically know some tr history before doing this one
if you have played tr before chronicles is no challenge
fun but no real challengei would say buy it if youre a fan of the series it is a nice addition
the stories are exciting and the puzzles are interesting enough
just dont expect much
it is really just a few stories of laras past adventures and thats itthis game is very good
one of my favs
there are some good levels on it
the black isle levels are different though because you dont have any weapons
the graphics are alright
the few problems with it are that some of the puzzles are kind of diffucult like the swinging thing at the end of the black isle levels
i havnt been able to get past there yeti used cheats to get to the last levels of the game if your wondering
also the part in the first level of the last story where you have to get down the ropewirebar thing before the fire stuff explodes and kills youjust tell me one thinghow is anyone suppose to know that that room is back there and that ya gotta back flip into it common
also you dont have the level editor in the ps version only in the pc version
still its a good game
i recommend iti like this its cute but if you use it too much you could get boared of iti used it for  months in a row but i got boared of it
i still use it sometimes when i feel like it
it counts how many steps you take
you play this game where you try to guess if the card is higer or lower
the lowest it goes is to a  and if you guessed right you earn watts
you have too give watts too your pikachu once a week
if you dont it will call you a meanie
its the st and only virtual pet thats color
and it doesnt beep like the tamagotchis did
thats all it does
and you cheek up on it to see what its doing
and if you have pokemon silver or gold you could trade watts from the color pikachu to your game pack to get mystery items
like i said its fun but if you use it to much you could get boared of iti got the package in excellent condition and in right time as it brought back childhood memories
i also had this game for pc which i thought was really funny the diffrence in the games
still
i enjoyed playing it againhow many of you have wanted to make you own rpg
well agetec thought that fighter maker would be able to simulate it
well many fans of fighters loved it but it did not have really the true feeling of creation
you could customize moves and where the various d models moved and such but overall it did not have an impact on the whole genre
well agetec has found the real way to do it
combine all the abilities to set everything and not just the moves and movements like on fighter maker you can even make your own graphics
but beware
this game not only has an incredibly long learning curve but it takes a really long time to make a high quality snesgenesis quality rpg
you can do anything with a little elbow grease though and you may want to wait until the release of the ps because they will have  mb memory cards for a lot of storage capacity
then  you thoroughobsessive compulsive guys that want to make  custom graphics thousands of words and tons of options and many other things can make a snes dream rpg
not for kids
too complex and difficult
not for guys with jobs
not for guys that have lives
this game takes up way to much time
that and the learning curve are the downside
this is much better than fighter maker but for those of you that liked the amount of options on fighter maker you will really be able to sink your teeth into rpg maker
if you like rpgs rpg fans get this game and make up a game of your own
who knows maybe someday all videogames will be made with engines like this one
it is a good introduction to overall creation of programs because you learn the general layout of games
get this if you aspire to make an rpg or just learn about making a videogamethe concept behind rpg maker is simple make your own rpgs and then store them on memory cards and share them with your friends
unfortunately the execution leaves a lot to be desired  but its still worth giving it a tryfirst off while the anime maker which lets you draw your own sprites monsters title screens etc
sounds good on paper its nighimpossible especially using the playstation controller
things are easier if you have a mouse but not by much
stick to using the provided graphics  there are plenty of them and you can spend your time designing your gamethe game design part is actually very fun and interesting  though dont expect to create a game within a couple of days
itll take weeks or months to make a decentlength game
the manuals dont begin to show the actual power of the program so play around and experiment
the graphics are very primitive  while no one expected polygonal graphics and fmv they would have looked mediocre back in  on the super nes
if you can get past that though theres a large variety of different graphics to use in making your gameif youre not willing to put some serious effort into learning the system and making your game then this probably isnt for you
but if youve always wanted to be a game developer give it a tryrpg maker will allow you to create almost anything you want and its amazingly easy to use for the most part
characters monsters skills and field maps are surprisingly easy to graspthe most complex parts of the game are probably dungeon creation and eventscenario creation
you will need to read the manuals there are two several times to get the hang of that but once you do you will be able to create almost anything your heart desires
cutscenes intro scenes endings in addition to being able to create ending scenes the game allows you to set snapshots to be used as a backdrop for the credits branching storylines or nonlinear play  if you have the time and the determination you can create literally anything in this gamehowever the tilesets the images you use to create dungeons are very limited and almost entirely fantasybased  creating an sf rpg here could be tough since you cant create tilesets
in addition the character graphics have the same bias   finally the musical selections are adequate at best
the ability to import music and tilesets would have been a great additionbut those are relatively minor caveats and rpg maker is well worth getting if you want to make your own rpgsfor those of you who are thinking about investing time into rpg maker  this game is just like that
there is one difference rpg maker  is for d games
if you like d games you can make a bunch
you can customize characters monsters backgrounds titles scripts eventstriggers effects dungeons towns spells attacks items and more
you could create a pretty cool d adventure
there are a few drawbacksyes it is time consuming
if you learn how to use the editor properly you should be able to do things fast
you dont need to be an artist to make characters but that takes time
use the implemented ones
as for typing
i tried on the controller but it removes all joy from the game
get a keyboard for your ps
it costs  bucks
go to search and type quotlogitech keyboardquot
find the one for ps and get that first
memory
that is another fault
buy like a  dollar memory card with space
one custom character takes one block
game data can go from  blocks
the sample game which is kinda boring takes  blocks i believe
you will probably stop playing it after a while
it gets hardthis game is good
there are a few drawbacks but it is great for people who want to create their own rpg
if you have a friend you could swap memory cards and play each others rpgsif you want d get rpg maker  if you want d get rpg maker  if you take the time to learn the editor and have a keyboard you will be fine on timethis game is in a doublecd case because it has two instruction manuals but only one disc
if that doesnt serve as a clue to its complexity i dont know what will
you have tons and tons of sprites for monsters characters objects and environmental set pieces
these range in style from scifi to olden fantasy and can be used for nearly any purpose their collision data is built in though so be careful the player cant walk over a deskits even possible to create your own sprites with the anime maker tool although its not even worth bothering if you dont have a mouse theres no support for analog sticks and the dpad is not fun to draw with
with the amount of text you have to enter in with the onscreen keyboard however its a shame the game doesnt work with any kind of keyboardoverall if you can find this game its worth your money
one precaution the game does not autosave anything so you have to be careful not to overwrite any system or scenario data
also its a shame theres no way to distribute your games aside from copying the data onto multiple memory cards and buying multiple copies of the gamegraphically superb
it is also challenging playing in single person mode
however like most fighting games the most fun is playing against one of your friends
this is the only real downside to the gameif you are a little skilled at the game you can put your opponent in a hold and make him tap out in only a few seconds
it takes a while to learn how to avoid these moves and if you not playing against someone who owns the game you will most likely just beat them very quickly match after match unless you agree that there are no submission holds allowed
so this isnt the type of game where you can just both get in the ring and beat on each other
it takes some practice to learn the special moves each fighter has and how to avoid submission holdsmy only other critique is that the game manual does little to help you learn how to play
so it is pretty much a just learn as you go type thing
other than that it is quite fun and entertaining
if you love fighting games you will like this one for sure
the standing grappling and submission positions add a depth that is currently unmatched by other fighting gamesunderrated gameit is slow pacedespecially when traversing across the huge game worldit would have been nice if you could choose to run faster or the like and it is quite difficult in the beginningbut if youre patient enough this game can become very rewardingit has good writing in the way of humor with a great story and is very clever going about it with the limited technology that the n offered at the timesave oftenaidyns chronicles is an excellent rpg if you forget about the zelda series
in aidyns chronicles you get to take on the role of ten different characters being upto a maximum of four at any one time
there is plenty of variation in this game as the tasks can be completed in any particular order
this is a great game and lets hope that they hurry up and supply us with a sequelthis game is extremely fun there are a lot of characters to choose from not as many as smackdown  just bring it or raw is war for xbox but still there are a lot
the finishing moves are great but the only problem is two things
one it is way to easy to perform a finishing move you can be about  inches away fromthe guy and still perform it  it is way to easy to build up your little quotbarquot in order to perform a finishing move and three triple h does not do a figure  leg lock and five when he does it his leg is going through the other guys leg
come on no wonder its rated teen for quotcartoon violencequotover and all this game is pretty fun but no where as good graphics game play and movement as just bring it or raw is war for xbox which is the best
oh and for those people who look more aobut me ignore the review about raw crashing
i got it fixed and now it works perfectlyin this game you can choose from  diffrent catergoriescompetition which is trying to become american idleparty play is a mini contest up to three people can play in and see who can do the bestkaraoke you can pick from a long list of songs to choose from and then you sing the written words to musicrehearsal its just what it says you can practice over and over again so you can be the bestjukebox its just like a real jukebox choose a song and watch your costumized player sing your fav songi give it  stars because i think they could have made the american idle part a little more in depth and because they didint use ryan seacrest but made up  new people for the hosts and another awsome thing about this game is that you can use a dance mat
i would recommend this game its great funi just got this game as sort of a late birthday gift my birthday is jan  but is fantastic
it is tons of fun to design your own guy and win competitions
however the only reason its not getting  is because there were some glitches in graphics and its not like you actually sing unless you have a mic
if you have a mic you can do karaoke mode where you actually sing but other than that you press buttons to keep your singer in tunemy ratings graphicssoundcreativityfunpeace and go to note  i did not give this game  stars
somehow the system has assigned that rating
it wouldnt let me rate it at all when i did this review and wont let me change it nowid say two stars maxreviewi really cant understand why some people love this gameperhaps it is the fact that you dont do the typical fight shoot fight shoot of so many other gameslets put aside the fact that this is not repeat not a karaoke singalong game as you would assume and as the box description impliesit is instead a way to make more money off the american idol show by creating a game
i just cant say game without quotes because it seems to similate a game rather than actually be one
the graphics are fine
a lot of hairstyle and wardrobe choices can be had for your singing cartoon characterbut i wish they had spent less memory and design work on that stuff  and more on game playbecause frankly in my opinion there is no subsantial game playit shows you an x  you hit the x with the beat of the songit shows you a triangle  you hit the triangle with the beat of the songit shows you a circle  you hit the circle with the beat of the song
yawnit shows you another triangle circle circle square beat beat beat beat yawn yawn yawn yawnit is simply an overglorified overpriced game of simon
no not simon the ai judge you remember simon  colorful buttons that glowed then you had to hit them in the right order to win
my sims bustin out game on gameboy advance has this same game  as a mini game within the main gameyes
this entire game is so sophisticated it can be replicated as a minigame within a gameboy game
impressive eh
they have attempted to make it more interesting by having your cartoon singer improve as you correctly hit buttons with the beatmaybe it is my game  but even that didnt work wellthe game would say great as i hit the beat  yet the singer would waiver notes and be flatthe minicompetions are even worsewhile you control nothing you are forced to listen to other cartoon wannabes sing flatif this game came out in  and was marketed by colecovision  or intellivision  it would have been breakthrough game playbut in   and with a  price tag  it is a pathetic attempt to make more money with no contentbuy it only if you dont want to have to fight shoot  or thinkafter reading through some of the reviews of this game it looks like some people disliked the fact that it has a large number of miniquest that you can complete
personaly i think that this is what make summoner a good game
i think that the longer it takes to complete a game the better
this game allows you to take your time and try to complete every miniquest or to just concentrate on the main quest which will still take you a while to complete
i usually get bored with role playing games after a few hours of play because they dont keep you involved in the game
in my opinion summoners many quest and overall style of game play help keep the game exciting even after hours of playing
the game does have a few bugs but nothing to big in my opinion
overall i think this is a great game for those looking for a little more action than the average rpgthis game is great for those who like rpgs although i should warn you that it is very different from final fantasyif youve ever played vagrant story youll have a much better idea of how it playsthe battles occur in realtimeyoull find none of that turnbased stuff herethis helps keep it very exciting as you constantly fight against monsterson the downside if you are new to rpgs youd better give this one a miss as at times it is incredibly hardbut if you are looking for something different than final fantasy give this one a goquotyesquot if you enjoy long deep rpgs with a lot of side quests  you get your first sidequest during the tutorial section and most of the side quests lead to unique acquisitions or plot twists that add dimension to the story
additionally the game tracks the quests for you in a journalno more jotting down notes about what you have to do next you prefer to strategize rather than buttonmash in combat  summoner has some great options for interactive combat but you dont generally have to go insane on your controller to keep up with whats coming at you
you pick which character you want to play in combat you can switch to any conscious character any time and the others will follow the general instructions you give them
in most cases i stuck with flece or jekhar and let joseph and rosalind do a lot of healing
a lot of healing its more important to you that your characters have personalities than overwhelming stats or good looksquotnoquot if youre more into action than strategy youre put off by long and i mean long load times youre an unforgiving graphics snob not intended as an insult who is distracted by artifacting and visible polygon drawsthe characters in summoner are uniformly uglythey have their distinct looks but they tend to look like walking corpses particularly joseph
this didnt bother me much but in the wake of so many pretty games with pretty characters a lot of people might be put off by this
personally i think joseph looks kinda stressed which is appropriate to the storythe story takes a bit of time to get going the first time i fired this game up i got so lost in the huge cityscape of lenele that i went back and started over again
but about a third of the way through the story something happened that really hooked me  a story event followed by a shift in focussuddenly the stakes had changed and things were no longer what they appearedthe combat system is cool and chain attacks combined with reasonably good combat ai for your party make the battles pretty interesting
the enemy ai isnt always so bright though its possible to get an enemy to chase one character exclusively while the others whittle away at iti beat quite a few bosses this way even close to the end of the gameif youre big into story in your rpgs this is a good choiceplay time approaches  hours
and if the sidequest bug gets you you may find yourself playing through the game   or  times trying to complete them all
if halfstars were possible id go the only thing i really didnt like about the game was all the loadingoh and push the x button during the credits for a few nice surprisesthis game was awesome and cant wait for the sequel if the sequel was as good as this then i would definetly buy the graphics are pretty good
honestly this game is awesome you should buy it and the fighting is really cool you can like duck when beign hit and control who to hit
overall this is an incredible i have seen some previews for the sequel and it just looks phenominalsummoner is not without its faults but i fell in love with this game nevertheless
the characters are well developed the storyline is complex and involving
lots of political and religious intrigue make for plenty of twists and turns
within the first hour of the game i had about  side quests
this game isnt half as linear as most rpgs out there which is quite refreshing
i didnt always know what to do and had to figure it out myselfnot as nonlinear as the ultima series but still preferable to being lead around by the nosefor gamers sick of endless quotpopup monstersquot youll find the field battles more pleasing
when a quotpopupquot battle does occure you end up in a battle field you can walk around in or run out of if you dont wanna fight
dungeons and towns do not have quotpopupsquot its all action fighting
the battle system is a cut above most rpgsreal time fighting complete control through pause menus and an arcadelike combo system
the characters do beautiful spell effects fight with intricate movesas hands on or as computer controlled as you wish
joseph the summoner can choose between several different monsters to call on during battles
the summoned monster will join the party and fight for the duration of battle
they suffer damage and power up just like the other characters
you can easily switch from one character to the next even summoned monsters
during battles which makes it easier to heal more interesting to fightheres the downside
while characters and towns look pretty good the graphics could have been improved upon for the ps
the characters look no better than the latest tomb raider on psone
more quotblockyquot than i expected
the towns are huge lots to explore but the camera angles can be annoying
you can only see so far ahead of yourself at times which ticked me off
the dungeon maps are ok but the world map is absolutely horrendous
towns arent even marked except this one castle its difficult to find your way around hard to tell if youre going n or s at first not even that is marked
 just follow that little snaking road until it dwindles off
then hope you find the place you need to godespite these shortcomings i found summoner to be an overall enjoyable experience
thanks to the storyline characters battle system and cool summoned monsters
there are two endings depending on how you answer a certain question and so many side quests you could never finish the first time so the game has some replay valuethe summoner is a good game with horrible graphics and a cool battle systemgraphics
the graphics are pretty  bad but people forget that this is a rpg
the graphics arent exactly going to be devil may crysound
theres extremely little voice acting and everything else is just averagecontrol
nice easy controlsstory an average story
nothing special nothing badcinames suuuurrrreeeeereplay
i supposecharacters
the main character joseph looks like he just got kicked out of the holocaustoverall fun
despite all the horrible things i said about it the summoner has a new original battleing system and a simple leveling up systemthis game is great but it is directed towards the wrong audience
this game will not be very simple for the children which are the target of the grinch movie and it will turn away teenagers and older gamers because it is called the grinch
this game is great and people jsut need to give it a chanceand i finally beat it
some people may think its impossible to beat
there are easier games but thats besides the point
the graphics are just like any other ps game
theres so many tasks in this game
that is what makes it coolthe grinch loses all his blueprints for his gadgets while planning to steal whovilles christmas
he has to search in  environments to obliterate everything to complete several tasks in whoville the whoforest the dump and who lake
and retrieve these blueprints to create his rotten egg launcher slime gun rocket spring octopusclimbing device marine mobile and grinch copter
thats the basic object of the whole game
if you complete enough tasks and destroy enough gifts you can open up  supadows which are doors that lead to cool games inside the grinchs lair up on mount crumpit
the first one has a bunch of poles that you swing from to get to the finish line in the limited time
the second one is where you just smash  as many pumpkins as you can and try to beat your time
the third one is where you just fly with the grinch copter through rings to the finish line in the limited time
all  of them have limited times
later on you can take a sleigh ride to stop santa
i got  percent
games like charlie and the chocolate factory for ps was much easier and i only beat that in a couple of days
the grinch will take a lot longer but its worth playing for the fun of itback when the original came out on the dreamcastbest system ever made it was great
the graphics at the time where incredible especially for a launch title
im sure this game helped sega sell a few systems
i remember they seem to have this game running on every dreamcast kiosk
the first game was pretty original and was good little game at the time
this came out about a year later
although they did improve the graphics a little and the music some they core of the game remain unchanged
this can be a good thing and a bad thing at the same time
midway knew it had a hit on their hands when the original came out
they didnt want to mess with the original formula much
the core of the game pretty much remained unchanged
they added a few touchups and a few more things here an there and improved the championship mode as well
however not enough was done to implement more features other than new boxers overall the game didnt evolve much
in a way you can say its more of a  than a part  you can say they dressed up the original and a few more characters to it
the ai in the game while not bad isnt great after a while youll get the hang of it
after you played it for a few hours it starts to wear a little thin
however you will have fun playing it before you arrive at that point
the game is much better if you play with a friend or use it as a party game with a few friends
all in all its a decent game just for the most part its the same as part  which is good in a way since the original was a good game
however with a few more modes and maybe if the game would of evolved a little more it would of been much better
this is been an arcade type of game like most arcade type of games they usually where thin after a few playsi bought this game for my cousins
i really thought it was a bit too silly for my tastes
theyd give it  stars ill take one away because of my thoughts on the gamefirst my cousins perspectives
a barrel of laughs and a whole lot of fun
they both will sit down in front of the tv for hours playing this game just beating the stink out of each other until they have to go
they dont care for michael buffer but they do enjoy the boxer commentssecond my perspective
its just a button masher to me
im sure theres technique there i just dont have the desire to discover it beyond some minor experimentation
the game has excellent graphics and sound it just seems to get old fast
you circle around and punch
once the intial novelty of the graphics and humour dissipate youre left with repetative gameplay
saving grace to this is the multiplayer
adding friends and family as opponents instead of the ai is a blastafter a short period of time youll be skipping everything just to get to the fight
so if you dont have friends and family to play with or against its just an arcade boxing game that probably wont hold your interest for longthreads of fate is a title that makes this game seems like its going to be deep and serious but its not
surprise
it actually features a very simple humordriven story
however threads of fate is still very enjoyable
who doesnt need a bit of lighthearted fun every now and thengraphics score  graphics were pretty decent for a ps game
they arent the best but not the worst either
overall the graphics are not too hard on the eyesmusic score  the music is decent and none of it is grating on the ears
rods theme song even got stuck in my head in a good way
each dungeon has its own music track so the game has sufficiently varied music and all of it was pleasantcharacters score  the characters are rather simplistic but they are also very cute and likable
there are two main characters mint and rue and a cast of supporting npcs who feature strongly in the story
alot of the characters themselves have rather silly personalities but this works well with the kind of humorous game that this is
even though the characters are not terribly deep nor welldeveloped the main characters at least have back stories that are examined and all of the characters are charming in their own waystory score  like the characters the story is pretty simplistic
however its engaging enough that it keeps you interested and there are some twists to keep things fresh
also you actually have two storylines
you can start off as either rue or mint
theyre both basically going through the same major events because they are searching for the same thing but playing as one versus the other allows you to see the events from either unique perspective
plus there are a couple differences in the storyline based on who you are using
so its almost like getting two games for the price of onebattle system score  threads of fate is a basic actionrpg
you have a weapon which you hit things with by pressing a button
you can also do a combo attack by hitting the x button twice as well as a regular hit
in addition each character has a special ability
rue can turn into monsters that he has killed and use their attacks
mint has magic attacks and also a healing spell later
i found the battle system to be pretty intuitive and easy to use
also the game designers did a good job of making both rue and mint pretty balanced with each other
i was afraid when i started playing that once i went through mints storyline she would be pathetically weak and underpowered but she was about the same
so neither character is more difficult to use than the other which really adds to the enjoyment of playing as either charactergameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
my biggest complaint here is a small section that involves doing three minigames which are required to advance the story
these minigames involve jumping platforms and they are extremely irritating
this is by far the most aggravating aspect of the game and lowers the score in this section
it wouldnt be so bad if you werent forced to complete these minigames to advance the story but unfortunately you are
one other small complaint is that you have to confirm alot of decisions twice
for example when you leave town you must select your desired location then confirm
the cursor starts out on cancel which means i sometimes accidentally hit cancel
this was mildly annoying
the other thing to note is that there is only one town in this game
this one town acts as a central hub where you can rest shop and get info
before setting out into dungeons
also there is no world map you just go to the town gate and select your desired location then youre taken straight there
you might think that having only one town and no world map would get dull but the game does a very good job of keeping you engaged and unbored with their lively interesting characters and simple but charming story
i could easily see how a game might use this same setup and completely ruin the experience so i applaud threads of fate for handling this aspect so well
still more towns might have added some variety to the gameoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
given its replayability due to the double storylines mostly enjoyable gameplay curse those required minigames
 and cute story i can easily recommend this game to rpg fans
since it is pretty inexpensive right now last time i checked anyway and is a very fun and enjoyable game threads of fate easily deserves a place in your game collectioni love this game to pieces
the graphics are colorful and cute
i enjoy the battle system as you can control the characters physicalmagical attacks  making the game part action part rpg
the story remains engaging throughout and the learning curve is pretty easymy only grievance with this game is that its so short
it can easily be completed it in  hours or less
theres only one town and one relic that the characters are after  even though they keep talking about how there are so many relics in the worldi wish i could give this game  stars but it stinks to pay so much for a game thatll barely entertain you for a day or twogreat  is used but like new so i have nothing to complain about the only thing isit didnt have the original case sadlyi only give this one  stars because it does not appeal to my taste
i was used to running jumping breaking boxes being followed by a boulder or a bear or flying in space
this one is so much different
you here play pong tank battles and so onthe game is divided as usual into levels
every level is divided into  games followed by fighting a boss
the game is extremely difficult
it does not have the flavor of usual crash yet still enjoyablebelieve it or not crash bash is one of the best games you can find
the plot is like this aka aku and uka uka decide to have a contest with akus team against ukas
akus team are ukas two henchmen tiny and dingodile who joined aku aku crashs sister coco and of course crash
uka ukas is rilla roo a new character koala kong n brio and of course cortex
there are many categories such as ballistix where you guard a goal and try to get balls through your opponents goals polar panic where you ride on polar bears trying to push the enemies off the ice pogo pandemonium where youre on a pogo stick painting some squares when you land on them and then hitting boxes and earning points equal to the number of squares of your color crate crush where you pick up crates and throw them at the enemy my favorite tank wars where you ride a tank and try to blow the enemy tanks up crash dash where youre on a circle racing across ten times and medieval mayhem where you try to hit something and gain points for it
these are difficult to access
if you have a number of controllers you can go through and adventure mode with a fellow helping you and you can hook up a multitap and four people can fight each other
these are the ups but now for the downs
if you want more then to just go through the game but to get everything the whole game can offer you will need to be the best video game player in the world
plus playing against the computer sometimes isnt the same as playing against some human guys
but basically if you can get by these two facts the game is quite entertaining anyway you will be quite in luck
do consider getting this game and do not pay any attention to the reviews who said all those things like it doesnt work on ps or this is boring because it worked on my ps and it is far from boring and a game you will enjoythe n had mario party
ps never got a true mario party clone but crash bash in its own right is a very fun party game for the ps
the adventure mode is a real highlight since you can play it coop with a friend and it actually makes it a little easier as a result
the actual minigames themselves have a little more depth than the average mario party minigame but theres only  types of games with the seventh type medieval madness switching things up the mostgreat for all ages and its certainly not terribly expensive or anything
you wont regret it but going for all of the collectables may prove frustrating if youre not doing it coopout of the  spyro games not including the new one for the ps year of the dragon is the best one
just like the previous versions your mission is to collect gems and this time dinosaur eggs
the more eggs spyro collects the more quotworldsquot are open to him
some eggsd are hidden in the levels but a lot of them need to be earned by completing challenges such as skateboardingyear of the dragon lets you take control of four characters besides spyro
sheila the kangaroo can perform a high jump as well as kick enemies with her feet
sergeant bird has a rocket launchers and can fly forever
theres also a yeti and a monkey named agent the controls are easy the graphics are nice and the sound is not bad you cant go wrong with this onea fun title for a child or even an adult who is not into shooting enemies blood and gore or the very fast pace of adult games
i like itpositive gameplay is still solid controls are still excellent tons of eggs to collect speedway levels are great fun extra characters are a smart additionnegative wait havent i seen some of those positives before some graphical issues are less forgivable the second time around the levels get a little boring after the first areaspyro the dragon was one of the defining characters of his genre back in the day
he had three great games a great start an even stronger sequel and now the third one year of the dragon
does it live up to the expectations generated by its predecessors or does it fail to live up to the other twowhen an evil sorceress from another world sends in a bunch of goons to kidnap the eggs in the world of the dragons you know who to send back to retrieve them
hunter the cheetah
oh and spyro of course
basically you go on a journey to get back the eggs through four big worlds each with a lot of levels and each of which has a lot of stuff to do for completioniststhe core gameplay of yotd is pretty much exactly the same as it was back in riptos rage you charge you glide you breath fire and you get power ups through gates every once in a while
thankfully all the abilities you learned in the previous game are available to you right off the bat
the downside to this is that you dont learn any new abilities as the game goes on which makes the spyro gameplay hardly vary at allfortunately there are four other characters that come into play every once in a while to change things up a bit
sheila the kangaroo can jump really high and kick enemies to kingdom come sgt
byrd can fly and shoot the crud out of baddies with his shoulder cannons bentley the yeti can smash guys with his giant club my personal favorite and agent s levels are kind of like thirdperson shooters
these guys each have their own level and also have a few areas throughout the game within other levels in which you can get eggs
all the characters are really fun to play as and offer some great diversitythe game has four huge home worlds each of which has many levels
the first world is home to a handful of great fun levels and then you go to the second world and find that youre suddenly not having as much fun
could it be that the levels are just not so great
i cant put my finger on it but theres something about the later levels that i just dont like
maybe its the slight lack of creativity i dont knowalthough many of the regular levels arent much fun there are four speedway levels in the game as well and these are surprisingly entertaining
they each have a time attack mode where you have to fly through rings torch cows and the like within a time limit but there is also a race on each of these levels as well as a hunter challenge usually involving you playing as the cheetah flying around in a plane shooting down sheep in flying saucers
good timescollecting eggs is the main goal of the game but there are many ways that you get them
of course there are some lying around on the ground every once in a while but there are also times when you have to do certain tasks to get them or play a minigame kind of thing
there are also a ton of gems but these are more annoying to collect as they are all over the place and if you want them all youll have to do a lot of backtracking
still the combination of eggs and gems makes for a great game to try to completethe visuals of yotd are exactly the same as they were in riptos rage
nothing has changed
yes spyros eyebrows still detach from his head every once in a while
yes everything still looks a little polygonal
they werent so bad the first time but when there is zero improvement in a game that came out a year later polygonal and occasionally glitched graphics are a bit less forgivable
not to say they look horrible for the time but i definitely would have liked to see some kind of improvement in this areathe sound effects are no different than they were back in riptos rage but there wasnt really anything that needed changing
there are still nice sometimes silly effects that fit well with the game
the music is great as usual and is like the sound effects fitting to the environments
some of the tracks are reused a few times but its really not a big dealoverall spyro year of the dragon is still a great game
it may be exactly the same as its predecessor except for a few fun variations in the gameplay but thats not to say its a bad game by any means
the spyro formula had already proven itself twice so why change it for the last game of the generation
still a few new abilities and graphical improvements would have been welcome and the levels could have been much more enjoyable
despite these few flaws though yotd is great for anyone who liked the other two games or someone looking for a game simply made to be completed and i would also recommend it to just about anyone who likes d platformersgameplay grahpics sound value final score completely satisfactory with the condition of the cd however it was advertised with the book let and didnt come with one and that was kinda the point of ordering ita great game for play station  based roughly on parts from both movies the original and bloodlust
if you have a ps get this game anyways it is fun addictive and contains a few puzzles
a few bugs but all in all a great gamethis game is worth checking out especially if you like anime or resident evil i dont care for  the resident evil games but every once in a while there is a clone that i like
this game is more  like dino crisis  and resident evil combined
you kill everything in site like dc but the  mood is more like resident evili did not think the controls were all that bad but the camra angels are the worst of allthe combat suffers a lot because of this
i remember one time when i was fighting some vampires and d wasnt even on the screen
what is that
there was a lot of screw ups but a lot of good stuff like the puzzles are done really good and the opening scene was verry verry good
i think there should have ben some anime in the game i havent beat the game yet but i havent seen any anime yetthis game was very addicting and fun
some of the voices are done really well
the graphics are pretty good for an older game and you can go up to  x  resolution with it
the monster animations are done rather well and there are lots of quests to do
you can join guilds and change your charater class whenever you want
the spell effects are good too
my favorite is the firestorm and tornado
the sound and music are done well too
it even has positional sound with a four or more speaker setup
i enjoyed the ending movie becuase it was totaly unsuspected
for a three year old game this game still holds its owni was attracted to this game because it was by the same people that did the wizardry series
i was not disappointedwhile not quite as much fun as say wizardry  this was still a pretty good game and i played it all the way to the end
i liked the first person party based perspective and liked that it was open ended like all the best games
highly recommendedim about halfway through it but so far its worth the money and the wait
the patch seems to have fixed almost all the bugs but characters still quotloosequot things they pick upwhere do those items go
it looks and feels like the wizardry series no surprise so if you liked those games especially the last two or three youll like this one too
some complaints the way the game handles the passing of time is strange  i seem to do most of my travelling and fighting at night
theres no way to rest and let time go by as in mampm  i dont like the way the outside world is arranged in long winding quotpathsquot rather than just one wide open space
and i definitely dont like the games tendency to give one hit point when a character levels up
other than that a pretty good first person rpg
i hope bradley gives us more of the samethis rpg is a lot like dungeon master dagerfall and lands of lore but the graphics for the monsters and locations look better as does the changing sky as night approaches
you move up to six characters around a huge world by foot horse and boat meeting quest helping npcs and fighting for your life
the interface is a bit clunky at first the normal move with arrows and look with mouse combo is missing also you can only restore your position by quiting the game back to the town menu where to save you must leave the town
still after you get used to the mechanics of the game i found myself having a lot of funi prefer less hazardous sports than skateboarding like skydiving for instance and always laugh when i see some idiot slip off the rail sans protective gear and do a faceplant into the concrete
that said ill admit this game is addictive enough to give skaters a little respective never played the original tony hawk so i cant really compare this version but it looks like its a port from the console
no biggie it still looks and plays great and the system requirements are minimal provided you have a good d card
the game is a reflex test like mortal kombat
this is not a simulation so youll be doing those pro moves in no time
timing is key and the best moves are performed when you have a combination of speed and accrued experience meaning you were able to execute enough moves without messing upthere are a ton of moves available for button mashers
every board flip grind and grab can be performed differently depending on which direction you are pointed and which button you are pressing
tricks even vary depending on which skater you choose but not wildly
objectives can vary from collecting pilots wings in an airplane hanger to hassling the bums on venice beach
speaking of which the locations are very well done and the musics good too even though the sound quality is a little poor
it is apparent this game would best be played on a gamepad but you can still get away with using the keyboard
i find myself frequently discovering new moves phrases such as quothey a onefootsmith
thats pretty cool
how did i do thatquot will become commonthe best feature of the game are the quothiddenquot areas opened up by exploring and performing tricks
grind the board off the helicopter blades and it takes off through the roof
get run over enough times and pretty soon youll searching for a tomatothrowing maneuver if you find it let me know
if youre really good spiderman may drop in for a visitfun game and worth the purchase price
buy it then get the neighbor kid to show you all the cool movesto tell you the truth im not much of a skateboard fan but i thought i would check this game out none the less
my first thoughts are that the game is actually quite good
the graphics are excellent especially if you have a system that handles d well
the one thing i think could be improved is the perspective you have while you are riding around
its kind of disorienting when you jump up and spin or do some other trick
it just has a wierd view which takes some getting used to
i also gave this four stars cause i dont think this game will have much replayability for me
its fun for awhile but im starting to loose interest
im sure skateboard fans will really like this game
my suggestion is to try out the demo first and if you like it buy itthis game is great but better on dreamcast let me explain the good and bad about this gamethe good
 good graphics lots of skaters and skate parks to choose from good carer mode a fun game in general
the bad
 very stupid and annoying music very bad music  no online multiplayer
gt can get laggy sometimeseasily the most addictive game i have played
i mainly stick with multiplayer but i have also tried playing the single player game but find myself bored after awhile
the single player isnt the best and honestly i find the supernatural aspect of it tiresome
because of that i lessened my rating from  stars to the multiplayer is phenomenal
the most fun ive had in a multiplayer game
i highly recommend this game for anyone who loves multiplayer gamesrtcwreturn to castle wolfenstine is one the the best fpsfirst person shooters for the pc  it is the sequal to the first fps of all timeand the best
i played wolfenstine d a lot and so what do you thjink i did the day rtcw came out
yeah
this game does not capture that same feeling that the original did
the single player game is good even though you never hear the main guys voice but the multiplayer verision is the reason to get this
rtcw has hardly any similarities to wolf d and it seems more like half life than wolf d did
however this is still good
id rather however have more weapon choice
if you own wolf d hallife or red faction that this will just be another soso game
however if you dont have any of those and want to try something new then get this game
the multiplayer game is exelenttheres nothing new in this game but it is still a great deal of fun
its story is pretty much just filler material with nicely done cutscenes ignore it and go kill more nazis
the game play is also extraordinarily average run here and kill some nazis run there and kill more nazis but it is still quite fun
the weapons are also average fair there is the usual assortment of pistols machine guns sniper rifles and what not though the weapons are rather well done particularly the flame thrower which has the most realistic looking fire effect ive yet seen in a gamethough the gameplay and weapons are average the graphics are stellar and the ai fairly competent
the best thing about the graphics is the assortment of different looking characters you will encounter there are nearly one hundred and fifty different faces and expressions for the characters and nearly as wide a variety of uniforms and accoutrements as well this is a nice perk that keeps the game from getting that clone army feel ie all the characters look exactly the same so it feels like youre fighting an army of clones
also the ai is quite good they know how to use their weapons with lethal accuracy standing far away is no defense if you encounter a guard armed with a rifle and they dont mindlessly stand around in the open
they will run and duck behind cover or move to sound an alarm and summon reinforcementsthe zombies and other undead that you encounter arent too tough to defeat with the exception of the three bosses just make sure you aim for the head as many of them are armed with a sword and shield and will use the shield to deflect your bullets
also these creatures do not randomly pop up in the game they are only encountered where it seems appropriate
for a portion of the game you are in some crypts that the nazis are excavating these crypts are crawling with undead
a short time later you will find yourself in a city no undead inhabit those areas just nazisto sum it all up this game is basically wolfenstein d with much better graphics
the gameplay and story are old rehashes of what has been done countless times before but if youre looking for some good nazi killing fun this is a great game
if you want something with a good story and innovative gameplay i would recommend no one lives forever or aliens vs predator as most of you are aware the video and pc gaming industry loves to hype games
in the last six years or so the games that got a lot of attention prior to release include unreal unreal tournament  unreal  black and white and of course doom   as you can see from this list not all of these games lived up to expectations
considering the tremendous amount of hype that heralded the return of wolfenstein does return to castle wolfenstein live up to expectationsmostly yes
the graphics in this game are definitely good and they seem to approach photorealism in some ways
it helps to run this game with a good video card and i can tell you that although return to castle wolfenstein was released in  my radeon  graphics card still strains a bit if i turn all the settings up
the sound level design weapons and enemy ai all are very good toonevertheless most gamers would agree that this shooter was not the milestone it was expected to be
some complained that the singleplayer adventure is mediocre but i thought it was quite good
i guess theres only so much you can do with a firstperson action game and if the previews in the pc gaming press get too exciting one should expect a let downso should you buy return to castle wolfenstein
if you like playing action games on your pc then by all means get a copy
at the price youll get a really good value because this game is as good or better than many of the newer more expensive shooters
moreover playing return to castle wolfenstein can lend you an idea of how games evolve and how gamers react to themever since return to castle wolfenstein was announced ive been anticipating it more than any other game
wolfenstein d literally created the first person shooter genre and i was hoping the sequel to it would break boundries and revolutionize the fps realm againwell it didntreturn to castle wolfenstein is a great fast diverse fps
there are sniping and stealth missions along with the typical enterthefacilityandkilleveryone missions
the variety of play definitely is nice keeping it from being a soldier of fortune where every level is mowing down mindless drones over and over
even though there are different kinds of playing other than the standard killeverything missions we have seen this all before
i think rtcw most wants to be like monoliths no one lives forever stealth sniper and action missions
i basically played this same game last year except it was in the s instead of in world war return to castle wolfenstein is a really fun game
the multiplayer although there are only  maps definitely adds to the longevity as well
the only problem with this is one cant help but be dissapointed
theres nothing new here
the new wolfenstein is just another fun prettylooking first person shooter without any real innovationsim a diehard single player only type gamer so this review is based on just that aspect
ive never tried the multiplayer
to briefly explain i bought my first pc so i wouldnt have to socialize with other people
ive tried some multiplayer games and even had fun doing so but nowhere near the fun ive had playing a good selfcontained single player game
hey if you love multiplayer more power to you
its just not my cup of tea
that said on with the reviewno doubt this is a fine looking game
my system is a win  homebuilt athlon  ghz with a geforce   meg video card and  megs of system ram
it ran fine for the most part but i did experience fairly frequent lockups possibly because i hadnt yet updated my video card drivers
the first several levels almost put me to sleep having seen environments just like them in no one lives forever
however i hung with it and was rewarded quickly with some much more interesting level design
gameplay was immersive with enemy machine gun fire ripping up the floorboards in front of me on several occasions
enemy ai was decent but nothing really new or spectacular
i was disappointed with the relentless linearity of the game
most doors are locked and cant be opened so you are led along a path that the designers obviously want you to follow
i much prefer a more openended design
i love to explore and this game didnt allow for much of that
even the original wolfenstein d allowed you to explore everywhere
but this is my own personal preference
some may enjoy the linearity of rtcw
also im a little tired of enemy bosses though this feature helps the game remain truer to the original
also this game seemed a bit on the short side
by the time i was battling the final boss i figured i was about halfway through the game
im just estimating here based on my gut but it seemed about half as long as half life or no one lives forever
the game is fun no doubt or i wouldnt have given it  stars
it just didnt blow me away like i figured it would
possibly my expectations were too highill be the first to admit that i bought in to the pregame hype surrounding return to castle wolfensteins release
when the developers released their quotstorm the beaches of normandyquot level as a free multiplayer demo they released what was probably one of the funnest online action multiplayer levels ever
while the new multiplayer levels included in the full version do not disappoint after playing them for some time they dont seem to have the same replay value as the beach demo that was releasedreturn to castle wolfenstein surrounds a wwii theme of nazis and the occult
it comes with two versions single player and multiplayer
the singler player version is an adventure in the mold of indiana jones and your solo american gi
must battle nazis zombies and witches
the single player version has various missions with different objectives
in one mission you must eliminate a specific person in the next you must infiltrate a nazi compound while not being detected and in another you can find yourself searching for a lost archaelogical relic that will prevent the nazis from obtaining power
the single player missions are great fun and there are many weapons that are aquired throughout the levels with more lethal weapons available in the later levels
impressive weapons such as several sniper rifles flamethrowers and a few others either invented by the programmers or in theme with the wwii atmosphere
return to castle wolfenstein allows fun gameplay elements such as sneaking up on nazis in the middle of top secret conversations or fighting your way through levels with a knife to avoid making noises that will alert other guards
probably the biggest complaint i have about the single player levels is that there arent many included on the cd and its over before you know itthe second version available in return to castle wolfenstein is the multiplayer mode and it comes with eight maps that you can play via the internet with other gamers
the best thing about return to castle wolfensteins multiplayer mode is the teamwork required
most team formats in fps games have the same type of soldiers with the same weapons available for all players
not so in return to castle wolfenstein
you must pick a class of soldier to play soldier lieutenant medic and engineer which reflects the weapons you are permitted and the special abilities you can use
some classes start with more ammunition
each class has a specific function in the multiplayer map you pick and must be used in unison with other players and their chosen classes to complete the teams objectives
while medics might be reviving fallen comrades lieutenants can call airstrikes on enemy positions soldiers can use flamethrowers to sniff out enemy bunkers engineers arm dynamite to blow up strategic walls etcif the price of return to castle wolfenstein was lower id give it five stars in a heartbeat
unfortunately the price was set by the games developers to reflect the instant demand for a game hyped such as this
amazoncom is actually one of the cheaper sources for wolfenstein as ive seen retail stores that charge as high as sixty dollars for this long awaited sequelthe price shouldnt be an issue though if the games developers follow through with some of their promises to release many more multiplayer maps and an official map editor that will allow gamers to create their own maps
already websites have started releasing utilities for this game and it looks like it will have a healthy amount of mods modifications that either create or change new levels and gameplay elements
 new mulitplayer maps and other creative programs developed by fans around the worldnot a poor game by any means but i think pc gamers were expecting a little bit more for the price
if you havent done it already download the free multiplayer demo available on the internet to see how fun the gameplay can be
a game that is fun and entertaining and promises to be much more after the developers and fans have created many more new features for ityou have probably heard this before but the multiplayer part of this game rocks
it focuses on teambased action with several character class that are used to support oneanother
the multiplayer will make this game live on in imfamy and is alone enough to purchase it
the single player however falls short of a few elements that while dont bring it down entirely they prevent it from being excellentone thing is for sure this game looks wonderful
every detail is wonderfully captured with the quake  engine and the flame effects are some of the best you have ever seen on your  inch monitor
it is ashame the developers didnt make the singleplayer game as wonderful as the graphicsthe most serious thing i think is the fact that the main character bj doesnt say a frickin word in the whole thing
i didnt mind gordon not saying a word nor lt powell but that to let to immerse yourself in the game
bj
has an attitude but you rarely see it
it also seems that the developers did things to avoid him talking
like instead of rosevelt briefing him he would tell some guy named jack what he told bj
to do
why doesnt jack do the frickin missions insteadthe story is fine but some of the cutscenes may make you fall asleep
this is cause of the fact that bj
isnt in any of the briefings
they are just president rosevelt talking to jack and  other guys who wants to see that
this game is sopposed to borrow elements from quotno one lives foreverquot but i could watch a  minute cutscene from that game and listen to every bit of it
in this game a  minute cutscene seems to longeverything else about the single player game is good the mission design is exceptional it still can only be considered a bonus for this gameill make this brief
graphics gameplay and storyline were all great
the annoying interface was not
believe it or not i was so annoyed with the save and load menus that it sort of spoiled the experience
saving was annoying because when i quicksaved the game reloaded where it wanted to not where i had last quicksaved
saving normally was annoying because i had to click on my save game file over and over to make the game recognize the filename and save over it
other than that i did enjoy the game though the wwii genre is getting old after playing a few of the games out there
i do recommend this game to people who arent easily annoyedabout time
there is great action and the game has an added level of sophistication by allowing tasks like rearmament by lieutenants revival by medics and engineering efforts that allow you to destroy or repair key itemsnone of which are difficult to learn
some games like tribes  just take too long to learn before you can get any real enjoyment out of themfor all of those growing tired of cheaters on counterstrike or getting your butt handed to you by  yearolds with hours of daily play experience this is a great new game
as an aside i hope cheating doesnt become an issue hereim glad ive found a new game but will stop playing or buying mods and sequels if they dont deal with it as soon as it happensthe ff setting friendly fire is greatserver sets it so you get automatically kicked after your third time unless the player you killed forgives you
an instant menu pops up for him while hes waiting in reenforcement queueim a big fan of ff onit adds additional sophistication to the game playand tends to keep the shootandbunnyhop kiddies off the serverminor flaws so far the running animation isnt very realistic at timesfrom certain angles some of the axis guys look like they are being pushed around on a magnetic board and im not sure i can tell the difference between the thompson and the mp
the bazoka is quite effective though
the different builtin voice commands are difficult to navigate due to the amount of relevant and inmportant ones available and may require some binding of favoritesi suppose if there are two groups whom its acceptable and almost encouraged to slaughter it would be nazis and zombies
its the only time a defendant could be on the witness stand and confess to his own benefit your honor they were really asking for it
which is what makes return to wolfenstein so much fun
its a historically accurate gothic wwii supernatural fps
one of those rare combinations you throw in a blender and it comes out all yummyill briefly echo all the other compliments here nearly photorealistic graphics pinpoint control targeting and collision detection silky smooth operation in xp
voice acting is believable
weapon and explosion sounds are appropriately metallic and jarring
and the undead are scary as hell
ive played many of the good survival horror franchises and none except silent hill  freaked me out like the zombies in wolfenstein
it was a rare stroke of genius to introduce the nazi grunts as sympathic victims of the undead hordes showing scenes of your enemys enemies devouring them alive
this creates a real hesitation and apprehension about the players role that exacerbates the fear
in other words me scared good jobso if it rocks so hard why not five stars
well this little revelation hit me about halfway through the game instead of being the best castle wolfenstein it could be id decided to make a very good cross between medal of honor and wolfenstein
which is a very good thing but remember what set the first wolfensteins apart from the rest were the exploration and secret area goodies
rtw would have been great if every level had been more like paderborn the best stage of rtw more dungeon crawling deeper and more inventive secret areas
im imagining innovative and useable secret goodies that enhanced gameplay hidden by new concepts of concealing secret doors
you know play to your strengths rather than copy someone elseas it is return to wolfenstein is a fun pretty and often scary offbeat shooter thats just a hair below the best of the more traditional wwii fpsreturn to castle wofenstien single players takes you throughscary and dangerous quake  arena powered graphics enginealong with high quality audio and entertaining music soundtracks
you bust out of jail you kill nazis you killa doctor you fight huge robot machines and end up in deepslaughter scary zombie dungeons and must collect imperativeinformation along the way and survive and kill thingsdid ijust say that
besides the point the good thing is this ispowered by the quake  arena engine so no software renderingsupport yeeeeeeaaaahhhhhhh
i have to be frank i hate it
it decreases the fun of the game the graphicslook chunky and are not the visual effect type support thatopengldirectd would offerbut i like opengl the bestbesides the point if you enjoyed the last onewhich i did youll go crazy on this onefinally activision has made the needed changes to the original call to power
the original game created huge expectations but failed to deliver on a lot of levels
even if this new version does not revolutionize the concepts of the classic civilization series games at least it addresses the many deficiencies of the ctp there are some new features but these offer only a small improvement
diplomacy is the most notable new feature with the ability to trade proposals and counter proposals with other players
however the vast majority of my carefully constructed offers met a frustrating blank wall of unexplained rejections
the originals easy to use interface has been upgraded to give greater depth and content it takes a bit of learning but its effort repaid
gone are most of the city management features in the pursuit of a true empirebuilding concept
mayors can be employed to manage all the mundane decisions using the same approach as computer players
unfortunately the ai has not improved greatly the computer will struggle to give a medium skilled human player a run for their money
the real good news i think is that it looks like this effort is more open to player customisation than the first attempt which had to rely heavily on customer mods to reach the level of playabilitythis is still not a great single player game
unless you are among the small number who bought and liked the original title which bore the time honoured label best wait for the release of civilization  next yearthis is a pretty good game and is pretty entertaining but i would not say it is a classic
i definitely enjoyed it for a while but it isnt one of those games that i keep going back to over and over again to play even  years after purchaseit is pretty cool how you can build your own little society or country in this game select from different political systems build wonders of the world research new advances and things like that
i really enjoyed that aspect of this game and how you can progress from an ancient civilization to a modern scientific wonderagain i wouldnt say it is a classic
this is one of those games that is quite enjoyable for a while but in my experience will end up collecting dust from lack of use within a few years when you move on to something else
so its good but there are better games out there in my opinioncall to power ii is a pretty cool game
im new to the turn based genre and although i liked it at first i decided to stick to real time
i mean its still a good game and the level of complexity is staggering allowing for hours of gameplay and thats only the first  years out of 
you start out in an ancient land around  bc
and build a capitol for your empire
from there you create units build more cities and explore the world which is quite vast
you can research all kinds of stuff and will be informed when something new has been discovered
as you progress thru time your options units and cities get more and more advanced and you go all the way into the distant future
the control panel is easy to understand and gives you complete access to every aspect of the game
there is also the great library an immense resource of knowledge with concise info on your empire and the various advancements you can create for your cities and units
the graphics are great and it runs  smooth on my piii  overall a very well done game
i prolly wont play it again but i give props to the games authors
any civilization fan will like this gamestreet fighter ex is probably one of the best fighting gamesbut why  megabites
thats likealmost the whole frickin memory card
i think
anyway back to the good partssfex has really good graphics and good controlsnot to mention very good musicmy favorite is kensthe game does not really have a story but who caresits still really fun to fight all those losers at the endhahahaha
the thing isi was exspecting more of a challengei beat the game in less than one minuteseriously
bisonbossis eaisier then skullo
skullo sucks
vegakenand ryu are probably the only kick a guys
i dont think they sell this game in the stores anymoreit was  of the first  games that were for ps
the st game ever was the bouncerthen  was tekken tagyou should probably order it from herecause i dont think amazoncom lets you quotrentquot stuffsincerlykennybasicaly capcom offers games that are a lot better than this
try marvel vs capcom or capcom vs snk  and avoid this one
while it is fun and original it will become boring fast
mark my wordsthis was one of the very first ps games i ever owned as well as one of the first ever released
there are a lot of really cool things about it
you cant play oneonone games like the ones you play on earlier sf games why wasnt there an option for that
beats me but the match types that are featured are neat
the practice mode or whatever its called is a nice feature
there are a lot of really cool characters  a lot of of them are from previous games and there are also many new ones at least i assume theyre new  ive never played any sf games for the ps
it might sound funny but my favorite character on the game is that little geeky girl area who is one of the hidden characters
her byebye move is the funniest move in the game not to mention one of the coolest
evil ryu another hidden character is probably my second favorite
the characters have some really awesome moves the meteor combos or most of them are especially mindblowing
some characters have a ton of moves i think skullo has the most while others have relatively few i think guile may have the fewest
some controller combinations are difficult to pull off at least until youve used them a lot like the degreesaroundthepad moves but most of them arent that hard to do
the games graphics are great  maybe a bit cartoony but thats cool with me
the sound effects may not be the best ive ever heard but theyre good
the characters voices are really good
its neat that the characters say stuff after they win matches but i think it would be better if i could understand the things they say maybe ill have to study japanese sometime
the characters dont have their own stages like they do on previous games unless you count the stages where you fight the bosses in the original mode as those characters own stages but they have their own music except evil ryu and bison  who have the music of their regular counterparts
however despite all the positive things about the game it has a couple of major flaws i assume its not just my copy
the bigger flaw is what i call the guile bug
whenever you finish off an opponent using guiles jumping knee attack the game freezes
the attack isnt even one of guiles special moves and is easy to do accidentally so i consciously avoid playing as guile usually anyway
the other flaw concerns the editable character ace  both the left and right versions
the game doesnt seem to correctly save the moves that you give them
if you change something about one of them it messes up both of them or something like that
i dont remember exactly what the game does when you edit the aces but it doesnt do like its supposed to
problems as big as these should be caught and corrected before a game is released
if it hadnt been for these two major flaws this game would have easily gotten five stars from me both for fun and for overalltekken was probably always an all time favorite of myself and many of my friends in the game rooms to the old ps
wed spend countless hours practicing combos all night while drinking beer and eating the leftover pizza we had ordered earlier that night
this quottag tournamentquot concept made this game interestingi dont think i really need to get into that much since the title speaks for itselfwhat can i really say though
simply said its another tekken
graphics improved a bit of course since we are in the more graphically enhanced playstation  now but overall its the same concept againhistory repeated itself
my friends and i would spend all night fighting one another unlocking all the secretsand thats it
just like we did with the previous tekken
dont get me wrong im not saying this game is boring
it is great
but there is one thing i did dislikea minor detail most would find negligable
i did not like the end moviesthose little prologues you see whenever you beat the game
they were too short and simple
there was nothing very impressive about them is what i meanonce my friends and i get tired of this game a couple months later a new tekken will be released
yeah well probably get it again and repeat everything i just wrote herethe tekken series has always been a favorite of mine and tekken tag is no different
the graphics are the best in a fighting to date and the number of characters is simply unreal
the only problem is there is almost nothing new other then the tag abilty
i would have given if  stars if they had just added a few more new characters or modes
there are a few new mini games like tekken bowling but thats not enough if youve played the other tekkens to death
bottem line if you are new to tekken or a hardcore tekken fan buy this
if not then buy dead or alive this game is pretty good if you have not played a tekken game before
but it is not fresh if you have
the drawback with this game is that it actually doesnt offer anything different from the previous tekken games and plays very identicle to tekken  ok it may have a tag mode in which none of the other previous tekken games have but the tag mode is not has good and different as the one in dead or alive  the good points this game as however is that it has all the charactars from the previous tekken games and a few extras
the game also has a tekken bowl mode in which you can unlock dr b from tekken  and possibly a one on one versus mode
and last the graphics are very outstandingi am not a big fan of fighting games but this one is pretty good
there is a lot of stuff to unlock and the game has a lot of different modes in it to keep things interesting
one drawback is that you cant move around in d like you can in soul calibur which is the best fighting game ever
but you do get do move to the left and right a little bit
id recommend it to anyone who likes fighting gamestekken tag tournament is one of a line of arcade fighting games that have made a successful transition to the home system
the tekken series like virtual fighter are games that are fought in d
like before with other tekken games tekken tt for ps is an improvement over the arcade versionthe level and character graphics have been updated and expanded to add more realism to the game
there are added game modes including vs oneonone team battle and practice to name a few
the amount of moves and combos per character are great
even if you dont know the moves the game has a complete ingame list available that includes grabs throws and hit combos specific to each character
the ability to have a teammate really adds a strategic element to the game not to mention its more fun with your friends
while some teams work well others may not
it all depends on how good you are with the two you have chosenmy only problem with the game is that the endoftournament movies are short and hold no extra style
granted this was one of the first games on ps however namco has been able to do more with less
this is a good fighting game to have if you and your buddies are tired of oneonone battlesif youre looking for something brand new and innovative this is probably not it
tekken tag is really a best of tekken featuring all the characters from all the tekkens using the tekken  engine which i find superior to the earlier egines but thats a personal preference
graphically ttt is quite impressive
some of the characters particuarly the changs could have been modeled better and a few others such as lee could have been tweaked for better fighting performance
musically its better than tekken   the music fits the characters and stages much better
tekkens volleyball and sidescrolling tekken force games were better than bowlingthe primary disappointment for me was the lack of imagination in creating the ending cgs  it would have been good to see a greater variety of endings rather than the same ending in all possible costumes
also endings that were specific to the team would have a been a great plus but would probably have resulted in ttt not making it as a launch titleall in all if youre new to fighting games youre a tekken addict or youre a casual fighting game player ttt is a good bet
if youre burned out on tekken  or looking for something innovative this is probably not the game for youthis is really tekken  with a tag option making it the only tekken tag option or any tag fight option outside of a wwf game for that matter
that is why one of the very first games ever made for the ps is still a gem to play today however tekken is not what is used to beto be honest namcos tekken entries since the initial release of the ps have done nothing but knock this fighter flat on its face but before we get to the cons lets talk a little about the pros
tekken tag boasts  players numerous fight settings and so the possible tag combinations between characters is almost unlimited making for plenty of variations in game play
this is why tag is so good
tekken provides about  moves for each character however some of the moves become frequently observed in other characters meaning that you start to see half of ones characters moves spread between three other characters
so if you are looking for more unique moves then really you should be looking towards tekken  however tag wins tekken  in terms of its lifespan even if you own tekken  friends will still ask you to put this disc in so the tag game play makes this game
basically you must balance between the two characters health as you fight the manout regains health meaning that on infinite time settings good players can really battle it out however tekken tag does suffer from the old this character is better than that character syndrome which to be honest has never changed in any game series as some character moves are simply impossible to pulloff with years playing with them
tags graphics let it down badly
the background is visibly disconnected with the fighting platform you can see the bad antialiasing moving out of sync with the background creating a dizzy fighting experience that is unpleasant on the eye
the fighters only look a little notch up from the ps tekken  and their moves are not a whole pile changed
although appearing fluid at first that illusion subsides very quickly but you keep playing because the tag option rulez it
quite simply you and your friends are going to be spending some time on this game even though it is not even remotely close to the kind of quality that namco could deliver on and believe it or not tekken  isnt a whole pile better either
this was made in  it is now nearly  and the ps has not had the good tekken gamer it deserves which is sham because tekken is only available on the pspros tag  characters and lots of fighting combinations game with a very long lifespan nothing else like itcons not much better than ps graphics terrible backgrounds character strength mismatches multiple moves shared with many charactersis tekken tag tournament the endall beall fighting game
no
but it is an unqualified success as a game
it takes much of what preceded it in the tekken series and elevates it with eyepopping graphics and hip new soundnow let me speak to all those who are griping
here is a fact this game is deep
not a little a lot
if youre complaining because you can only pull off a simple move then you simply havent spent enough time on the game to learn to love the intricacy of it
it saddens me to think that the potential of this game is so huge that most gamers will only scratch the surface before their simple minds get frustrated and they go back to barneyo excuse me mario and suck their thumbs
tekken demands a lot from the player and if you arent willing to excel then go buy fuzzy bunnies  for n
only gamers need applyand anyone who recommends soul caliber or doa over t i will say this
if you need cartoon tampa to get you to play a fighting game you are a sad and pathetic human being
doas engine is a decent foundation but any credibility gets thrown right out the window with the constant jiggle factor thrown in so the preteens can dream about handling the merchandiseand as for soul calibur a great game no argument there i will say this weaponbased fighters are inherently inferior
great one person stands on one side of the room the other person stands on the other and you both pull off cheesy moves without ever getting into striking distance
and inevitably in weaponbased fighters both players have quotspecial movesquot soul calibur is guilty of this that all but cripple your opponents lifebar
if you want to fight handtohand combat is the only way to go
if you want to flail around with a sword twice as big as your body toshinden anyone
while remaining out of range of the other guy why bother
it turns into a game of keepaway not a strikecounterstrike effortyes tekken takes much of its gameplay from its predecessors
its called quotif it aint broke dont fix itquot  the movebase is expanded though and it is possible to use multiple styles with the same person which rewards the user that cares to explore those possibilities
so long story short tekken tag is as good as you want to make it
the best fighting games are like that merely a vehicle through which the skilled gamer builds their craftand if anyone needs a hint the most important thing to remember about the tekken series is that the game is all about opportunity
try the practice mode to see what i mean
tekken is all about that splitsecond pause that occurs when your opponent is recovering from an offensive strike that heshe initiated
that is the time to strike
if youre approaching it fists up and flailing youre going about it all wrong
youve got to pick your spots and seizing that splitsecond moment of weakness is the key to victoryclass dismissedtekken has always been the social butterfly of the fighting genre
this game offers a good time without the long term commitment
you will likely love it and spend as much time with it as you can but in the end youll find it just lacks substancetekken tag has a very small learning curve and it wont take very long to learn how to wield at least one character well
that being said many of the characters are similar and the techniques youll use against youre opponents dont vary much between fighters
this makes it very easy to go in and slug away at opponents regardless of who youre using
this of course comes at the cost of the likely outcome that youll get tired of an opponent who falls for the same tactics every timethis game truly shines in pvp however especially in multitap  person tag mayhem
this truly is fun and ranks this game as my favorite way to waste a night with a handful of friends
the pvp is better than namcos more recent tekken in general if youre looking for a great relatively inexpensive game that you can share with your roomates and have a great time with look no further than the add to shopping cart button above
if youre looking for a great single player fighting experience id recommend tekken  or even better virtua fighter  which is beyond amazing
for  bucks however you wont do much better than thistekken tag is the best out of the series which you expect with it being on playstation   there are over  characters to choose from all with loads of new moves
the appeal for twoplayers is immense as the two player mode is fantastic
my friends and myself havent stopped playing this game for ages which im sure most of you wont be able to as welli have always been a fan of the tekken series of games and i wanted this one especiallyi love the tag feature best of all
i love using different characters with different fighting techniquesif you play every character and win the tournament you are awarded a new unseen character
but after you do this and get all of the characters the game does tend to get boringsome of the problems i have are finding some of the secret moves
granted it is a home video game system but you cannot use the analog stick even if you could it is not as easy as the arcadeanother problem is some of the fighting moves
some of the characters moves seem to be repeated with other characters like anna and nina angel and devil alex and roger
i was hoping that each character would have a different throwthere are a few bonus features with the game
you get a theater option with different outfits that is also a choice when playing the game
you can play a one on one tournament or have a practice fight
there is also a galllery but these are pictures you must save
but the oddest feature is the bowling tournament
that has got to be the stupidest feature for this game
there is also a tag survival tournament
this is were you beat your opponents while your energy is spent up
keep in mind each round gets harder than the previous one
there is also a timed attack tournamentoverall this is not a bad game to have
but dont play it too many times or you will wind up getting bored of itquicklymy friends dad is in the video game industry so i get to play a american ps everytime i go over to his house
out of his  american games he owns  this is definatly my favorite
the gameplays smooth with a good framerate
theres  guys for variety
and the tag modes pretty cool
my complaints  though come from the capabilitys of a ps
first it has a seperate procesor  for graphics sound and of course a main procesor
the majority of games set  for the launch arent using all  next it supports  types of media old  playstaion games about  mbs ps cdrom games a little more then psx   mbs ps dvd games  mbs and the huge double layered ps dvd games   mbs
and they also color coded them so you could know if the game  you got was on a regular disk black is psx blue is cdrom and silver  which everygame should be is either dvd
hmmmm if ttt was on a larger disk  there might be beter graphics more moves maybee  characters more detailed  levels etc
and they would still have room to spare
soul calibur which is  one year older and on a much weaker system beats ttt majorly on the  graphics
im hopeing tekken  will be alot better then this
i also cant  wait till my friend can get something like grand tourism  or metal gear  solid  finally if you wana see screen shots of ttt or anyother ps game  ign has about  high res shots
i cant give u the exact url but its the  same as aols just instead of aol its ignthe newest member of the tekken family debuts as one of the premier fighting games for the ps
tekken tag tournaments attention to visual detail and fun gameplay even outperforms its coinop counterpart making it a musthave title for fortunate ps owners
the cast of ttt is a whos who of the tekken family
a total of  characters including your favorite brawlers from tekken  and tekken  plus an original end boss
but this isnt just a tekken family reunion instead ttt brings a new strategy to the ring with a quottagquot system that lets you tag in a partner at any time during a heated round
fighter duos can do major damage alternating on the fly without interrupting the action teaming up for insane multihit partnerswap air juggles and delivering serious hardhitting standing combos
players will instantly notice the games sharp graphics
each area looks more polished than the arcade versions with separate animations in the background enhanced welldrawn environments and of course beautiful computergraphic fullmotion videos to tell the story
the character detail is also astonishing
from their diverse outfits to each of their unique animations fighters are vivid and move smoothly without any slowdown
as for the audio the sounds of ttt have been faithfully retained from the arcade
crisp audio effects keep the action alive while the cool techno tunes in each level are in harmony with the overall feel of the game
fans of this ferocious fighter franchise of either the arcade or home version will immediately feel at home with the controls
using just the topfour buttons directional pad and a shoulder button to switch between fighters bruisers can execute devastating  hitcombos and bonecrunching linking moves
even if youre a tekken newbie the practice mode will quickly get you in shape as it lists every special move which the computer will demonstrate how to do if youre unsure what the move is supposed to look like
the only drawback is that youll have to learn the bighit combos on your own
besides the practice option ttt also has special modes that you wont find in the arcade version
there are oneonone vs team battle time attack and survival modes along with an area where you can view the various tekken cinemas an art gallery and a minigame tekken bowl
namco has always been strong in the fighting genre and tekken tag tournament is no exception
while the game may be old in the arcades it certainly looks and feels new for the home console effectively exploiting the power of the ps with outstanding graphics sound and controls
this is a perfect addition to the pss burgeoning librarybadon easy the charictors dont move at allon normal they almost know what your next move isyou dont gain lifethe jacks movies are all the samegun jack cant use his gunsif the jacks are machiens they should be able to do alot morewhat is the endinghow do you get to the endinggood

you can control two people
if your about to die you can switch to someone else
you can choose all the people from the games before
i like this game alot but i still losethis is the best fighting game i have ever playedyou will be amazed by this games graphicsthe game is overall amazing it has great soundgraphicscontrols plus it is funthere is a lot of cool charactersmy favorite is tigerit is very short and easy but you need to beat it many times to unlock everythingdespite its flaws it is greati bought this game when it first came out and have been playing it pretty much constantly since then
i thought that the game might get boring after a while considering all you do is run around killing things but it hasnt not yet anyway
i was a big fan of the arcade game and the playstation  version in my opinion is even better
since this is a playstation  game you would expect it to have good graphics and it does
the controls are simple so it doesnt take long to learn how to play the game
i havent tried playing a multiplayer game yet but i imagine it is pretty exciting
the are point in the game were short cuts can only be taken if you have are playing with more than one player
the game is also very long it has nine different worlds with five or six areas to defeat in each world
each world has different enimies to kill so it helps keep the game fresh
the only bad thing i can say about this game is that it doesnt let you keep items it uses them automatically
overall i think this is a great game and if you have a multitap it should be even betterthis game was a lot of fun
it was a huge improvement from the days it was on the original nintendo
theres a bit of a challenge to this game but not much
i rented it first and im thankful that i did
the game is fun but it gets to be repetative after a while
while your character gets stronger the game seems to get easier a lot easier
personally i like a game with a challege and this wasnt itive played previous incarnations of gauntlet and ill be the first to admit you do see alot of diablo and baldurs gatedark alliance in it
even so you got to remember that gauntlet has been around longer than all of them
unlike those games gauntlet doesnt take itself too seriously and that is what makes it such a blast to play
going from level to level hacking and slashing figuring out puzzles and trying to collect everthing you need to progress in the game is way cool
if i had any gripes itd have to be with the graphics
although they were better than any previous gauntlet released i still dont think they harnessed the true power of the playstation
i think they coulda been alot better than they were
one thing is for sure though the graphics didnt look like n graphics
they were better than that but they coulda been better
other than that gauntletdark legacy was awesome
even better with friends too
definitely worth recommending to everyone
this game is fun fun funthis game is a lot of fun and i really like it
the worlds are very interesting and not very similar to each other
thats mainly a good thing because there are tons of worlds
most of the songs are really cool
one of them sounds like something that should be on guitar hero and it doesnt go with the mysterious flow of the gamemy main critic is regarding the sound effects
the characters say funny things when they get food and there are a few other good sound effects but other than that they are unimaginitive
more than half of the enemies have a bland sound when you kill them and the generator sounds are bland when you destroy them
fortunately the generators look cool when they get destroyed
and why do the wolves sound like seals when you kill themmany people rave about the multiplayer on this game but i think its pretty annoying
players cant go far from each other and that can make it frustrating if they want to fight different sets of enemieslast complaint  you cant save your items once you get them and the items can be found in not the best places sometimeswhy did i give this game such a high rating
because its way addictive and it doesnt get oldfirst of all you have to play this game with others
it just isnt fun by yourself
some of the highlights are the voices which are absolutely comical and the physical transformation of the characters as they increase in levels
the action is intense at times and with all of the hidden extras the replay value is very high
the only downsides are that the characters can be hard to control at times and when you play with too many people the screen gets very cramped and it is almost impossible get anywhere
but all in all this is a great game to play with a bunch of friendsgauntlet dl plays just like the revamped gauntlet legends
its a very cool action game to play with a couple friends and now you get to pick some of the better characters that were hidden in legends ex the knight jester and dwarf
its still a very long game so you have to have a lot of committment for it
if you need just a quick little fix then i would suggest a different title because this one is rather longthe graphics look just as good as legends and the game plays almost to a t like it as well
for some people that might be a bad thing because beyond that you are pretty much playing legends with different boards and more detailed scenary
its still a great game but for those of you looking for an upgraded installment of the gauntlet series its unfortunately not in dark legacy because of the fact that its still way too much like the originaleven so check it out because you may like it
and of course like i said its great with a few friends because that always shakes things up a littlegotta love remakes
graphics are sweet gameplay is good
multiplayer gets a little old trying to keep everyone together but overall a good purchase
kept me entertained for a few weeksguantlet dark legacy is colorful and character operation is easy
there is a lot of fighting in real time with nasty monsters throughout the game
a wide variety of spells may be used by sorceress  executed with ease by assigned buttons
slashing in the case of  knights depending on your choice of characters
there area wide variety to choose from
i chose the yellow sorceress
a dynamite character with tons of power and the blue knight the second time through not so strong but cutethe graphics in this game were fantastic
locations are huge and varied
the main bosses for each world are challenging but not impossibleif i were to improve this very nice game i would add some movement abilities for the characters
maybe jumping and climbingthis has to be one of the best strategy type multi player games that i have every played
the graphics are pretty good and there is a action every place has enemys that are easy to beat and they all come at you at once all you have to do is use magic or swing your weapon
i would not recomend this game for a single player multi player is way betterwhile the game is definately not bad it just gets old too quick
even with more than one person it still ages
good try though midwaygauntlet dark legacy is midways update to gauntlet legends
for those unfamiliar with gauntlet its an overhead view d hack and slash action game with a medievil theme
new features include  new realms  new main characters plus repolished graphics and gameplay
rest assured this ps version is a perfect translation of the arcade game
the designers have made some good decisions in adding helpful hints and tweaks to every aspect of the game
each character can now perform a more powerful version of their standard attack to ward off stronger enemies clues to find secret areas are littered across the playing field and food items added to the shop all make this version of gauntlet a more enjoyable experience
even though the gameplay can still become monotonous after a while there are more incentives than ever included to keep you playing
lots of secret charactersitems are available to search for and certainly help add replay value
there are still a few graphical and hit detection glitches that could use fixing but most are minor and dont detract from the gameplay
dark legacy isnt quite a true sequel but i believe enough new features are included to make it worth buying even if you already own legendshey where else can you get in the ring with boxing gloves and beat the  out of michael jackson
enough said now i know you want this game
so go get itwhoever thinks of this game in the same manner as knockout kings is looking at it all wrong
this game is meant to be fun and goofy
and fun it is
the crazy moves and wacky characters make it great
it is especially awesome in player mode
if you are looking for a realistic game look somewhere else
but if you are looking for a game that will be loads of fun for you and your friends then look no further
the only reason i didnt give this game a  is because it does get boring after a while with only  player but play  player mode to keep the fun lastingthis is a good game and graphiclly it is pretty amazing
the hero looks too western to be a samurai though
yes it is a resident evil clone
and for that it is a little sad
capcom are showing that they have the talent to do excellent games
but they are having a tendency to do the same style of survival horror
the graphics are great but the characters are weak overall
just that little bit two dimentional
but hopefully that will improve with an onimusha ii
i dont like the distances between some save points and i dont like the way you cant skip movies
there are  trappuzzel rooms in a row in one area and you have to view the movie each time
the monsters go from being very cool to just average and that is a bit of a pity
i would have liked to have seen more ninja based villans
the samurai villains are easy but cool
i would have liked to have been able to play the girl ninja
she for most of the game takes a different route and that would have added alot to the lasting appeal
the extra costumes are cool although i was told there is a panda bear costume or something similar
capcom for gods sake why
give us another interesting costume rather than something just ridiculas
i bought the game i am happy i bought it
it is worth buying and the ps has already had some nice japanese samurai games
they are rapidly becoming my favourite type of game
i hope to see more of these cinematic style gamescapcom creators of the awfully clicheacute resident evil series time travel to the ages of feudal japan and surprisingly enough their undead creatures have a special magic to them
as anyone who knows me ought to know i despise the whole quotresident evil phenomenonquot with perhaps the sole exception of resident evil  but i know a good game when i see one and certainly this is one of them despite the fact of being a short one
even though the story line is in no way  original it still makes up for a decent game you take the role of smanuske a samurai in the hunt of princess yuki who has been kidnapped by quotthe demonsquot to be offered as a sacrifice during a ceremony that will seal the pact between the demons and the quotfilthyquot humans
sounds way to damn linear right
and of course it is but linear story line is masterfully contrasted with an addicting gaming experience plus a macabre quotmedicalquot look at the demons doing a trick that works marvels in comparison to the clicheacute quotcrazy scientistsquot of resident evil
a fine game for the ps and highly recommended go for itlets face it capcom has made a name for themselves with games like this surival horrorfrom the resident evil series to dino crisis to onimusha warlords im sure i am leaving out others they seem to know what they are doing
i liked playing this game once
after that its really hard to get back into
but because i played it once and not again doesnt make it a bad game
its just you reach a point where in the game industry that once you played it its time to move on to the next game
if you are like me and other obligations have to be met work school social life every day chores then you are limited for play time
if i had more time i would love to explore more of onimusha because its a real nicely made game
most of the times though i would love to just pop in a quick game like tekken tag doa or midnight club and play for bit
but as for my rating i had a hard time deciding then i thought of the games out there for ps
there are not many games and this is one of the better ones
so if you want a hack and slash resident evil then this is for you
great graphics
great sound
easy controls what more can i say
not much of a ps libraryso this one shines at the toponimusha is very good but let me say this  i saw everything this game has to offer in  five day rental
i actually played through it twice
i had fun was blown away by the graphics but after i returned the game i never thought of it againonimusha can be compared to resident evil because it basically that same game only set in medival japan
anyone who has played the re series will certainly feel some deja vu
you play a samuri warrior who must rescue a princess from a castle over run by zombies
the graphics are beautiful but are still the same static shots
however the player models and little touches of smoke and such really make everything blend in together and seem more alive
combat is simple yet strategic and very fun although it gets old after the second run thru
still i enjoyed myself better than shooting zombies
there are a few puzzles in the game but nothing too hard
the story though is very very simple and a bit of a letdown
you can tell they cut parts of the game to release it on timei consider onimusha a part of the resident evil series because it is so similiar to those games
definitely rent it if you own a ps but i think you money is better saved for recode veronicagranted we all thought this game lacked because it was only about  hours long
but when you set down the controller after beating the final boss youd have thought you went through at least most likely because youll be playing it on and off
theres just so much story packed into those  hoursanother great quality is the graphics
most of the time youll see a prerendered backdrop behind your character something not too unusual if youve played alot of pc games in the s
it also leads you to pressing x to go up ladders stairs or opening anything interactivefading to black then reappearing with the object affected appropriately
aside from that later on in the game backgrounds begin to move in a strangely beautiful animation such as in the dark realm or out on a lake at night with a moon reflecting in the water
but what makes it beautiful is that it actually seems to be moving dynamically rahter than some obvious loop
so its not as painful as you think it is to not have the background move with the character
in most games alot of developers screw that part up anywayone final note on the graphics is that with playstation s new engine the character model looks almost exactly as detailed as a model in an fmv
and indeed the game doesnt seem to find much use for an fmv transition as the models look realistic anyhowso now that ive sold you on the graphics lets talk gameplay
i felt that this was the only obvious feature that i had trouble with
basically you dont even need a dualshock controller to play this game
its all done with arrows buttons and the l r buttons for blocking and such
well thats not too bad
except that left and right turns you left and right while forward and backward makes you go well forward and backward
so its something to get used to especially in battle
after playing the game for a few minutes you get the feel for thingsand finally difficulty
this game can be one sick little monkey as you get farther in the game
the whole game runs off of the resident evil engine which makes health and ammo hard to recover
youll have to stick it out by using alot of your blocking and dodging skills not to mention making the right attack at the right time
so i guess its good in that there is some skill required to beat it
but some bosses and even just getting from place to place can be difficult without getting sliced or shot with arrowsi give this game  out  because its everything i wanted in a good involving storyas well as some side plots by reading pieces of a journal that you have to collect as you play a steady theme an excellent soundtrack and a perfect legacy for the other sequels
its not my favorite game so it doesnt get a  but its definitely something to look back onthis is the first game ive played from capcom and i have to tell you that it was an extremely enjoyable game even though the total time it took me to finish the game was between  hours and to me that seems kind of short
there was a few parts were you dont know what in the heck you should do but otherwise this game was extremely fun and has a lot of replay value
this game is a must have for your ps library
dont miss out on this oneonimusha is cool
its that simple
great graphics great sound decent control an interesting and rather strange premise and storyline and some cleverly designed main characters make onimusha the first game since pss launch to really crow aboutonimusha is very much an arcade style game
the battles are intense the attacks are fluid the bosses are huge the weapons are sweet as is the upgrade system and the music and sound effects are great
unfortunately onimusha is also very much an arcade style game which means it is way too short a growing trend with ps games see also starfighter the bouncer and zoe
and pretty darn easy
it is also very hard to overlook the absolutely awful dubbing
it really is that horrible so bad in fact this game probably deserves a three instead of a four but im willing to overlook it with all the good the game has to offer
im not sure if capcom did this on purpose to sort of lampoon bad movie dubs but it is so distracting that it ruins many of the cinemas
its a shame too because the voice acting isnt terrible though its no metal gear solidin the end onimusha is fun
youll enjoy hacking zombie infantry men to pieces with the several weapons at your disposal four swords two of which can be upgraded a double bladed bow two daggers throwing knives the other kind of bow and a rather awsome rifle and the puzzles are designed to be clever without making you run back to the beginning of the game to find a gear or a key
but keep in mind it is way too short and easy and the resident evil riffs like playing as both a male and horribly weak female character do get a little old
but man that opening cinemapersonaly capcom is  of my favorite companiesand if you like resident evil this is a game you wont want to miss
awsome graphics not much of a story a cool samuri sword and gameplay much like capcoms re series
i havent beat the game yet but from what i have heard its a pretty short game
but it also has an amazing ammount of replay value
i always start the game over just so i can go back and kill those stupid little zobies with the chineise hats there is alot of diologe in this game and alot of those puzzles that capcom interduced in resident evil  and  this game is a fun game that will keep you playing for hours and will make a fine edtion to any collectionthe fist game in a long time to have me drooling over its graphics
the first of a small handful of ps games that genuinely look good
the voice acting is a bit too quiet though and if youre dumb like me and turn the subtitles off you miss a lot of the dialogue
the overall story however is great
i rather enjoyed the way the story tried to tie into real japanese history the way that white wolf games try to tie the world of darkness into our own creating a somewhat believeable horror story
the best part of this game however is its fully orchistrated sound track simply put its one of the most amazing soundtracks ever written for a gamethe puzzels and fetch quests are managable and you will not likely need a strategy guide for this game not that its easy but if you take a few minutes to stop and think about what youre doing you can figure it all out on your own which is nice
you feel so much smarter when you figure a game like this out on your ownfor its merrits there are however some major flaws
the control scheme once again capcom refused to abandon the archaic resident evil style controls which makes combat a little more difficult than it needed to be but thankfully once you adjust to the agonizing control mechanics and build up your weapons and learn the magic spells and special moves it becomes easier plus you can block and perry which is helpful
devil may cry is much better but this was a good prelude
the game was also the first in what seems to be a trend in hotly anticipated titles that present a strong story great graphics great sound but can be beaten in less than six hours and is just flat out too short way too short
i clocked in at about  and a half hours
id like developers to start making longer games again
heres hoping for a longer sequel and one that will play less like resident evil and more like devil may cryat first glance its hard to distinguish onimusha from aother capcom titles like resident evil and dino crisis
the same stuff is there fighting the undead lots o blood betrayal lots o blood soulsucking wait that wasnt in reonimusha is a very fun and exciting game that stays chalenging yet can also be relatively simple with certain puzzles
this makes for a fun and exciting experience through an ancient monster and zombieridden japan
thanks capcom
just what i need more nightmaresim not big on battle strategy unless ive got time to thinkin a game like this one i charge the enemy and pound buttons until the enemy is pulpor i am
which happens a lotin this game when youre smashed to dust somewhere around  times the game hands you a free pass  the option to play in easy modedont get me wrongi still die on occasion but without this mode the game would have been unsurmountable to a player of my skill and i use the term loosely
as it is ive made it to the final boss though havent beaten him yet and enjoyed the experience all around minor complaints  the use of the dpad only for character motion and the occasional bad camera anglein the case of the dpad i dont mind not being able to use the analog stick but the choice of how the dpad functions is a little weirdthe leftright arrows turn you the up arrow sprints you forward and the down arrow jumps you back
i seem to spend a lot of time tapping the left and right to line up where i want to go before i go therethis is especially bad when youre in the middle of a boss fightthe camera angles are generally quite good but often youll find yourself fighting a demon who is out of view and you have no way to bring him into view except to try to move somewhere that theres a more favorable camera angle
my personal solution is to hackandslash toward the enemy because a you can kill him even if hes not on camera and b youll usually slash your way to a better camera angle
once or twice though the camera angle set me up to take damage i could easily have avoided and since kaede cant heal except with the games rather scarce herbs and medicines ive never seen a game as stingy with healing items having her take damage is a pretty expensive propositionbut the game is pretty sounds good is anywhere from reasonably challenging to what
are you crazy
depending on your skill level and has a pretty decent story and system of combatmagicif you like harddriving combat against some pretty tough enemies and dont mind that the puzzles arent especially tricky this is a solid offering that you should enjoy
worth your time even if it is a little on the short sidethis is a fun game that lets you play as a samurai samanosuke akechi and a ninja kaede battling demons in feudal japan
the premise alone is enough to draw in any lover of anime or beatem up game fans
the games story is straightforward but keeps you interested with its endearing main characters and hideous villains some of the dialogue can be cheesy at times but one normally expects such a thing from a capcom game
the warlord nobunaga oda has returned after seemingly being killed during a battle by a stray arrow that pierced his throat
he allies himself with demons and wishes to gain their power by offering samanosukes cousin princess yuki to the demons as a sacrifice
samanosuke ofcourse embarks on a quest to save her
the controls in this game were a little dated for its time but they worked
you could only move the characters around with the dpad like the original resident evil games but considering the game has fixed camera positions that look at you from all directions using the analog stick would have made navigating the characters more confusing
unlike the resident evil games the combat is more fastpaced and actually lets you go toe to toe with the many demonic enemies you face by blocking or dodging their attacks and then slicing them up with one of several awesomely crafted mortal or magical blades
the main character samanosuke akechi is a mighty samurai who is given a powerful gauntlet that lets him absorb the souls of defeated demons which in turn allow him to upgrade his magic weapons with more powerful elemental attacks namely lightning fire and wind
he could also upgrade the magic orbs that provide him with his weapons to open sealed doors leading to new areas
he can even use a bow and arrow and a rifle but both weapons have limited ammunition
the other controllable character kaede the ninja isnt as strong or resilient as samanosuke but shes much quicker and more agile
she acquires one magical blade but still possesses no elemental attacks
she also has only one ranged weapon throwing kniveskunai
playing as kaede will make you feel more vulnerable when you face some of the tougher enemies making you miss being samanosuke while at the same time giving the ninjas scenarios a slightly more tense feeling to themregardless of which character youre playing as this game offers plenty of challenging yet fair battles especially the boss battles except the first one which was quite easy
another similarity this game has to the resident evil ones is the use of puzzles which youll spend at least half the game working on
none of them are too challenging except for one intense puzzle sequence where you constantly switch between samanosuke and kaede to make it through a room with spikefilled trap doors this is immediately followed up by a heart pounding race against time to free samanosuke from a sealed hallway filling up with water by moving a collection of metal plates around in the right order until you put two specific pieces together to form a symbol which unlocks the seal
the games music matches the current situations and locations nicely whether youre in a dark and gloomy basement with creepy horror music in the background or outside rescuing other rather cowardly samurai from demons with orchestral scores empowering you with a saving the day feel
the ingame graphics are quite good and give the characters human or otherwise a believable sense of weight and style
the cgi cutscenes are simply beautiful and combine with the awesome music to give you an enjoyable and memorable cinematic experience
the scene that plays after samanosuke defeats the final boss is a personal favorite of mine and will most certainly give you goosebumps
this game is a perfect blend of survival horror and beatem up action and while it is very linear and quite short even first time players should beat it in no more than six hours its fun and memorableonimusha warlords is a gorgeous game with an interesting story line
the game engine is classic resident evil but ow is set in feudal japan
instead of killing zombies you are killing demon warlord soldiers which had been killed in a war one year earlier at the site of the castle
in place of res modern weapons you have three swords and three different orbs
the three orbsfire thunder and wind each create their own majic attack
you can also possess knives a bow and a flintlock rifle
what i really like about the game is that it gives you a reason to fight enemies
when you kill enemies they release a soul energy and you have to suck in the souljust like soul reaverwith an ogre gauntlet
the energy gained from these processed souls can be used to quotpower upquot weapons and orbs
ow is different from re in that there is no treasure boxes  a player keeps every item found
the graphics are the best yet on ps and the story is pretty cool
i love the fact that the game audio has a japanese option
it also has englishjapanese subtitles
the only thing keeping me from giving ow  stars is the games length
it is fairly short even by re standards
it should have been  or more discs
and it only takes about  hours of gameplay to defeat the game
still ow is definitely worth the money
the magic in the game has amazing effects and the medievel hacking of enemies with magical swords is awesome
bottom line the game has a decent story amazing graphics and fun gameplay
ow is a definite top five ps gamei really had no idea what to expect going in with this one
on one hand it was produced by capcom one of my alltime favorite publishers and even they had seen enough potential in it to immediately produce a sequel
on the other if just due to the period in which the game was set i was immediately confusing it with nobunagas ambition a military simulation game thats had about  sequels and dozens of imitations in the decade or so since it was first released
im not a fan of military simulation
but within the first minute of play my suspicions and fears were whisked away
onimusha had taken hold of me and however hard i tried i just couldnt put it down for longas samanosuke youve returned from a horrifying battlefield to discover the princess youve spent your life protecting has been abducted
naturally you embark on a simple quest to rescue the princess from her captors
however instead of battling enemy soldiers samanosuke finds himself mixed up in the middle of a fight between demons and humans the undead and the living
its like resident evil on a grander scalehowever the similarities to capcoms original survival horror series extend well beyond the mere involvement of the living dead and related monsters
truly the bulk of the game itself may have been ported directly from the re series
onimusha is not a true d platform title your surroundings arent totally navigable
you watch from an overhead view as samanosuke runs from one prerendered background to the next
as you run off the screen the camera angle changes and a new background fills the screenmuch like the legacy of kain soul reaver your ultimate quest is to defeat enemies and use their very souls to enhance your own performance
the story explains this away as such on their way to conquering the earth the demons made mortal enemies of ogres
enraged the ogres have chosen samanosuke to represent them in halting the demons plans a sort of sweet scheme for revenge
they grant you a bulky attachment for your right arm used to capture enemy souls and send you on your way
if that sounds a little bit out of left field thats because it is the storyline on the whole is overly confusing generally silly and even occasionally ignoredin keeping with that trend the voice acting takes poorly written dialogue and brutally drags it along the coals
these guys didnt even attempt to match what they were saying with their characters lips and its not an uncommon thing to see your characters gums flapping for a couple seconds after hes quit speaking
despite their ability to pronounce all the characters names correctly the voice talent just isnt getting the job done here
id rather read subtitles than endure thisfortunately enough the graphics almost completely make up for the lack of compelling audio just by themselves
as a first wave title for the ps there were most certainly lofty expectations for this disc and id wager its exceeded even those
onimusha is a brilliant visual treat taking full advantage of what the new system had to offer
even liverendered scenes look exceptional with blur effects trailers following various light sources on the screen and a welldesigned rogues gallery to hack your way throughlikewise the fmv scenes in onimusha infrequent as they may be are stunning
though they havent quite reached the level of perfection that squaresoft seems to demand in their cinema scenes capcoms crew is giving the masters a stern run for their money
while the story may be a little on the light side the real emphasis in these scenes is on dynamic poses and memorable moments
as the back story is explained hundreds upon hundreds of soldiers march in slow motion illuminated only by the moonlight their spears extending a good six feet above their heads
its an ominous visual one that sticks with you long after the power button has been turned offas a standard hacknslash affair the gameplay doesnt exactly light the world on fire
if youve played final fight you basically know what the deal is here though battles do occasionally require a bit more strategy than that old capcom standby
youre granted a limited amount of magic special attacks which are best saved for major battles and the rest of the game is comprised of madly smashing the square button retreating before the enemy can attack you and repeating
interspersed throughout the land are a series of rudimentary puzzles which range from not entirely challenging to simple
youll find a special item hold onto it for a couple minutes and then find the doorway or puzzle requiring its use
again nothing to write home about but something thatll keep you occupiedmy one major complaint about the game is its length
perhaps ive grown a bit too used to rpgs that span upwards of ten twenty sixty hours before completion
i defeated onimusha in four and a half with relative ease
the end boss was a pushover and i was never really concerned about being killed in that final battle
though i did fall on three or four occasions it was always due to my own stubbornness i refuse to use potions and recovery items unless absolutely necessary and not any real difficulty built into the game itself
if you know how to press the square button and have retained any sort of knowledge from elementary school you shouldnt have much problem defeating this onethough its heavily reliant on one battle system things never seem to become monotonous
the scenery changes often new enemies are introduced at just the right times and theres a real epic cinematic feel to this that cant be put into words
for all my words about what this game could have been i think its silly to overlook what it is
a solid entertaining little packagethe only flaw i see in this game is that it is too short but never the less it stays exiting and entertaining all the way thourgh
the graphics are awsome
 if you dont like violent video games then stay clearon the fight sceens be sure to turn this up at full blast for full effectonimusha is a good game i would recommend it to anyone
although its rather short in length it makes up in game play a definitely good purchasethis game has really nice pre rendered backrounds and the best graphics for its time
the moving around is easy because the camera angles dont effect how you angle yourself to move
foward is always forward nomatter how the camera has shifted
the puzzles arent immpossible and the powering up system is awsome
best survival horror game
more action
the voices arent very good
the music makes up for it
short it only takes  and a half hours to beat
the plot is good and the levels are really cool
extremely fun game and it is only the first and foremost thing about this game that jumps out at me is that it took me five hours of game time to beat it
including my deaths and needing to reply it couldnt have been more than six hours
for a storyline game meaning replay values is small six hours is far too short
because of the small amount of play involved this is not a game to buy
that being said this is a great game to rentthis is not a puzzle game this is an action game
the puzzles mostly revolved around a door being locked and you having to run down a different corridor until you get the key
there are also a few boxes that have scrambled numbers on them which you must put into the correct order to open a room where levers must be pulled in the right order and a trapped floor that requires a little thought and the use of both your characters to safely get across
thats the limit of the puzzle aspect of the game and thats fine because this is an action gameon the action side most fighting it done with one of the three bladed weapons you pick up in the game so you dont have to worry about limited ammo unless you like using the bow or gun
the combat is pretty simple and mostly involves hitting when theres an opening and then blocking or stepping out of the way when theres not
unfortunately the game has resident evil style controls up is forward left turns left right turns right back is back which makes complicated battle sequences difficult
thats probably why the game doesnt really have any complicated battles
hopefully the sequel will go with the devil may cry controls that lead to much faster paced combati liked the game because the story line and graphics were great the battles were challenging and there were enough different opponents to keep them interesting
plus parts of the game get played with kaede your very attractive ninja sidekick to add some extra flavor
though because of her inability to get back health and powerup from fallen foes her playtime is less action oriented and more strategy
it gives a good mix to the gameoverall rent this game on some week when youve got six or so hours you can put into it
the graphics are great the game play is pretty good and its funi found my self unable to remove my butt from the beanbag my eyes became one with the television set as i was a samurhi banishing demons souls into my blinking wristwatch
extreamly short but makes up with the lack of game time with the amazeing drewling expierence of being a samurhi
i loved it i cant wait intell they make a sequel hopefully theyll give it more game length more goreing effects and more movements
its fun really intereasting story line and trully one to collect dust on your shelfsi think this is by far the best game i ever played for the ps with the exception of being way to short
as soon as i received my game i started playing it and could not stop
i played it for  hours straight until i beat it
everything about this game is so awesome
the only thing that sucks about it is that it is way to shorti just started this game last night for the first time
i am enjoying it a good deal
graphics greatcontrols good but my only huge complaint is that i really wish that you could use the joy stick
camera same as resident evil games which is fine but i kind of wish i had a little controlcombat terrific
i love the lock on button
makes fighting multiple enemies easy and smoothstory yep
dubbing terrible and laughable
lol i highly recommend playing this game in japanese with english subtitles
doverall great
i recommend iti guess we wont stop having better with the ps and its graphical qualities and that title is up to it
both fmvs and in game graphics are up to the ps technical specs
it is still using still image though but at least they look goodgameplay itself is pretty interesting and brings a new help with the quotsoul absorbingquot
so no more reliance on the  amp such like in resident evil
also its nice to just slash you way through instead of having ammunitionthe other small note of disapointment is that it only takes a few hours to finish the game the first time  all puzzles are also easy making it fasteroverall though its a game worth while trying on the psok first of all the controls are in a word really badother than that on an epic scale this game gets a four for story line which is incredible by the waythis is a great game but it is not that inovative there is one lv where you just smash buttons
but it is a great game i love it but it is only  hours long so if you spend lots of time on a game just rent it but it has a good replay value onimusha  is on the way to so this will be good for a couple of weeks so this is a must buy or rent it is a fightingactionadventure game it is great but i just wish it was longeronimusha warlords mustve blown people away back in  but time has reared its ugly face on this first entry in a series that has spawned  sequels and  spinoff fighting game
in many ways this action title reminds me of ico  throughly engaging and never dull but its over before you know itthe gameplay is actually very easy to describe if youve played any of the resident evil games besides re 
the player will use the dpad to navigate while using  attack buttons to combat enemies
there are even some retype puzzles and presentation fixed camera each room has its own loadtime documents etc
however unlike capcoms survival horror franchise the controls are not clunky at all
this game is fasterpaced and instantly grabs your attention
there are very few stupid puzzles and the weapons upgrades  item management is very simple
even when the game switches characters or if youre lostyou know that youre supposed to be stuck
onimusha is a very userfriendly title
onimusha offers the choice of japanese or engligh language and subtitles a terrific feature
the story is either too simple or too vague but what i gather is this as samanosuke you once fought along with general nobunaga until he is killed in combat
then nobunaga is soon resurrected by demons to take over the world and its up to you to kill him while rescuing a princess
sadly the story doesnt get much more detailed than that
this is almost like a mario story with bloody hackandslash in middle age japanthe story is ultimately what brings onimusha warlords down a notch even though theres a lot to like about it
the combat is easy to master and never gets too complicated
the graphics still hold up well
the music is excellent and the voice acting is equally strong
but gamers dont get a chance understand the world theyre playing in
for a game involving civil war and the supernatural onimusha is very simple and feels very isolatedin first paragraph i compared this game to ico
it was deliberately vague about the story and depended entirely on its gameplay
it featured a massive world and  characters you wanted to spend time with even if you had no idea who they were
ico remains an arthouse indie title and can be forgiven for its hour lengthbut onimusha feels like a suckerpunch
we meet several characters who seem important but are never fully explained
were thrust into a story we learn only by reading journals
we battle supernatural forces who seem only to exist within the confines of a castle keep
we have much to excited about but experience very little after only  hours
i dont mind games ending with loose ends
god of war ii metal gear solid and halo  are masterpieces
we didnt mind the ambiguous ending because we knew that an individual entry was a part of a larger universei have yet to play the sequels to this game and i do intend on purchasing them
but i urge gamers to be careful with this first installment
i paid   tax at a gamestop store and i still felt a little jipped
onimusha warlords is a solid action game with outstanding presentation
its never boring and always fun
just dont expect much after a few hoursback in  i wouldve given onimusha warlords   but now its  and games have evolved
i say   well seems like price has lowered for this game after the xbox version has come out
at this new pricepoint its definitely worth picking up
graphics are good as is the special effects
controls might take some getting used to for some
its pretty much a resident evil type of control except now you have swords instead of heavy guns
you have your choice of japanese or english language with subtitles
the dubbing is actually pretty well done here
doesnt seem like the typical bad martial arts dubbing
my one gripe for this game is the inability to skip past certain fmv scenes that you already viewed
it becomes kinda cumbersome if you repeatedly die at one point only to have to repeat certain scenes and puzzles again just to get back to the last puzzle you died onthats it exactly it this is capcom
if you have played resident evil then you already know the style of game play
if you dont like resident evil then stay away from this one
i enjoyed playing through this onewhen i saw this it looked like a resident eviltype game only instead of zombies theres demons and instead of guns you use swords
i picked this up the other day and now im ready to give you my loyal fansif i have any my opinion of onimushawarlords
now to start off the graphics are a thing of beauty even if the games about  or  years old
backgrounds are highly detailed character models are stunning and the cg intro is just nothing short of jawdropping
music is pretty darn good too but the english voiceacting is horrendous
ive set it to the japanese acting instead of the english
controls will take some getting used to unless youre a resident evil veteran
once you get the control scheme down pat its all gravy from there
only other complaint is game length camera issueslike every single capcom survival horror game and english acting
i will mention that onimusha does do a few things better than most games of this particular genre dosave for devil may cry
one is you can block attacks death stab an enemy once its down and the swords are fun to use
i know this is a reletively short review but its a reletively short game
overall i still give it a  out of  this is sean david signing offuntil next timesemper fi carry ononimusha warlords is a decent hack n slash type of gamewith some rpg elements to iteven though this is an older gamethe graphics are actually pretty goodthe characters are cool and so is the setting along with the musicthey all fit in perfectly for a game like thisthe monsters look pretty cool toomy only little gripe with the gameis the controlsthe controls can be a bit sluggish at timesand not being able to use the analog stickjust the dpad makes it a little bit worsebut once you get used to itit gets a little easieroverallonimusha is a pretty cool game for anybody who likes hack n slashaction andor rpg types of video gamesthis game was great fun not very scary but very well done
it doesnt get  stars because it isnt very long
my roomate rented it we both beat it before it had to go back
but still it has great graphs and a good plot as fun as the first resident evil even if it isnt very longthis is a great game a great addition to the capcom actionadventure games that are out there right now
the above information is wrong though the backgrounds are prerendered and have no polygons
they look awesome anyway
the characters are comprised of over  polygons the highest count in character polygons in gamingever
this means highly detailed characters with great graphics
its easy to control if you are used to resident evil but otherwise its kinda hard to get used to
my only complaint is that the game is short lasting about  hours the game takes place in feudal japan and is historically accurate and researched if that means anything to youwhen you had one of those hard days at work this the kind of game you come home too and just relieve stressi know the puzzles sucks  but the game play is awesome yeaaaah
what can i say the graphics is beautiful and i will not comment on the character bad lip sync hey
i dont care  this game is fun violence plain and simple and i like that sorry
and some of the boss characters are great all in all this deserve a  stars laterzzzzzzonimusha warlords is an epic saga of th century japan when warlords fought brutal handtohand battles for rulership and power
the game weaves actual historical accounts and capcoms own fictional storylines into one epic drama
taking place in feudal japan  onimusha is set in the civil war time ruled by the feared warlord nobunaga odaan epic masterpiecein a world of darkness and magic power hungry warlords battle one another for control of feudal japan
at the height of the chaos a young princess is kidnapped
now one lone swordsman samanosuke boldly volunteers to rescue and avenge the noble princess
but in these dark and mysterious times even samanosuke does not realize the desperation of his mission
an entire legion of demon warriorsstands between him the princessand triumphgame featuresrevolutionary quotbackground animationquot technology  backgrounds come alive with waterfalls wind effects insects weather and moreunrivaled realism  characters come alive with realistic emotion and character animationstunning motion picture quality cg movies a true cinematic gaming experiencewow
truly amazing graphics
its not just the fluid movement of the players its the minor details
the players adjust their pads after a hit in a dome they all throw four shadows because of the indoor lighting the linemen drop the first down marker and run out of the way when the play comes at them and on and on
not to mention the depth of play playing a season owning a franchise worrying about the salary capits all there
or you can just simply play football
the only downside i can really point out is the announcing
its repetitive and quickly becomes annoying
not to mention lesley visser is terrible as the sideline reporter she sounds like the vissertron  her linereading is more wooden than pinnochio
the game however is simply to beautiful to look at and play to allow the audio to detract from it
buy this if you want the best football game ever madei was very impressed with ea commitment to becoming the best sports gaming company
madden  for ps goes far as solidifying their gaming tile
the graphics are fantastic
the only problem i have with this title is the lack of human defense
i am amazed at how my cornerbacks lack the tendency to stay with there man
the computers offensive line picks up a your blitz every time
qb sacks are rare the computer always release and completes a pass when your man is about to put the qb in the hospital
but these are little things that can be tweaked for future releases
i love the franchise mode i have taken several franchise from the bottom to the top and kept within the salary cap
if you are a real football fan you have to have this oneif i were to come on and tell you this game wasnt the best football game i have ever played i would have to be out of my mind
there are a few small things i could see easports doing in the next edition to spice things up
first of all the graphics are spectacular
although from the surface they look somewhat like dreamcast as you progress into gameplay you get upclose looks at coaches and the sidelines and they added some cool details like a bench on the sideline and the players on the bench arent just number 
meaning they arent just fake players
if your the bucs on offense warren sapp is on the sideline and you can see him not just a fake player and they arent just statue like
maybe they couldve made the coaches look realistic
wade phillips looks  now come on we all know the guy has to be  on to the gameplay
again the best i have ever set my eyes on but its a little too easy to run the ball up the gut
unless playing against a peer running is pretty rediculous
braking tackles is cake
the only thing i think is challenging running the ball is getting bursts of speed and breaking away
things i would love to see in the next version although i only played for an hour at a friends something i would love to see eas add would be a gamebreak or footage of other games
i remember way back in the day of madden  for the snes
after your game was over you had the option of watching the ending of another exciting game
an addition i do fully approve of is the ea sportsticker
on the bottom of the screen scores of games come and go which helps make this game realistic
i hope this review was helpful and believe me  stars is no bad review
i just expected the tiniest bit more from the graphics especially
peacethis is a good game and the graphics are pretty good
in order to run this game on windows xp home edition you will need to run this in windows compatibility mode i got this to run in windows  compatibility mode
trying to run this game windows xp results in a quotlockupquot of the pc
the windows  gave an enumeration error and windows nt  wouldnt run at all
we have an older joystick that is connected to the pc using a serial to usb converters usb nest
the joystick had to be disconnected from the pc in order to get madden nfl  to run
a joystick that has a usb connector will work without any problemsthis game is great
of all the ps titles ive played its the best by far i havent played ssx though cause i dont like the idea even though it has gotten good ratingsim not a huge fan of sports games and ive never really liked football games i dont even like watching it on tv but ive spent hours and hours and hours playing this game both alone and withagainst friendsthe game like most games does cheat at times for me quite a bit but for the computer a lot more but in general its quite balanced
im not a fan of the music but i dont like rap that much
otherwise the sound is goodyou can hear the stadium announcers in the background telling about cars with their lights on or parked illegally and sometimes they say funnier things
also madden has his usual stupid comments just like a real football game but they do get old after playing a few games
the graphics are amazing easily the best on the ps
just about everyone has heard the stories of people passing by assuming youre watching a game on tvthe first time i played the game there was a scene i initially thought was liveaction footage even though i knew it wasnt
also the controls are very good and intuitive
and the madden card system is like giving you an additional game to play alongside the football game itselfif you like football and video games youll probably like this game
if you like football games youll love this game so buy it nowbest football game ive ever playedgraphics  almost perfect
collision detection is a little off sometimes player falls before graphics show the collision and occasional glitches players helmet goes through another player but overall amazingsound  very bad
john madden and pat summerall are terrible announcers  no emotion in pats voice and maddens phrases are repeated far too often
one time madden repeated the same phrase on  straight playsgameplay  perfect
the game is a little slower than the ps version which actually makes it better
more time to read blocks and really appreciate the graphicsoverall  great game
great replayability with franchise mode and madden cards earn them by accomplishing various challenges then trade with friends
just fix the commentary and graphics glitches and this is a perfect gameone major improvement over the previous madden games is the player movement
the improvements are clearly visible when the player is catching the ball taking a hit getting the snap etc
some annoying parts area the rosters require some shuffling if you want to get them to be accurate for this season ie dolphins start damon huard at qb and jj johnson at hb this was never the case this year
b camera view makes it tough to see sideline actionc offensive plays broken down by athlete some may like this but i find it a little annoying when you are looking for a certain type of playd i still cant get a pass interference call they are murdering my wideoutse computer is still fairly stupid about clock managementf faces arent very accurate see kurt warner he just looks like a monsterthis game looks great plus its fun even for me and i only moderatly like football go dolphins but if you are going to spend the money get  or i am a convert to the madden football series dating back to  prior to that i was a sega genesis owner who eschewed the hype surrounding the madden opting instead for the lesserhyped yet fundamentallysound college footballs national championship which incidentally i still consider to be one of the best football games ever created for a console
when i switched over to the playstation in  i was an nfl gameday fan
but in  i converted over to the madden series and have been hooked sinceso how does this latest edition of madden translate to the new generation of consolesgraphics   i couldnt tell you the difference between a framerate and an interest rate but i can tell you this the graphics for this game are absolutely incredible
i just cannot do them justice in written format
although a clicheacute you really do have to see them to believe them
the auto replays are astonishing
details such as a players breath in cold weather and the glare of the stadium lights on a players helmet augment the experience
why not a 
occasionally the picture becomes slightly choppy
and those demonlike eyes
dont stare directly into them
gameplay   the realistic gameplay is unmatched
one thing i noticed immediately was that the juke and spin moves are not as responsive as those found in the psx version
the juke move is supposedly touchsensitive ive not noticed this
in the psx version the juke move was a wild swiping move almost like a player skating across a frozen pond
it was highly effective but not entirely realistic
same with the spin move
these moves in the ps version are not nearly as arcadeish as their psx counterparts
this took me a while to get used to
however the fact is that these moves in the ps version are much more realistic than those in the psxthe madden series has built its reputation through a detailed franchise mode where you control an extensive offseason of trades signings and a round draft
veterans of the madden series will be glad to know that the franchise mode is in place and deeper than ever
i have found it more challenging to negotiate with players than in the psx version
agents for more highlyvalued players are not likely to deviate from their original salary requests
again a little more frustrating but much more realistic
one quick sidenote i truly wish ea sports could take this franchise mode and translate it into a similar mode for its nba live nhl and triple play series
the createaplayer mode is incredible
the amount of detail you can adjust is simply overwhelming but in a great waya couple of negatives in the gameplay   kicking in mk has been a challenge so far as the kicking meter is a faint red and is difficult to see
hopefully this will be fixed in the k version  sacking the qb thus far has been an impossible task for me
on mkpsx i could work through blocks and get to the qb a couple times a game
so far this has not been the case with the ps version
even controlling a defensive tackle with an overall rating of  i struggle breaking free from a guard or center rated in the low s wr patterns  this is really the one aspect of the madden series which has always frustrated me
for as long as i can remember receivers in the madden series have not always run full patterns
this is no exception in the ps version
simply put you cant throw timing patterns in this game
in order for a qb to throw an adequate  yard out he must throw the ball before the receiver makes his cut
if you do this in madden the receiver whos supposed to run an outpattern changes his route most often to a fly pattern
youre supposed to be able to press the l in order to lead the receiver
a couple of problems a most of the time this does not work and b the concept is that qbs are supposed to lead the receivers so why should i have to press a special button
the aforementioned college footballs national championship for the genesis was handsdown the most accurate football game in this regard
if i threw an out the receiver ran an out
this is a detail that although very frustrating to me does not detract from my overall enjoyment of the gameaudio   summerall and madden are exhaustingly repetitive
its time for ea take advantage of the full power of the ps and jazz up the playbyplay
and one more question is leslie visser really necessary
the environmental sounds the hits on the field and all of the other noises that come along with the football game are in here and are welldonereplay value   the indepth franchise mode means that its not likely youll get bored with this game too quickly
i didnt think i would but i miss the  minute warning play mode and the fantasy draft mode that was available in madden  for the psx
hopefully they will add these features in the  versionfurthermore for those who prefer more arcadelike play there are madden cards which unlike special codes
you collect these by accomplishing certain tasks
ive not used these but people i know say that they truly enhance their overall enjoyment of the gameoverall   this is the best football game ever created for a console
the audio can be maddening at times no pun intended but its not enough to take away from the overall enjoyment of the game
as the ps enters its second year and programmers become more familiar with it i hope that some of these little quirks can be fixed
but this is definitely a mustown for football fansmadden football is smoothly animated
the crunches when a dl flattens you or the reverse is sharp
the sound quality overall is great except that the commentary is waaaay too repeatitive for a game of this calibur
in this regard i think dcs nfl k is betterim not sure if its just me but the players look squat even when i eliminate the flak jackets its a bit annoying since this gives them a slightly comical look
while having less polygon counts the k version seems more in proportioni agree with a previous reviewers comment about defending the pass and passing in general
star receivers almost always seem to break for  yards and they rarely drop the ball
passing over a dbs head is impossible unless your receiver is so far away that the db cant touch the pass but theres really rare
the advantage aside from the cosmetic of madden over nfl k is the franchise system ai is tougher
in nfl k i used to be able to sign good players for  years on fairly low salaries madden wont let you do that
good players demand a shorter term or arod type salaries
also maddens franchise system allows for players that you created to be signed a failing in the k systemif you own a ps madden will keep you occupied for a long time
if you own the dreamcast nfl k will do the same if you have both its a toss up but i would give a slight nod to ki received my ps for christmas and  of the  games i bought was madden  i am an extremely big football fan and i played nfl k to death
of course my first mission was to compare this game to k and when i first played the game i thought quotwell the graphics are awesome but whats up with the controlsquot
the controls seem a bit strange
for example you can being a wide receiver and be holding quotoquot to sprint out but once you catch the ball the sprint button is now quotxquot
this will almost always lead you to spinning once you catch the ball as quotoquot is spin once you have the ball
maybe its me but when the players are at the coin toss but they seriously look like midgets with big eyes
this is probably the only graphical dissapointment
the graphics are gorgeous
everyting is round and smooth and even the side lines are detailed and d
now one major concern is the ability to cut up
if you are sprinting up field and you see a gap to cut into nope it isnt happening
the game makes it almost impossible to cut because if so called quotmomentumquot
this is seriously annoying and frustrating
another frustrating aspect is john madden and pat summerall announcing
 these are all minor and once you start playing you will find it is a seriously challenging and addicting game for every football fan
you cant compare this game to k because k has a more arcade feel to it
as a football sim and also as a fun party game madden scores big and i highly reccomend it as a ps launch pick upthis game is not the best nascar game on the market any more nascar thunder  and the soon to be released  are better versoins of this game but it is better then nascar heat  
if you like nascar or racing games and dont want to spead a lot of money  this is a perfect pick up right now to get started on you psfirst off just like roleplaying games there will be a segment of the gamebuying populous that will buy this game the week it is released and a portion that will avoid it like the plague
it really depends on whether or not you enjoy nascar
i have played eas nascar series for a few years now and have always been pleased by their treatment of americas fastest growing sport
as for this rendition there is a lot of good as well as some question marksfirst off the good the graphics are wow good
the cars tracks periphery and especially pit stops look incredible
the sense of speed is fine
the amount of cars on the track at one time has increased to  up from  previously
the driver roster is diverse and includes richard petty as well as adam petty and kenny irwin
control is spot on and you will need it to be
there are a few presets to use in certain modes so if you arent really big on endless tweaking you can pick one and racenow the interesting stuff the track list had been reduced to   no las vegas texas michigan homestead dover pocono new hampshire or phoenix
although there are several instances of visiting the same track twice under different lighting daynight the missing tracks do hurt
not to mention there are no fantasy tracks which were fun to race when the standard ones got old
this smells of a rushjob and wouldnt be surprising given the fact that knockout kings  got pushed back to early  and that nhl  also seemed a bit hurried and not fully planned outthe main other issue i have is with the general difficulty
even on arcaderookie this game puts up a fight
being a veteran of these games i tried to jump in at simulationveteran and got shellacked by the competition
not that the difficulty is a horrible thing i was just very surprised given the relatively easy nature of the previous iterationsthere is some framerate drop at certain points in the race and though i love the new realtime damage to the cars the actual visuals for this effect leave a bit to be desired
the menus are very sparse and this time around the commentary is almost exclusively done by bob jenkins with minimal input from benny parsons who is always a treat quotthis track has the best foodquot for every track in nascar 
though now your spotter and crew chief are a lot more vocalbut even with the annoying leaveouts and a few irritating ingame features this still manages to come out as another quality nascar title for ea sports
like i said many will either be running to the store or ignoring it altogether so reviews wont change a lot of minds in this case
lets just be glad that its a firsteffort for ps and can only get better from hereps
did i mention how great it is to creep up on the  ride his bumper give him a little tap and watch the tiresmoke billow up as he takes a hard right into the wall
you hafta see it to believe how cool the wrecks aresince  snowboarding was released it has been as much of a trend as relasing a cartoon racing game
i am talking about snowboarding games
many company have misserably
other almost made the game okay but never really was there a good snowboarding game since  and after cool boarder just got worse every year until now i had all but givin up on aeeing a good boarderat first when i heard of this i thought who really wants another snowboarding game
then i saw all the great reviews for this and my thoughts changed a bit
then when the big day came the ps relase of course
 my brother and i got tekken and my sister got ssx
now more than a monthh later i am ready to review it
unlike other reviews i will review this by different catagories
entertainment     the fun level in this is excellent ant would be perfect except for the fact that you will get of course a lot if you play too flashy which can destroy your changes of winninggraphics   wow
very nice graphics
ps has games with better but these will definetely doreplay   there are many different events you can choose from and secret characters and tracks to unlock
you will be playing this for a good amount of timecontrol   this is the games only problem i wont get in to it but i personnally did not like the control
but do not not purchase the game because of this unless control is very important in a game to yousound   all right music and excellent sound effects make the sound of ssx niceoverall  this is a solid very fun gameas i was in my review of smugglers run i am in awe of the sheer magnitude that this new platform affords
granted there have been very few games that have taken advantage of that fact yet but the thing  was just born lets give it a little bitthe tracks  the runs are huge
right off the bat there are  runs you can try and one actually take  minutes
if youre actually trying to get through
the more experience you build up the longer and more interesting the runs getoptions again the more experience you build up the better the options
from new clothes to new boards to a sliding performance scale that actually allows you to increase your own abilities with pointsgraphics dont even get me started
from the box this thing looks more like a documentary than a video game
the colors are stunning and the speed is phenominal
if only more companies would put this kind of time and energy into their game playability look and feel then the world would be one step closer to perfect
okay maybe not but it might be a nice place to startall in all if you like snowboarding games even marginally dont bother renting this game just buy it
its certainly well worth the initial cost and youll be pulling it out as long as you own your systemnot the amazing kick in the pants that madden  was but significantly better than the horrid nhl  and pleasantly better than the twitchy nascar this is still fifa so if youve played it once youll know your way around this title
the gameplay stays the same though special moves seem a bit easier this time around
the amount of leagues has increased significantly korean league anyone
with the showcase american mls making an appearance
announcing is thankfully back to a vintage uk team instead of the lame americans that polluted the previous fifa on psx
the music is the same sort of poptechno mobysounding stuff that never seems to go away in games like thesethe graphics are much improved with bigger onscreen players as well as spectacular lighting effects on the various stadiums
the postgoal cut scenes are alright not great but a nice change of pace
the player models on the closeups are still annoyingly blocky and awkward but weve come along way since fifa on the genesis
and thats another good quality both soccer games for dreamcast are pretty poor
it is to your advantage to own a ps if not simply for the pleasure of a good soccer gamethe one gripe i have about this game is the camera angle its too close
the players are commendably larger but this comes at a price you just cannot see who you are passing to nor can you tell where the goalie is on shots
instead fifa opts for a new and nonetooaccurate arrow that turns from red to yellow to green
redquotdont passquot yellowquotrisky passquot greenquotsafe to passquot  needless to say this arrow system gets real old the first time you pass on green only to have the opponent take the ball away but you have no choice as you cant see that far upfield so youre forced to take the computers oftenwrong arrow system as gospel
i will also say that this game even on the medium difficulty level is too easy
all it takes is either a cross pass from the outside followed by a bicycle kick or a sprint down the middle of the field accompanied by a few  spins or fancy kickups to score
and the only way the cpu can stop you is to commit some cheap sliding tackle that you always get carded for if you try it
a stupid double standardeven with the ease of play and the awfully close camera this game still provides the best fifa experience yet
the amount of teams are mindboggling and the gameplay apart from the cheap plays is rocksolid
highly recommended for any soccer enthusiast as well as the casual footballerlet me start off by saying that this rating should be at least a  or higheri would have set it at a  but that is a very rare rating for me to giveso far only one game nba street has gotten a i proudly own this game and feel it is one of the best games on the pssome people are saying that ea sports  up and made this game badthats a bunch offirst of all the graphics in this game are top notch and test the ability of the systemthere is many things in this game to do with one player and with twoanother great thing about this game is the numerous amount of teamsmuch like all the other fifa games you get teams you havent even heard of to choose fromto conclude this game is hands down the best fifa game to date and anyone who disagrees must either be extremely confused or they didnt play this game and just think that they can bad mouth itsports fans should buy this game and non sports fans should rent it firstnhl  was the first sports game i ever bought
i had never been interested in sports games before but the speed and brutal checking had me hooked
me and my friends would play  for hours
then nhl  came out  what a dud
what a disappointmententer nhl  the graphics are great and the commentary by clement and thorne sounds just like they do when i am watching an avs game
at first i thought  was too slow but then i found the control to up the speed  just one notch does it for me
i tried it all the way up and it is way to fast
but i love the fact that you can change the speed
default speed is good if you are trying to teach your wife or newbie but bump it up just one when you are playing your experienced friendsi still have a hard time playing defense but that is just me not any fault of the controls though it seems to me that bodycheck was x in  now it is o maybe im wrong and getting to old to remember
oh wellnhl  was the only game i actually bought with my ps  all the rest i am just renting
all in all this game seems to be a worthy successor to the now classic nhl since i am old and married now i dont play video games like i did when i was single and living in a loft downtown
that being the case i am giving it  stars
but if i was livin the single life again where every day was a party nhl  would defintely get  stars for the quothangin with the guysquot fun factorget this for only the used price
it was a great start of hockey for the ps system
any part of the game play can be updated and made to make the game easier to play
great graphics and better game play then its counter part for the psi have to say i really dig this game
the graphics arent perfect but they are pretty good and most of the hockey players look like their real life counterpartsthe game is rather balanced and its way fun to check someone into the glass and steal the puck
you can practically feel the exhiliration when you score a goal or the disappointment and anger when a goal is scored on you
the replay of goals is really tasty lets  you have to feeling of really being therethe season mode is nice because you have to make sure that you have a well balanced team and that you dont let your goalie get too fatigued throughout the course of the  game season
ive been playing thru the game with the new jersey devils and i know how each of my players does his part who the strong and weak members are and how to use them to their optimum
this is fun for any hockey fan but ea has always made some of the best sports games in existanceea sports certainly put all their attention to this years hockey games to the playstation
their nhl  for the psx was terrible and nothing new when compared to last years title
however on the psx things are much different and the disapointment level is much lessto start with this game looks amazing
everything from the animation of reallooking checks facial expressions player complaints when called for penalties injuries players grab their hips for hip injuries and wrists for wrist injuries realistic deflections goals scoring by screening goalies put a guy in front of the opponents goalie and watch the late reaction by the netminder all the way to the coach yelling at the ref and other players on the bench interacting with the game is simply amazing
some other great things in this game are the best features ever
take all the gameplay options to creat bigger checks more rebounds etc
my favorite option is with the game clock
all games are  minutes finally
 but you can adjust the clock speed not length to make periods go to actually  minutes or speed the clock to go  or  minutes this is really a good thing because i hate losing my powerforward for the whole period for fighting if i play a  minute game
back in the game is the ref kicking out centers from the faceoffs whos controlled by a buttonmashing player
stat tracking injuries and suspensions are done perfectly
gameplay is right on too
gone is the sloppy control and game physics and the ai on the allstar level is deadon to real life teams and playersim currently playing a season with the rangers on the allstar lever and i currently have a  record with my top scorer having around  points no more unrealistic statsthe bad in this game is limited
the main thing i cant stand is the ultrapoor goalies
far too many weak goals are scored
the only way to eliminate this is to learn how to control your goalie manually or be frustrated on a regular basis when your goalie weakly waves at a superslow wrister from the point and totally misses it
if you can learn to play as your goalie when on defense youll eliminate this problem
the other main problem with the game isnt as big as the goalie problem but improvements can be done to make the fighting better
the fighting looks great but still players just stand there and take a beating the fighting in this game is very similiar to the fighting in the original arcade quotblades of steelquot that came out around overall graphically sound options and overall gameplay this game is the best hockey game ive played in a long timeif not the best ever
tweak the gameplay options to your liking and from the pregame introduction to the threestars of the game youll find out that this is the best hockey game this year
im not just saying this because its on the psxim saying this because its been a while since ive really enjoyed a hockey sim on any platformthis game is great
easily the best playbyplay ive ever heard the graphics are fantastic and the gameplay modes are great
you can change your teams offensive or defensive strategies
heres why it doesnt get  stars the fights are a joke and the penalties are silly
double minors and min majors are called way too often
the checking is also a little overdone but it can happens once in a while
i am especially impressed with the realistic movements of the players
very well doneespn track and field ps is based on the  olympic games
i own it im also an athlete a mm sprinterpositives the game is good to play for a certain time they manage to have the events close to real and with actual athletes by name and county the intro to each the idea or have the words relating to the event is real unique a star for that job the movement of the athletes are really good
close to the real thing the compitision can be real good at parts of the race have tutorals to show you which bottons are used to play the event the replay is greatnegatives not very much events after a hour of play the game get pretty boring dont have that great of choices in athletes on it shouldve had heats and finals for the events to show that you really worked to compete in the finals when you break the world record they really dont make a big thing bout it on the game
a few cameras here and there but nothing dramatictips for improvements for any new espn track  field games should have a atleast athletes to pick from under atleast  countries enter more events such as m m m m m m hurdles discus hammer shot put javelin high jump pole vault long jump triple jump xm relay xm relay have the record holder be able to compete in thier event in which they hold the record improve the realisumn in the game simular to the  athens show medalist collecting medal on the medal stand need a mixture of different countrys music and not rock  roll for everything
not everyone is a fan of rock  roll give you the chance to create players and be able to train them weight lifting spint drills sprint starts endurance jumps etc
for thier events so they can become stronger and also fasterits an okay game when you have extra time on your handsboohoo it was tooo hard to playnonesense
evil dead is the king of all b horror movies and this game was awesome
i know everyone has their own opinion but dont badmouth a game just because you couldnt play it
i think the game was average difficulty and intense
ash is the undisputed king of all heroes and once you get the special moves with his movie catch phrases down youre ripping up monsters like theres no tomorrow
if youre an evil dead fan and not a crybaby youll love itthis game is a spectacular instalment of the past s movies evil dead and army of darkness
it uses great voice overs for instance bruce cambell
the angle shots and graphics could use a little bit more progress but the button handling and controlling is great for a ps game of its marvelous movie credencials
i reccomend this game for  teens everywherei rented this game and played it for about a week
from the start i was blown away by the graphics
the players emotions gear special effects and background graphics are stunning
i was immpressed how the wind blows the riders numbered vest as heshe races down the mountain
powder blows up as the rider launches off jumps and the most realistic crowd i have seen on any games cheers you as you race by
i give the graphics a solid  stars
it is equal to madden
the game i rented did not include a manual which prevented me from knowing what buttons to hit for tricks so the learning curve was a little longer for me than it should be
the gameplay is difficult but not impossible
i was able to win every event accept the downhill race other riders kept knocking me down
the game is fun but very slooowwww
the riders go into slow mo during their tricks
a bit too dramatic for me
i also hate the music but that is just me
i just found it difficult to get overally excited about this game proabably because i a have played so many other snowboard games like cool boarders for the past three years
i suppose i am due for a new sportlove the game play etc
but there are graphics glitches in this game that were never addressed and patched or corrected that can lock it up or make it jump back to the deckstop and ruin a good roll you might be having in combat
if it does not flake out on you it is really a kewl approach that would have been great to see sequals to
especially with all of the voices from actors from the dp tv show
could have been greatmost of you trekkies watched ds series and you know very well about the  wars out of gamma quadrant
now you can relive them and change them help  defeat the evil  dominion or destroy all defenses and invade as  dominionyou control iti have already provided an earlier review of this game
here is an addendum comparing starfleet command sfc vs armada vs dominion wars dw all of which i have playedsfcproslarger variety in missionsyou get to follow a starfleet careerdetailed control of ship systemsconstoo few ships per battlecareers too shortarmadaprosgood story animation sequencesfun to be able to play all sides as integrated part of the storylineconsterrible battle sequences basically army troops posing as star trek ships so the ships fly in strange formations
the game is really command and conquer with star ship spritesfar too many campaigns and starts to get repetitived spritesdwprosexcellent big fleet battle sequencesbeautiful graphicshigh level control of ship systemsconsweak story animation sequencesgame gets repetitiveproblems running on some graphics cardsthis game stays true to the series in terms of story
newbies to the star trek saga would be hanging by a thread in the plot
game play is decent  i would have liked this game better if the ships at our disposal would be more control friendly
when you ask a ship to fire phasers or photon torpedoes or attempt a manuever such as alpha strike it fires on its own
starfleet command allowed the player to fire phasers and photon torpedoes at the players discretion this game does so on its own
winning missions pretty much depends on your arsenal of weapons and what class ship you have or how many ships are in your fleetthe graphics are rendered quite nicely and you can import ships from starship creator warp  only akira defiant and galaxy into the multiplayer game
galaxy ships that are imported in seems to appear invisible  a product of a program glitch or bug that need fixing and patching
previously no patches are available online to correct this mistake
this game seldom crashes and players can finish the entire game in one day
you can chose to be dominion or federation forcesgameplay  graphics  sound  value  this game was a great game
it had a great story line for the federation and dominion
it provided you with a whatif story if the federation had lost
the importing ships from creator was a nice touch
you could upgrade the ships import them and watch them fight in instant action and if you have an endless supply of credits in creator warp  and upgraded your ship well you can watch it take on the entire ai fleet
however if the ship importing doesnt work the replay value severly diminishes
plus the fact that most people and companies sell programs that need xp and newer programs and owning an xp i had  before so thats how i played the game it will be about impossible to play dominion wars on it
so if you have an old computer with  or lower and have some free time its great but otherwise its a game that will sink into the pastim not quite sure what it is about this game that i didnt quite like
i just didnt find it quite as fun as the previous three
maybe its just the jokes are getting old or a lot of the puzzles are just variations on what weve had before insult fights etc
the music is more or less the same and i found myself turning it off in places way too repetitive
i also never did understand games that dont make good use of the mousethis made me use keyboard keys for everything not just basic character movement
yuck
i find that slows me down and is rather tediousbut it still is one of the better adventure games out right now and if you like the genre it is still well worth buying and playing
if this is your first monkey island game you probably will enjoy it much more than i did
and heck if you havent played grim fandango yet getting that game a much better one imo more than makes up for the cost of this one
i also was surprised to find a complete quickwalkthrough for the game kudos to lucas arts for including this rather than the usual  hint line numberescape from monkey island is the forth game in the monkey island  series which started out in  with each new release of each moneky island sequel there was always something new and fun to do
for example in the third release  curse of monkey island the hero guybrush threepwood went for a complete make over to become a goofy lanky lovable pirate in a long interactive animated cartoon
escape from monkey island is no exception
it has something new to offer for everyonelets start with the storyline
it continues from curse of monkey island where guybrush and elaine returns from their honeymoon to find out that they were pronuced quotdeadquot
apart from that melee island was about to be taken over by a villian charles
l charles for diehard monkey island fans no prizes for guess who that is
the plot thickens when an australian realestate tycoon buys over the triisland area and turns it into a tourist spot
and somehow all this seems to be linked to a voodo artifact the ultimate insult in which guybrush has to find outwhat i liked about this game as with all other monkey island games is its humour
the game makers pokes fun at todays hip and happenin culture for example on one of the island there is a guy called hugo selling perfumes
apart from that its wicked usages of puns will here you brusting with laughterperfect for anyone who is feeling downthe music let me say this it is fantastic
although most of it is repeated from curse of monkey island the music really puts you in a tropical mood to sail around the caribbeanthe voice acting the actors has done a pretty good job doing the voice acting for the characters bringing them to lifethe graphics escape from monkey island is different from all other monkey island game because it is in gorgeous d
that means you have to have a d acclerator card to play this game
the way the game designers took time to model the d areas really pays off the graphics are quotsmoothquot and bright and beautiful to look atwhat i dislike about this game is its controls and some of the puzzles
the game interface is difficult to master and to have guybrush lined up in a particular manner eg to enter a roomis frustrating
another thing with this game is that if you accidentally have guybrush stand to close to a door he may enter the room automatically which a again is frustrating as you may not want him to enter the roomsome of the puzzles in the game makes no sense
it will have you tearing out your hair when you cant solve it
for example you have to cause a parrot by giving it beer so that it can help you solve the puzzle
how logical can that be overall this is a fun game to play although it does have some illogical and difficult puzzles to solve that will dampen your mood
however it is worth your every cent to get it if you are looking for something new to playi agree with most monkey island fans out there why it had to be d
the drawing stile from curse of monkey island third game was great very funny
now well have to watch guybrush threepwood and elaine in their aliased romancewell its still a monkey island game so youll get everything and still more youve got from the past games humour hours of game play lots of insults and some great memories from the past monkey island games
if you never played a monkey island game its a good title to startzork nemesis is an absorbing adventure game in the tradition of myst
you are immersed by music and beautiful graphics
in the game a dark lord has risen and you are to stop this nemesis
the puzzles are challenging and the sound effects and music are top notch and very atmospheric
compared to other zork games this one is virtually humorless
the story is dark and depressing but it doesnt keep it from being an unpleasant game
zork grand inquisitor is much better but this one is worth playingzork nemisis is a quotzorkquot game in name only
unlike zork grand inquisitor and return to zork nemisis is a completely different story line
the game is a dark adventure with good graphics great sound and good gameplay
it wins a place on my best games listmafia is a good game very similiar to grand theft auto games
it has a decent story to it you work for the mafia as a hitman and whatever else they want you to do mostly their dirty work
it is a fun game and can be very enjoyable at times  my big problem with the game is it involves a lot of trial and error which can be extremely frustrating
some of the missions in the game are pretty damn hard and you can get stuck on for hours some for days and the fact that you have to repeat them over and over til you complete them right can be very boring and annoying after a while
the game does not have a quick save but to its benefit it has autosavescheckpoints basically at certain points during missions
the price of this game is  nowadays making it well worth it to buy and check outeven though this game is old and has been replaced by many other games this game was the one that popularized this genre
the game is a classic and is a must play if you havent played it before it combines grand theft auto with first person shooter and a great story line as you move up the ranks in the italian mobi first playedwatched mafia on my brothers pc back in about   sometime later probably december of  i purchased it for  at a retail store because of all the fine memories i had of it
what a great buythe game can be tedious
it isnt quite like gta which is made for people that cant concentrate on one task for more than  seconds that can be me sometimes but as one reviewer said it has more class
but because of the setting and a few items such as the ai it can become slightly boring at times
the cars are slower you are in a game set in the s right
the ai isnt the greatest but is okay for when the game was made
the buildings lack details that you might expect in newer games but again for the time it was made that isnt an issue
especially since you can drive completely in and around the city with no load screens
that is a huge areathe game also gets a little frustrating at times when you have a strict time limit or when you have to have a gun fight and even more so when you get in a fist fight
this isnt a straight up shooter and it isnt a straight up driving game
it is both
it does both well while not being perfect at either
that in and of itself is a great accomplishment for such a beautiful gamewhat really sets this game apart for me is the story and a close second is the detail of the living city itself
the story is top notch and it takes a lot to get me to say that
even in the spots that dont seem to fit perfectly it still feels like a solid story and a player can get attached to some of the other characters
even the song at the ending credits which doesnt fit the theme of the game but is a great song still seems to fit the story
as for the living city there are gas stations you have to hit if you are low on gas there are draw bridges that raze up and down when ships come by fun to ramp if you time it right great fun to lose cops over and you can even take a trollery or an elevated train around town fun to mess with the ai by shooting from these
i could be wrong but i seem to remember a couple of places where trains run across the road as well
then there are the various seemingly realistic locations that give a lot of real world emotion to the gameive heard a lot of criticism about save games and health packs
i can understand that i suppose but its not really a valid point
they didnt want to make the game too easy by allowing you to quick save every time you turned a corner
additionally they probably didnt want to tempt the player into saving themselves into a corner on timed missions
perhaps a few well placed autosaves would be nice but if you can settle down and concentrate on the game for a few minutes or stop and come back another time during the hard parts youll be fine
and there are health boxes in places where you are expected to fight a large number of enemies such as in the hotel at the airport on the river boat and in the old prisonphysics arent the greatest but its still fun to run people over and smash carsonce you complete the story you unlock free ride extreme which allows you to complete random odd and sometimes nearly impossible tasks to unlock really cool cars
this adds a bit to the game though not much
it basically makes it even more fun to do free ride because you can chose a really fast taxi cab to help make more moneythe total package is great im not sure why it is priced so high hear on amazon
dont buy it here aparently buy it somewhere else if you can find it
maybe send a message to those guys that gave it one star because they got bored driving or couldnt survive long enough
if they still have their copies they may sell them to you for cheapgraphics   for the timephysics   not bad for the time but not the greateststory  gameplay   its hard to mix driving and shooting and they didnt get it perfect but they got it closeinterface   very intuitivereplay potential   maybe hard to replay the story becuase it is always the same but the extra features are fundetail  maps   beautiful and fairly vastartificial intelligence   probably better than that for the time it was made but the ai drivers especially sufferedsoooooo total rating comes tooooooo  if you enjoyed grand theft auto  then youll most likely drool over this game
try and picture gta but back in the s and youre half way there
now stealing cars isnt nearly as important in this game as it was in gta but you can still do it
mafia does lack some of the freedom elements we all enjoyed in gta but you can take the free ride option and just cruise around the city
the graphics in mafia are simply amazing character models and surroundings alike are breathtaking
as far as weapons you get to use all of your favorite guns from the old movies yes yes the tommy gun is finally here
youll spend the same amount of time if not more of gameplay driving around the city on missions in vintage cars that look beautiful
driving in the game is similar again to gta you have to deal with traffic pedestrians etc
you also have to watch out for the police theyll stop you for speeding and other driving offenses like running red lights
all and all this has been a  very enjoyable game and i highly recommend it to any one who likes the criminal genremafia is one of those games that allow you to explore every inch of the environment youre in
it is a rd person perspective player and the city youre in has virtually no limits
you can go anywhere you would like pick up any car you would likethe story takes place back in the twenties if i remember correctly
you are a simple man a cab driver that is trying to make ends meet when suddenly one day opportunity knocks at your door
you help a mafia figure escape a shooting by a rival mob family and in return youre offered a chance to do a few favors here and therefrom there on the story unravels
you become increasingly more trusted within the mob family are being given more important and confidential missions and goals to completegreat gameplay great action great storytelling and overall plotby todays standards the game doesnt require much computing power however if your system is not relatively new i would encourage you to read the system requirements on the box before you pick up this title
i remember last year when i played it it was a bit heavy on my thenmonthsold systemalso keep in mind this game has no multiplayermafia came out with very little publicity
sometimes those are the best games
minus all the hype a person can enjoy a game without all the high expectations that often are not realized
thats what happened with me herenot since the original no one lives forever have i felt like i was playing a movie not a game
mafia has a deep storyline portrayed through wellproduced cutscenes
your character tommy angelo is a member of a mafia family in the s in lost heaven which seems a lot like chicago
the game plays as a retrospective of the bigger events in his short career with the family
mafia continues to be compared to grand theft auto   in some ways thats a correct assessment
but in most ways theyre very different
gta is more of a cartoonish overthetop wild crime ride
mafia is darker and more realistic
if you enjoyed gta you may not enjoy mafia if youre expecting the same kind of experienceif youre interested in a somewhat difficult storydriven third person shooter that also involves driving youll enjoy mafia
the gameplay is a blast
everythings herereckless gunfights in different locales
shootouts while driving vintage cars
cops that actually pull you over for running red lights or speeding
political assassinations
rooftop chases
a bank robbery
even a racing game withinthegame which has become infamous for its difficulty but still changes things up in a refreshing way
all of this taking place within a great storyline that takes twists and turnsthe reason i dont give it a full five stars is because of a few issues  youll need a high end system to really get this game going
while this isnt necessarily a negative it still has a penchant for slowdowns during unacceptable moments mainly large gunfights when theres a lot of other activity onscreen
i know there have been a few gamers who have had other problems getting the game to run well at all
collision detection is also a little weak in some areas and the ai isnt always too bright
when this involves characters you need to help protect its very annoyingoverall however this is a superb interactive movie
it takes some thinking and strategy but its well worth your time and money
look for mafia to be a game of the year candidatethis game is hard
you will die many times and have to keep playing the same level
that said the game is incredibly addictive has some of the best ambient noise around and the use of motion capture makes the soldiers move like real soldiers
the reason for the difficulty is the ultrarealistic one hit can kill you idea combined with rather accurate enemy fire
add to this some poor pathfinding on the part of your allies and avoiding casualties becomes extremely difficult
also there are some bugs in the game but these can be fixed by downloading a patch
strategy fans will enjoy this game immensely but other people may get frustratedthis game rocks
as far as gameplay it is as good as it gets
my only gripe is all the patches and that if one doesnt have the same patch upgrade their may be issues on connecting to some of the serversthat said i had very few bugs in the single player game and only the patch issue for multiplayer
i think this game blows away moh and is graphically better than bf  though bf  is fun to play as wellif you dont have this game id highly recommend getting it
also the sabre squadron expansion is a must get
if you are watchful you can get both for around  bucks usa note for those who have performance anxiety lol please upgrade your guigraphics card to the latest drivers
if your card is older it may not run dx  games
another thing to upgrade is your ram
the one person with only  of ram well thats the minimum for windows xp
up that to  plus get a more advanced card like the ati  or betterthe equivelent in nvidiaand together with a  ghz machine or better this game will fly
also for those worried about too many controls you can customize them to your likeing
almost all games allow control customizationif you liked hd  you will like this even better
the graphics are some what better than the earlier version
there are a lot more scenic missions to complete
however the challenge is a little bit less compared to the previous version probably because the helping soldiers are a little smarter in this version
in harder levels the challenge is more due to limited saving ability rather than gameplay
i didnt like that conceptthe only thing better about hd compared to the original gem is the wholescale destruction of game crashing bugs
yep hd out of the box has been crash proof for me
played over the weekend finishing it and not once was i booted to windows or had any significant bugs
the only glitch i noticed was how your character had the most difficult time going through doorways while sneakingyes the major bugs are gone the only reason i couldnt finish hd was because of game crashing bugs in that one level where you drivememory doesnt serve me that great but in its place are less then ideal ai needlessly complicated maps and those damn tanks that are everywhereainot too bad but i see a glaring problem when the enemy ai can shoot your before your can clear a corner yet you can peek out forever without them noticing you
and when youre in tall grass do yourself a favor and switch to a different character when your character says hes spotted an enemy
you cannot see out of those blades of grass but the enemy and ally ai canmaps  too many blank rooms
too many areas that will never ever be of significant use
i like big maps but some of the maps on the game are overtly twisty and turny
some missions youre gonna have to do a dry run just to get familiar with which doorways leads to whereand those tanksdamn those tanksi drooled not literally over this game for years before i finally purchased it
it was worth the money but there were a few serious flaws that may discourage gamers
here is my reviewgraphicsperfect
this is one of those games that sucks you in just by the realistic environment
getting to explore ancient egyptian sites was almost as fun as playing the game itself
the backdrops were really beautifulpuzzleshard
the puzzles ranged from easy to so hard it made my head spin
needless to say i resorted to using a walk through
if you are really good at the type of puzzles in this game this may or may not be an issue for yougeneral game playgood
this is definitely a pointandclicker just to let you know
there is a warp option that will let you skip certain areas that you have already explored which can be really nicecontentfine
i think a heard a swear word or two in this game but they were muttered under the breath and i am not even positive that what i thought i heard was what they really saidmusici dont usually even address music in my reviews but the music in this game was breathtaking to say the least
i wish there was a soundtrackoverallthis was a really good game i took off  one star for the difficulty but dont let me discourage you from trying your hand at itfun fun fun
i just finished riddle of the sphinx rots and it was one of the best adventurepuzzle games i have ever playedthe storyline is familiar yet intriguing you will have to find the ancient secret of the sphinx
an archeologist friend of yours has disappeared after he solved the riddle and now it is up to you to discover what he found out before his disappearance
the main objective in this game is to solve puzzles interpret clues and look in each and every corner for each and every detail to help you solve this ancient secreti cannot begin to say how much i enjoyed the rich superb graphics and detail of the different locations
i still cant believe all this was more or less crammed onto only  cds
compared to the game i played just before this one gabriel knight   bad
 the rots graphics were pure art
many times it felt as if i was right there for example on the beach with the golden pyramid
adding to this feeling of reality was the soothing music which also helped to quotspirituallyquot send me to the shores of the nilethe puzzles tie in well with the story i never got the feeling that what i was doing had nothing to do with the purpose of my search
however i admit that some of the puzzles were quite difficult to solve i especially remember a particular one the one where i had to press certain stones in a certain order to open a gate where i would have been completely lost without a walkthru i found on the webon a more fundamental level i would like to commend dreamcatcher for continuing to make nonviolent games like this one
there was a time when i thought this genre had disappeared for good
i am delighted to report that although you can die in rots on very few occasions by making a wrong choice it is not bloody or gory at all
no fights no weapons no violence
add to this the more than reasonable price for this game and you have a true winneri would have given this game  stars in a heartbeat
the only reason for why i didnt is that at times the screen was awfully dark and it was extremely hard to see where i had to go
i had to literally block out all light in my computer room to be able to see something
but this seems to be a problem that i have noticed in other games too
rots is no worse than any of the others
it just bugs me that i have to click around blindly in order to find the one hole in the otherwise black and solid wall through which i need to go nextother than that only one more thing i hope dreamcatcher will come out with a sequel
soonthis game is really good
it was worth the time and energy i put into it
flying your hellicopter to a different part of the desert was fun
solving the puzzles were rewarding
i love the mouse controls this game has
i really felt like i was there
graphics were cool
neat concept
it will be one in my collection
there is one con if you freeze or you experience a quotbugquot in the game at one of the puzzles hintblow arrow the game sight has a patch for  you to download
once that is doneyou are good to go for the rest of the game
dont let that discourage you
keep on going its worth itriddle of the sphinx had a lot of what i look for in an adventure game  believable or at least internally logical plot good graphics challenging puzzles and a conclusion that both ended the game and set up a sequel without being too obnoxious about itmy main problem was that sphinx crashed for no apparent reason about every  minutes and despite numerous contacts with tech support i never did solve this problem
so watch out for thatthe interface was a bit clumsy
you tended to accumulate a bazillion inventory items which you then had to lug around for the rest of the game even when they were no longer of use
it would have been nice if some of these disappeared after a whilethe music was a little repetetive
and there was virtually no character interaction so if thats something you look for youll be disappointed
also gameplay is only nonlinear to a degree  certain things do have to happen in orderhowever this was one of the better games ive played recentlysvideo gives performance way beyond the poor performance of the composate video
i gave this cable  instead of  only because i know that component video is better and this is not the best in the market
if your tv doesnt support component video then this the right choicetropico is a game about politics
though the game may appear to be about buildings and resource management at its core is a very sophisticated ai that has its voter registration card and isnt afraid to use itfrom the very beginning you are constantly faced with the ageold political challenge being all things to all the people all the time
six political factions each with their own often mutually exclusive goals are persistently pushing and prodding you for satisfaction and sometimes they can push very hard
managing the games dynamic political landscape is what this game is all about
using all of the methods available to you like buildings decrees bribery religion and rigged elections you are eternally struggling to stay ahead of the next protest or uprising
the amazing detail that goes into each one of unfortunately only  citizens makes the game a true test of your management and social engineering skills
because each citizens opinion can influence the attitude and opinions of those around them the game is constantly changing
that means that unlike most other strategy games where you hit a point at which the game becomes predicable and boring in tropico you always have a new challenge to keep the game interestingi highly recommend that you play the tutorial that the game offers because the amount of information offered by the game can be overwhelming at first
once you have an understanding of how the interface works and how the information presented to you relates to what actions you have taken you will be able to fully enjoy tropico
the game menus are a little hard to work with but after a little practice and a patch v that gives you some very useful hotkeys the interface works amazingly well
my only major complaint about the game is the inability to rotate the buildings
not being able to rotate the buildings can often lead to wasted space or awkwardly laid out villages
another minor flaw is that the population of the game is limited to  although this does limit your ability to build a truly massive nation it doesnt really detract from the game playif you are looking for a strategy game that is about more that killing tropico is for you
although if killing is your thing there is always the assassination edicttropico imagine a sim in which you play a rd world island dictator that places you in a large presidential palace where you govern the native inhabitants immigrants who come to your country looking for work tourists looking for that perfect beach vacation political regimes wanting to be your friend building an economic empire all while making sure you avoid a coupin an obvious tongue and cheek version of playing fidel castro governing cuba from the early s to present day and beyond i am totally amazed at the depth of your decision making progress
while the graphics are very strong and the music soundtrack will have you humming for hours to a latinsalsa beat you will want to play this game over and over especially the random map generator and setting winning conditions in figuring out the best way to manage your island
the game at its most basic core is modeled after a very sophisticated economic engine
depending on what you pay your inhabitants at their jobs the placement of certain money generating industries the level of housing quality what you can provide as entertainment religion schooling healthcare is incredible
the placement of buildings on terrain elevation and proximity to other structures is very critical
also staffing those buildings and making your people happy while also maintaining a good relationship with capitalists usa and communists ussr is just as important
you also have to be very wary about weather conditions and pollution
again you will be amazed at the level of depth this economic engine runsthe characters are very amusing to watch and their thoughts will help you make other decisions
but i guarantee you will always be questioning yourself
was placing the church here a good idea or should i have put the cabaret closer to the tourist area
should i have planted coffee or corn on this plot of land or should i start a timber industry and raise goats instead
very serious
the most fun i had so far was quelling a coup where a few of my soldiers betrayed me i guess they werent to happy and fled to the hills only to come and try to storm my palace later
my loyalists then began a gun battle downtown sending the native and the tourists runningthere is not enough space in this review to tell you about all the myriad of building and characters available
but one really neat and realistic feature is the creation of your dictator
before starting the game you need to set attributes to your character and depending on what you set people industry tourists foreign powers will react differently
in addition you must chose  faults whether you are a womanizer boozer have tourits syndrome compulsive gambler
etcthese also affect how the world reacts to you so you will never play the same game twice
okay now the downsides  the manual is vague in areas and you will want a better description on how things interact
 the manual has a few blatant errors
pictures do not match text
 some buildings not all cannot be rotated this is truly unacceptable with today sims  your peoples explanations on how they are feeling are vague at times and there is no immediate feedback on decisions which can prove to be difficult for new players and finally  there is already a patch  available for download at the main website poptopcombut dont let these few minor annoyances detract you this game
it has a great educational value and humor to it
the graphics and music are amazing and the replayability factor is high
now bulldoze that shack build an apartment building for the masses grow some pineapple and build that hotel on the beachtropico is one of the most enjoyable games ive played in a while
the premise  playing the dictator of a banana republic  is just plain fun
the game looks really good and has a great soundtracktropico differentiates itself from other games in the genre in a couple of areas
one is obviously the setting
another is that compared to other games eg
pharaoh its easy to figure out what needs to be done to improve your country which greatly reduces frustration
it does however require a great deal of advance planning since buildings arent built immediately and even after they are built you have to wait a while to have it attract employees and even longer for the building to have an effect
the political game thus comes into play since you have to be able to identify trends and identify problems early onthe game loses a star for a couple of reasons
one is that the middle of the game can get pretty slow since you basically just sit around waiting for buildings to be take effect
i frequently found myself letting the game run and leaving the room
another drawback is that the scenarios included with the game arent that compelling so i found myself almost always playing random mapsif you like games like simcity caesar and other cityempire building games youll like tropico
if youre new to the genre tropico is a great place to start since its so much easier to learn than many of its competitorstropico is an incredibly intriguing allaround great game
i preordered tropico at the same time as i got the diablo ii expansion pack
when tropico finally came i installed it and havent gone back to diablo ii yetyou start the game by taking control of an island in the caribbean sea as quotel presidentequot in  either starting from scratch or choosing a prebuilt scenario like in sim city you build it up with apartments and tenements farms and mines and about  other buildings
at the same time you have to try and appease the communist and capitalist factions on the island as well as  others
if you dont protesters and rebels might pop up and us gunboats could even threaten an invasion
or you could simply lose the next election unless of course you quotreinterpret the ballotsquottropico has a fairly large learning curve but theres a good tutorial the first one in a game ive liked and an advisor will give you tips as the game progresses
you can just go in and mess around or look at incredibly detailed charts and check out each individual named character with specific traits and feelings as you become more comfortable with the game
also there is no instant gratification for getting money if you build a farm for example you dont get paid until the planted crops grow are harvested and carried to the dock
this involves a lot of strategy and you might spend a year or two in the hole until the tobacco gets sold and you pop up to  immediately
the music is also perfect a great island mix that really sets the moodunfortunately i can only give it  stars because there are some fairly important things that need to be fixed in a patch
buildings cant be rotated bulldozing things isnt instantaneous i havent found a way to delete saved games in the program and a couple other aspects detract from the game
however they dont cause any major problems and tropico remains one of my favorite games that will probably keep me occupied all the way until civ  comes out
definitely pick this game up its well worth your time and moneysim city on an island hold on didnt they make a sim island
oh nevermind
thats what it should be named
after reading the reviews here i felt it would be worth my time and money to go out and buy a copy of tropico
it is an enjoyable game although frequently annoyingthe premise that you are a dictator on a carribean island named tropico and that you and you alone through wits or might make it or break it by ruling your own banana republic
promising right
the developers actually manage to pull it off tooeverything from the look of the buildings to the mood music in the background is just right
having made more than a few visits to the carribean in my military days tells me that the layout and operations of the island is surprisingly accurate tooeverythings not sunshine thoughyoull start off relying on crops to bring in the major portion of your income
your money levels fluctuate very erratically though so be prepared by saving an extra few thousand before making any big purchases power plants cigar factories airstrips etc
and since im no farmer ive had thus far some mixed experiences with my crops most notably with my tobacco and sugar farmsthey make lots of money when theyre working that ismy only foray into tourism resulted in countless thousands of dollars lost while slob tourists depreciated the value of the land regardless of whatever action i took to prevent otherwise
i set up nice bars restaurants and hotel on thier end of the island only to see them move to the other end of the island to congregate with the locals in the slum bar
ive been to those bars in the carribeanno thanks ill stick with the nice hotel ones
education of your citizens if critical
after a while filling certain jobs in whatever industry you want to make youll need a slew of high school educated people for most is of incredible importance
in every game i build a high school to address this problem but after a few citizens graduate they have this crazy pattern of simply applying as a teacher at the same high school and staying there thus depriving the industry that i educated them for of thier knowledge
pretty soon you have a high school with  teachers and  students and you still cant run your cigar factory because only one hs educated worker even works there no matter how much money i pay them
this holds true also for the church you build
expect one foreign priest to show up
also expect there to be only  parishioners to regularly attend church
it doesnt matter how many priest spots are filled only  people will ever attend there
this after all manner of ruckus and complaint about not having a church from my citizenslogging brings in a heap of cash as does mining but the problem is that you have to put the things so close to your settlementsif the workers spend all thier time walking there theyll usually arrive chop once on a tree yawn and then head back the  mile to goto bed
all this is not bad howeverthis game demands a good head for planning and urban development as the developers have wisely programmed into the game building delays
know exactly where it is you want to put that apartment building because its going to take a while to build ita wide variety of dictator personalities is given at the beginning of the game for you to choose from everything from fidel castro to eva peron
still i would have liked to custom build my own dictator with my own name
the custom options are all great no complaints thereyour island can be customized to death with options ranging from making it mountainousflat to largesmall to deciding how many trees will be on it
the economy can be customized as well making it either harsh or easy depending on your level of expertise
be forewarned though that another critical omission in the game is the lack of ability to modify your tax ratestropico is a good game and if youve ever played sim city youll get the basic premise of it quickly
it does have good replay value because the base design of it is rock solid but the few flaws that i pointed out as well as a few others are simply too big to overcome
my suggestionwait until its in the bargain bin before you purchasethis is an enjoyable game with a few interesting features
the premise is simple you are the dictator of a banana republic
it combines the play of simcity money management building placement and infrastructure maintenance with the resource management of warcraft build farms sell products
in addition you can personalize your character with some entertaining traits
the few flaws involve some minor graphics hitches and the lack of serious micromanagement tools which might annoy some hardcore sim gamers
all in all quite funi love this game
not the best ie ever played of course but definetly worth buyingin tropico you play the role of a dictator for a remote island called tropico
its very challenging as you have several political factions to please all at the same time communists capitalists militarists enviromentalists intellectuals religious something faction and the enviromentalists are in my opinion hard to please especially when you have a casino gawd those things eat up so much power and need the  power plantsi reccomend this game to fans of age of empires hey its similar
simcity and its sequels or other games of this genrehowever there are slow spots
sometimes id set the speed to max and read until my buildings finishedif you get this game read the manual thoroughly andgood luck tongue is planted firmly in cheek in this game
it rather reminded me of a funny s movie called moon over paradour
you are a bananarepublic leader who was just elected
you can choose a preplan scenario or design your own with a leader who has both positives and negatives supporters and detractors
you have an advisor who warns el presidente of potential problems or uprisingsyou quickly find out that you can please some of the people some of the time but almost never all of the people
and everyone is so demanding
the communists want free housing and equality in job pay
the religious want plenty of churches
the military wants a police state
and youyou would like to put a little of the building fun for a rainy day in switzerland
and the nerve of these peoplethey want elections periodically
 of course if youre running behind in the polls you can get a little help from friends to ahem assist in the countingso while youre trying to attract tourism or banking and exporting goods youve got people to provide housing at a reasonable rent of course and feed your population
also you need to educate your them so they can be employed in these industries and you dont have to import expensive help from overseas
and churches and clinics must also be built to keep your people healthy and fulfilledthe the game speed can be set from normal to fast
its still a fairly slow paced game and basically a relaxing day on the beach
and the hours of play slip by
eventually it does get oldthis isnt like the sims where you can look forward to adding new objects
i was somewhat surprised that there wasnt any calamities of nature like hurricanes or earthquakes to spice up the game
but after some time away i found myself going back to play it when i wanted something not so fastpaced
the music lends wonderful flavor although it does make me hungry for some of our local texmex
no kiddingthe only thing i regret here is not buying this game sooner
i passed over it several times while gameshopping and settled on other games with which i quickly bored or found myself less than satisfied
im not sure why other reviewers found it too hard to follow because the tutorial combined with the quickstart guide in the manual made it playable right out of the box
instant gratification ends there however since the games approach to citybuilding and management is more realistic
buildings dont just appear
they take time to be built
you have to priofitize what you want built and when
land takes time to be leveled
crops take time to grow and be delivered to the docks
however all of this makes for very rich gameplay
besides the scenarios the option of openended play combined with all the variables offered when a new game is started creates nearly endless possibilities and hours of enjoyable and diverse gameplaymy advice
if you come across tropico especially in the bargain bin grab it
you wont be sorrythe game is about the ascension to power of a new leader in a poor and undeveloped tropical islandyou can customize your style leftist intellectual military general high class aristocratic etcyoull have to plan what kind of economic development youll give to your people farmers or factory menyoull have to feed them educate them provide them with religious comfort and tell them constantly you are the best leader they could ever had
all this supported by a strong army just in casebeware do not ever consider having enough money
your public finances can go into red figures immediately and take you years to get them back in order
thus keep a wary eye on your expendituresat first glance rustin parr looks like it should be passed off as a joke
the intro to the game is odd and far from what you would expect from a blair witch title
get past the intro and the game picks up drastically
to be honest the game suffers a lot from its oblvious beginnings
in fact it seems some of the game namely the beginning was developed before acquiring its blair witch license
you start off in a secret underground government headquarters known as spookhouse as fbi agent doc holiday
doc holiday is a an attractive young detective who is being guided and directed by a military leader and somesort of kirate sensei
first impressions are not on the side of this one
why is there a sensei when doc holiday does not in anyway use any form of martial arts in the game
this just adds to the out of place and irrevelance factors that infect the games initial impression
the game pushes you into a room of confusion and frustration
this inevitability makes you want to instantly put the game down and walk away
goofy controls choppy animations and meaningless chatter amongst characters puts you in a dreadful disposition
horror takes a new meaning
the intro was designed to give you a feel for the controls of the game but seems far distant in its relation to the rest of it
choppy animation plagues the beginning and settles its way all the way through
buggy and just careless
some tweaking with keyboard configuration and mouse sensitivity are necessary in order to master the controls
and some monitor adjustments with brightness and contrasts are also required in order to get the proper fix
get past the intro and you are on you way into a very satisfying title
burkittsville the town in which rustin parr resides is where all the fun begins and really where the game should have started
your assignment is to investigate the murders of  children who were all mutiliatted by a really small town hermit rustin parr in his basement sound familiar
the small town of burkittsville maryland seems to be the perfect scene for this horrorinflicted blair witch project
minor frustrations remain but the enticing creepiness and story leave you drawn to the games gravitional pull
and you wont be able to put it down until it leaves you hanging for volume iigameplay lacks much in controls and action
combat with the dead is more of an annoyance than actual fun
combat is more of a chore routine to progress to the real awards revealing storyline and entriguing puzzles
and thats exactly what makes up for the clumsy controls and weak combat the intense progression of storyline and the appropriate level of challenging puzzlesalso the environments will leave you sweating at the edge of your seat
its the scariest creepiest game i ever played resembling authentic northeastern fall landscape
the subtle crackle of the woods with dynamic lighting and shadows are enough to mess with your head
add in the cries of children in the distance and you have one terrifying title that emulates its theatrical counterpart
when you lose your way in these woods you really feel lost and desperate to get back
despite clumsy controls and combat the daemons zombies ghosts and creatures in this game all add to the intensity with their haunting animations creepiness growls and sneakiness
the town itself is enough make your heart thump faster against your chest with its small town eccentric attitude and feel
and characters of the town are very dynamic which adds to the overall story and dimensional texture
getting caught up in the hauntings of rustin parr is what makes this game
so turn out the lights and enjoy this thrill ridewhen i began playing rustin parr i didnt like the game because of the controls and the camera angles
but after playing it and getting use to the system the game became fascinating
im a person who loves horror things so it takes a lot to scare me
this came has accomplished that
its hairraising spooky
the storyline of the game is excellent also
i only gave it  stars because of the controls camera view and it takes a while to load the next level but the rest makes up for it
it is a great game once you get the feel of how it works
play it and youll think twice about the darka friend lost his playstation  cable and wanted a good place to buy it
i suggested this one because i bough one before and the results are just fine
no problems whatsoever and my friend is satisfiedi can somewhat agree with some of the reviews
this stick is a little stiff but its designed that way
its metal for crying out loud
you can drive a car over the side with the buttons and it would still work
in the winter its a little cold on your lap but again its metal
ive used it for fighting games and had very little difficulty adjusting to its controls
it isnt really designed for rpgs drivers or shooters
its well made sturdy and dependable in my opinion
no
i do not work for a gaming company
haha just an average couch potato gamerhard luck ps owners we had this first
grandia  is a bright and innovative rpg which requires the player to really think about strategy desicions during its many battle sequences
all reviewers refer to this as the games best selling point and after playing i would have to agree
the battle system involves an on screen timer guage for each character and enemythat lets you see when each one is ready to act which means that you can make judgements based on predicting the enemies attack pattern
at each command input you can choose between a variety of full on attacks a countering move to interrupt an enemy onslaught a dodging move which lets you run to a different area of the battle field or a defensive stance to lower damage taken
it makes for incredibly involving and enjoyable gameplay as you try and time your best attacks to stop the enemies before they can do the same to you
why squaresoft could not manage a similarly complex system in their excellent rpg games is a real pity but this idea puts them to shame and thats saying somethingwell with all this effort applied to the fighting is there any part of the game that falls short
well yes but not much
firstly the battle system is innovative but the plot sure aint
a rough and surly mercenary teams up with a sweet and pious young girl in a quest to rid the land of a huge evil force that threatens to end all existance on the planet
on the way they team up with various other characters blah blah nothing new there
the other thing is the graphics which although very pleasant are a little on the cute side for my taste and the character models are pretty unimpressive especially as they have no noses and mouths
one other drawback is that there is no incentive to explore the noncombat areas or talk to characters you meet as tems are never found by searching the town fields and speaking to random townsfolk never ever turns up any useful information or sub quests so gameplay can get boring in between fights
but the battle system is what makes this game and i was pleased to see a tough and drawn out final sequence that come at the games climax and at times i despaired that the final boss would ever comefor dreamcast owners it all boils down to a tie breaker between this game and skies of arcadia
for real innovation and graphical splendour sorry it has to be arcadia those ship battles  now thats a new idea
 but for a traditional rpg that calls for real fighting strategy arcadias battles have to be its least impressive aspect grandia  is the winner
as long as you dont mind characters with no facesin this era of  hour rpgs its nice to know theres an rpg designed for someone who wants to see the light of day
grandia  clocks in at a very accessable  hours even if you wander around a bit to build up characters
its short because its not terribly complex theres not many secrets to find there are no random monster encounters you dont have to talk to many stupid townsfolk to advance and everything is incredibly scripted resulting in a very linear storybut grandia  is not a bad game
it has a compelling story even with some annoying voice acting a brilliant quasireal time combat system and theres plenty of save points so you can put it down and pick it up fairly easily
a great gamefirst i must say i dont like rpgs
the reason for this is i hate getting lost in humongous dungeons caves etc for hours and hours
i easily get frustrated and usually give up
i also dont particularly like looking for impossible to find keys and other items needed to progress
often used as a cheap way to lengthen these type of games especially in the past
i wanted to try something a little different and after doing a little research i decided to give this a try
i was able to find it cheap enough to take a flyer on
the game is pretty linear which is what i was initially looking for
however it is almost to linear and straightforward
i was never stuck for too long in one place
sans the last dungeon which is lengthy and slightly complicated when compared to the previous dungeonsmazes
the story progresses pretty quickly
not much in the way of exploration as well
graphics are nice most of the towns are colorful and a lot of details went in them
the main characters are nicely drawn
enemies probably could of used a few more polys in them
the story line plot and characters are all nicely implemented
classic good vs evil theme going on with religion tossed in
although somewhat predictable and some what cliche overall i still found it to be pretty good
battle system is great and i actually look forward to a fight
however this is the one fault with the game
your party is slightly too strong and except for early on and a few boss fights i wasnt in danger of losing my party too many times
also the game is a little on the short side
experienced rpgers will probably finish it in probably  hours
one thing i might add although i loved every minute once you play the game through  times i see little reason to go back to it
no side quests here and there arent different scenarios
i think theres to instances in the game where depending on your choice you might get a different sequence
however this doesnt change the flow of the game
so in other words there is almost little replay value other than the sheer enjoyment of replaying it
i think a small side quest unrelated to the plot would of helped this game in a few ways
a nicely done game that was largely ignored in the north american market
a must pick up for any dreamcast fans or rpg fans alikeamazing graphics detail and fun combat are in every nook of this game
while not as good as its predecessor it is still a very entertaining game with memorable characters and a grand journey but before i get to the story let me tell you about the great things about this game
this music is incredible
an audio cd is included with the purchase of this game so thats an added bonus but theres also grandia ii deus and grandia ii povo if you can find these anywhere theyre also nice to have and dont have any of the techno beats that were maliciously added to the cd they give you
and for those of you that were wondering like me the lyrics are all in portugese
very nicethe gameplay is also very very solid
the battle system is innovative and best of all fun to play the artificial intelligence autopilot for battles is great for building experience and the flow of the battles is also great
the bad part of these are the spells
theyre long drawn out and annoying
the best spell to watch are the ones involving the shards of ice coming out of the ground becuase it doesnt look like a movie pasted in
all the other spells are just terrible terrible terriblethe voice acting is as follows within the game very good
within the battles embarrasing
youll see what i mean
but im glad they decided to go with professionals on this one
it adds to their personalitiesso back to the story
you will undoubtedly throughout the game stop and say to yourself quothuh
that doesnt make any sensequot but take it for what it is an rpg that isnt made by the storytellers  squarehave funthe original grandia which debuted on the sega saturn in japan in  and the original playstation in north america in  became a huge cult success
offering up some of the best storytelling characters and battle system the jrpg genre had ever seen
it was fun emotionally moving and incredibly original
with such a game it was only a matter of time before a second game followed
and while id love to tell you its just as good as the first its hard for me to do so
its a great game but not quite as fantastic as that first onea word of caution before moving on
i first played grandia ii on the playstation  when it was ported to that system
and while i enjoyed that version a great deal id implore anyone out there to play the original dreamcast version over that one any day of the week
well get to why but first lets talk about the actual gameryudo is a member of the geoblades
a mercenary group that will take odd jobs to make money
in the village of carbo he takes on the tasks of escorting elena
a priestess for the church of granas
as the story goes  years ago a battle between granas and valmar was waged and the battle was long fought
valmar was slain but now it appears that he may yet rise again
at first ryudo is uninterested in any of this only looking at this as a job
but as the two travel together and meet new allies they soon learn that theres much more to the legend behind granas and valmar and that the church may in fact be hiding something
as you can imagine elena is the keyin terms of story grandia ii doesnt hold a candle up to the first
while the first was slow to hit the ground running the story ended up being a much more unique take on an old formula making it that much more engaging
along with having lighthearted characters
grandia ii on the other hand is much more formulaic in its approach
where as justin was a lighthearted boy just looking for adventure ryudo is a brazen character who is something of a loner
this was no doubt inspired by the fact that the most popular jrpg characters of the time were characters like cloud and squall
in other words the character with attitude was just the more popular trope
it makes for a tough introduction to ryudo at first as grandia ii plays the attitude and apathetic mercenary angle a little too strongly at first but he develops incredibly well becoming and overall good character that youll really love by the end of the game
the rest of the cast is pretty much the same way
each one beginning as a standard trope at first but becoming something more
in the end while the cast isnt as memorable as the first game theyre certainly not forgettablethe same cant be said about the writing
as with many jrpgs of the past the dialog does not always age well
the voice acting is sometimes rather flat but what is more annoying is how typical most of the dialog in granida ii is
were it not for the characters within the story grandia ii would come off as a by the book type of jrpgeven upon its original release
theres nothing surprising or unpredictable about the story at all
there are twists and turns but because of the formulaic approach youll never find yourself guessing for long just what the next twist will be
at least the characters make for a more engaging story
their conversations with one another more than make up for the predictability as the game is pretty big on showing you just how much they care about each other
but more importantly its how the characters grow and change throughout
this in the end makes grandia iis story truly rewardingthe grandia series is well known for its battle system
a little mix of active time and turn based battling grandia ii still feels complex
every character moves along an ip gauge and when you hit a certain point you select an action
they will begin performing it but your enemies will be moving at the same time
attacks execute themselves immediately while magic or special abilities generally have to be charged up first
you can strike enemies with a critical hit thus canceling certain attacks if doen at the right time and you can also counter an enemy if your attack gets off before theirs doesthere is plenty of magic to learn throughout the game
youll often find mana eggs which you can equip on characters and utilize the spells
they often cover a specific range across the battle field
the more a spell is used the faster itll charge up when you select it
but more rewarding than the spells are each characters special abilities
every character has a set of moves to call their own and some come with added perks such as the ability to cancel enemy attacks
like magic the more you use them the less time they take to charge
they also become more powerful
unlike magic however your abilities dont use mp
they use spirit points sp
spirit points are earned by attacking and being attacked
theyre exceptionally powerful moves that often end most battles quicklyif there were any downside to grandia ii it would be that the game is ridiculously easy
at first it seems complex to see the battle system in action but grandia ii gives the player overly powerful attacks while also making the system easy to take advantage of
with the ability to cancel and counter so easily you can get through whole battles even boss fights with the enemy never touching you
once the player learns the system it becomes a walk in the park to get through
nothing will really challenge the player
theres also not as much emphasis put on grinding given that theres much less to level up and explore
yes in the long run grandia ii is actually much smaller than the first game
there are fewer spells its a shorter quest there are fewer abilities and its a lot more straightforward
the dungeons are smaller and push you through
in a way some of this is good
in the first grandia it was a lot easier to get lost and it caused the story to sometimes move at a slower pace
grandia ii progresses by much faster not keeping you in the same area for very long
and while there arent as many spells or as much customization grandia ii is still solid from a gameplay stand pointvisually grandia ii is a pretty stunning dreamcast game
its got lots of colors and details and also moves at a pretty good framerate
it really shows off just how awesome the dreamcast is
there are some games that came out that look bettersome even at launch soul calibur and some that came a little later skies of arcadia but grandia ii definitely holds its own
the music is pretty solid too
the games battle themes in particular are catchy
the voice acting might use some work but its not going to make you want to turn the volume down eithergrandia ii was ported to the ps and the pc in   this was how i first experienced grandia ii
i was pretty impressed with it then but now that ive played the original dreamcast version id very much have to recommend the dreamcast version much more so
the ps version suffers from steep dips in frame rate as well as flickering textures  and no where near as much polish
while this may not sound big on a technical level some of it is
particularly the frame rate dips
when theres too much going on at any one point in time you may find that ryudo and company run in slow motion
the dreamcast version by comparison moves a lot smoother animations are better and you dont have to worry about flickering textures
if you have a choice between the ps and dreamcast version go with the dreamcast
certainly the ps has an added scene or two but the dreamcast version still tells a very coherent story without them
the only reason to play the ps version over the dreamcast one is if you have absolutely no way of getting a hold of the dreamcast version of the gamegrandia ii is not a perfect game
it doesnt strive to go above and beyond the competition the way the first one does but its still a really good game to play
its got great characters and a really complex and fun battle system
its a fun game and one that any fan of the jrpg should give a trymostly pretty good more than you could possibly eat and just a bit overcookedprobably the most noteworthy observation of grandia ii is that it fits on one disc
its an incredibly expansive game with voiceovers some cinematic fmvs and a stunning level of graphic detail that makes every doorknob crate or street lamp pop off the screen
not an rpg enthusiast myself i was hooked after a few hours and couldnt turn it off
i killed almost three days playing for around  hours straight at one point lucky i didnt burn up my dreamcast and finished in about  game hours enjoying nearly every secondexploration is the main gameplay mechanic each world is large and complete with an immeasurable number of npcs all of which will lend a wealth of conversation
the amount of text in this game alone could fill a short novel and most of it is coherent and wellorganized no small feat for a japaneseenglish translation
i regret rushing through the game so quickly its best played in short intervals over a few weeks so that the intricacies of each new world can be explored and appreciatedthe combat system is a mixed blessing the extreme complexity gives a player something to sink his teeth into as the game progresses but requires a lot of manual study and hits pretty hard initially with its steep curve
attack animations and just the sheer variety of maneuvers are pleasantly overwhelming but be prepared to wait through some pretty long boss battles
levelingup against common enemies and subbosses is a breeze it nearly becomes a tiresome annoyance after half the game
but boss battles are often unnecessarily difficult due to the radical variation of individual attacking appendages from one boss to another
creatures with six or seven attack points will be awarded with almost twice as many turns as the players party while many superbosses are relatively easy with only one or two offensive points
otherwise a great battle systeminteraction with characters really builds a strong empathy for the npcs and thats the strongest hook an rpg can offer
the story is fairly typical japanese rpg a bizarre and often nonsensical tale of apocalyptic destruction undercut by a budding love story camaraderie and good spot of wellaimed humor
the rant on religion which apparently ends up as some sort of endorsement of atheism
is excessively preachy and rather illogical eventually deteriorating into an intellectual train wreck endorsing as best i understand it the truth and falsehood of both everyones beliefs and no ones
i wouldnt spend time criticizing it if i hadnt been forced to abutton through every inane bit of text that all added up to a whole lot of nothing
fortunately the bonds between characters are the main focus of conversation and the friendships you build are the true foundation of the games themethis is one of the really great adventure games of this era
i cant imagine a gamer whom i couldnt recommend this to well maybe someone without a lot of time on their handschad steingraberparadigminfogrameslevel designergame designerd artist on the terminator dawn of fatethe orignal on dreamcast was fun and this port doesnt fall through the cracks
believe it or not a bad port can ruin a good gamebut rayman for the ps holds the magic that the original had
it looks good and it plays goodthe part is anyone can play it
parents dont need to worry about young kids playing thisits appropriate for everyone
this game is a great example of d platforming done righthopefully rayman will be just as good maybe better
great game and makes you anticipate the next onea must own title no need to rent this onei watched my wife play this game for hours on end at first it seemed a bit slow but it all made sense in the end
the only reason i didnt give this  stars was that the game locked up on my wife at least  times
i called and emailed the company quotubisoftquot but all i got was an automated email response and no satisfaction when i calledall in all the game was great on many different levels the graphics sound just about everything was nearly flawless
you also get a bunch of little skill games so you can break it up a littlei strongly suggest you get this game i hope that if you do get this game you dont have the lock up problems we didid never played a d platform game before rayman revolution but now ive been introduced to a whole new type of game i enjoy
from simple running around and jumping to basic throwing energy orb fighting the game blends a great mix of game playone of the most enjoyable parts of the game was all the different styles of play you get to do
youre not just running around jumping on platforms
youll get a chance to ride missiles on the ground and in the air barefoot water ski across a swamp ride plumbs down lava streams and even pilot a flying pirate ship through canyonsthe storyline was cute and fun to follow
i found the animation to be pretty amazing during many levels
i greatly enjoyed just letting go of the controller for a while and watching what rayman would do when he got boredfrom time to time the camera angles would position in ways i didnt like and the game wouldnt let me change them but these times were rare and never at a very important pointthe puzzles werent very complicated but searching for yellow lums magic items you can use to up your powers is great fun
there are  in the game scattered throughout the levels and by the time i beat it in about  hour of gameplay i had only found   so i went back to play many earlier levels in search of the elusive lumsthe replay value is a probably low
once youve beat the game youll want to track down more of the lums but tracking down all  of them proved to frustrate me and i finally gave up
the game sits on my shelf now and i dont expect it to moveoverall the game is a great fun
the controls are intuitive and easy to use the scenery is beautiful and the game play gives a wide variety of stylesits a very good remake to the one i played on n and it defiantly is very nostalgia heavy for me  i recomend it its a fun gamelets face it many of us are very upset with ea about the problems they seem to be having releasing live  on time
but i have to give them credit where credit is due
madden  is possibly the best football game to date for any console
i am not a very dedicated football fanatic but this game is slowly changing that
the graphics on this game are excellent and they even rival those of the ps version
the movements are fluid and are not robotic and choopy
each football stadium is done almost perfectly
even raiders stadium has an inprint of the oakland as baseball field
the game play is probally the best it has ever been
it seems much easier to control and a lot more realistic than ever
yes it still gets frustrating when your receiver cant seem to catch a pass with noone on him and then the computers receivers catch passes with double coverage
but this does not happen very often as it has in past madden games
the anouncers add a little bit more depth to the game eventhough their comments often repeat during the same game
if you dont pay close attention to them the fact that they are commenting on the game plays well bring you closer to the game
i can now go into some of the minor faults of this game
in addition to the commentators repeating themselves often leslie viscer at the halftime reports always has something to say about halftime adjustments and that gets old very fast
but i guess some talking is better than no talking at all
also sometimes the receivers seem not to want to catch the ball even when their wide open
however that doesnt happen very frequently and the whole gaming experience wont be a frustrating nightmare as in past madden games
another frustrating this is that their is no way to restart a season game from the beginning if you want to start over
everyimte you exit out of the game before the regulation time is complete the game automatically saves which sucks
however you can always turn the power off on your computer during gameplay but i wouldnt recommend doign this very often
one final point about the game save feature even after you win a game you have to leave it up to the computer to save your game their is no save option where you can actually manually save your progress
you have to depend on the computer to do it for you
i really got screwed by the computer
i beat the seahawks     however when i came back to the game the next day
i found out the for some reason the computer did not save my game and i had to play the seahawks again
very frustrating
if you win a game then i would suggest advancing to the next week and starting your next game and after the coin toss
exit the game and the computer will automatically save that game and all your previous games as well
if you dont do this you have to hope that the computer saves your game
also you cant switch teams or have another player take over the computer control during gameplay and this sucks as well
i feel that you should have more control in this game and thats probally one of its worst features
but other than that i think that you will be very pleased with this games graphics as well as gameplay
i was very nervous about getting this game due to my past madden experiences but i got a very good deal on this game and i am very satified with this gameso what if its not totally different
if it aint broke dont fix it
its only   year out of your hot little hand
i think its well worth  the money just to get all the new rosters and be able to find real  competition online
i think the game is great and i wouldnt change a  darn thing about it
feel the powerif u asked me what i thought about this game when i first got it and started playing it i would have told u i hated it
the passing and running game were nearly impossible the computer was juking me left and right out of my jockstrap on defense and trying to put field goals through the uprights was just not happening
full disclosure i am originally from san diego and was playing with the chargers every time i engaged a game of madden  and thats probably the reason i hated this game at first
but now i truly enjoy and look forward to playing this game
the running game is all about hitting your holes quickly and putting your head down
the passing game is all about timing accuracy and soft hands
defense is about team if u cant make the tackle or the play do something that enables your teammate to be able to fill a gap take away the insideoutside take a blocker out go for the tackle instead of the pick etc
the one  part where the game truly lacks is field goals
they are hard as hell if youre farther than  yards away
nevertheless this game is exciting and fun
im currently playing the chargers in franchise and i made it to the playoffs like whoa
it seems like in the playoffs the crowd cheers a little louder the hits are a little harder and the only thing that matters is the win
way to go easportsthe sims is one of the greatest most addictive games out there
the first day that i got it i played for  hours straight
there are so many choices and different scenarios that can happen
however the sims expansion pack added onto this great game
it adds new furniture and appliances new careers and it quadruples your previous ability of households
it also has some new interesting scenarios
to go along with the new furniture the building features have been improved to fit the style of the household
the improvements of this game are dramatic but become even more expansive with the newer expansion packs which give you the ability to leave the sim home
allinall a good upgrade but somewhat outdatedlivin large is a big improvement to the original sims
with the additional  neighborhoods you can try different things like making an entire neighborhood of one particular career type
plus this expansion offers up five new career tracks which brings the total to   not bad if youre looking to try out a variety of careersthe new objects in livin large are nice but i wasnt able to find all the new objects the box claimed to have
i looked for some of them for a while maybe i looked in the wrong spot
the additional objects help though they fill in the quality gaps the original sims had and they give themes which are a nice change from the original
you can use wall torches a bearskin rug or a vibrating heart shaped bedthe sims themselves can now have different looks there are new faces and bodies which give your sims more personality
there are bodies and faces to go with the skins you can have gladiators or sarongs or other things to liven it upall in all livin large is good if you liked the original sims but found it to be lacking
it doesnt cover all the missing aspects of the sims but its a good starti wrote a review for the original sims game
i only give this sims game a  because there isnt really anything different in it except a few different homes and items
i think that this is a good game to add to your collection and its much more entertaining
but it just doesnt have that same effect that the original game did
note you cannot download this game without the original sims game this game is still really fun but i suggest that you stick with the original game instead
its much more entertaininga great livinlarge expension pack for your original simsnow this livinlarge have alots of stuff for us to build different housesdecorected the sims home with more wallpaper and floor cover that i can choose fromalso the furnituremore furniture i would saywhat i like about this expansion packthat i can build  new houses on a same land then i can watched them and play themthis is a greatlast years ea nhl game was the best looking one to that point
this year theyve gone a step further
i wont go into a lot of detail here but let me say this you will not find a better looking hockey game anywhere
players talk to each other between faceoffs lights are reflected in the helmets and the skating animations are better than last yearas for game play its not really a whole lot different than weve seen before
simple button use is customizable if you want more options than  and the learning curve is fairly smallneat new features include a momentum meter to show how the game is flowing a custom jersey creator which is much more limited than the name implies and a shootout modeoverall if you are looking to be blown away by the next generation of nhl by easports you will be disapointed
if youve never played one of eas hockey entries you will be mightily impressed
if you cant decide which hockey game to play this is the oneyou dont need an quotoh my godquot computer to enjoy this game
i played it with a celeron  with mb of ram and a tnt ultra  hint video card means a lot more then processor speed
the graphics look great in this game
they have the faces to most nhl players
they fixed some of the game play issues in this version of nhl   the largest two fixes were  the insideoutsideshoot old sega move doesnt work  of the time
the other main fix was you cant just skate down the center of the ice split the defense and get a great scoring chancehowever they are some quotbugsquot with the game
the most irratating is the goalie spreading his legs on a shot going to the far post
the puck slides under his legs into the net
its irratating since its a very stoppable shot
the other quotbugquot is that one of the few ways to score consistently is a onetimer
thats where you pass the puck and the reciever just cranks the shot without ever gaining control of the puck
a issue i had was the allstar level just made the computer faster
im sorry but tie domi will never catch pavel bure in a footrace
it just wont happenall in all this is a great game
if you dont understand hockey just sit down and play  games and youll know the rules and how they work
the game is the best  i spent last year
i cant wait for  to see what they can do nexti usually collect easports computer games to have an easports games collection
one of the games in my list is nhl
i picked this because i love ice hockey alot so this could be the best game for me
other games i had werent as good as this
the graphics is great and the player detail is highly graphical
the gameplay is also good and the game doesnt run slow a single bit
my advise to you hockey fans is to buy this new hockey pc gamein this game you are a deity
you can be good or evil hence the title black  white
you also get a creaturetitan to help you out
you are to convert villagers through love or fear and establish your reign against other gods
not only do you have to maintain your worshippers but you also have to raise your creature to do your will
this takes a lot of time and skill
it actually pays to be a good deity
wood is a hard resource to acquire quickly so be careful when destroying villages they are hard to rebuildfrom a christian perspective this game is a little new agey
the game starts off saying in a land of innocence a god is not needed and they are created by praying to one
there are also some references to the yingyang
another thing i found it awkward having the villagers worship me
one thing i must admit i have been convicted not to play this game anymore
i was uncomfortable with the idea of villagers making sacrifices to gods including the one you portray
the last thing to consider would be violence if you are a bad deitythe game play is real fun
this game took three years to make so my expectations were high
the graphics are beautiful
the sounds are good
the controls are a little tricky and takes some getting used to
you can multiplay this game and even play online
on the downside there are some bugs in the game
there is a patch out though
hopefully that fixed them
from a christian standpoint dont play this if you are uncomfortable being treated like a godi have played this game a lot since i got it and im still not sure what to make of it
one thing is certain  black amp white is more of an experiment than a game
the backbone of bampw is a god rts  you have little villages on tropical islands which you watch over as their guardian deity
you can play either as good or evil or anywhere in between  anything you want to do is allowed
to top it off you have a gigantic creature like a  foot monkey acting as your pupilpet in the world which you can train to do your biddingyour creature is definitely the highlight of the game  the artifical intelligence is revolutionary and absolutely amazing
they watch watch you imitate you and learn from you
you can teach them things like go find food when the village store is empty and poop in the fields instead of on peoples houses
eventually ive heard you can teach them really complex tasks like planting and growing forests
however it takes hours of dedication to get your creature beyond the simplest of things
to me the pace of creature learning is just too slow
casual gamers will not get much from the game with only a few hours of playtime
also the methods which the game expects you to communicate with your creature are usually hidden from you and often subtle
often my advisors would comment that my creature had learned something completely different from what i was trying to teaching himtake away your creature which actually happens on one level and you have a generic shallow rts game with limited options
the hyped ability to play as either good or evil is also very shallow and limited
both sides have to impress villagers into worshiping them  good gods do so by casting good miracles evil gods cast evil miracles
thats all there is to it
there is no strategy except to train your creature to do your work so that you are effectively  places at once
supposedly the land would change to reflect your alienment but the only thing i have witnessed is my temple growing horns when im evil and doves circle the temple when im good
many promised features of the game obviously did not make it into the final releasethe single player story mode in black and white is very good yet riddled with bugs and uncertain goals
constantly you are presented with moral challenges that push you to do good while testing your patience
for example  lazy sailors need help getting their boat afloat but they are so annoying in their songs that you will certainly be tempted to chuck the little twerps out to sea without their boat
then there are quests which are so vague you dont know what to do or at least logical solutions do nothing
plus many many bugs seem to halt your progress as well
one quest with some stolen cattle i completely on my first play thru but on my second time around the same actions did nothing
in the end id recommend you buy the game after the patch comes out just to see what the fuss is aboutlike many other reviewers of this game i had heard about it over a year ago and have been looking forward to it
i was enthralled with creatures although creatures ii was a complete disaster and enjoyed the sims so i was looking forward to a similar experience
i also like the heroes of might and magic series
black amp white reminds me of all of these but more soit is beautiful
the way you move about the landscape and pan in and out gives a sense of freedom ive never experienced in another game
you can swoop way up in the sky until the land is a little island then double click on the spot you want to go to and you swoop back down
you can zoom in so closely that you can see a worm wiggling in an apple or see inside a house
you can reach inside the creche and grab the dice that your creature is so enthralled with
and all this without things fading off in the distance the way they do in most gamesa couple of misconceptions i read in other reviews deserve to be debunked
first of all you and your creature become good or evil independently
you can be a good god with an evil cow or an evil god with a good tiger
whether you are considered good or evil depends on how you or your creature behave
if you kill a lot of villagers if your solution to a quest is to crush the house and grab the rock the villager is hiding from you if your method of taking posession of a new village involves lots of lightning bolts and fireballs then you will become more and more evil
the appearance of your hand your representation in the game will reflect your evil orientation
if you feed villagers help the villager find her sick brother so shell give you the rock and take posession of the village through missionaries traders and miracles you will become more good
your creature becomes good or evil depending on how many bad deeds ie
eating villagers or good deeds ie
replenishing the village food supply your creature does
you can fairly easily influence his behavior via a combination of reward and punishment and the judicious use of the learning compassion and aggression leashesthe gameplay is also different depending on how you choose to go about it
if you solve certain quests via mayhem you will be rewarded with the ability to create more mayhem like a lightning bolt miracle while if you solve the quest in a nonviolent way you will receive a similar miracle like a water miracleon the downside the game has some serious technical flaws
the developers lionhead software have posted an announcement stating that a patch will be forthcoming promptly but in the meantime the game crashes and freezes and slows down far too often
and the black amp white website which is supposed to be an integral part of the whole bampw experience is still not functioning
also the online game playing interface is confusing at best and incomprehensible at worst
although i believe them when they state that they did not release a quotbetaquot version of the game i also believe that they were pushed into releasing the game before they would have liked to due to their arrangement with ea
so these technical problems have turned a game with a  star concept and  star gameplay into a  star reviewwhen i heard about this game i immediatly got curious and waited in anticipation for the final release i read every article and downloaded any and all video clips i could find on it so i could learn more
now that i have it i love it and cant stay away from the computer
nowyou have two options
mouse or keyboard or a combination of both
it only took me about  minutes to get adjusted to it
after that it was smooth sailing
i have a pentium iii mhz and it ran well enough although the autosave was a bit slow at times but that was it
the tutorial at the beginning is informative but it wouldve been nice to turn it off afterwards
the game itself is awesome the graphics are the best ive seen and the creature ai is excellent
i left my creature alone for about  minutes and when i came back my entire town was in flames
the creature can learn on its own or you can teach it yourself
want to teach it a spell cast it either on or beside him eat livestock or eat live humans its all up to you if you want it to be evil or be nice or a little of both
you can notice the physical changes of your creature through the way you bring him up
and with every year that passes it grows a little more untill it about the size of a mountain although there are a couple spells that make that happen automatically for a short period of time
there so much you can do you dont necessarily have to finish the game either just roam about creating havoc with other villages fight other monsters and teach new creatures
theres lots of gaming here if you put the time into it unlike some people who played this gamewhen i first played this game i was soooo frustrated because it went so slowly and the graphics didnt come out properly
i was running it on a system with  mb ram and no graphic card then i ordered more memory  mb now on my system and a nvidia graphic card andwow
the graphics were extraordinary
the temple was absolutely lovely with all of the decorations
a lot of people would probably think that this is one of those quotguy gamesquot where they can do whatever they want with the people but i am a girl and i thoroughly enjoy it
you have to choice to be kind or cruel which i would never do
to your villagers and your creature
the creature is such a good idea
you can train him to help you care for him and change creatures as the game progresses
so if you have the system to support it then you should buy it out of  stars for black amp white
yep
although everybody seems to go totally nuts about this extreamly hyped game i still found it a slight dissapointment
this is mainly because its a game
you cant have total freedom cuz its programmed
the ai isnt perfect cuz computers arent
lots of people influenced by the press didnt want to see this as a game anymore but as another perfect world
i myself went with the hype and thats why im a little dissapointedive got absolutely nothing to complain about the graphics
theyre in one word stunning
highly detailed and the level of zooming is almost scarysound is also right all along
the devil with a new york cabdriveraccent and the saint with the very brittish accent the music also changes when your more evil or less eviland then the game itself its just not all that fun
you just have to convert vilages over and over again
the socalled great submissions just really have  options and not  like those gamemags say helping the villager  out of  times by finding something or killing him
youll only really use the titan for converting and helping villages
also its very too easy to learn em things and he doesnt really do much unexpected things
the ai is to blame for that
not that its bad not at all but we human beings arent capable yet of programming humanlike ai
and thats what bothers me most
i want the game to be more
but it simply isntgraphically this game is pretty good it was maid in  so it is not going to have the greatest graphics
but for the type of game it is they are good
the premise is you are a god and you determine how a town and theyre culture will develop
you can be a good god and tend to theyre every need or you can be a bad god and torture and kill them for fun
you also get a creature to raise to be good or evil
good and he will help youre town bad and he will help destoy it
i played this game for  hours then i realized that was the training section
so needless to say this game will take along time to beat
i have played for  hours or so now and have barely started
this is a good game for people that like rpgs strategy games and simulation games
why did i give it a  this game is not for everyone
it does not have a lot of action
when youre creature fights with other creatures it is not like mortal kombati just bought the game aug  and its been out for quite a while now bw  is supposed to be coming out before long however i found the game to still be solid complex funfirst off this game has you play the role of a god
you perform miracles and interact with the world to gain worshipers and do various missions and tasks
the real selling point of the game is its openendedness
the game certainly feels complex enough while not being overly complex to play
there is a lot of depth and almost infinite number of ways to play
you can choose to be good and gain worshipers through acts of mercy and goodness or you can reek havoc on the villagers and gain thier loyalty through fear
either way its fun
you can even do a little of each as your own conscience permitsthe game really pulls this off well
i almost actually felt guilty when choosing to take a villagers sick brother and toss him into the ocean rather than heal him and answer her prayer to me
the game also has some really intricate ai
you get to have a pet of sorts in the form of a creature that allows you to further interact with the world and influence events
you dynamically train this creature by teaching him right from wrong and by him observing your behavior and learning
this is done very well and seems very sophisticated it really feels like the creature develops a real and unique personalityive only been playing the game a day but have run across only a few complaints
the controls can be a pain and you may want to tweak them playing on a laptop with a touchpad is a real source of frustation
the graphics feel a bit antiquated as the game is beggining to visually show its age  although they are still good just not great  especially by todays  standardsall in all this game is original and offers a lot of fun
you will play and experiment for hours with this one and there is an infinite potential for replay valuethis is one of those games like the sims that is very much a nongame and that tends to divide people into two groups
what does it have going for it
great graphics and music a great mood awesome ai novel idea engrossing at first
whats not to like
controls especially the idiotic fighting mode and the use of leashes are clumsy villager ai is set on subcretin mode and it focuses too much on micromanagement of your people which undermines the whole quotgodquot concept turning the game into a variant of simcity or civilization and not in a good way
this game was amazing for the first few hours then got tedious and repetitivethe worlds leader computer gaming magazine pc gamer pointed out black and white as the hottest and most promising rts titles in years
that was four years ago
the game has hit the shelves surrounded by a tremendous amount of hype
of course that is to be expected having been delayed so muchfirst of all had this game been released before the sims it would have been hailed as a revolutionary triumph
had this game been released a year ago it would have been the visionary break through
the god game
unfortunately for black and white the sims has already done that
before i get into the detail of this game i can tell you if you loved the sims you will love this game
even though on the surface both are completely different titles at their hearts they are similarfirst of all dont let the god gaming genre fool you
this is a real time strategy with a mask
a mask which is quite gorgeous and brilliant at times
almost makes you forget that you are playing an rts
however after  addictive hours you will realize that this is just a really good strategy game
the god elements are good but not ground breakingthis game is quite amusing and will have you grinning for hours
after all no one will forget the first time they toss a villager into the sea or slapping their pet into oblivion
the strategy elements are quite good and the competition between other villages is addictive
if you get bored of single player you can challenge others online to your gleethe only downside to this game is after you get through all that great fun you do eventually realize that this game is a bit typical at its core
and at times certain things will tax your patiencehowever this game is a great buy
along with tribes this is currently the hottest title of the yearenjoymany reviewers seem to lack the patience
you have to devote some serious time to this game to get your creature working well enough that you can extract yourself from the elementary game playing to handle more advanced and abstract tasks and quests
things get progressively complex as you advance in the game and if you havent trained your creature well enough to do lots of the simple things for you you cant enjoy the game as a whole
you just need to get past the tediousness of the initial training of the creature
black amp white satisfies those who enjoyed other godgames such as populous and simcity
i would however recommend adhering to the quotrecommend hardwarequot instead of the required
with an mb d graphics card and amd duron mhz rendering can be jumpy and the speech of the characters occasionally gets truncatedeven though micromanaging your villages can be a chore and the creatures serve very little purpose at all there are lots of unique things about this gamefor instance there are no icons in it
meaning you dont click a button when you want to walk pick up things or cast a spell
you move with grabing the ground with your hand
you cast miracles with gestures you make with your mouse
its pretty cool
and alot of fun
i would of given it a  star rating but making your villages perfectly happy and paying attention to your creature is a real pain
if you do decide to get this game which i hope you do dont bother trying to make all your villages flags go down because you wont be able to
pay attention to your creature insteadpeople who like this genre of gaming should really pick this game up
it is a lot of fun but playing it over excessively will make you shelf it sooner than you should
the ai is absolutely amazing teaching my animal things was just awesome
the sound could have been better but it was good
the visuals are not defining a new age of graphics but they are survivable
the playability of this game is long it wont bog you down as fast as diablo iithe system requirements are a little high but most real gamers dont care about that they already have a beautifully rigged system
i can tell you safely that the replay value is high there are many different scenarios you can put yourself in
my favorite is atonement where i would be evil and than try to make up for it by being niceget this game if you have the money and plan to play it for a long timei like it but is difficult to dominate quotthe mousequot
is a good game of quest and dominationin my opinion the fifa series has been on the downhill
from fifa  to  i have found that the fifa series has become worse
well this year i have been completely impressed and i consider fifa  to be as good as fifa  as it was in its daythe fifa series is the only good choice for you football needs
there has been no serious competition for ea sports in the genre
all the competing products have mostly been flops
microsoft tried in  and again in  both of them have been failed attempts to emulate a football matchfifa  features many internatal teams and leagues
leagues include the english premiership italian seria a to the turkish first division
looking at the league listings show an obvious missing league the argentine league
with the likes of teams like river plate and boca juniors the argentina league should be there way before the turkish leagueyou are able to play as any team for any league and complete a season
during the season you also play in the corresponding cups like the champions league
eg
for manchestar utd if you play with them in the english premiership you get to play the regular english season champions league and the fa cup
also at the end of the season you can play another season and see some of the newly promoted teams in the fray and the demoted teams disappear
this really adds to the realism to the gameother modes of play include friendlies penalty shootouts and training matches
you are also allowed to make your own custom cup or league
in the friendly mode you can put any of the leugue teams or international teams against each other
there are near  international teams with everything from brazil and france to the usa
noteable missing teams which should have been included are the ukraine with big players like shevchenco i know i mispelt it jamaica who made it to world cup  and trinidad and tobago who have great players like dwight york shakka hislop and russel latapyin the actual game you will be surprised by the amount of detail in the stadium and grounds
the crowd is constantly jumping or clapping with all having a unique look for each person
there are also flags in the crowd
there are security guards camera men players and managers on the bench with some warming up and even a linesman
the players themselves look great and most people resemble their human counterparts
this is still a problem of the fifa series but alot has been done to try and improve this
also users can make their own faces and download themthe pace of gameplay is very adjustable
some people prefer a slower ball movement more of a simulation while some people prefer fast arcade play
the game speed is easily changeable
playing fifa  is very realistic
the movements of the players look real
you can do all kinds of moves from long passes to bicycle kicksyou cannot adjust the key setup for the game so if you are unsatisfied with the keyboard setup well tuff luck
the layout for the keyboard is great in my opinion
i also use a gravis gamepad pro and that layout is superb also
i would suggest using this gamepad for fifa as this is one of the most common for the game the other most common pad the microsoft sidewinder gamepad  was stopped in production from microsoft so luck of getting one is slimthe sound is fifa is excellent
people who have played fifa  have complained about the annoying american commentators so ea has reverted back to the old english duo john motsen and mark lawrence
i dont know what it is but football aint football unless you have english commentators
the commentators are excellent in their comments they are very accurate
the talk to each other alot and they correct their own mistake
eg
if i have a player making a solo run john might say quot here he goes and no one can stop him now quot and if i loose possesion immediately he says quot i spoke to fast therequot the ambience of the crowd is well presented as the chant scream clap at the appropriate timesfor all the fifa veterans you will immediately realise this is a step foward in the fifa series
ea has finally decided to listen to us instead of doing their own thing
they have starting including the stadiums again but are limited to  for now
they have added a shot power bar so it is more realistic when taking shots it is very easy to shoot over bar the have improved character faces they fixed the shot arrow there is online play they made the pitch bigger the crowd sounds bias for home matches the refreeing works much better the logos on the shirts are there the nike ticks are really nike ticks and they have fixed the commentry
i would say that the fifa series will only get better from herethe are only a few problems besides the missing teams
this is mostly some incorrect rosters and logos
eg
in hibernian in the scottish league russel latapy is not there and he almost always starts
the good thing is that people can edit the teams shirts pants and shoes there are third party jersey editorsin conlusion football is the most international sport in the world
with the usa womens team enjoying success football is growing daily
if you want to play football on your computer it is also on playstation and n then this is the way to gofirst of all the graphics arewell youve read the other reviews and know how good they are
you can argue that this edition is great graphically but there is room for improvement sky textures some lighting and large areas of some statiums are disappointing at times
but the players look and movement are amazing
better than any other edition very realistic and fun to watch
my gforce  pro handles them wellnow the downside of fifa  the difficulty level of the gameplay is way too high when using a button gamepad
i own the original fifa fifa  fifa  fifa  and now fifa  every time ive bought home these footy games id set up a game with me as brazil or england and the cpu team something bad like peru
well this time that doesnt work
the ai is too good even when the odds are way in your favor
ive heard talk of ai cheating and that is most certainly true
the cpu players seem too perfect no matter what country they are being modeled after
seems the only way to get the blinking ball anywhere near the goal is to go with a long shot and hope one of your little guys is there to shoot it toward the goalie  who is played by clark kent in disguise they are supermen goal keepers who can stop nearly every shot even if they hail from peru
to me these are nearly fatal flaws and leave me screaming at the screen in disgust
nowif you have a button gamepad then the odds tilt more toward the player than the cpu
still it shouldnd be so difficult to beat a bad team controlled by the cpu even if you had a button gamepadbut my gripes aside ea continues to make my favorite sports game of all time
for the budgetminded gamer fifa  is a better choice than fifa   eventually  will be a better choice than i am new to the world of pc internet gaming so i dont have a frame of reference of a bunch of other pc games to stack delta forceland warrior against however i am a veteran gamer and i do know a fun game when i have played onedelta force land warrior is just an average shooter if playing this game by yourself
the real fun with this game comes with the internet play
with the wide assortment of weapons scopes and night vision and cool d terrain this is as close to actual warfare as you are going to gethow you choose to play is entirely your choice whether you prefer the aggressive run and shoot stance or if you prefer to hang back and pick people off as a sniper or lob grenades from a hard to see position
either way this game requires some skill and it isnt one that you will be instantly good at
it requires lots of practice and patienceanyone that has played paintball before will likely enjoy this game as it requires a lot of the same skills and stealth tactics as paintball warfarebottomline if you are looking for a good war like game that you want to enjoy with your friends delta force land warrior is a definite hit and at money it is definitely a good valuerecommendedthe main reason i bought this game was because of the alice in wonderland theme
i must admit im a sucker for anything dealing with lewis carrolls classic story
plus i do like playing gamesespecially computer gamesso the question is did alice live up to the hype
yes and no
is it as good or as bad as people claim
well boththe object of the game is simple save wonderland
alice returns to wonderlanda more dark twisted wonderland than she knew before
it is now ruled by the evil queen of hearts
alice must destroy the queen and bring wonderland back to its natural gloryi found mcgees vision of wonderland fantastic
i think the best adaption ive seen
way better than the fluffy disney verison
the characters are even more mad than they were before
instead of just quotharmlessquot madness its now to the point where the madness is justwell murder
we meet farmilar characters such as the mad hatter tweedle dee and dum the catepillar and even the beloved with rabbitthe graphics and sound are superior
nice dark jingles that run through the game as you discover wonderland
and the graphicswhoa
what can i say
wonderful
at times you just have to look around and enjoy the view
maybe even carroll would approve ehbut where there are pros there are cons
i must agree with the the people and critics that say this game is too linear
and this is from a person who prefers linear games
butat times i do like to rack my brain get lost or have to think of a way out of a sitution
in this game you dont do that
you go here you go there
a to z you dont have to really think as you progress
there are no secrets worlds no extra places to go no extra weaponsobjects no altnerative endings or paths none of that or very very little of it
once you finish alice thats it
nothing else to do
nothing else to see
put the game in the drawerthe game boasts puzzles on the box and hinting on a challenge but i found none
the very few puzzles they had were average at best
this is if you dont include jumping puzzleswhich are a pain in this game
not as bad as tomb raider but bad enough
let me tell you a secret you will die more often falling off cliffs than you die in combatbasically its your choice
if youre looking for this game to be revolutionary with hours and hours of fun gameplay its not
if youre looking for a game with good graphics and sound that presents you with a fun creative adaption of alice in wonderland this game for youits a toss upive just read over most of the reviews here and thought id add my two cents
i just completed the game and as is the case with successful games im  wiredi was very tempted to give this game a  star rating but there were a few points that were unnecessarily frustrating the leaf ride for example and struck me more as some tacked on quotconsoleitisquot  however they were few and far between and didnt really detract from the overall experienceto sum the plot up wonderland exists only in alices mind
the  original wonderland stories were told to the little girl when she was a child by her uncle also the author as i understand
well this is the story of that little girl fictionally extended
in this plotline young alice has been reading her favorite book guess which one with her favorite stuffed rabbit with her
her pet cat is in the room with her as well and the cat knocks over the oil lamp she was reading  by  resulting in a fire
alice leaps to safety but the rest of her family dies
only alice and her stuffed rabbit survive the firemove ahead some five to ten years  alice is a lateteenage girl confined to a mental institution effectively catatonic but if you look closely you can see that her wrists have been slit recently
one of the nurses finds the rabbit and gives it to her before bed hoping that it will stir something in the zombie of a girland alices fractured mind reacts  taking us into a wonderland that is clearly representative of her fractured psyche
the entire game is not about killing monsters at least not in the traditional sense
the monsters that alice is fighting are the horrors in her own mind
the goal of the game is to fight back to some semblence of sanityeach and every scene in the game is a reflection of something that was both in the original books and also in alices bedroom the night of the fire
one example would be the quotfortress of doorsquot alice was unable to get the door open to get to her parentsif you want a random technoslaughterfest pass this game by
like youll read in other reviews the gameplay is linear and all the architecture is symbolic which to some people is quotunimaginativequot
if you get a thrill out of killing people on the net dont waste your moneyif you enjoy fiction however and like to imagine yourself as the heroheroine of that story this is definitely your kind of gamenext summer the quotalicequot movie will be coming out
were all used to movietiein games  and weve seen some cruddy quotmovies from gamesquot in the past but this one will be different
this is a movie and it always wasso go turn the lights out and prepare yourself for immersion into the subconscious of a traumatized mind
and bring alice back to real lifei admit it im a sucker for atmosphere
any game that can pull me in so well that it affects my mood fully engrossing me in the game is a winner in my book and alice does exactly that
every detail of the game comes together perfectly to create a dark insane world that seemed very real making me care about the characters and want to keep exploring a little furtherthe game does have a few shortcomings
the linear gameplay and lack of multiplayer support leaves it with very low replay value
i finished it in about  weeks and have not played it since
also the gameplay itself isnt much different from many other games on the market
overall though if youre tired of the slew of unoriginal games being released these days alice will be a refreshing break for youthis game is designed for people who like to slice and dice their way through to the end
it is bloody and twisted
if that is the type of game you like then what are you waiting for
however if you like games that have more of a plot to them or any plot and try to appeal to your intellect even a little then avoid this one
im not saying the game is bad
its not
in fact technically its superb
but if you dont go for this type of game then you will be disappointed
also the hardware requirements are rather steep
mega amounts of ram a special high end video card and over mb of hard disk space are requiredalice is a very intriguing game with an equally interesting storyline spunoff from lewis carrolls alice in wonderland and through the looking glass
basically alices parents are killed one night in a house fire several years after the events recorded in the lewis carroll novels have transpired
alice is the only survivor from this house fire
she goes crazy with guilt as the lone survivor ends up in an institution and ultimately back in a wonderland that is very different from the one she once knew
she must fight her way through all kinds of enemies to a climatic battle with the red queen to free herself from the guiltthere are many positives to alice
for one the graphics are pure eye candy especially if you have a descent video card and processor
the voice acting is superb as well as the flow of the story
the weapon variation is amazing  some really unique ones are to be found here
as ive already said the story is superb with an excellent endingnow for some detractions
while the violence is not too severe it is still present
unfortunately some parts are down right gross
this brings up some concerns since i believe personally that the game could have been just as good without the added goreviolence
other problems would include the massive system requirements
a pentium ii  mhz is required translated you need at least a p iii  for it to run adequately
i would not recommend running this on anything less than that
my computer is a p iii  mhz with  mgs of ram and there were many occasions when the game play became quite slow so much so that it was difficult to maneuverall in all worth a look if youre a lewis carroll fanthe initial concern i had with this game is the potential controversy this title could generate
on the cover youre seeing a bloodstained little girl wielding a knife and lately the game companies have been churning out fps games that rely more on excessive gore and satanic references than anything else
fortunately i can say this game is a creepy enough to deserve the quotmquot rating definitely not for small children but the emphasis is on the surreal and the violence is not terribly overdone
other reviewers report bugs
visual glitches
havent seen any
i have a p with mb ram and a voodoo
with the settings down to a minimum the game runs fine with the exception of some of the fight scenes where the framerates get choppy
i may have to break down finally and upgrade
i think the system requirements amazon listed are incorrect
i wouldnt suggest getting it unless you have at least a p mb ram and a fast video card dfx or nvidiavisually this game is chock full of eye candy
clocks sway back and forth steam churns out of the chimneys of mushroom houses and alice makes her journeys through giant gardens castles outer space and swirling tunnels and passageways reminiscent of the twilight zone
lots of color and lighting effects  im going to go out on a limb by saying its the most beautiful game ive seen yetthe gangs all here  from the white rabbit to the cheshire cat to humpty dumpty everyones been rendered and animated in painstaking detail
most of the games characters and maybe their programmers have spent less time eating and more of their time in the clubs tattoo parlors or on drugs as hinted at by the games load save delete screen
the voice acting is well done and the music infused with a combination of bells xylophones and childrens windup toys is especially atmospheric
another nice feature is the superquick quicksave which easily allows you to return to where you last left offthe gameplay on the other hand is remarkably normal
i spent the first part of the game jumping around on all these places i wasnt supposed to be and tried hacking my way into mushroom houses or into caves and passages i thought i could fit in
eventually i realized the game plays like your basic linear fps
the only difference
theres a madness meter that drops based on how much she uses her weapons
if she whacks too many people and it drops to zero alice is reduced to just using her knife for reasons im still unclear about
theres a sprinkling of puzzles here and there mostly platform jumping or switch flipping but nothing too difficult good
overall id have to say the gameplay is probably the weakest point of the game
there just isnt much to do
quake or unreal players wanting fast action are going to be disappointed
instead you more or less wander from place to place checking out the scenery defeating whoever is in the room then figuring out where to go nextthats not to say its not fun to play  at the time of this review it is still one of my top picks and good enough to deserve  stars
its just not one of those games thats going to keep you up all night like half life civilization or command and conquer
perhaps thats a good thingif you want the eye candy get this game
if youre more into gameplay check out no one lives forever
hope my review helpedif you are than this is definitely a good choice
its a fairly good game but it gets incredibly disgusting and disturbing as you play along
the controls are slightly awkward but overall its a pretty good gamemcgees alice is a unique recasting of the alice in wonderland mythos into a game context
im sure the reader is already aware that this alice and this wonderland is horribly twisted by alices inability to deal with the tragic deaths of her parents
alice follows the white rabbit once again and finds herself faced which the terrible task of cleansing and healing the world of wonderlandthe task is made harder because in order to heal wonderland she must heal herself
to do that she must conquer fear guilt and anger
in wonderlands terms she must slay the red queen who is really the reflection of alices own painthe game interface is smooth and transparent
the disturbing artwork is truly superb
all the characters have lost their innocence and appear as distorted caricatures of their originals
the world itself is incredibly fantastic rich in imagination and detail
the game may be worth its cost simply as eye candyto me the games really serious flaw is that its story and action is on a very adult level but the level of challenge it offers is low
now i am not a regular hack and slash player so the ease and linearity of alices challenges were really welcome and allowed me to enjoy the visual and narrative parts of the game
but experts used to deus ex and quake tournament will find the game too simple
levels are completely linear and the weapon set is limited in features and utility
the only challenge is keeping a big enough supply of will the games equivalent of ammo to keep shooting
despite the violence and traumatic plot the game would work best for a  to  year old
actually the violence the game offers is really only moderately graphic
im not sure that the mature player warning is completely justifiedstill most collectors will want to own this game
and most players will find it enjoyable
the storyline itself is very touching with a strong positive ending
as american mcgees first solo effort it promises much for his continued career
id recommend buying it even with its flawsi played american mcgees alice for the first time about eight or so years ago
it stood out of the crowd dark foreboding and eerie
id heard nothing about it no praise no condemnations nothing and perhaps that coupled with just how different it was from everything on the shelf i simply had to take a look
now its almost a decade since then and with alice madness returns waiting for me at home i felt that it was time to take a look back at alicefirst things first i cant believe how differently so many other folks have viewed this game from the way i walked away from it
to the detractors linear
what
sure its not as open ended as say an elder scrolls game but alice is not with out exploratory elements
wandering off the beaten trail will give plenty of meta essence in game restorative item and weapons
yes thats the extent of it but the game is hardly overly linear
and as for repeatative
hardly
mazes puzzles roving platforms aerial enemies pits of lava grinding gears towering bosses and demonic midgets barely even make up half of what youll see
in this twisted trip down the rabbit hole you never know whats going to happen nextand now to its most ardent supporters i am among them did you just block out how awful the controls were
yes they work alright for platforming sometimes but throw in the combat the clunky clunky combat and the word cluster fk ceases to seem adequate
the atmosphere is rich the music wonderful the storyline imaginative and the characters memorable but they dont lessen the frustration levels especially in wonderland woodto my own end i love this game
the music atmosphere the way the tale of alices madness unfolds the characters the sense of enchantment and dread
it all mixes together and becomes something altogether rich and wondrous
on the other hand the controls made scream and every time alice would phase through the climbing ropes i desperately steered her towards was like a decent in gaming hell
american mcgees alice is one of the best games ive ever played and one of the most frustrating
still i love it so and it shall always have that special place in my heartive beaten american mcgees alice more times than i can remember
for a time there it was incompatible but for those of you looking to blow the dust off those old discs i have good news  it works in windows   no compatibility mode tweaking or other fiddling necessary  i just stuck in the disc ran the installer and was good to go
you wont find a stunning max resolution but you can force newer tweaks through the nvidia control panel using the applicationspecific settingsto that end ive gone back down the rabbithole and now im going to take you along with me
american mcgees alice was designed to tell a newer story from lewis carrolls classic  alices family perished in a terrible fire
alice has gone mad with grief and survivors guilt
you are alice returned to a weeping wonderland that begs for her to set it rightthis thirdperson shooter uses a variety of clever weapons from croquet mallets that bludgeon one way altfire an electrified croquet ball anotherto the very magical blunderbuss if you can find it in its secret location
the many creatures that menace alice are a combination of folklore fiery imps a witch who would eagerly eat you to booklore the jabberwock the mad hatter and unique creations in between creepy dollface spiders a centipede with a german soldiers helmet and flaming eyesthe environments are interesting and the voicework is for the most part ahead of its time which puts it close to the professionalpolish we get in newer games today
there are some problems you would expect from an older game such as a difficult jumping mechanic and occasional buttonlag but otherwise the slow climb through the many interesting levels make it all worth the effortif you have or are considering purchasing this title you will find an enjoyable dark gothic tale with color and imagination
graphics only get so good but gameplay makes up for iti got nba live  a long time ago
it had awesome game play and cool dunks but their was one mistake
there werent many shots that hit off of the rim and went in the net
there were all swishes and backboards
overall this game is a good buy and has great animationthis is a really great game but just like every nba live game ever made its way too easy which makes it get boring much quickerthis game is the best
to many tricks and stunts
the only problem is they should have made classic teamsrockstar is the king of game development for the ps
now that some of these older games are becoming cheaper they provide a great bang for the buckthis game is really good when you have more than one person around because two players can play head to head which is a lot of funthe missions are really interesting and get pretty challenging
i recommend reading a faq from someone who has completed the gamepthis is one of those games that you can play over and over i highly recommend itthink quotdriverquot meets quotvigilante quot and youve got a pretty good idea of how this game works
the excitememnt and high speed chases of a wilderness quotdriverquot and the crash em up quotwhats physics got to do with itquot of quotvquot
this is a really impressive piece of work heres whysize
the maps are massive
they seem to go on forever and for the first half hour of play i thought that they wrapped around like in the old atari days
nope theyre just really flippin huge
it could litterally take you  minutes to get from one side to the other
want to climb a mountain
you can and then you can look around at things that will actually take time to get to
detail
everywhere you look theres just lots of well stuff
you hit a stream and it goes on and on and on
you hit the highway and it stretches out for miles
you hit a pedestrian and well i dont want to spoil everythingprice
ive paid almost this much for ps games in the past that have still only been played for  minutes
this is one of those that even if you dont play the mission mode you will continue to pull out every few days and just allow yourself to be impressed by a video gamewhy  stars and not 
its not perfect
the physics is a little conservative for me
mind you im not complaining
id have given up looooong ago if i actually died every time i deserved to in this game
also i dont like the fact that just about all the cars have the same acceleration and x ability even if they wouldnt have the ability in reality
but this isnt reality its pure unadulterated fantasy and its well worth the pricesmugglers run makes you the driver of a dune buggy who can go wherever and do whatever he wishes
you have the freedom of hitting neumerous animals and people and watching them go well over  feet
satisfying and interesting
too bad they take animals and pedestrians out on p modelate night fun or under ground cult this is the story behind midnight club
suped up cars racing the night streets
causing havok at  mph
with cops on their tail and cars flying through the air its your quest to obtain the most cars and become midnight club champ
so dont hesitate to hold down the accelerator its a close finish for firstthis game takes all the best elements of such games as driver or need for speed and brings them to the forefront of the ps library in midnight club street racing
while the much anticipated gran turismo  focuses on track racing and car performance this game is concerned with avoiding the law keeping your car from getting totalled and beating those trash talking racers computer or friends
i like the this game
its street racing at its best
it should come with a disclaimer please do not try this at home but hopefully no one is immitating this game on the streets for real
graphics are good the two cities you race on new york and london are hugh and the cars you can select from are good
capture the flag is great
it should have come with race editor
maybe let you course out your own races for you and your friends to play
all and all its a great game and i recommend it to any driving game fans
why is it one away from a  star rating you ask
because i believe they could have done more to this game but then i guess what would do for a sequel huh
i guess they figure like most game makers they should only give a consumer so much so they can make more money for future games
a perfect game
is there such a thingi loved driver and driver  on ps
my favorite way to spend a couple hours gaming was to go for a ride around the featured cities just exploring
midnight club almost brought that experience home to the ps for me
unfortunately though the graphics are much better than the latter titles the cities only two new york and london in midnight club are too small and dont have the same atmosphere as those in the driver games
regardless some of the visuals in mc are jawdroppingly gorgeous like the rainwet tarmac effects
wow
another great thing about mc is that in some small way it satisfied my hunger for gran turismo  mc is one of the best first generation ps titlesi bought this without rentingto tell the truth i was expecting a bit more
the graphics on the back of the box look mindblowingbut when you load this game up it just lacks shine
running at  frames its ok but it can do better frames
now that would be great
in this game you do same thing over and overgets boring
so if you dont to do things repeatedly dont buy thismidnight club street racing is loaded with speed versatility graphics and street cars
i didnt know anything about this game until one of my friends told me about it
he said he had rented it and it was really fun
i decided to pick it up and give it a trythe second i put it into my ps i was hooked
i was mesmorized by the size complicity and graphics of the city
the details were as specific as people diving out of the way as your speedy car came roaring at them to the changing daylight as your racing day wore onthe lighting is another amazing affect
when you start you can choose to start at dawn dusk midnight or evening
as you roam around the city the time of day changes
if you satrt at midnight after a while of driving it will be dawnthis game also has limitless fun with its versatility factor
it has the sense of roaming that you get in my alltime favorite gta
if you are in a street race you can just drive around the enormous city doing what ever you wishone thing that surprised me in this game was the compelling storyline
you are a begining street racer looking for a race
once you follow a car to a race you compete to get your name out on the streets
eventually you race big names for their cars
as your name gets more and more well known you race more challenging people
the thing i liked was the top names were quite hard to beat but hey who doesnt like a little competitionthe only reason i gave it  stars is because there are only two cities  new york and london
although the two city are gigantic more cities would have gotten this game a perfect score
otherwise this is a great game which i recomendvery fun game with very simplistic gameplay
this is the grand turismo made more for kids or someone who does not want extremely hard gameplay
multiple races with multiple vehicles once you win the first couple of races which once again are very easy
i recommend this to anyone who does not want to have to push several buttons at once just to do one thingthis game is ok  i thought the game would be a little better than it is
over time it gets boring
you are doing the same thing over and over
i would rent it and play it a  few timesangel studios the developers of midnight club also did smugglers run
smugglers run thanks to early instore exposure seems to be the more popular title currently despite being a bit repetitive and not quite as deep or original as midnight clubthere are many modes of play in midnight club the bulk of which is the career mode
you start out with the bottomoftheheap taxi and use it to roam the city looking for quothookmenquot  once you find one he will acknowledge you and then you must tail him as he speeds around the city
if you successfully keep up with him then you will enter into a race that takes place at midnight thus the title against that hookman and any number of his quothomeysquot  the objective of this race is to hit various checkpoints in order and then reach the finishing point first
if you are successful the hookman will reward you with his cellphone
when you get a hookmans cellphone you can then call him challenge him to a oneonone race no marauding quothomeysquot to help him out this time which if you win you get to use his car
each quothookmanquot has a different type of vehicle sport truck latino lowrider honda civic etc and each has strengths and weaknesses
the taxi is very maneuverable but slower than molasses therefore you will want to challenge immediately in order to gain access to better carsthere also a cruise mode where you simply take a car and drive around the city no purpose or objective required basically to learn the map of the city as well as an arcade mode where you just race against other hookmen for their cars but you can only use cars gained this way in arcade mode
the various quothookmenquot are all very colorful and have a lot to say when you race them including a dash of the old profanity the cars are wellrendered in the style of san francisco rush ie
sorta arcadeish but detailed enough to know what they are
there are only  environments in the game new york city and london
both have been replicated in detail from real city maps lending a very authentic feel to the locales
and both cities are hugei enjoyed the multitiered gameplay that almost forces you to run the gauntlet before you can get the prize new cars
it shows some creativity and plotdevelopment on the part of the developers
is this game like driver
yes and no
the freeroaming environment is definitely similar but midnight club is essentially a racing game and not an quotevade the copsquot game though the cops do show up in midnight club and will chase you
midnight club is a very smooth very laid back game that will challenge even the most hardcore gamer especially on the later levels
once you start getting cars you have to know which ones to use in certain situations straight course
use something with speed
circuitous path
get something with handling
not the quotkillerappquot launch title that ssx is but still topif you like the midtown madness series you should enjoy this game
it has the look and feel of a midtown madness game and is developed by the same developer angel studios
the only difference is you can nail pedestrians and send them flying
this actualy is more fun than it sounds
cant wait for the sequelokay this is a very enjoyable game
the graphics are excellent with the cars looking almost real you can drive anywhere  including through buildings
this is a very straightforward game you race your cars against quotseasonedquot streetracers move yourself up in the world as you do you get the deed to their cars in special racesmy big problem with it is sometimes the jokes that the characters throw out while are funny the first time or too around  after you get into several races with them they start get very tiring very fast
but thast has nothing to do with the gameplay itselfyou do have to be careful of some of the cars  they all have their own quotflawsquot but if you can learn what they are and how to work around them you can actually get them to work for youafter a foray into the third person shooter genre that received mixed responses ea brought bond back into the first person with a game based on the world is not enough
what they ended up with is an enjoyable yet flawed game
while its unfair to compare it to goldeneye for nintendo  perhaps the definitive bond game most people who have played goldeneye will probably see this as a somewhat unsuccessful attempt at recreating the success of that gameperhaps a quotgoldeneye litequot
in fact the playstation version could even be considered quotthe world is not enough litequot as its lacking the multiplayer feature found in its nintendo  counterpart
however reviewing it on its own merits rather than a comparison to other bond games or versions for other platforms reveals it to be a fun and entertaining gamegraphically and sonically speaking things are pretty good
the level graphics are fairly good and have some nice aesthetic touches although the textures are maybe a bit blocky at times
the character graphics are quite decent for the playstation despite the fact that most of the enemies in any given area have the same clothesfaces
the cutscenes are full beautifully digitized scenes taken directly from the movie
the music in the game fits the james bond theme well
the voice acting is fairly good despite the fact that the voice actor playing bond does a fairly laughable impersonation at times
the sound effects were generally good toothe controls are nice and intuitive although the use of two buttons to cycle through your weaponitem inventory can be a bit tedious
basically though everything is hereauto aim strafing using r to zoom in and aim using crosshairs  the only other complaint i have is that hit detection on items you can use is sometimes a bit off
when you walk up to an item you can use it will have a red box around it that will turn green when youre facing it correctly
however it sometimes requires a few seconds of adjusting your angle to get the box to turn green which can be troublesome when youre trying to do something like bug a telephone and take off before the patrolling guard comes backthe gameplay is a mixed bag
the game definitely does a nice job of providing variety with levels ranging from standard shooting to sneaking around placing bugs to photographing secret documents to protecting your allies from enemy fire to sneaking around to save hostages to playing blackjack and more
however most of these levels are fairly short linear and overly simple
the skiing level is especially disappointing with skiing basically amounting to nothing more than clumsily following a narrow linear path while shooting the occasional enemy
many gadgets are also incorporated into the game however usually fairly poorly
the end of many levels involve certain timed situations where you have to use an item or gadget aimed at a small target to escape get somewhere or do something before time runs out
more often than not these timed situations seemed to leave me saying quotokay what the heck am i supposed to do herequot and failing the mission once or twice before finally figuring it out
another of the frustrating factors of the gameplay is that most objects are impervious to gunfire including windows
it would be awesome if you could sneak up and take out certain guards through a window but shooting at a window is basically the same as shooting at a wallthe ai do a lot to both add to and detract from the gameplay
the ai do a decent job of fightingdodging trigger alarms when they see you and even use radios to alert other ai to your presence
however their responses are usually fairly predictable
theyre also quite flawed especially when it comes to using the stun gun or tranquilizer gun on them
the stun gun only knocks out enemies for about  seconds for some reason yet you can sit there and stun the same enemy for an hour and he never questions why he keeps waking up on the floor every  seconds
there are some levels where if an ai sees you and alerts the other ai you automatically fail the mission
however if you can stun the ai before he gets a chance to radio the others hell wake up on the floor  seconds later and itll be like he never saw you and nothing happened
its actually quite amusing but sort of kills the whole realistic ai factorthe game is also fairly easy largely due to the linear gameplay and short levels
it more or less involves plowing through a level over and over until you beat it not an overly challenging task even on the hardest difficulty level
the replay factor involves  different difficulty levels and cheats that can be unlocked by beating certain levels within a certain amount of time
its also fun to go back every once in a while and play through the levels especially more creative levels like the hostage rescue and telephone bugging levels
however with no multiplayer and no real secrets or bonus levels theres not a whole lot left after you finish the gameoverall the game is quite fun despite its flaws
most of the levels are very enjoyable
the game basically plays a digitized scene from the movie that cuts right into the next level based directly on the corresponding scenario from the movie
then when you finish the level it ends with a digitized scene that picks up right where the level ends
this really gives you the feeling that youre playing through the movie
in fact even people who were in the room when i was playing were actually entertained just from watching it
its definitely worth buying although those looking for multiplayer action might want to consider the nintendo  version insteadthough the game was released a while back its still fun to play now
a good successor to tommorow never dies on ps
the does become tough but otherwise
really enjoyablethis game has a great solo campain but the multiplayer is where it is at in my opinon
there is a lot of weapons to choose from as well as characters and unlockablesgameplay pretty straight foreward
i have found something cheap in it with the ai
they are cheap when with fully automatic weapons you hear a bang and you are dead
well that is how it is for mesound pretty real not much more to saystory not to complexoverall a great buy for the multiplayer
the single player is fine but no where near as fun as the multiplayerrare couldnt hold onto the james bond licensing rights forever and when it expired ea games jumped at the chance to be the next company to make the next james bond game
they enlisted the help of eurocom to develop the world is not enough and it was released to the nintendo  in  based on the movie of the same name james bond is out to stop a terrorist who has nothing to lose from causing destruction
choose from the main story mode  stages all based from the movie locations or the multiplayer mode up to  players play against each other or in teams with customizable match options to boot
completing missions in the main story mode unlocks its equivalent in the multiplayer mode and beating missions under a certain time limit and difficulty level unlocks multiplayer characters and modifiers
after each mission is complete you have the option to save your progress on a memory pack if you dont youll lose any progress once you turn the game off
the pros the fact that there are similarities between this game and goldeneye  is not a coincidence high production values spot on controls the way you unlock bonus content and  player support are what youll find here that you saw first hand in goldeneye  like rare eurocom took its time in making this game and thats one of the main reasons this game turned out good
add in digitized speech from all of the main characters expansion pak support higher resolution  smoother graphics and ai
controlled bots for multiplayer matches a la perfect dark and it makes it an even more enjoyable game to play
when you are done with the story mode grab some friends for  player matches against each other or in teams
there are enough options to customize each match to your liking and it will keep you and your friends busy and its fun toothe cons twine comes real close to duplicating the fun times players had with multiplayer matches on goldeneye
it just feels different this time around and theres an odd quirk thrown into the mix every match cannot have all players use good characters one person must pick an evil character before the game allows you to play
why eurocom programmed this stipulation into the multiplayer mode is anyones guess and shouldnt be there to begin withwhile the world is not enough is not goldeneye its a good james bond game that surprised everyone
its based on a good movie and follows it closely while packing in unlockable bonus content and a  player multiplayer mode that makes it a worthwhile title for the n
this one is worth owning and if you choose to get it make sure you have a memory pack and an expansion pak they will come in handy no doubtthis a fun n game
though its not as good as goldeneye its still a very fun game
i used to love this game when i was younger
it comes in a nice rare blue cartrage which fits the game
i say play itwhat could be said about goldeneye on the  that hasnt been said before
yes goldeneye was an absolutely fantastic game that knocked all playstation  games on their butts
then three years later ea came out with the world is not enough
now the game has a lot of things in its favor
the polygon count and frame rates and overall graphics are worlds above what goldeneye had
not only that the game has actual cutscenes with dialogue
the voice acting is really bad but come on do you really expect professional vocal work for a nintendo version of a game
as far as general gameplay goes imagine goldeneyes  style but fine tuned
the controls are tight and responsive in any of the four control schemes
the one real downfall of this game is that it is just too short for its james bond logo
goldeneye was easily  hours and this clocks in around  on the easiest difficulty
on the hardest setting goldeneye is over  hours with this one being at most  and one half hours
overall this is a fine successor to goldeneye and is an enjoyable experience from beginning to end
i give  the world is not enough an  out of prepare your gun fire up that n and get ready for a fun experience in eas latest fun trump quotthe world is not enoughquot
after loving quotgoldeneyequot i figured this sequel would provide the levels of frustration and fun the first one provided
i wasnt disappointedfollowing the plot of the movie you work your way through each level attaining objectives and moving forward
ahead of you lies many obstacles bombs in subways dock chases and a particularly difficult sleath mission that doesnt allow you to shoot one person
it all adds up to funi have to agree with the one reviewer as far as the guards and bad guys you shoot
they seem really stupid at times picking them off is sometimes too easy
unless you are right in front of them they dont fight backall in all i was able to complete this game at secret agent level in about two weeks so if you are interested you may just want to rent this game from your local video store rather than purchasing it overall a fun timethe world is not enough on the nintendo  is a great game now the james bond games put out by ea arent exactly the most liked but they were good i thought
it does do a good job of following the movies plot with the terrorist renard trying to get a nuclear weapon  elecktra king killing her father  taking over his oil pipeline
the st  levels  the th th  th levels do a great job of following the movie
you also have christmas jones from the movie
the gameplay is good the weapon selection is good but not awesome like golden eye
there is very little difficulty except for the last level  the level where you got to take down the helicopter
i can say it still has some feel of golden eye with the gameplay  you get to use more gadgetsim going this review quick cause i already reviewed this game on my old account back in december  i reccommmed this game over the tomarrow never dies on playstation that was a  disappointmentthis game is really fun and it has to be among the best first person shooters for any system but the whole reason i bought it was for the multiplayer and it fell short of goldeneye and perfect dark
the graphics are great as well as the frame rate
i highly recommend this game to any fan of a first person shooter but dont get too excited for the multiplayer modethe only good ea bond game that ive played
its nowhere near any of the classics but it could at least hold its own against other games of the nonclassic varietythe singleplayer mode is good
some levels are bothersome but overall its fun
good levels nice guns decent ai
the movies plot is told very well from getting rid of davidov to swimming through a sunken submarine to finish the baddies and save the worldthe multiplayer is great
its not quite as optionpacked as perfect dark but its good
my major complaint is the whole good and evil thing
each character is either good or evil and good characters cant fight each other
its annoying but there are at least plenty of characters to choose fromand even more to unlock that it hasnt bothered me more than a handful of timestwine has some of my favorite multiplayer levels ever
a hedgemaze two small bases connected by a skyrailthis level is done better than its nightfire counterpart and one of the coolest a blackbird jet and a cargo plane connected by a fueling line flying in the air
its fun to go out on the wings and try not to get blown down by the wind or to go on top of the cargo plane to snipe people off of the blackbird belowthe bots are generally pathetic though
if youre accostumed to instinctively circlestrafing the bots dont present much of a threat
i played an entire game without using weapons
i just got really close to the bot and circlestrafed while punching them and they didnt even get a hit inbut thats only like half of the bots
the other half are okayi was also upset to find that theres no way to setup the controller so that you can use the up and down cbuttons to look like in goldeneye
instead they are for jump and for crouch
no way to move jump and crouch to up and down dpad
i need my freelook more than i need jump and crouch in multiplayer
o welloverall this game is actually really fun but the few flaws really stand out and keep it from being classicthis game is a huge step up in the department of graphics and sound from the hit goldeneye
this game includes reload animations crisper gaphics voice acting and lighting effects
the gameplay while not as good as goldeneye is still solid
all in all if you like the n or goldeneye pick this game uothis is of course the video game adaptation of the third james bond movie featuring pierce brosnan
its also a kind of sequel to the n classic goldeneye though its developed by eurocom rather than rarewareim not sure how well this game sold but its a surprisingly aboveaverage effort considering the expectations it had to live up to
it borrows heavily from the control scheme established by goldeneye while throwing in a few new modifications ability to jump new gadgets etc
the graphics are pretty solid including some nice scripted animations of bad guys jumping in through windows and other effects
a lot of care was put into the movie license with solid voice acting including john cleese as r and detailed recreations of key movie scenes and sets a rarity in older games
also like goldeneye you can unlock secrets such as new multiplayer characters by completing missions within a certain time limitthe problem is that while the world is not enough is a strong effort on its own it still pales to goldeneye and also perfect dark which was rares other masterpiece shooter for the n
enemy ai is pretty weak and its robotic nature occasionally pulls you out of the cinematic experience
the decent amount of multiplayer options simply doesnt match the massive bucketload that perfect dark offered and again the ai bots are lacking
finally the biggest annoyance is that the game needs the controller pak for save files
other games need the controller pak too but saving to the cartridge is always easierif you collect all things james bond the world is not enough is a solid title to grab and is much stronger than the completely different psx version
if youre looking for a good n shooter to fill out your collection with this is also highly recommended though you may want to try perfect dark firstthis has got to have been one of the most eagerly awaited games of all time and i have to say that its pretty good
although its not visualy as good as goldeneye there are are a lot of factors that make this game better
there are loads of new levels various new weapons and a whole new story
everyone who was a fan of goldeneye must own this game or they will miss out on all of the fun that they had with goldeneyewhen first playing the wellknown midtown madness when the first drivingracing amusement game came about i could drive in their city chicago all the time non stop without many qualmsi expected something way better in midtown madness   i dont know
i guess it was the sameness of the levels and options it wasnt even what should have been a sequelthe graphics sound and gameplay were the same
nothing on this game to dwell much on except for the levelstwo new medium sized levels san francisco and london
but let me reassure you the sound needs to improve
totally generic sounds which arent very realistic in citylife atmosphere need to improve dramaticallywhat really plummets midtown madness  is the lack of interest and captivation
like i said everything is the same  roads have the same textures or the same ol knock down the traffic light get the limited amountthree cops to chase you in which they arent different sadlyplus speed isnt accurate
what i mean by that is is that you could be driving  mph
and feel like youre really going  mph
having the lack of feeling the rush or intensifying speed really puts this game into a downfallsame textures although a bit worse looking same ideas almost same everything except for two new levels which is something to be quite moody about
other than that if youre looking for fun in this game itll be there but for a limited time onlythe game is lots of fun there are pros
and cons
ill start with the pros
you can cruse two citys crash course and check point
there other things but im to lazy type them  lots of cars and races
there are some cons
it takes  mins load on my mhz computer
the graphics are like the first game
download this game before you buyi actually loved midtown madness at chicago cruisin about winning races and well getting away from cops
midtown  is just the same and well even better with  cities and more cars to your collection
san francisco is the best place with real roads and real buildings
the cars such as audi are perfectly detailed with every single gadget
now this game is great but if you have an old system requirment the game will get slow not detailed and bad
but with new system requirments the game will become fantasticthis game is fun to run over a network with friends and family
we get bored with it fast if we are playing alone
my younger kids like it much more than me they think its great
its a pain that they make you do some mind numbing tasks to unlock cars
i would give it a  my kids give it a  so we settled on a  star rating
dont buy this software
lookup racing madness and you can get this with motocross madness  as well for the same price
asin bnaamidtown madness  is the follow up to microsofts first attempt midtown madness
the first was troubled by bugs and horrible physics and damage modeling ruined the game
midtown  features two towns san fran and london
they are both excellently modeled and are true to their reallife counterparts
the graphics are wonderful and portray the cities nicely
they are a little too happy and colorful but they still are top of the line
twenty cars are availible and many more over the internet make sure to download the moon rover
the game comes with many modes of racing included the favorite quotcruisequot
this is where you are free to roam about the city causing as much mayhem as you want
other race modes are availible and the computer ai is a worthy oppoinent
some races though are really hard leaving one frustrated and mad ex
london crash course final
its a great accomplishment when you complete them though
all in all mm is a great step past the first game and also a excellent game
enjoy this oneflight sims
fun
action oriented
campy
wait a minute you said quotfunquot
talk about being on target zipper interactive has really nailed the fun quotient with crimson skies
forget your preconceptions about flight sims being boring and tedious overwhelming you with controls air intake valves and flap setting
theres no fussing with landing gears here just guns rockets and babesthink of your images of old radio shows and dramas a crackling radio an overthetop heroic voice thats borderline comical as he proclaims the villain a quotdastardly fellowquot
add in the energy of a st century action game filled with heroic dogfighting and incredible barrel rolls no need for the laws of physics here when it might compromise fun huge explosions rippling landscapes and incredible planes and youve got a fantastic gamethe graphics here really are incredible after i finish im going through all the missions in a bomber just so i can get up close to the ground and fly very slowly to savor every bit of detail just superb coloring and lush landscapes
the cutscenes are tastefully done with a feel for old news reels youd see at the movie theaters in the s and s artfully building the plot as it goesgameplay is smooth and easy to quickly pickup
controls are at a minimum and though i have a new joystick coming in today its perfectly fine to even use the keyboard to fly
maneuvering is very smooth and the keys are well laid outso far im about half way through the missions are pretty easy which was apparently intentional as zipper wanted to make sure everyone completed the game
despite the ease the missions are still a lot of fun with plenty of action
theres also a multiplayer option and a skirmish mode so you can design your own missionsmy only complaint is the menu interface its darned clunky and the hard drive chugs away for up to thirty seconds just when trying to view a minor option on the plane construction screen
i dont know what the problem is here but zipper really could have done a better job on this it detracts from what could otherwise be a very nice feature
instead building your own air wing turns into a tedious and mind numbing process
you cant even save your designs for quick reference in the future just start from scratchbut the slow menu interface is my only real complaint
this is a fantastic game and i would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys action games its kind of an aerial fps
im running on a pent iii  coppermine with m ram at mhz viper v m and a soundblaster live
valuefirst off i dont think this game should be rated as harshly as a lot of other reviewers have done
yes the load times are long but not unbearable and i only have a p with a voodoo   those who complain about the load times in this game are going to be livid waiting for no one lives forever to load a great game by the wayive always wanted a game like this dogfighting indiana jones style without having to worry about pressing this key or that maintaining proper altitude airspeed or whatever
sim fanatics need not apply
this is hardly a simulation and for me thats a good thingthe acting is fun actually interesting dialogue that you dont skip through
the missions are fun shootouts in the air against zeppelins boarding and hijacking planes in midair sim fans try that one flying through caves bridges hangars you name it
basically this games one overriding factor is simple
its fun to playnow for the bad stuff
yes you must download the patch so your campaign info isnt erased when you go multiplayer
its not a huge download and besides this is a microsoft product were you really expecting it to be bug free
also the game provides you with wingmen but like most flying games theyre worthless
mine are usually shot down in the first minutemy biggest complaint  as you progress in the game youll find the missions become harder not because the enemy ai becomes smarter but because the missions become longer and you find yourself fighting wave after wave of enemy planes
kind of like the shooter games where you find yourself alone in a room surrounded by  monsters
gets tedious
lastly there are minor annoyances like hiccups in the music as the mission ends and slow menu change times etc
nothing unbearable thoughto summarize its the most original flyingshooter ive seen since wing commander and its a lot of fun
anyone remotely interested in flying games is going to love it
just make sure theyre not looking for a simulationthe storyidea behind this game is great
its like the kind of adventure seen in indiana jones
its just plain white knuckled yet carefree action
i love it
buti have a top notch machine and find that the game is slow
so far my experience with microsoft games is always alike they run too slow
other games requiring a better computer usually run fine
what gives
other than that it deserves  stars for originalityonce i got this installed and started a mission i thought the game had crashed
for some reason this game has pathetically long load times
it seems to freeze your system but its just going through its routine
very frustrating at times when you are in a hurry to shut the game down or to get into a mission
once you get through all of that pain in the arse stuff you will find the game to be a blast
the storylines are terrifically entertaining very original
the flight itself is excellent to
there are numerous odd aircraft to fly all with wwi style guns which i just love
besides the usual dogfighting there are some quotbarn stormingquot missions where you get to see whos the best hot dogging pilot
most of the times i crash but its cool when you can fly right through a train tunnel with barley a foot on either side of the wing
the downside to this game might be that you need a bit of quotumphquot in your computer to run and load this
for all its faults though its really fun to playi bought crimson skies on a friday and i played it continuously until i was forced to go back to work on monday
i would highly recommend this game to anyone
what is so great about itthe games storyline centered around a group of quotair piratesquot in an alternate s era earth was very engrossing
the whole idea of flying armed prop planes and having a zeppelin as a base was great
the concept of moving the plot along via a series of black and white newsreeltype cut scenes was a brilliant idea and works very well
the voice acting was great they were deliberately hamming it up and this added to the fun
the game environments were very well designed and allowed for a great amount of free movement
the mission where you attack a pirate base on top of a mountain was particularly eyecatching
the games interface works well
i never read the manual and i was able to figure out how to customize my plane and its weapons after playing the game for ten minutes
and the planes and their weapons different caliber guns types of bullets missiles and zeppelin busting air torpedoes are wonderful
there is also a custom battle option that lets you create then play a combat option that lets you create a combat scenario
speaking of flying in the game realize that this is not a true flight sim its an adventure game
the flight dynamics are not  realistic but the game wont let you get away with anything
i crashed my plane a bunch of times trying to pull off tricky stunts that only added to the thrills
also the game lets you skip missions that you flunked four consecutive times
i played the game on the medium setting and i used this option about  times
i do not think that there is a limit which is good in my opinion
the missions range in difficulty and most have multiple objectives that vary in difficulty as wellwhat is not so great about crimson skiesmicrosoft is consistent with their game stopping bugs
after playing this game for about four hours straight it locked up and i had to alttab out of the game and reboot my pc
this is the same thing that happens when i play starlancer another microsoft game
this probable memory leak bug would be worse for anyone playing this game on a low end pc that is one that only meets the required game specslt long level load times
although it was worth the wait it took some considerable amount of time for most of the game levels to load
this is annoyingbuy this game its one of the best availablevery cool game be aware however that this is an arcade rather than real flight sim game
its tons of fun with good graphics story line and over the top fictional aircraft
one of the few games ive played several timesthe playstation classic that reinvented video game cinematics storytelling and gaming as we know was faithfully ported over for pc gaming in   this pc version even adds a nice bonus by having the vr missions disc added vr missions was originally a seperate game that featured an expanded version of the metal gear solid training levels
but just how good is this version compared to the playstation edition released in storyfoxhound agent solid snake is brought out of alaskan retirement to take down terrorists who have taken over a nuclear weapons facility at the nearby islands
six renegade soldiers  one of them liquid snake who has an uncanny resemblance to solid snake  are leading the takeover
along the way snake communicates through satellite radio with missionleader col campbell and other specialists who assist him through the arduous operation
betrayal love philosophy and political intrigue all strike a powerful chord throughout the story
it might feel imbalanced once in a while when bosses like psycho mantis reveal a troubled childhood or when the gatlinggun toting vulcan raven begins to delve into sioux heritage
also some of the cutscenes run a little too long
minor complaints aside the story  characters are topnotchgraphics  animationthe pc improves the jaggedpolygons from the console version and it even runs smoother
but this game didnt look great as far as pc games go instead it was good by console standards
however the cutscenes are realtime and are actually very nicely animated
there arent any sudden glitches when solid snake or any other ai enemy change movements
instead they move naturally and fluidly
metal gear solid was a greatlooking psone title and its look is mostly unchanged on a computersoundthis is a splitdecision
the voiceacting is excellent but the dialogue isnt always very natural
its a little too philosophical andbeautiful
the dialoguewriters couldnt find the right balance between reality and poetry  one glaring example is when our gruff hero starts to reflect on friendship  the future while gazing at a sunrise
the actors are actually better than the nintendo gamecubes new voice actors for the twin snakes but the written words in that version come off more naturally
the music is also hitandmiss
the music is excellent but when youre hearing the same track over  over again during a minute codec conversation between characters it becomes annoying
just listen to the conversation when snake is locked in his prison cell and try to block out the musical scoregameplayfirst off for those whove played or seen this game alreadythe psycho mantis battle is sadly downgraded because the mindreading segment is completely removed
now for the uninitiated this game relies on stealth
hiding from the enemy is much wiser but not simply because alerting the terrorist soldiers will call in infinite reinforcementsbut also because the combat is not that great
i can respect that negative because combat is not the key strategy to success
however there are scenarios when combat is unavoidable and most gamers will have trouble battling the bosses and enemies properly because of odd controls
also theres a backtracking section at the end that would rival metroid
the stealth portions of the game are still amazing after all these years but the combat always needed work
but the level design is genius and also some suspensful moments  such as when a guard patrols so close to your positiononly to turn and guard opposite directionextrasthe vr missions which are on a nd disc and help you improve your tactics and maneuvers are all here and wonderfully ported
even the crazy mystery and variety levels are here and are also excellent
there are a couple of training missions that will drive you bonkers with their puzzlesis this worth the moneyalthough metal gear solid is a classic milestone in all of gaming it hasnt aged as well as others have
the graphics dont look great the gameplay has vastly improved in later iterations of this series and replay value is lacking because theres little to unlock
because the nintendo gamecube now has the revamped version of this game the twin snakes plus since this game hasnt improved much over the playstation version i cant give this  stars
for those who have never experienced this game and dont own a gamecube pick this up right now
im lowering the grade as a metal gear solid fan
as far as gaming goes this one is a classici recently played the demo of this and liked it so much i bought age of empires  and the expansion
the new civilizations and new stuff make the game even better than it was
after playing this for a week or two i went back to playing starcraft and found it a little boring compared to this
the most addictive part of this game is building up over the different time periods
i only have two very small problems with this game that if they were improved would make this the greatest game
problem  the ai opponent in random games gives up way too easy and resigns way too quick from a battle
after spending an hour or two building up you dont want the climax up the fight to end in a resign in five minutes
its like a great movie with a horrible ending
i want to completely demolish every little building of the enemys till nothing of thiers exists on the map at all
this is still a great game cant wait to see what the next age of empires brings
the only other minor thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the different civilizations are still way too much alike i wish they were just a bit more unique more unique weapons armies buildings etcwould be great
this game is completely addicting and the expansion just greatly improves on that
matter of fact once youve played the expansion theres really no going back to playing without itlets get this out of the way first  age of empires  was an excellent game that didnt need much in the way of an expansion pak
however the conquerors adds new features and races and cleans up the interface
it also polishes up the few blemishes on the original game like the constant need to reseed farms manually
overall this was not a dramatic overhaul to aoe but then again it didnt need to be
given the price this is a smart purchase if you own aoe just dont expect a whole new gamethe conquerors is a great expansion
with five new civilizations new  units better game play its just more fun
the reason i rated it  stars  instead of five stars is because i think they still could have done more
yes the new civilizations and units make the game more fun but its still  the same game
even though i took a star off the rating i would still buy  this product
the age of empires the conquerors is a great expanision it  makes the game more fun
heck thats what expanisions are for arent theythis expansion is just that
the features it adds new cultures and techs will seem random to the new or infrequent player
however if you let yourself learn aoeii then conquerors is worth all the moneygraphics  no upgrade heregameplay  the techs and cultures it adds keep the game goingcontrols  no upgrade heretech tree  niche addons helpstory  a simple microsoft campaign but its the thought that countsoverall  not too much to add but every gain helpsaoe is the best series of games on the face of this earth
unless your from mars where they have d interactive vr then dont argue with me
the game expands with  more campaigns with  new civs huns aztecs mayans koreans spanish
plus adds about  new maps like my favorite quotarenaquot
the game is a great expansion if you like campaigns but it dosent bring barely any new units or abilities
other than that this game is a winnerif you have aoeii you need this to run the game andyou liked it then definitely get this expanstionall hail the king of the losersthe predominant problem with force feedback sticks is that they dont have the lovely center snap that other sticks do
the jarring motion is nice but even with the force center turned on control can be loose at best
that said of the ff sticks ive tried this is the best
its comfortable durable easy to configure
good stuffthis is my first joystick so i dont have any way to compare it to others
its hard for me to precisely control sometimes in freespace and when i try to take off in airfix dogfighter sometimes the aircraft veers right and i cant bring it back straight
on the other hand it gets good reviews and its fun to play with
i have mixed feelings about the force feedback
it distracts alot of the time
on the other hand in freespace i was diddling along and then something shot me from behind and there was a big jerk on the stick that added with the sound and screen gave me the distinctive feeling that id just been blasted
it was quite something
one thing about this joystick that surprised and delighted me is that theres a cd packed with it that has freespace colossus
id heard about freespace which is supposed to be the greatest space simulationbattle ever and is hard to find now
colossus is a sort of limited version of it but still seems to have about a third of the features and missions
its a great bonusif you havent tried a forcefeedback joystick before this is a good one to start with
the effects are nice but check out whether your favourite games actually support force feedback before buying  as freespace is one of the few games that i own that supports it
the logitech joystick is much cheaper than the microsoft versions but its a bit flimsy too
theres also a big deadspot in the centre of the joystick which can make setting it up for games rather timeconsumingforce feedback tm technology is great
this thing does kick like a mule
it is no doubt a good joystic
but you only really truly in need of a joystick for flight simulators and air combats
since i am not really into this i do not enjoy this product as much as a true enthusiast probably would
also do follow the instructions and install the softeare before you plug the joystick into the usb port otherwise it may not work properlylogitech is well known for its mice keyboards speakers and now game controllers
its wingman series is pretty good with joysticks and gamepads
while you can play fps with this controller dual analog one stick for movement and the other for view it really isnt recommended
if you play sports games then a gamepad is really needed but for most games just save money and keep that keyboard and mouseegronomics of a gamepad is pretty important and the wingman rumblepad is pretty good with this
your middle fingers have a groove that they can rest inside and your index fingers go onto the shoulder buttons aka triggers
buttons are pretty easy to press but the analog sticks do not have any rubber grips on them or anything
all there is present is a slight groove
the force feedback feature is pretty accurate
i cannot wait until halo comes to the computer
then itll have an authentic quotxboxquot feeling
not really cause the analog sticks are positioned like the ps controlleroverall stay with your keyboard and mouse
if you want a gamepad though this is a pretty good one that you should consideri have had mine for over a year and it still worksno button failure anyway but it is too small for my hands
if you have large hands and play return of the king then youll be sorry i promise
i have cramps in my thumbtoindex finger tendons and last night my right arm went numb
find another controller if using extensively
works better in flight sims where you dont have to have a clickclick dexterity fest to beat your foes
hmm richard garriot said that
maybe an automatic rep modelike nintendo did fifteen years ago with thier turbo stick
my how we have evolved people
sarcasticlly rolls eyeswell there certainly is alot to say about sarges heroes
in comparison to all other army men games this ranks as one of the top then again the other games werent much competition
the graphics sparkle brilliantly using the advantage of the ps console
each movement and environment is very realistic and clear
but now comes the bad side
its play control is somewhat to be desired
in many points in the game the controller is unresponsive
you push x to fire your weapon nothing happens
however this only happens every so often
angles you look from can also be somewhat choppy where you either look right or left nothing in between
also the levels are extremely confusing
the objectives are so undescriptive you have no clue what you are supposed to do such as in the quotbridgequot level
the game however is certainly not the easiest army men game
huge tanks shoot one missile at you and youre plastic shards
but even though its moderately difficult in that perspective its really fun
cinema scenes are great and so is the music
overall a good army men game worth buyingi used to play this on n all the time and saw a decent deal for a used one for  and it is sooooooo much more fun than i rememberedit is a tough enough game where you get anxious and just want to keep playing but not tough enough that you get frustrated and want to not play itthis is a great game
graphics are pretty goodwith lots of explosions
frame rate starts at fps then drops to like  with one or two tanks on screen with  to and so on
but it seems that the game never drops below  frames a second regardless of whats on the screen
if you like twisted metal type games like me this game is greatwhile you wait for twisted metal blackthis follow up to master of orion added a lot in the way of new bells and whistles but lost the flavor that made moo so much fun  the need to be very creative in star ship building and strategy to win many unique styles of game that cropped upin moo the strategy to win is pretty much the same every game
build up tech build up fleets run the enemy off the map
there are new diplomacy options tech options and ship building features but these details i thought quickly burned themselves out
the later portion of the game becomes an almost endless cycle of starting new buildings and ships as you have more and more planets contributing to production and that is a serious drawback to all of the civ type games
you can spend a considerable amount of time doing nothing but acknowledging production complete messages at the start of each game turnstill the game overall was fun and by the time computers didnt have floppy drives to load the original moo anymore i was more or less stuck with moo for my scifi fix
lol as of the date of this review you can actually buy both games for six dollars at stardock in one package
thats a great deal and evidently lets you get the ancient moo game onto current computers
i dont know how long that offer will be available so if you are interested check on it right away and hope that you arent reading this review two years later than its published datei used to spent hours and hours playing the first orion
the second one is just as enjoyable and time consuming
if you are one of the few remaining fans of turn based strategy gaming  this is probably the last good title released before everything became real time
the rules are just the same as any of the microprose titles  build colonies ammass resources and technologies build armies destroy opponents
the ai is really frustrating to play against especially at higher levels and random events are often cruel
combined those factors allow for replaying the game dozens of times
the rules of tactical combat have been made more sophisticated in this version resulting in very lenghty battles  something i dont enjoy a lot
also frustrating is the absolute inability to protect planets in the later stages of the game  the defensive technologies pale against the powerfull attack ships which have as many hit points as two or three battlestations
on the other hand the ability to customize races and the need to choose amongst alternative technologies are great improvementsfinding computer games for a mac can be difficult frankly i dont understand why because macs are not uncommon
master of orion ii combines neat graphics the races are quite different with strategy
i like the fact that i can advance and quotwinquot either by killing everyone else or by politicing
i only wish the quotcreate your own racequot section allowed you to create an image as well for your race since you have only the standard models to chose fromthe fun of this game is in this simplicity
its so simple yet people have trouble understanding it
i bought this game  years ago and got hooked
my fave part is the cheat menu where you can change the king and queens names
its a giggle making them into people i know
the part i dont like is how you have to wait while your rivals move and they have a million units and its confusing if you have  players
i also like the high councils and the meetings with your rivals
all in all this game is good
i like it a loti really like civilization ii for my mac
the changes from the first version of the game are wonderful and im happy that you can chose not to watch the wonders videos all the time
i also like the various levels of difficulty and the fact that i can make up a nationrace  i often do amazons then use names of amazon cities from classical references
however a big problem is the tutor and instant advice that i cannot turn off
i think i should be able to reset the game options better than it allows because i find these popups to be very annoyingconsidering this games realistic level it is absolutely one of the best first person shootersthe graphics are up to date the walls and floors are perfectly detailed
the enemies move somewhat realisticly especially when being shot at also to add getting limbs blown offthe audio is normal nothing special not good but not bad
the voice acting isnt all that but you really dont notice itthe gameplay is very fun
the storyline is simple and is kept simple
the game is simple as well mainly to get from point a to point b with a few minor obstacles such as enemies or jumping through a window sadly
there are no difficult parts in the game except the bosses the game also gets somewhat boring after constantly shooting at baddies throughoutanyway the game is very fun to play has alot of realistic blood and guts in it and the storyline isnt badsof is an oddity in modern gaming
while most games try to cut it by having a deep story cutting edge graphics realistic game play or even complex game play sof is none of these and for that it is a good ridefirst i would like to point out that the game has taken a lot of flak for its violent content
it is true that there is gore in the game but any seasoned quake ut or halflife players if you have never played those you should not be reading this will find its content little more than another day at the office
yes you can blow off limbs or blow open a guys guts
however that graphics are so dated that this seems unrealistic do our guts really look like pvc tubesanother thing the graphics are old
while a lot of the q engine code has been updated it still does not escape its basic thresholds
the level design however it impressive at times
the models also are not too shabby considering the engines age
it even uses alpha channels
even though some of the shiny textures on objects i would not think to be actually shiny
it is a shame really that one trip outdoors tells you that the engine was around before most people today had the internetthere are some quirks in the game desing
each time the game boots up it warns you that this graphicly depicks real world combat
yet the game fails to be realistic its almost a joke
things can stick to walls that are not supposed too grenades have fixed trajectories  tanks can be taken out with sinper rifles not matter how many missles you fire at a door it will still stand the enemies lack an unterstanding of doors and grenades and the weapons have only a vague likeness to real world counterparts
also you earn money but to what with it
it is never a factor in buying weapons
for that matter you will pick up weapons and ammo in the game it doesnt matter what you picked out before hand
also stealth is supposed to matter the ai is so basic it does notthat said this is a very enertaining game
worth it if you like just some good old mindless bloody action to rot your brain onworks great but paper is sort of hard to find for itmadden  can be described basically as a cleaner fresher version of madden  for playstation
there have been no real big changes as far as graphics the game is still amazing considering its only bit
but there have been several small upgradesfrom the variable equipment armpads etc
that the players actually wear to the allaround slightly better look of the player movements and the fieldsas far as the intangibles there have been many improvements over  the addition of madden cards is a definite plus as is the minute drill
the hot and cold feature is very interesting and adds a more realistic feel
do you start a cold marshall faulk or a hot trung canidate
a cold drew bledsoe or a hot michael bishopthe franchise mode has seen improvement as well the salary cap seems to be more realistic now when signing free agents and the nfl draft is now  rounds instead of just  but maybe the best new feature is the addition of the preseason mode which allows you to pick your opponents for  or  games to sharpen the skills of your rookies and get a feel for your new acquisitions
then once the preseason ends young players who performed well will see added points to their attributes
really helps to develop rookies and just to try new plays which you arent accustomed to usingall that being said this is still not the perfect football game
there are statistical errors you will encounter at various times most notably the tracking of kickoff and punt returns during a season
you see it only tracks  players stats for kickoff returns and just  for punt returns
thus if only  of your kick returners got the ball during the first week and at the end of the game the opposing team attempts an onside kick recovered by one of your linemen the return stats for that lineman will be tracked for the rest of the season
and your second return man is left statless
same thing with punt returns
if your returner is performing badly and you choose to bench him his replacement will see zero stattracking
pretty frustrating if that player returns one  yards for a touchdownanother minus is the commentary which tends to induce sleepiness
summerall has no enthusiasm in his voice and madden repeats the same stuff when he does choose to say something he can go a full game on here and only speak  or  times
youd think hed know he made his point when he says quotrandy moss is one of the best receivers in the league todayquot but then two plays later when moss makes another catch you hear him repeat the same thing yet againstill this is an allaround solid game which succeeds in most areas
it is much better than gameday  so if youre looking for a football game for playstation this is the one you wanti lost  straight exhibition games against the computer but once i got the hang of the game controls i cant be stopped now
this game is pretty enjoyable id recommend it for any football fanguess what
theyre back
the evil mitochondria from the first pe have shown up and this time theyre crashing the party in los angeles
to top it off aya is back
is it just me or is she a little bigger as in chubbier and has bleached white hair
making a return appearance is eve only this time she is a sweet innocent little girl
lets get to it
the game is a very interesting hybrid
it is an rpg mixed with action strategy and plays like resident evil
this gives it some strengths and some glaring weaknesses
the strengths the major strength lies in the battle system
it is realtime so move your whatever or it will get knocked down action
you move shot and reload all while your enemy is sneaking up on you
it makes the game play like resident evil basically
the magic system has been revamped as well
instead of gaining spells as you gain levels levels have been done away with entirely you gain experience in battle and use it to invoke the spells  in all
the spells follow the fire earth wind and water elements so you can figure out which elements abilities are
trite isnt it
the controls have also been finetuned but can still be quite maddening
this occurs when ever you need to haul  fast like in the reactor battle
sometimes it is just easier to use the digital controls instead of the analog
the negatives include the story or rather the dialouge
the dialouge seems like it was written by a second grader that knew some big words
its sad really the first parasite eve was written very well
the only saving grace are aya thoughts
these come up whenever she looks at items and the background
in one such example she looks at a toilet once and says wow thats a nice toilet
look at it again and she says dear god i need to get out more
some rather humorous things can be found by analyzing everything till she repeats herself well i thought they were humorous
the other negative is this massive problem i have with socalled goverment conspiricies in video games and the world in general
they may happen in real life but they always seem tacked on in video games and this game reeks with them
the games main part happens in area  in nevada while aya looks for ufos relating to nmc activity
can anyone say area 
i almost got sick of watching the scenes in the white house and is it just me or did clinton call aya very attractive
get the best ending if you need explaination
the story would of been much better if it was handled by the same group that did vagrant story
now there was a good story and aweinspiring dialouge
also this isnt the silent era anymore
if a game is described as a cinematic rpg like pe and pe it should have real voice everywhere not just one worders here and there
the game koudelka isnt a cinematic rpg and everything except item describtions is spoken rather well too
pe would have been much better with voice acting even if it would mean adding a third disk because of memory limitations
well with that said
my recommendation is to get the game if you can overlook the flaws
just make sure that you get the players guide too
it is almost impossible to get the best ending without itparasite eve is the most innovative game ever created no doubt
who would have ever thought up the idea of mitochondria that went wild and attacked americas most profound city new york
not many people except maybe a genius
parasite eve ii is not as special as pei but it certainly is a great game and in many ways it is better than the first parasite eve title
for one thing in this new game battle is in real time unlike the first pe which had a pokemonstyle battle system where each character took turns esentially in fighting
not anymore
peii is much more like resident evil which makes fighting even more fun
the monsters are cooler in peii except its missing the first eve no doubt the most awesome video game villian ever created
she was as cool as the script of the game
but now the monsters arent just funny little animals loose
there are actually scary resident evillike monsters with awesome features and battle techniques
except for that damn shaman horse
the guns are also better in peii and there is not as many features to get used to in peii as in the first title
thats also way better
the levels are generally cool and for a playstation title the graphics are a big wow
even for a gamecube and ps owner with games such as metal gear solid  and resident evil on the gc
now for the icky partthe innovative but awful control scheme
i spent a half an hour trying to run straight ahead at first without running backwards and viceversa
actually after a couple of hours the controls may feel comfortable
thats until you go back to playing one of your other games with traditional controls
ouch
parasite eve ii is definitely a fun game if not a great game
in most ways it is better than pe except for its missing the classic eve and the storyline and cinematics are a little weaker
however the cinematics are the best that squaresoft has ever produced
above all if you liked the first pe then you will be most pleased with this title
if not then maybe you are happier with resident evil or super mario gamesi like itthose who miss the style of the old re games should try this if you havent
its survival horror with some magical elements thrown in
but this is squaresoft in the old days and they always made good games theni can understand those disappointed when compared to the first
i did play a little bit of that but i enjoy survival horror gamesparasite eve  removed everything that was wrong with the first one but left only one thing that i couldnt get over
controlling aya was a pain i thought this was really the only down point of the game
i like how there was no leveling up or active time bar to wait to shootalso the graphics are awesome and the story will entertainhowever i did enjoy parasite eve  better than  overall this is a very good game and does a good job on continuing the microchondria eve storynot resident evil
although it may seem a lot alike its not
this game is a little easier and has what i think a little bit of a better story than resident evil there is some fact behind the whole microchondria eve where as zombies are always used to try and scarei am reviewing the ps game but cant find it listed here on amazoncomi have only played this game  or  times
i have to say im not completely satisfied with it
i guess i learned that i like to play ice hockey in real life dont mind watching it but dont love to play videogame ice hockey
and im a big gamer see my other reviewsid give this a  out of  over all as it is a great game and has great graphics and gameplayoverall fun  out of   its aiight but not perfectpeace gamersmc whitei have really been looking for a decent hockey game for the last few years
nhl  was the closest i had come but after a couple of seasons i was on pace to win  games in one season
with ea sports latest effort  it seems they have corrected that flaw
at the end of of the season the team records look about as realistic as they should usually with some surprises calgary flames in the playoffs if youre lucky you can have the leagues leading scorer on your team
all of the statistics are fairly realistic
you can still run away with a game but it rarely happens
i have been playing with the stars which are rated the best team in the game and i have only scored  goals in one game
dont be disappointed the computer sometimes returns the favor
i have noticed that you can be beaten by any team
your team goes through winning streaks and slumping streaks
your stars get hot and then cold
overall the realistic feel of the game is great
theres no scoring  goals with one player in a season unless of course you have it on one of the easier levels
some of the problems left untouched from last year are the amount of breakaways shorthanded goals penalty kill percentages and your goalie save 
there are way too many breakaways which you cant always score on but nonetheless unrealistic
a player can sometimes have    shorthanded goals in a season your penalty kill percentage is somewhere around  your powerplay  is somewhere around  and your goalies save  is somewhere around   unrealistic
gameplay is fantastic graphics are equally as impressive and most of all you dont blow away the competition
also the game allows you to create players
you can give them anywhere from rookie to all star status
as you take this player through the seasons he improves or gets worse depending on his age and productivity
players retire and the computer creates new players the longer you play
i have only played a  game season so far
i played with the stars
after some key injuries slumps and winning streaks i finished  which is dead on for a first or second place team
that would be on pace to win about  games in an  game season
it doesnt get any more realistic than that
i finished nd in the western conference th overall and st in pacific division
im having trouble in the playoffs after phoenix took me to game six and vancouver is giving me fits
it can be somewhat easy getting to the playoffs with some of the best teams in the game but watch out you can get knocked out of the playoffs as easy as you got in
thats where the real challenge is
chances are if you try to take a subpar team through the season you will not make it to the playoffs unless you create some superstars and make some killer trades to beef up your lineup
thats how challenging this game is
if you want a fun and competitive hockey game try nhl   after reading the reviews on this site i decided to rent the game before i bought it
turns out i wasted  dollars renting the game
just a great game with a  star fun factor so in other words its quotsuperbquot  i cant give it  stars because there isnt much improvement in graphics or gameplay
they couldve just issued this game out with the original medal of honor as disc  and you wouldnt know the differencehowever the story line is great and the suspense in gameplay is as intense as before
there are some new weapons and ai buddies that fight with you briefly during some missions
enemies are pretty much the same but with different vehicles and modes of destruction
other than that youve got the same game
the music once again enhances the action on the screen
sound effects are untouchable as wellif you liked the original medal of honor pick this game upmain gripe  kind of easy like the first one
youll probably finish it in a week or so
if you want to save money but enjoy the game rent it a few timesgreat game but i still like the original better
there are some new levels of play and others seem like they just changed the skins on the original
over all i recommend it especially if youre a big moh fan
it gets a little creepy with some sort of wolf men which is were you may stat to loose interest because it takes away from the real historical parts of the story and gives it a cheesy endingif you read my review on the original you will recall i said it was quotthe greatest video game ive ever playedquot  this is a good game too but unfortunately i didnt feel it lived up to the original and in fact i found a few flaws that took away from my enjoymentits pretty much the same format and control scheme as the original which makes it a very enjoyable game very easy to learn
unfortunately for me this game seems to be quite a bit harder and in the later bonus missions it becomes frustratingly difficult to the point of where i finally gave up without finishing it
i do not agree with the thinking of a lot of game designers who think if you just make a game harder that will make it more enjoyablei was very disappointed when i got to the quotbonusquot missions
one of the strengths of medal of honor is that you are engaging real enemies ie
nazi soldiers no monsters aliens etc
well in the final missions of underground you encounter exploding robots and dogs who drive halftracks carry machine guns and bazookas
totally ridiculous and a total departure from the overall historical context of the gamefinally i found a few bugs
enemies that had been defeated came back to life objectives that were cleared were suddenly uncleared enemies with xray vision and worse quotxray bulletsquot and enemies who literally appeared right before your eyesoverall its a fun game im glad i bought it but im disappointed in it and would be a little skeptical if there is ever another sequeli remember how hard it was to find a good first person shooter for the psx of course the ps has tons of them and finally comming upon this one
i was impressed immediately
the graphics were well done and the ai while eventually becomming slightly predictable was reasonable and well designed
the levels are intricate but generally linear
i would have liked to be able to open more doors other than the absolutely necessary onesthe storyline is intricate taking you through almost every stage of wwii up to and including the liberation of france and the fall of hitler
complete with about a half hour estimated of real wwii footage the mission briefings come to life like never before
the weapons are all real wwii weapons everything from the panzerfaust to the stick handgrenade to the smg the reason it is at a four star rating and not a five is because of several bugs throughout the game
many missions can be completed cheaply by tricking the ai through walls or sometimes even shooting through walls or hiding behind other guards
another very annoying problem is that your character gets stuck on walls
it is impossible to slide along the side of a wall without getting jerked around
all in all however a very well designed game best fps for the psxif you liked nba live  youll definitely love   the look and the feel of the games is pretty much the samefor example there are more details to the stadiums here and there which you will notice
the game commentary is much improved
youll hear accurate and abundant comments by the two commentators
at times they even interact with each other in dialoguethe play is the same but youll have to get used to timing your jump shots
it seems the time they jump in the air is a little less
other than that the feel of the game is pretty much the sameone new and very welcome feature is the challenges
for those who are bored with playing seasons over and over again these challenges will keep us entertained
with incentives such as the aba basketball west coast outdoor courts afros eye patches etc the challenges will keep us busyagain we have the one on one with jordan with the classic players once againthe enhancements are subtle but they do make a big difference for   if you thought  was a good bball game you will for sure love one good thing about this game is that it includes the new rookies
however it doesnt show their faces when you trade them and etc
this year there are a few more legends and for those of you who buy it for the graphics or those high flying dunks seen in the advertisements dont buy this game
ive had nba live  to  and  this game isnt a big improvement over  sure there is a challenge mode but its to long and it becomes boring after a while
i even think nba shootout  will be better then this
like all the years  the camera angles make the gameplay extremely hard
and you need glasses to recognize faces
i broke my glassesso if you have  dont buy this game
buy shootout if you want toif its in the game it might be in the gameand oh yeah dont think all those arguments with the refs over the calls are any good the players only have one reaction to those calls and it takes  seconds to load up that little flickrather than wasting a lot of time and words heres the pros and cons of this game
the pros   excellent fun gameplay easy to perform moves easy to perform finishers
the commentary is funny and entertaining at times
being able to customize your favorite wrestlers with whatever moves you like is great want to see sting pull a jackhammer on someone you can do that
the backstage areas and weapons are fun to use
the cons  graphics could be way better theyre blocky and some wrestlers dont look very much like thier real life wrestlers
opponents get up or kick out way too quick after performing a finishing move
finishing moves arent exact to thier wrestlers since when is stings finisher a sidewalk slam aka the bookend the scorpion death drop should have been much easier to perform instead of a rear grapple to do it
ea should watch wcw and write it all down before the next wcw title comes out
the last problem i find is moving around is slow unless your running
i really liked mayhem and this is better theyve got some great trademark moves in here nash putting his hands up before he knees someone in the corner is great
keeping up with times though its too bad people like raven randy savage and gorgeous george arent in this
 scott hall is in this game you have to beat him to use him
if you like wcw buy this game if your a wwf fan or play wwf games give this one some time to get used to the play control is very differentif youve played the playstation version of jedi power battles then you already know what to expect from this installment a basic action game where you journey through levels destroying enemies and jumping from platform to platform a good gameplay comparison can be found in the teenage mutant ninja turtles games of old
other than vastly improved graphics and slightly better play control power battles for the dreamcast doesnt feature any good improvementsto start the added training mode is too short and doesnt even tell you how to perform certain actions such as reflecting laser shots back at the enemies to do so block just before the shot reaches youthe new vs mode where two players can duke it out is uneven and boring
players start by selecting their characters and are then put in a small plain arena where there are no objects to jump onto or block their way
borrring
also the characters are often uneven meaning that someone will always have the advantage
for instance if your opponent picks a simple droid as his character and you choose one of the jedi as yours you will more than likely win since your character has force powers and can also deflect laser shots while your opponents droid can only shoot from a distance
unfairand to end it off lucasarts never fixed the small glitches you still get stuck between objects like trees and cliffs the animation of characters is still choppy and sometimes the screen scrolls to blackness and you cant see your character
there was even one time in the last level as i was fighting darth maul when he fell into a pit and the only way to proceed with the game was to jump down after him sacrifice a life and start the level overwith all this said though the main game is still a blast especially when playing cooperatively with a friend
i find jedi power battles simple action a great diversion from the large complex adventure games that seem everywhere nowadays
after all who hasnt wanted to be in the shoes of a jedi and wield a lightsaberat least on the playstation that is
its about time we get a good star wars game on this system
it may not be a masterpiece but its certainly good enough to restore just a little faith in lucasartsill start with some of the negatives that have been brought up   there is no reverse button
really once you get good at the game you dont need a reverse button but i still think it would be good to have one just the same
 the graphics while excellent for the most part can also make some things very hard to see especially thermal detonators on the ground and smaller vehicles aurra sing darth maul leia and especially boba fett
 worst of all this game has a bad habit of freezing up during loading screens more often than any other that ive ever playednow after considering those things i kept at it and i find that this game is actually really fun
some have complained that its too hard but thats just something to be remedied by practice and strategy
after awhile i found myself feeling that it was too easythe other complaint is that the storyline is not consistent with star wars but come on
even the games that were supposed to be directly based on the movies did not follow the movie scripts to the letter
if they did there really would not be much of a game
besides the star wars universe has plenty of openings for alternate storylines
just look at all the novels fanfics and rpgs out therei also like the music in this game being remixes of the original star wars songs
they really manage to keep a good pace and tempo to suit all the action in the gamei will admit too that at first i did not like the control scheme
i dont like having to use those l amp r buttons so much
however when you get down to it there is really no other way that the controls in this game could have been set up without being horribly awkward
this is not really a design flaw of the game its a limitation of the playstation controller
i also think it would have been a good idea for some of these vehicles to have the ability to pitch forward and back that is move up and down instead of just left and right
its unrealistic without this a snowspeeder should handle like a jet not a sports carother than these minor gripes though i actually had a lot of fun with this game
its certainly not perfect but its much more enjoyable than other psx star wars gamesi bought this game because i remembered playing a demo version of it when i was a kid and i loved it as a kid
now that im older and playing it i remember liking it much more back then haha
it actually is a difficult game
you drive around trying to finish off your opponents before they finish you offstar wars demolition certainly blazes no new ground in the gaming or star wars universes but it sure is a lot of fun to play
one has to appreciate the absurdity of the premise and the locales of battle
basically jabba has decreed that a number of members of the star wars universe battle it out in a gladiatorlike tournament for the right to not be killed
this leads to some very bizarre matches and even stranger combatants
anyone or thing from boba fett to an atst to a rancor can be used as a combatant
the battle grids take place in such disparate locations as tatooine naboo dagobah and the death star
 to name a few
the gameplay itself is not the smoothest but it is still a very fun play
try it on full tournament mode and after using various different combatants to win hidden combatants can be unlocked
its quite fun and has a high replay value
it is certainly as entertaining as any number of fighting games out there
try it outi have always been a big fan of lucas arts xwing and tie fighter games so when i heard they were making a game for the playstation  i reserved my copy
i was a little disappointed at first and if your expecting this to be xwing for the ps you will be too
however that being said i think that starfighter is a good game
the graphics are spectacular and the storyline and movie sceens are entertaining
the missions range from fighting it out in space to destroying targets on planet surfaces which keeps the game interesting
overall i think this is a good game just dont expect it to be xwingfirst let me say that i love star wars
thats anything about star wars i have seen all six movies im sure some of you have too and have played all the games that have come out with the name star wars on it
with that aside let me just say that this was probably the best star wars game to come out since tie fighter the only exception being jedi power battles which was fun but not in the same way
star wars starfighter is a space combat game that uses a flight sim control style that falls just short of the realism provided by tie fighter but what was lost in the realism was gained in the terrific graphics
i was completely blown away by the canyon runs and fullscale space battles
the movies themselves did not contain such spectacularly large and complex space fight scenes
i became dizzy at some points and just had to pause the game to try and get my bearings again
truly a marvelous piece of programmingmy only complaints about this game come from features that existed in other games provided by lucas arts that were missing from this one
the most notable is the nonexistent map
perhaps i couldnt find it but in either case there was no map and without one the complicated space battles turned into allot of spinning over and over again looking for the place im supposed to go
the next problem is the limited control over the armament and selection of ships
in most other space combat games by lucas arts you are able to select what ship you wish to fly and what armament you want on your ship
additionally during combat switching between shields weapons engines and the like all added that much more fun to the game
this one on the other hand functioned like an arcade game and did not provide such complications which could be good for some playersfor those of you that loved tie fighter and xwing then you will appreciate the advancements that have been made with starfighter
increasing the difficulty level until your ship turns into stardust on the first training mission makes up for its rather short playtime
so go out rent it buy it borrow it from a friend but by all means play iti also dont really go for starwars games but this game was an exception
to me the game plays like the incredible starfox game back on the snes but without the end level bosses
the graphics are incredible detailed i cant emphasis on how good looking the game is
and with the gameplay it almosts matches to how the game looks with smooth realistic movement of the ships
the draw back with this game is that the framerate tends to drop a bit when there is quite a lot of ships on screen and the fact that the actual game is a bit short
but with how the game plays it wouldt bother you
i can say i got a classic game worth of  this is a must for any starwars fans and a must for any shoot emup fans the game is a classthis game is one of the best flying games in the world
its always fun to play when im bored
about  missions with  pilots to battle your way to save naboo from the trade federation
the great graphics and many bad guys are cool
this is like real life
the last level is the best where you and your team battle with at least  bad guys flying everywhere in space
if you like star wars or any type of flying game then this is for youthis is a great game
it has great graphics except for the occansional fogging in the background
the music is fantastic classic star wars tunes
the only thing i can think of that is somewhat difficult are the different screens that you get when you are in one of the three different ships
but that isnt that hard to get used to
this is classic star wars material
starfighter is just like rouge squadron and battle for naboo where you get medals on how well you do in a level
that accounts for tons of the replay value because you can see if you can get better ratings and a higher medal
one really neat feature that makes starfighter stand out is the original sniper mode you can use to hit enemies from far away
this game is a blast and if you like star wars even a little bit you should not miss out on this great gamewhen i bought this game i saw how great all the reviews were
since i was a mediocre star wars fan i went ahead and purchased it
the graphics are amazing but the first few levels are extremely boring
all they really do is get you used to the controls and i pretty much got them down after the first level
anyway the game has a story to it which is slightly interesting but the real fun comes when you get to the other levels on hard and you find yourself in a very chaotic battle
youve got tanks all over the ground slowly moving toward your base and theyre firing at you while your trying to keep fighters out
and during that more dropships come in launching more tanks and then in the middle of it when all hell has broken lose one of your wingmen asks you to take care of some side goal
the game is pretty short but if you want some intense battles then you should try this one outthis game is well made
it has good graphics and gameplay
there are even a few missions which can be played  player
however the new jedi starfighter game is twice as fun and you can play all the missions  player on it
if you own neither one i suggest skipping this one and going right for jedi starfighterthe graphics are good
the controls are tricky but once you get used to them they work well
i played all the way through twice
i enjoyed it even more the second time
your squad gets in your way and the get themselves killed a lot but you get them back later
most ps games have been a let down
this one was funi got this because it was cheap but my grandson loves it because he said it was way cool
he enjoys the action and role playing
easy to understand and graphic are well doneif you enjoyed hotshots golf on the psx then you should enjoy swing away golf
they are very similar in style and gameplay
the game is very easy to learn certainly no harder than hotshots was
the load times are not excessive but they are there and that is a little disappointing
the caddies are a massive pain in the butt
but instead of turning the sound down and putting on the stero why not just go into the options menu and turn narration off
i had several people tell me that the caddies were always there
i dont know maybe they didnt look in the options menuif you are looking for a very serious golf game then look elsewhere
this game is certainly not serious
it is anime characters playing golf
if you like hotshots or want to just joke around with your friends then this game would be well worth it
 player mode can be a blast with some friends and beer
worth the cashall in all not a bad game
its a bit frustrating at first due to the fact that your irons do not hit as far as advertised
your caddie and opponents comments get a bit tired due to the lack of variety but this can be remedied by listening to the stereo while playingenough already
yes the caddies are annoying but only if you 
seriously theres an awful lot of chatter and the load times especially when generating a course seem slow for all of the vaunted speed of the ps
those things aside and they truly are minor given the overall quality of the game this is a great golf game
lots of depth of play so many different types of tournaments and contests to play in story mode that its fun for one person to develop their own character or invite over some buddies drink some beer and play golf
if youve played a video golf game in the last  years youll be able to pick up on the swing system inside of  holes not to mention some great tutorials that allow notsoexperienced players to get up to speed quickly
a great addition to your ps library
foreto be honest i bought the game because i was getting tired of playing tekken and all the other games im interested in are not being released until january
i was a big fan of hot shot golf and thought it might be nice to get a golf game for the psthe game is fun  very fun i think
it was extremely difficult getting used to at first there is a very sharp learning curve initially because the documentation on simply quothow to playquot just isnt in the game  neither in the books nor during the quotlessonsquot
however once you get the hang of the controls the game becomes quite enjoyable and mildly addicting
after about a week of recreational play i typically play for about  mins until my wife tells me its time to eatcleanquotdo something constructivequot the learning curve completely disappears and it becomes almost overly easy
however the gran turismoesque simulation mode is quite addictivei would definitely recommend itpros fun interface without being cute lots of replay value a lot of different multiplayer capabilities typical stroke and match play but also skins suddendeath longdrive and betting capability the course generator builds completely new courses on the fly adds tons to replay value and the weather pattern will actually change during course play not just between holes but between strokes on a holeadds some new challenge
scenery weather waterawesomecons the game does not explain itself well i still dont know what quothsquot means on one of the rating charts at all and the ingame characters can get really annoying when youre not doing well
the caddies kinda stink but the only game with caddies i liked was hot shots  and the bgm music is vry limited read as beat your head against the wall repetativeall in all a much better than average golf game for a console
fun for friends and wives and for people who arent golf fanatics irl im not and many of my friends arent but the ones who are really enjoy the game as well
and even though the interface is clunky at first its quite enjoyable after you beat the learning curve out
imho three things keep it from being a fivestar bgm music ingame character attitude and explanation of whattheheck some of the stuff in the game means
i hope you enjoy i didwell worth the priceive never liked golf i hate playing it i hate watching it on tv but i love this game
its addictive to watch your career skyrocket in the story mode going from amateur to fullon professional within months as you compete in different tournaments
the gameplay is engaging and entertaining with fun characters and beautiful courses
some people have been saying that the caddies are annoying but there are  caddies to choose from ranging from very supportive to very critical
there are not all knowitalls
for me theres only one drawback the incredible amount of slowdown
the game seems to drag out longer than it has to be because of all the waiting for each hole to load
but seriously despite the slowdown this game is very very fun and a musthave for anyones ps collection even if you dont like golfthis is one my favorite games from the old ps
i replayed this one over and over again
its not to hard to master and the game is kinda short but im a sucker for all things feudal japan and this game gave me a good fix
the graphics are a little under par for whats available now but its the chess like strategy aspect of the game that appeals to me
i wish the duels could have been a bit better tho
not the greatest game that ever came out for the ps but i still get the urge to play it now and thenfor those of us that stayed up nights cursing oda nobunaga and his blasted quotambitionquot this game may very well seem like one of his traps
old koei games were not real big on doing much thinking for you
autopilot was never an option then
well apparently the suits at koei finally broke down and decided to make a strategy game for the masses one without all the pesky troop upkeep and rice
the opening credits fill in the gamer that kessen was made to resemble a movielike experience much like hideo kojimas metal gear solid
that becomes readily evident when after going through a tutorial that teaches you all about how to order your generals and influence enemy generals and plan battle routes the game begins to basically play itselfwarning
no great amount of tactical aptitude is required to play this gamealways a little intimidated by koeis previous elegant epics
well this isnt one of them
you can get as involved or as passive as you want this time your generals will think for themselves thank you very much
oldtimers may get a bit miffed at the lack of any serious micromanagement aspects but even the crankiest curmudgeon will rejoice at the fabulous storyline and character development
and did i mention the graphics
never has routing your opponent on the battlefield looked so rewardingin short it is very much a like a koei playable movie sans any deep strategy or widescale management
as such one must have patience
not necessarily for learning the game more for sitting back and watching as your generals go to work on the opposition
this is still fun even for an old quotriceheadquot like myself aerobiz supersonic anyone
and newcomers to the koei stable will likely be very impressed by the grand nature of it all and grateful that they dont have to spend an eternity making sure the dams and levees are properly fundedand who knows maybe this game will count for credits toward that japanese history major youve been wanting to obtain if you are really into japanese history then you may like this game
if you are really into strategy games and japanese history you may like this game
in fact go rent part  it has to be better than this mess
if you are not interested at all in japanese history then to you this is simply a very lame strategy game that should be avoided at all costs
if you are not even into strategy games let alone japanese history you shouldnt even be reading this reviewthis game is just bad
it is very slow
you move your group of soldiers here while they move their soldiers there
if they get close enough there is a warning that someone is going to attack
this is where you see a cool looking cut scene where some guy on a horse says he is going to kill you like the eagle diving down from the sky to capture its prey or something lame like that
then you watch as he kills your soldiers and you realize that this reminds you of another game you should be playing instead
then you are back to the overhead screen where you see your soldiers defeat his soldiers
way to go eagle man
after you beat him you can keep moving your group of soldiers to another group of bad guy soldiers
if you win the cycle of quotviolencequot continues
i suppose the game may be worth playing to see what other kinds of neat metaphors the evil hondas or toyotas come up with
who knows in the later parts of the game they may have prepared threatening haikusyour face is uglymy sword is extremely sharpi will watch you diebuild roller coasters ride them get them ratedstraightforward familyfriendly funthe only way i could see a person being disappointed with this is if they had some mistaken expectation of what the game was
its not action its not really roleplaying its building theme parks and trying to make them profitable by having satisfied customersit is difficult to get the best rating for a coaster but i know ill figure it out eventually
currently mine are all too fast making the kids sick but at least they are exciting
heres a tip so stop reading if a tip will ruin it for you earn money early on using your sideshows
people will pay a lot for the sideshow games as long as the chance of winning makes the game satisfying enoughi got this game in  i also had the theme park game for the ps
its simple enough to learn how to construct rides and such for your theme park
the are eight different parks you can have
i made it up to the fourth park which has a halloween theme
you must make a profit maintain your rides clean the bath rooms and add new features to make people want to return
challenging but fun
the game allows for correcting mistakes and the tutorial constantly has something to tell you which to some extent can be annoyingi agree with another reviewer in that the buisness objectives take away from some of the fun of the game
younger and less patient gamers will probably not like this game
this game definitely requires patience and a memory card to keep up with your latest enhancements
the messages tend to be repetitive
how many times can a stink bomb go off in the bath room
as you get better you earn coupons and can put more elaborate things in your park like an employee lounge where your workers can hang out during their breaka good game to learn about what goes into running a theme park but you need patience and it can get repetitivei had waited long and hard for nba live  to come to the ps and am diassapointed with the the final copy
it is very uncommon of  ea sports games to be missing lots of fantasy options i mean the franchise mode of madden is one of the things that made it so great
theres no franchise mode here there isnt even a three point shoot out
the actual game though is fun fun and more fun
but that does not make up for the lack of options and annoying music
finally graphically the game is great not as graphically great as madden but then again what is
overall its good but just doesnt have the feel i was excpecting it too have
you should probably rent it before purchasingthis game is much better than what a lot of people make it
its a complete game with great graphicswell they could have left out the game intro where everyone is dancing around like its a quoti feel like chicken tonightquot commercial but thats ok thats what the start button is for
everyone is pretty much as good in this game as they are in real life which is much different from other basketball titles i care not to mention
overall if you are a slight fan of the series its still worth the purchase
a good buyjust got this game from a seller thru amazon and while the controls took a while to get used to im pretty impressed
the graphics are beautiful and while the gameplay can be slow at times overall it is challengingim not a fan of first person shooters or kiss if you feel the same read on
i recieved this game as a gift when i got around to trying it out i was pleased to find the levels to be a perfect balance between challenge and fun
not too dark although i believe this is some variant of the quake ii or iii engine
the game is fun to play and i love the default control setup use the analog pad to look around the colored buttons to move around and the triggers to use weaponsquake iii and unreal are both more impressive for graphics but they are designed to be multiplayer games
this game game has story element and most important its fun and addictiveand as others have stated here as well as myself you do not have to be a fan of kiss to enjoy this game its based off a comic book thats loosely based around the band
kiss music is used in this game about as much as nine inch nails music was used in the original quake its transparent and blends with game playfour starsthis game was not what i thought it would be
it appeals to me because i am a big kiss fan
the game play is straight forward
move through the enviornments and kill monsters in search of the pieces of your kiss costume
it takes time to get through each phase
you start out as paul and end with gene
you switch characters once you have the full costume and have completed all tasksyou will collect different weapons unique to each character
it is fun but the controls are a little difficult to get use to
the graphics are average
the instruction book does not give you a clue as to what you need to do or how to do it
if you like to play first person shooters and like kiss you will like this game
otherwise keep lookingim a late comer to the world of quotsurvival horrorquot games
but i love themfrom my introduction to them with the first resident evil game ive been hooked
and this game provides a good installment in my now rather long string of games playedyes it does have a lot in common with the re series
but so what
this is a good gamei always like how these games start out in some creepy location and then things just get weirder and weirder
and the monsters keep getting more and more bizarre
but the best thing is when the originally described premise is supplanted by the truth behind all the gruesome events which are part of the game
and then that too usually becomes more and more strange and wonderfulthe best part for me about this particular game though is the puzzles
that is definitely one of the strengths here
some seem a bit too intuitive at first glancewhile a couple just dont seem logical even after discovering the secret
sure i can try all of my tools on an object and finally hit on which one is supposed to be usedbut that doesnt make me feel smart
nor does it make solving the puzzle seem rewardingbut all in all this is a pretty interesting gameyes it does seem to have borrowed from resident evil fear effect silent hill and others
but if so the choices of elements to integrate here were wiseas someone who is still waiting for a game developed specifically for the ps which i would consider worth playing im glad to have this one
but even if youve already stepped up to the ps give this a chance
it offers a type of game that i wish was more commonfighting racing and battle strategy might do it for manybut i need a game like this with an interesting story and puzzling situations to immerse myself inif that describes what you look for in a game too i hope you will also enjoy this gamethe good scary with first time round hallucinations and paranoia
cool weapons n monsters with upgrades and flashlight aspect to kill
semi multi storiesthe bad controls are dated tank comtrols
story is interesting till half through
replay isnt as different or lasting till time has passedthe neutral graphics are dated but good for its time
gameplay n lvls are about same as re puzzles are itemized usuallyoverall great game replay less often dont mind ok story n youll get the most fun and fear out of this gameits games like this that shows that is still plenty of life left in the original playstation
alone in the dark  is the best in the series with the some stunning graphics and gameplay that will keep the player captivated for along time
the object of the game is till pretty much the same and you are armed with minimal weaponary but yet you have to enjure several levels of terror and mayhem this is what makes the game so much fun
basicaly this is a must have game if you want something that is different to the games that are around at the mmomentsimply put this game is a blast to play
for true flight enthusaists it offers very accurate graphics and flight simulations
for casual pilots the gameplay can be tuned to allow any level of pilot to enjoy the game
but lets dig into the detailsgraphicsoverall very nice
when the graphics level is turned up the detail is amazing especially on the aircraft
the ground detail is good but not very exciting  after all youre pretty much in the middle of the pacific
my main criticism here is that the detail on the ships could be better
when youre on the deck of an aircraft carrier there are no other planes on the deck and the detail of the control tower isnt that greatgameplaythe game makes it easy to get in the air quickly
this is great when you dont feel like playing through a whole missing or just havent taken the time to start a full campaigneach of the aircraft have a distinctly different feel and sound but none of them are very difficult to fly
however getting the plane back on the ground is a different story
with some practice youll be able to land on a long runway pretty easily but setting down on the deck of a carrier takes a lot of practice
if you add windstorms to the mix it is even more difficult
personally i found developing this skill one of the most enjoyable parts of the gamethe realism of flight and damage are just great
if your aircraft is damaged in a dogfight it will fly very differently
because of the realistic damage modelling you really appreciate the fragility of the planesi didnt find the storyline too exciting and the cartoon sequences between sequences werent very compelling
this aspect of the game wasnt of too much interest to me in the first place so im not that concerned by itfinally the mission builder is very well done
when you get tired of flying the stock campaigns you can fire up the mission builder and throw something together in a few minutesother notesi highly recommend picking up a force feedback joystick for this game
having one adds an enormous amount to the gameplayi have the force feed back joystick that i bought just for this game
it is worth it but i would like to see a better story and maybe more realistic crashesi had trouble getting this one to run but finally was successful
i am running an amdk  cpu with  mb of ram and a diamond monster d ii accelerator with a flightstick pro and rudder pedals
according to the package i meet all of the requirements
my operating system is microsofts windows mei loaded cfs twice but when i tried to play it could not get past loading the scenery when my screen went black
the machine locked up
finally after trying the new drivers for the diamond monster which i found on their european site i got it to run properlyyou would think though that microsoft with all of their expertise could design a game that would run without so many hasslesthe game is good
graphics are superb sound is good and the scenery is excellent
the game runs smoothly when you finally get it to run
i found some fault of coursefirst i dislike the annoying cones that point you at the nearby enemy
they are certainly not realistic
also the enemy planes flit about in a most unrealistic fashion and make them unrealistically hard to track
even closing at a combined speed of  miles an hour another aircraft should be more easily followed
however microsoft is no guiltier than many other simulation designers in such mattersmodeling of the aircrafts flight characteristics is not bad but not entirely realistic either
i took an ff quothellcatquot up to  feet above kwajalein atoll an airstrip from which i have flown and put her into a spin
this is an aircraft that was relatively easy to fly i soloed in  in the real thing
although i kicked reverse rudder and neutralized the controls properly she would not recover from the spin and go into a dive
the ff was not notorious for having bad spin characteristicsalso dropping your landing gear at a couple hundred miles an hour should not result in quotgear damagequot  pilots often did it in combat to get a sudden reduction in speedanother problem is the slow reaction of the machine guns to the gun button
and after the button is released they inexplicably keep on firing for a couple or three secondsthe copy writers who wrote the pilots manual fell into the same trap as everyone else in comparing the ff with the fu quotcorsairquot  they claimed that the ff is quotfar from the fastest us fighterquot but that it was in the quottop rank of american fighters in the pacific theater along with the vought corsairquot  they claim a top speed for the hellcat of  knots  mph at  feet while the corsair is credited with a top speed of  knots  mph at  feet making the corsair seem much faster
one gets tired of hearing such unfair comparisonsive got news for them an article in flight journal last year by corky meyer a grumman test pilot described a side by side test of the corsair and hellcat flat out at the same altitude they had the same r  horsepower pratt amp whitney engine but different dash numbers had them performing at the same speed over the ground but the corsair was indicating a higher speed due to the different placement of the pitot tubebecause of its wing design the corsair had a quicker roll characteristic than the hellcat
it was also more unstable and difficult to fly and taxiing and landing visibility was hampered by the long engine nacelle
they called it the quotensign eliminatorquot  otherwise they were very evenly matched in their performance characteristicsthe copy writers call the corsair quotbig tough and fastquot which it was of course but the ff pilots shot down over  percent of all airtoair kills in the pacific war
it is a vastly under rated airplane by the desk jockeyshere are some figures  the hellcat is credited with  air victories during wwii and  hellcat pilots shot down  or more enemy planes the definition of an quotacequot  corsairs shot down  enemy and made only  aces although they enbtered service in the pacific first
the famed mustang was credited with only  kills and made only  aces
the little ff quotwildcatquot with  kills made  aces and was badmouthed as being obsolete at the wars beginning
looking only at results one wonders at the critics remarksbut this is a fine game
the graphics are right up there with janes wwii fighters and it will be a source of much pleasure for a lot of peoplejoseph pierre usn retthis is a very good flight sim
cfs  was better in the graphics area
this has a way better story line though
this had wonderful graphics too but not as great as the first combat flight simulatorsome of the complaints i have about this game are
your wingmen are useless when you want them to do something
even though the game is pretty long i wish it stopped at the surrender of japan or the americans victory
it is too easy to complete missionsother than that this is a flawless gamethis is a very enjoyable game and easy to get into right away despite what other reviewers say
true if you jump in with fully realistic modelling of plane behavior and agressive enemies youll have a very hard time staying alive
being new to flight sims i took the wimpy route and used easy modes wherever i could to start out with and i quickly became interested and started using harder settings
a flight yoke is a must of course
dont hope to fly with just a keyboard
also if heavily actionoriented games fpss and stuff are your thing you may get bored with this game after a few hours
alot of the fun is in learning to effectively fly the different planes and outfly enemies
though the action is great this game is really more about skill acquisition than about blowing things up
that said its extremely gratifying to watch your enemies burst into flames and shed pieces as your tracers tear through themthis is a good wwii flying shooter with great graphics and easy controls
works fantastic with my sidewinder  force feedback stick on a piii  ghz win xp system
also plays well on a  ghz celeron system with integrated graphics running win xp
this is not a game that you can play hours on end for days and feel like your getting challenged
pull it out occasionally as a break from your other games and it will keep you occupied happily for several hours
at the current low price its an easy addition to your gaming librarya while ago in june i for some reason decided to pick up a copy of the original combat flight simulator when i got it and installed it after playing it for  minutes i absolutly hated it
but enough about the originalmicrosoft combat flight simulator  pacific theatre is a lot better
i finally convinced myself to buy this and when i got it i played it for about an hour and i was thinking quotthis is funquot  one of the reasons i bought this game was because it includes the quotfu corsairquot what is that you ask
if you have seen the show quotblack sheep squadronquot then you know what i am talking about
in this game you can fight ww on the japanese or american side you have a fair amount of planes to chose from  in all including the quotam zeroquot and the quotf hellcatquot  you do everything from taking off aircraft carriers to escorting bombers to hot dogfights over the pacific oceanthis is a must have for all flight simmersi really enjoyed this game immensely  the graphics are great the storyline is very good and it really is scary in places
a couple of times i rounded a corner to be faced with some nasty thing and actually yelled out loud because i was so startled
the soundtrack is incredibly creepy the lighting is very dim and the monsters make sufficiently scary noises which all lend themselves to an astonishingly scary atmosphere  youll stay on your toes believe methe monsters are pretty grotesque and this isnt a game id want younger children to play if i were a parent
theres a huge amount of reading in the game and much of it is superfluous  any important clues are generally easily distinguished from them
there were a couple of bugs i found mostly with objects not wanting to be moved in the right way for the next progression to happen but overall a relatively bugfree and stable gamethere are several weapons available and a goodly number of monsters to fight
the puzzles can be challenging and its possible to get entirely lost  but those arent bad things in my viewget ready to be creeped out and go grab this onei thought id throw in my two cents worth
first alone in the dark is a series of games that originated as pc games
they are not console games but have been adapted for several console systems
i am enjoying this game so far and it is definitely not find key goto next level as one ignorant review leads you to believe
the graphics may not be the greatest and i will agree the lack of ammo bothers me as i had the hardest time with the gator in the cellar because you cant pass him without killing him as he throws you back to the middle of the room each time you get anywhere close to the door on the other side of the room
the one thing i have had a problem with though is that the instructions say you can use a joystick or a mouse with or instead of the keyboard controls but to my knowledge there is no way to set up or configure any type of controls but the keyboardthis is probally the finest example for monkey island rookies to start playing atwhile the other two before it were praised for their innovations and humor the graphics are just too pixelated for many of todays gamers to take seriouslyon the contrary mis hand drawn artwork can still be appreciated today as all good productions made during this time period have the antidated technology of plain old fashioned well drawn art to guide themthis game takes almost everything that was good about the first few and makes the generational leap to a more visually realized gaming universethe curse of monkey island was a funfilled adventure that will keep you wanting more
it is very exciting although the story is not as good as the first two games
its animation is top notch and the sound is pretty good
i did have some problems with the sound every now and then
the characters would stutter and blip
good game that is very good value for the money you pay
buy it todayill start by saying that this game is really dated
if id written this review  years ago id have given the game  starsi liked the game so much for several reasons
first it is one of the few old west games on the market  a genre that i think is far underutilized in the gaming industrysecond the story is quite good
the opening cinematic is done cartoonstyle and so holds up well even today
the opening is quite long and does a lot to get the player involved and set a dark mood for the gamethird this game has a more realistic damage system than most but not all other st person shooters on the market
your character isnt armored to the hilt and so one or two wellplaced shots will likely take him outoverall if you dont mind the graphics this is a darned good game
as i always say  the plays the thingthis game is similar in quality to the other lucasarts fps quotjedi knightquot
i bought this game at a clearance sale and i was surprised by how much fun this game is to play
if you like playing other fpss like quotquake quot and quotshogoquot and are looking for something new try this old gamewith all the new graphics and whatnot out there this game is worthless
but if you have a bad pc and would like a little fun buy this game
 years ago i would give this game of the yearyou are in luck  bucks for this great game
to be honest i really dont like this genre but i have played the demo seen the promos and talked to people who have played the whole game
my conclusion is that besides xwing alliance this was one of the last expertly programmed and designed games to come out of the lucasarts workshop
pretty much everything after this release stinks to high heaven
so go buy it alreadythe good superb voice acting humor and script writing beautiful art style and prerendered graphicsthe bad puzzles are difficult to figure out a few graphical glitches here and there too short disappointing endingive heard all about this game for years and i finally decided to play it
im really glad i did because grim fandango has one of the best story lines in all games period
of course this game was made in the late s so there are some flaws but i was surprised at how few there werethe story starts with you a grim reaper who sells travel packages to the dead entering the ninth underworld
while manuel manny calevera cant seem to sell the premium ticket to the  packages
these tickets let you leave the underworld to a very luxurious place
while most of the dead qualify theres something up with your rival domino
the adventure has you finding new buddies chasing a women you love and defeating the evil baddiesthe game has some pretty good prerendered scenes especially for  the only issue i had were the puzzles because the are just so damn hard
there is a distinct lack of hints in the game and i always had to result to a faq
while the game is a bit short running in at about  hours it is satisfying but has a disappointing ending
i highly suggest this game if you love stories and if you love adventure gamesnot very groundbreaking in terms of gameplay but an absolute joy to spend time solving
not too hard not too easy visually stunningthe game plays very similar to full throttle an older lucasarts game made by the same creative teamat the ten dollar price its at now it would be impossible to be disappointedi had been wanting to play grim fandango for a long time so i was excited to get it as a christmas present
perhaps it was that my anticipation was so great but the enjoyment level of the game didnt quite lead up to my expectationsthe premise is both original and amusing  you are manuel manny calavera
your job as a travel agent with the department of death is to sell packages to souls on their way from the th level of the underworld to the th and last
if a soul has been really good in life it has earned enough spiritual wealth to get a ticket on the  train and make the trip in just hours
poor souls have to walk a journey of four years
manny finds out that a ruthless crime syndicate is stealing train tickets and depriving souls of their just rewards
as he follows the trail of the mysterious and beautiful mercedes colomar he must stand against the crime syndicate and work for the freedom of souls everywhere
phew
there are a lot of really good things about this game
number one is you cant be killed
even in situations that look dire where other game manufaturers would certainly have put a timed puzzle you have all the time that you need
thank you lucasarts
the character development is wonderful aided by some of the best voice acting ever
the plot is engaging
the art though an older d style that might bother some players is a lovely mix of mexican and art deco styles with lots of day of the dead references eg the characters
i thought it would be hard to relate to weird d skeletons but i soon knew them as people
and the script never takes itself too seriously poking good natured fun at everything from revolution to open mic night at the local bistrothe set up is a good mix of linear and nonlinear with levels that have to be accomplished in a certain order but a great deal of freedom within the level itself
in general the game sustains its momentum very well
so often in this type of game you see very complex first and second levels but towards the end the levels get so easy it seems the game developers were running out of ideas
although the second level was the most difficult the third and fourth levels offered enough to keep me interestedon the other hand gf is very very difficult  hard enough that the frustration level at times interferred with my enjoyment of the game
take it from this experienced gamer  anyone who claims to have completed this game in  hours or less was playing with a walkthrough at his elbow not applying his brain to the puzzlesthe puzzles were strictly the application of inventory variety with some amount of gathering clues from conversation
i dont usually have any difficulty with these types of puzzles but two things made them really hard in gf
one was the interface itself
the game is completely keyboard operated and your character turns his head to look at things with which you can interact
unfortunately where things are close together its hard to tell what it is mannys looking at
there were several times that i thought i didnt know the solution to a puzzle that i did in fact know just because i couldnt get manny in the right place to interact with the appropriate person or item
so id go haring off all over the game looking at every other possible solution until i was frustrated enough to go to the hint page where i invariably found out i was right in the first place i just hadnt had manny positioned correctlythe other thing that makes this game difficult is that many of the puzzles are logical only in retrospect often because there is a piece of information missing in the middle requiring the gamer to take such a leap of imagination that you generally only stumble upon the solution by chance
a little more information from manny pointing you in the right direction would have been helpful in some cases
as it was as often as not i solved the puzzles in a completely random fashion  for only about half of them had i any plan of actiondespite its cartoony appearance grim fandango is not a game for kids
there is a lot of smoking and drinking if you object to that every time you arent actively playing for a while manny lights up
i thought this was pretty funny but some people surely wont
there are some skeletal sexual inuendoes and quite a bit of violence both real and implied
the latter is softened a bit by euphemism and the fact that the characters are already dead but gf is not a light game
plus many of the references and jokes that make the game worth playing would probably be lost on anyone under there is a lot of running back and forth particularly in the second level  some map or zip feature would have been very helpful
in a couple of places it was hard to maneuver and manny got sucked into doors simply by passing them whether i wanted him to go there or not
grim fandango also features one of the grossest puzzle solutions ive yet come acrossit took me  hours to complete this game
it would have been less had the frustration level not been so high
i give it relatively high marks because it was well done original and ran very smoothly but the puzzles really deserve only three stars
for the money id say grim fandango is a good buy but not for everyone and certainly not for those with a low frustration thresholdloopy landscapes is the second expansion pack for the original roller coaster tycoonfor the price you get quite a few extra goodies
loopy landscapes includes  new scenarios  real prebuiltparks new themes new coaster designs new shopsstalls music and coloring options plus a few new rides
it should be said upfront that this expansion also includes rcts st expansion corkscrew follies so you dont need to purchase it as a separate itemthe scenarios like the original and first expansion get progressively harder and when you load it for the first time only  of the scenarios are unlocked
you must complete a scenario here in order to unlock others
however i think this is where loopy landscapes shines in game play the new scenarios are much more dynamic creative and challenging than previous ones
here instead of the normal have  guests by the end of year  or have a park value of xxxxx by the end of year  youll find you have to create certain excitement levels on half built coasters or create x coasters of y type
my favorite so far is arid heights where you are free from any financial burdensjust a big sandbox mode in which to create a park that will attract  guests
i like it because you are not restricted to time or money and can make a beautiful parkalso loopy landscapes groups the scenarios by tabs
there is one tab each for the original game corkscrew follies loopy landscapes extras and real parks
very cool to be able to switch between these
also the real parks are just plain beautiful to look at and watch
sure you can change them but i like to study them for tips and hints on what you can bring into one of the other scenarios you are working onthere are a few new coasters and a few new rides including jet skis and enterprise but there are many new shopsstalls to choose from
the new coloring options have been expanded you have more control over how a ride is now painted
there are many new tiles for roofing and ground cover including snow swamp martian wood etc
also there are new supports for different walkways and queue lines
the music scores for rides have been expanded as well you must check out the oriental stylevery beautiful
for a new expansion i would have liked to see a few more new thrill rideslastly is the new themes themselves
there is now arctic medieval spooky space and more
this adds so much creativity but the biggest let down is that some of the older themes could have been expanded but were not
like old west should have had maybe a saloon more cacti horse tieups mine cars etc
or jurassic could have had more dinosaurs egyptian and greek could have been expanded too
there are some themes that are begging to be created like pirates or super heros or mexican
however the oriental theme was done very niceoverall a worthy addition to rctif you had the st rct youd love it but eventually the novelty wears off
well if you pick up this expansion which has  addon packs youd be thrilled
however if you already have quotcorkscrew folliesquot youd notice that their arent that many new things added on
still the game is worth it for diehard rct fanssome new things in terms of scenary
ll really has a lot of new themeing types which is always fun
the cf features that carry over are new entertainers music choices painting colors and section painting
if you are really into the whole themeing thing then this is truly the expansion pack for yourides cf gives you a lot of new gentle rides and a few thrill rides
around  new rollercoasters really add to the gameplay as they are all different and fun
one new thing youll see alot of with ll is water rides
jet skis water coasters raft rides etc
are all brand new which is a good change
in terms of ride improvements you get a lot of new rollercoaster cart types which is coolshops there are tooooons of new shops so if you wanna make more money this is an easy way
there is everything from teeshirt and hat stalls to fried chicken and coffee shopsbad things some major bummers you can no longer charge admission to your park which is wear i think a lot of the money comes from
also you cant research ride improvements which i guess is ok cuz you get the stuff youd be researching thenscenarios the corkscrew follies scenarios are realllly hard
at least i think so
they have big goals and are all similar in that you have to have x number of people in your park by a certain time
the loopy landscape scenarios are fun because they are different
there is a huge empty park right in the beginning with unlimited money
some new ways to win include quotfinish building these  rollercoasters to have an excitement value of quot or quotearn  a month with ride ticket salesquot  these new ways to play are really greatso even if you already have cf this is a great expansion cuz you can get a rebate
